[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:11.760]   comb over Mike Isaac's article about Uber because it has a really interesting impact on Apple,
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.520]   on iPhones and your privacy. We'll also talk about Apple changing its affiliate commission
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.200]   on the App Store, which is making a big difference in a bad way for a lot of people.
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:29.520]   And iPhone 8 rumors. Where will that fingerprint reader be? It's all coming up next on Mac Break

[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:03.200]   news from. Oh, there should be an echo on that. Joining us right now, I'm so thrilled to have
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.880]   her back, Kelly Guimont. Am I saying your name right? Should I say Guimont?
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:14.880]   You can, but mostly it's just Gomont. So nice, vulgar, Americanized pronunciation.
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:22.240]   Yeah. Welcome to Ellis Island, Gomont. Kelly works for Mac Observer and does social media for the
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:28.240]   fabulous smile software. Great to have you and your smile. And the Enocho is also here from the
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:34.240]   Chicago Sun Times and the celestial waste of bandwidth. Don't yell at me. That's what he calls
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.920]   his website, C-W-O-B dot com. It delivers on its promise. It says it does what that
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.160]   website does what it says in the packaging. It is indeed a celestial waste event. And he's wearing
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.400]   a unicorn hat. Is that your team, the unicorns? No, no. This is my Boston marathon. Some people
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.560]   get a starters medal. I didn't even get himself a starter. I stood and watched. That's a great
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.560]   hat. I like the unicorn. Is that their? That is their official. That was the official logo. It's
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:08.320]   the unicorn. It's been for 110, 120 years. The Boston Marathon was the first marathon.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.520]   Or not the first. The first one that did not immediately end in a fatality, let's say.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:20.640]   And also here, Renee Richie, who walks 26.3 miles routinely just to collect the Pokemon.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.400]   He's from imore dot com. Mr. Nepal, I am thrilled to be here with Madam Guillemau and Miss Yale.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.640]   And that's cool. You know how to say that now. And I'm glad that Andy got a hat for getting one of
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.280]   the rare Starbucks Frappuccinos. I think that was wonderful. Did you get a unicorn fr- what do they
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.520]   call those? Unicorn Frappuccinos. Unicorn Frappuccino. Has anybody here had one?
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:46.560]   I thought I saw a big. My blood sugar spiked. We went to Starbucks and they were sold out. I
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.600]   wanted to buy. Yeah, there was a sign up on the drive through saying we are no longer able to
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:56.880]   fulfill requests for the unicorn. Whatever frappuccino. I think that was ultimately. That was a post
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.560]   from the barista saying just as a matter of taste, we are no longer able to make these.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.640]   We have the ingredients. We're just. We'll keep you forever alive, but in an unlive state.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.560]   I actually enjoy. Anthony Bourdain's quote. Wow, that's like four things I hate all in one sentence.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.560]   Starbucks, unicorn, zicolor, pink and purple. Also a Frappuccino. It's the perfect nexus of
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.720]   awfulness. His second book was amazing when he talked about like surreptitiously telling his
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.680]   kids that no one knew where the bodies were from McDonald's. And just like kept putting those
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.560]   thoughts in there. That's good. That's the trick. We tried to get them, but you know, I wish we could
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:42.000]   have, but wow. I think there's a lot of sugar in there is be my guess. I would guess. Yeah.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.680]   So I'm just surprised they didn't they wouldn't tie it into some sort of like 80s nostalgia thing.
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.920]   Like you get you get a free Cindy Lauper. She's on so unusual. Oh, we're living in John.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:59.840]   No, no, it looks like a Lisa Frank notebook or a Lisa Frank sticker collection has like
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.520]   exploded like fell into the blender while they were making your Frappuccino for you.
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.320]   According to the New York Times, a unicorn food trend is taking over the internet.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:16.320]   Oh dear. Are they just saying that because the unicorn, the can of unicorn meat on think
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.120]   geek was always funny. Well, why is this unicorn and not rainbow? Like it was rainbow bagels.
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.840]   Why is it unicorn Frappuccino? I don't like this lack of consistency in my
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.560]   I think it started with that Snapchat filter where you vomit. Oh, vomiting rainbows.
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.920]   But then I should be a rainbow vomit frappuccino. Oh, I don't think everybody.
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.200]   I'm not a marketing genius. I'm.
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:42.080]   The unicorn Frappuccino is aggressively glittery and and how is my little pony not
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:48.560]   suing everybody? Yeah, no, right. So I'm leading off with something sugary, sweet, and delightful
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:54.960]   ish because the next story is the exact opposite. Let's let's talk about uber.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:01.840]   Hi, I don't know where to begin. Let's talk about an uber scandal for a change.
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.400]   We know what it's doing. It must be three or four to choose one.
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:10.960]   A shock. So this is Sunday's New York Times big piece. Ubers CEO plays with fire.
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.920]   But the funny thing is, you know, it's all about it says Travis Kalanick's drive to
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.000]   win in life has led to a pattern of risk taking that is time times put his right
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.920]   hailing company on the brink of implosion. But but they really kind of buried the lead.
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.880]   Because well, actually it's it is the lead. So I guess two leads. That's the problem is that
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.120]   there's two candles in one story and it's not even the point of the story.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:39.840]   Yeah. So we'll start with the we'll start with number one. And by the way, John John Gruber gets
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:47.760]   all the credit in the world for parsing this because it's not immediately clear if you read
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:54.960]   the Times piece, what's going on for months Kalanick had pushed pulled a fast one on Apple
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:02.320]   by directing his employees to camouflage the ride hailing app. Now, hold that for later because
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.640]   we're going to we're going to talk about how they camouflaged it from Apple's engineers.
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:12.640]   The reason so Apple would not find out that Uber had been secretly identifying and tagging
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:17.680]   iPhones. They changed that because in the original copy, it said tracking. Even after
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.880]   its app had been deleted and the devices erased a fraud detection maneuver that violated Apple's
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:29.360]   privacy guidelines. Now that's all they say really. And I think John gets a lot of credit for
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:34.800]   and some others for figuring it out. They go on to say Apple was on to the deception.
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:41.040]   Tim Cook says when Kalanick comes in to meet with him in his bright red sneakers and hot pink socks.
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:46.560]   So I I've heard you not cook Kalanick, by the way, I don't think of worse.
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:55.280]   So so all she do I should do Mr. Cook in a in a fine Alba in accent. So I heard you have been
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:02.320]   breaking some of our rules. Stop the trickery, Mr. Cook demanded a Uber's Apple be kicked out of
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:08.960]   the app stall. And of course, you know, Kalanick promised I will stop the trickery. But what was
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.880]   not clear in here is what the hell the trickery was. So before you get to that, Leo, my favorite
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:18.160]   part is that they camouflaged it. But Apple has more than one office and a company whose entire
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:22.560]   business is based upon location didn't realize that Apple had more than one office and anybody
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:26.320]   outside the main office would just detect this normally. So the way they camouflaged it is
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:31.680]   they would check in the app if they were near Cupertino and then they wouldn't do it.
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:36.080]   Yeah, the theory being that app would get approved by something they all get caught.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:47.600]   Yeah, right. Yeah. So cut to John Goober's post from from that day. He says secretly
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:52.080]   identifying tagging iPhones even if after its app has been deleted is a rather startling accusation
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.920]   because it sounds like it should be technically impossible. It's also unclear what information
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:08.240]   Uber was able to glean. So he he then reads between the lines and and also comes up with,
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:15.040]   I think, an exactly right story, which is the Uber app while installed uses
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:23.600]   forbidden or even secret APIs to get the apps unique ID, right? It's UD ID.
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.600]   I think it says just a little bit below your links to Wilson will stop the chronic who flagged
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:33.680]   it with chronic figured it out. Yeah, it uses IO. One of the frameworks to to basically bombard
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:38.800]   it with symbols private APIs using IO kit to pull the device serial number from the device registry.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:44.240]   So you install the Uber app and among other things it sends back to the home office is your phone's
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:49.120]   serial number. Why do they want that? Well, again, you this is more digging out the times kind of
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:52.720]   fumbled this. They didn't know what the important story was. I think because they weren't techno
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:56.640]   or Mike Isaac who wrote it wasn't technical left to understand. Wait a minute. What the hell?
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:01.520]   So it turns out that Uber had a fraud problem, particularly in India,
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:06.800]   drivers were being rewarded for the number of rides they accepted. They were getting bonus
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:12.880]   drivers are not dumb. They went out and bought a lot of old iPhones, put the app on it,
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:17.840]   requested rides from themselves and accepted it. Boob, boob, boob, boob, boob. Uber, of course,
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:22.080]   caught on and said, Okay, so what we're going to do is we're going to keep track of the serial
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:26.640]   numbers of phones that install the Uber app and make sure that this doesn't happen.
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:30.640]   Prevent the fraud. The problem is in order to do that, you have to break Apple's rules.
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:37.680]   Now, I think I don't blame Uber for wanting to do this. The question is, is that, well,
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:41.520]   yeah, you know, they could have gotten banned from the app store, which would have been huge.
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:46.000]   On the other hand, notice Tim Cook didn't didn't do anything but say, now knock that off.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.280]   So obviously, Apple wants Uber in the app store as much as Uber wants to be in the app store.
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:58.080]   So Apple kind of overlooked this violation. And it's a reasonable thing for
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:04.160]   Uber to want to do. The question is, did they use it in other ways to spy on customers?
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:10.480]   Well, they were already again, that's why I'm saying isn't it interesting that,
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:15.680]   oh, no, not again, imagine a bad story about Uber. They're already doing things like tracking,
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:21.600]   who is who in certain major cities, including Boston, are government regulators that are trying
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:27.600]   to see if Uber is doing anything illegal with their apps. And therefore, if, and so if I'm a
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:32.320]   regulator in Boston and I hail an Uber, because I want to see like how how's the app work?
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.040]   That was another one.
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.080]   That's right.
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:34.240]   Yeah.
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:38.640]   Right. It will actually, it's identified me somewhere in a database and refuses to
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:42.720]   like, they called it, the ball, I think something like that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:48.320]   And that's not even they're very, very, very, yeah, and that there are a couple of us we could
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:54.640]   talk about, but it's like, they're clearly playing at a certain, not, not, let's, when I say,
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:12:00.080]   not comic book super villain level, but let's say the 1960s Batman TV shows,
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.320]   super villain level. Okay, I'll give you that.
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:10.000]   Also, they, we know they had this God mode that would, you know, see all Uber rides going on.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.320]   And if for instance, they said, and lift rides, you know, I happen though, what President Trump's
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.880]   Uber, you know, phone is we could tell you where Trump is at any time, right?
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.960]   I guess they'd know that anyway from the account information.
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.760]   It reminds me of that line though, where they said that no amount of law enforcement,
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.720]   manpower or financing is equal to criminals being stupid.
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:30.080]   It's just like they do this thing and you can understand that frustration with the fraud,
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.360]   but there are other ways, and I believe they're doing those ways now that don't violate the rules.
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.480]   But back then, it was just what's an expedient way to get this information,
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:41.280]   you know, rules be damned. They acted first and thought second, which is a dangerous
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.840]   trade in a company that has as much responsibility on their service.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:49.920]   John Gruber says that Will Streffek said that this was in the 2014 build of Uber's iOS app,
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:55.520]   and it no longer works in iOS 10. So Apple clearly changed these API calls,
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:13:00.640]   these private API calls to break this. But all Gruber also points out, and that were asked,
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:06.240]   I think a really good question. Why didn't Apple require Uber to tell its customers what they've
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:10.560]   been doing as a condition for remaining the stores? Shouldn't Apple have said,
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:18.320]   hey, you've really violated the privacy of our customers. You need to tell them if you want to
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:28.160]   stay in the store. Why didn't they do that? I agree. They really need to establish that they
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:34.240]   are protecting their customers. I do think that part of it is that Uber is such, it's not just an
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:39.520]   app, it's also part of infrastructure. I wouldn't like to say that it's because that
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:43.040]   G Uber is really got really got Apple by the throat. They can't just,
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:47.520]   Apple needs this app. I think it's more like Apple has the longer view that
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:53.520]   Uber isn't just this evil company, this tracking people. It's also how a lot of single parents get
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:58.880]   their kids from home to from school to home. It's how a lot of people who cannot drive get to
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:03.440]   doctor's appointments. It's a really, really big deal to cut off tens of millions of their
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:12.080]   customers from a basic transportation infrastructure. I've no doubt that if they refuse to play ball
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:17.520]   or if they painted them, they behaved like they're a consistent enemy, always trying to work around
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:21.760]   Apple, there wouldn't have been much bigger and much broader steps. But I don't think that pulling
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:27.920]   the app is something that they felt they should do unless it's really the end of the line.
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:33.200]   But we also don't know what you like. I feel like I'm on pretty safe ground here asking you guys
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:37.040]   this. Do you know what all the terms and conditions are when you create that Uber account when you
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:40.640]   install the app on your phone? Like do you know what you're actually agreeing to?
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:44.720]   No, I have dialogue fatigue big time with nobody reads this and we'll get to.
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:48.800]   We'll get to by the way, that issue in a second with scandal number two in this article.
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:53.680]   But the other question I have, Kelly, is does does Apple make money from
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:59.360]   Uber using like if I use the Uber app and I pay for a ride, does Apple get a cut of that?
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:03.760]   Wouldn't that be? Wouldn't that be a motive too for keeping you?
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:07.200]   If you pay with Apple Pay, they'll get the transaction, but I don't believe they get anything if
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:11.360]   you're paying with the game. They don't get 30% of the ride. They don't. For physical things,
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:16.560]   they don't. It's only digital goods that they have. They have the Uber is the transactor of
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.520]   your credit card because you have their they have your credit card on file.
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:23.600]   So the interesting thing to me is that he gets called in front of like there's a few apps that
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:27.520]   can get away with a lot Facebook, Uber, because their cross platform, they're everywhere and
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:31.280]   their services that often define the mobile experience. And that I don't want to say it puts
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:35.040]   them above the law, but it makes it very difficult. I don't know if they were doing this on Android
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:38.080]   too. I've asked that nobody seems to be able to tell me if they were doing something similar
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:42.480]   on Android and if they were probably not illegal, if you're. It may it may not be a violation,
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:47.200]   but it's certainly a privacy violation. But it's like Facebook has violated the background rules.
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:51.760]   Like they've had audio, they've abused audio. Yeah. Battery Pokemon goes on the same thing.
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:56.160]   These super apps, they seem to get away with a lot. Getting called into Tim Cook's office. I mean,
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:00.080]   that's like the ultimate principles office for this. And I don't know how you escalate. Can you
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:05.040]   just ban Uber and like, and like, what is the repercussions of that? So a chat was giving me
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:11.280]   the link to Uber's terms and conditions. If anybody would like to read this, you might just go
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:16.960]   right ahead and let me know. We will do evil and hear a saying yes. What do you, what do you
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:23.200]   have to do is Uber to get in trouble? Like, yeah, what does Travis have to do before finally somebody's
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:28.400]   like, yeah, we send a security guy to your desk with a box. We're going to walk you out at the
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:36.720]   end of the day. Like what? Like, I can't figure it out. I don't use Uber for about 96 reasons. I
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:42.400]   never bothered installing it. Because I was usually with a group of people whenever there was a need
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:46.960]   for Uber and somebody else already had it and had it set up and and was like a longtime Uber user.
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:54.000]   So those guys would just hail the car and then we'd go do that. So I don't use it a lot here in
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.320]   Portland. They are here in Portland. And yeah, I could tell you stories because I know people
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:05.680]   who drive for Uber. But like, what do you have to do? Like, they broke all the rules when they
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:09.520]   came to Portland when they went to Austin, when they like everywhere they go, they just sort of show
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:14.720]   up and and show a blatant disregard for rules and regulations and all that kind of stuff. Like,
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:18.720]   when they show up somewhere and they go, you know, we're so awesome. You're just going to get over
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:24.960]   it. Like, number one, number two, like Travis, like, I don't even have to go any further down that
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:31.120]   road. Like, we all know was up there. And and then like things like God mode and the gray bar or
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:37.360]   the gray ball. And and now this with with tracking everybody's phone, like, what do you have to do
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:43.600]   as Uber to actually get in trouble? We don't care anymore. We said that out straight and we said
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:47.360]   this before a few years ago, a decade ago, you could have one swift boat incident and it would end
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:51.200]   your career. You could make one pile and all recall and it might almost destroy your brand.
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:54.000]   And now your phones can burst into flames and we'll buy them again three days later because we
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.480]   love you. And you can be elected president. I mean, it's we have a startling lack of care for those
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:02.560]   things anymore. No, no, no, no, no. That's that's I don't think that's appropriate. I think it's
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:06.080]   absolutely true. No, I think it's absolutely true with our generation. We we want instant
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:12.000]   gratification. We have zero attention span. And we sort of almost put people up on pedestals who we
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.400]   see as rule breakers or, you know, getting away with something. It's it's sort of what we've
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:24.080]   devolved into. We have it depends on whether that's an established pattern of behavior or whether
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:30.640]   it is a dumb mistake and they can correct for that mistake. It's also again, it's putting it this
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:36.400]   way. It's very, very easy if someone has seven options to solve a different problem to choose the
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:41.680]   one that is not only the best service, not only the best made, not only shares my values, not only
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:47.360]   streaming its employees, the best, but is also cost efficient and etc, etc, etc. There are a lot
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:53.200]   of people that only have one or two options. Again, I don't I don't like the way that Walmart,
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:59.440]   for instance, treats its its labor. I don't like the way it treats its customers customers.
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:05.920]   I do my shopping my food shopping at a local store who the best the best thing the only thing I need
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:11.840]   to say about it is that they do not have a single self service kiosk for checkout. They have they
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:18.720]   actually pay actual I'm serious. They pay actual people to they don't they they have people who for
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:23.200]   three or four hours are just checking people out. Not you have eight duties, including mopping things
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:27.120]   up. And if we need to open a physical register, then you have to run to cover that register.
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:33.280]   However, there are some people for whom if the only thing that the difference between Walmart and
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:37.680]   that's a shop doing grocery shopping at Walmart and doing grocery shopping at the store I'm talking
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:43.840]   about is the difference between each of my four kids eating well and being clothed and having shoes
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:48.480]   that holds on them and having to choose which one of them has to wear those shoes that have
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:53.200]   cardboard in the bottom and has to eat the cardboard box that the cereal came in because we ran out
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:57.920]   of cheery out oat oops for them to eat. So I'm saying that that's why I'm saying it's not that
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:02.080]   simple. So if you have lots of options, you have lots of options. If you don't have many options,
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:07.840]   again, if I if I'll have to say that, again, I don't have I don't have four or five people living
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:13.920]   in the house with me if if I have when I have to get like a colonoscopy or something, I will probably
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:19.600]   you know, I will probably hire a lift if I can't fire a lift. I will probably hire an Uber to drive
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:26.080]   me there because I don't have options to get myself home under anesthesia or semi anesthesia where I'm
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:31.280]   not allowed to drive that do not involve using a ride sharing service. So again, that's that's why
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:36.320]   I stopped short of saying we are a culture that doesn't care. We were a culture that is willing to
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:40.560]   forget whatever the last transgression was. So I mean, and to answer your question, Kelly,
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:45.920]   I don't I don't think Uber has broken the law yet. And if it does, well, then I think they would be
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:51.280]   subject to, you know, civil and maybe criminal penalties. I don't think that they're getting away
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:57.040]   with that they've broken Apple's law and they may be an Apple jail. And by the way, here is the
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:01.680]   Uber privacy policy and they're very clear. We device information, we may collect information
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:05.680]   about your mobile device, including, for example, the hardware model operating system in versions,
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:11.280]   software and file names, versions, preferred language, unique device identifier, advertising
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:16.080]   identifiers, serial number, device motion information, and mobile network information, they say very
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:21.120]   clearly, we'll collect that. So the law there and what they're inviting, you know, the FTC, the
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:25.120]   federal trade commission is not going to say, well, you're violating your privacy policy, they're
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:30.960]   very clear the they're they're breaking Apple's rules. You have no privacy, Apple gets upset.
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:36.560]   Yeah, yeah, right. Well, you've agreed by using Uber not to have any privacy. If you if you want
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:40.000]   to, by the way, that was not in the terms of service, that's a separate, this is a separate
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:46.320]   Uber privacy statement information we collect about you from use of our services. And by the way,
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:54.720]   they say right away, we collect information about you. Lots of it. And here's in the general following
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.360]   general categories, we collect information about you.
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:02.160]   Well, and I understand that some of that is required, and I'm not saying that they shouldn't
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:07.040]   collect data, they need to know your name, they need to know where you are. You know, they need to
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:10.560]   know who they're looking for, they need to have some sort of payment information so that you can
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:14.640]   pay for the ride at the end of it. Like, I understand that those are things that you need to do. But
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:24.160]   I sort of get the feeling, like from here, that that in general, Uber doesn't have my interest at
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:30.000]   heart. They have Travis's interest at heart. And I feel like as a consumer, like what I get,
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.600]   like what's good for me when I use any sort of service, whether it's I call Broadway cab or
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:41.280]   Rose City Cap Company or whoever, you know, around here, or I call Lyft or Uber, or I call a friend
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:47.040]   of mine and I go, Hey, can you come drive me to the place for the thing because reasons, then
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:52.640]   like at that point, like what's good for me and what's good for Travis aren't necessarily going
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:56.640]   to be the same thing. What's good for me and what's good for the cab company aren't always going to
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:01.920]   be the same thing. But the cab company has been around long enough that they've, there are rules
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:08.160]   and regulations the cab company must abide by in order for in order for them to exist and for them
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:12.400]   to be the people who roll up at my house at 4 30 in the morning when I need a ride to the airport.
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:19.600]   So I mean, so the way you put Uber in jail is in customer jail doing what you did, Kelly,
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:23.680]   which is boycott them. But Andy's point is well taken. There are many people who can't.
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:30.320]   When we talked about the United issue, our travel guy, Johnny Jett said, yeah, but as soon as you
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:33.840]   can only get to a town by flying United, you're going to be flying United again.
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:38.240]   We only have Uber and Montreal. I use Lyft when I'm not in Montreal. I don't use Uber here because
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:44.640]   I have a car, but people have to use it here. There's no other choice. So you use your boycott. I
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:48.640]   mean, I think you clearly, Uber is under pressure at this point. And remember, they hired former
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:53.680]   Attorney General Eric Holder, Ariana Hovington on the board hired him. He has investigation.
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:59.040]   They've he's asked for more time. I bet there's a lot to investigate.
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:04.560]   Because there's still a line of people outside his door going, have I got a story for you?
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:10.640]   Yeah, exactly. So, so I don't, you know, it's an interesting question. I think you're also right
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:16.560]   Renee that we forgive very easily these days because well, frankly, I don't know why maybe
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:20.080]   thanks to Twitter and the internet, there's a new outrage every week. There's the delta now,
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:26.240]   or the delta way the stroller outrage now it's the best to be bad at Uber anymore.
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:31.360]   I got a general general. I mean, you can't. Well, no, but I think reality TV has also warped,
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:35.040]   you know, the way we see this as theater. We don't see this as as we like going on. There's a lot going
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:41.520]   on. There's also a 24 hour news cycle that is fed by three, at least 24 hour news channels
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:45.920]   who have to fill their time. There's all sorts of stuff going on with them that.
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:53.280]   I think if you wanted to lump it in in one big clump, it's that we are now kind of all of us
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:25:00.800]   part of the global nervous system. We are willy nilly jacked in. And when you're part of a global
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:08.400]   nervous system, you get a lot of information. You do. Yeah. So long so long as it's an open
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:14.880]   transaction. I think that I think that Uber's day is passing unless it replaces its CEO and
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:20.560]   proves that its culture has changed significantly. Thank goodness it has a good competition in the
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:27.840]   form of lift that are in many ways. In many ways, Uber is touching is sticking their tongues into
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:34.240]   power outlets for lift saying that, Oh, okay, we definitely, that one was okay. We can stick
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:40.000]   our tongue in that we cannot stick our tongue in that one. But you're making interest in the
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.640]   place because the way it's structured, I looked into this, the board is set up in such a way. Travis
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:51.280]   cannot be fired by the board. So he'd have to willingly step down. But I think you're absolutely
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:56.800]   right. This doesn't go away until the way you handle this is by Ariana Huffington and Jeffrey
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:01.440]   Holder to having a press conference saying Travis Kalanek has agreed that in the interests of this
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:07.920]   company, he's going to step down and be the chairman or the advisor. We're going to have a new CEO,
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:14.320]   a new regime and new rules and we apologize. And we're going to make this, we know you love this
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:20.160]   service and we're going to make this company worthy of your trust. And I can see that happening
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:24.880]   at any given time. But the problem is that if Kalanek doesn't want to step down, he doesn't
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:30.160]   have to step down. Well, it happens when shareholders and stakeholders say, okay, we are not, we're
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:34.640]   not investing in your company because we like your company. We like the money that we think that
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:38.240]   we're going to make from your company and you're screwing it up. So we're saying you need to step
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:44.560]   down. So basically they can that that's the public, the public vote as it is that allows
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:49.680]   corporate private companies be shut down is when the public who is putting up the money says, okay,
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:52.560]   we're out your your idiots. Goodbye. Uber is not a public.
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:56.880]   The money off of you that we were supposed to. And as soon as that value proposition doesn't
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:04.000]   exist anymore, oops, lost your audio. Oh, my back. Yeah, we should.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   So part of the thing about this that is sort of frustrating to me is that it would be very easy
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:17.520]   for the establishment to eliminate Uber more or less because what people like about Uber is I
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:23.600]   open the app and I say, I'm right here and I need a ride to this other place. And then I wait a few
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:28.320]   minutes and a car shows up. So I know one of the I don't remember where it was. It was one of the
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:34.320]   larger cities. And basically what it came down to was hailing in advance like that was against the
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:38.960]   law was against some sort of regulation in that city. And that's why Uber was winning was because
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:45.920]   they weren't playing by the rules. So if cab company stepped up and had applications like if I
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:50.320]   were willing to swear my allegiance to one cab company here, I could install their app.
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:54.800]   And then I could use that app and hail people because I don't I live in the in the burbs. I live
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:59.280]   like outside of downtown Portland. If I lived in downtown Portland, I probably could roll out on
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:04.400]   the street, raise my hand like people do and hail a cab and get a taxi and it wouldn't be a big deal.
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:11.920]   But where I live, that's a little more complicated. So for most people, I feel like if cab companies
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:18.800]   were able to just sort of for lack of a better adjective, Uber, five themselves, then if I could
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:23.600]   open an app and go, I'm here and I need a cab and I need it to the airport and I need it in an hour
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:28.880]   or I need it in 10 minutes and it were possible to make that happen. I feel like if cab companies
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:33.760]   went for that, they're already abiding by all the other rules. They're already companies that are
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:40.080]   here and people who are driving for Uber full time might be enticed to go drive for a cab company
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:46.080]   instead. And then if that were the case, then the cab companies are winning. And at that point,
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:49.440]   you know, Uber becomes a lot less attractive option for all these other reasons.
[00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:55.200]   Of course, Uber is not publicly held. It's privately held. However, article today in the
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:29:01.200]   information by Alfred Lee says that in the secondary market, investors have cut the price they're
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:07.760]   willing to pay by about 15% in recent months, cutting Uber's value to about $50 billion.
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:13.360]   Another broker said they'd seen an uptick in the number of Uber shareholders looking to sell.
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:19.680]   On the other hand, more buyers in the market looking to scoop up shares. See, the stock market
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:26.960]   doesn't really care if Travis Kalanik is a. Yeah, but this is a toolbox. This is another example
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:35.920]   where they haven't they're not they're not digging into their own 401ks at Uber to keep up company.
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:41.120]   They do have investors. They do have venture funds. So basically, now instead of having to
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:46.960]   deal with lots of shareholders that I can't imagine how badly Apple could screw up.
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:52.240]   And even in the mirror mirror version where Tim Cook has a goatee and he's evil, I can't imagine
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:57.440]   how bad the stock would have to go before people would say you're morally outraged and you want to
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:02.000]   sell. Great. We'll take that discount. We'll buy our own. But these these are investing in Uber
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:07.040]   not because of today's business, but because of the future business. So there are a few people
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:14.480]   who can say hi. So basically, if all if 23 people were to say, we have given you a lot of money,
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:18.480]   because we know that if there's an IPO, we're going to make a huge amount of money. But you are
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:24.000]   going to if basically you auger this company into the ground. So this is why we are going to praise
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.520]   your vision as CEO and say that, Oh my goodness, I'm so sorry that you want to race yachts
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:33.600]   competitively instead of continue to run the company. But yes, your butt is on a train,
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:39.440]   whether it's on a rail or in or inside the car. But to what Kelly said, that's that's that's
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:44.000]   that's an excellent point. That's exactly that's exactly right. I think this is one of those cases
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:51.520]   where capitalism for all the different ways I can rail against it, it kind of works in the sense
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:59.680]   they're the reason why I don't use cabs. I only in New York City really to ever actually write in
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:04.800]   a cab is because they just don't work. And they don't do what it says on the box. The number of
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:09.440]   times where the most I'm going for I'm going to be out of the out of the office for two weeks.
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:13.760]   And I don't want to park my car and pay for two weeks of parking. I want to take a cab to the
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:19.680]   airport. The number of times that I have called a week in advance to set up a cab ride that will
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:25.440]   get me to the airport three hours before my flight. And then it's an hour later, and they still
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:29.120]   haven't shown up. And they're out answering the phone and then a half hour later, I finally get
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:33.520]   in touch with somebody and they act annoyed because I don't have it here and I can't get
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:37.440]   your car for an hour and a half. I don't know why you're bothering me. And so, what do you mean?
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:43.360]   You ordered a car. Yeah. That's why I'm pretty thrilled that Lyft and Uber are kicking their
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:48.720]   butts because the other reason is that in so many markets, the reason why cabs don't work is because
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:54.080]   the individual taxi medallions that used to be an independent owner and operator will own a cab
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:59.520]   and they'll buy a medallion so they can pass all the regulations. No, now the taxi industry has
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:04.240]   been trying to severely limit and make sure that cities do not get more medallions because that
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:08.800]   makes their individual medallion more valuable. And they don't really run a company. They just
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:14.000]   simply sort of license their access to their medallion and they're worth hundreds and hundreds
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:19.360]   of thousands of dollars. So this is an industry that desperately needed somebody to kick its butt
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:25.440]   and make it feel like it's about to lose its house because you can't simply run a business this way
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:31.360]   on lack of competition. And also means it sometimes counterintuitively for me,
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:38.240]   there is such a thing as if the law does not say that something is illegal, but you have a great idea,
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:45.120]   go ahead anyway and hope that the law winds up being as awesome as you think it is. Everybody
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:50.080]   thinks agrees with you on the awesomeness of your product. And so you can basically get the law on
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:55.040]   your side when the time comes. Like when Google decided it would be very good if we simply were
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:33:01.600]   to scan every single book that exists. We will send trucks, we will spend half a billion dollars,
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:06.000]   billion with a B, building trucks that will go to university libraries and scan everything that
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:11.520]   they have. And we know the public domain stuff, we can do that. The copyrighted stuff we don't know,
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:16.800]   but we think that because all we're going to do is make that content searchable so people can
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:21.920]   find this book that has the content they want and then buy it, we think that it'll be okay and
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:26.000]   that didn't turn out to be the case. But it was good that they decided, okay, the law says that
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.680]   that's we don't know what happens if someone does that, we're going to pretend that we're going
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:34.000]   to that's going to work out, we're going to do it because it's an awesome idea. So I'm hoping
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:40.800]   that Lyft wins and that Uber gets its butt handed to it because they are now becoming the
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:47.440]   evil empire instead of instead of the valiant freedom fighters. But there are this is this
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:52.560]   whole story as an example of so many ways where there are no absolutes, at least in my in my
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:56.720]   principles like, oh, in principle, I think the little guy in capitalism is about to well,
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:01.520]   actually, no, this worked out. Okay. Okay. Well, how about well, it's okay that we're okay. Fine.
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:08.800]   We're going to take a break when we come back to second scandal to come out of this mic Isaac
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:15.040]   as well. Before he goes, but I just want to a quick plug for my guys. He really is a very good
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:18.720]   tech journalist. He's been with recode. He's been with the Wall Street Journal.
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:23.280]   And so he is not just someone who is right. So he knows what he's doing. If there were
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:28.560]   if there are things that weren't great in this column, that doesn't mean he's not. No, it's not.
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:33.200]   It's not all. It wasn't great. It's that he didn't. He's a very he's very knowledgeable about the
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:36.800]   tech industry. He covers Uber specifically as one of his beats in the New York Times. I think he
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:44.480]   insufficiently understood the risk, the severe backlash that as two of his revelation. I mean,
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:49.920]   hey, this is an article that got a lot of attention deservedly. So and he and he broke the story and
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:56.160]   had he changed, I think two words of it that I'm sure that I can't speak for him. But I when I
[00:34:56.160 --> 00:35:01.440]   write, I can see that later on that. Oh, see, in my head, when I was writing this, I understood
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:07.600]   the big version of this word. I forget that people who don't live in the space 24 seven understand
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:13.040]   a specific or correct. No, that was correct to take the word tracking out. I think that that
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:19.120]   implies a certain belief in him. Really, really great story. He's one of those bylines that
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:22.960]   gets my attention because he's really got the he's really got the beans. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:28.720]   And yeah, and no, it's really obviously he's in terms of story about Travis Kalanek. And it's
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:36.640]   kind of the complete story of of Kalanek. But within it, there were a couple of very interesting things.
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:41.840]   We're going to go way down to almost the very bottom of the story for our next subject when we
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:49.840]   return. But first a word from Drobo. Somebody said, didn't this show used to have a rat hole,
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:54.400]   a rat hole theme? Yeah, Merlin man made a rat hole theme for us. He also made, I think it was him,
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:58.800]   a Drobo jingle, because we Drobo has been a sponsor. This shows us practically the very
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:08.000]   all of your stuff on a Drobo. That's it. Drobo, the new five and two. This is the new network
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:14.800]   attached storage device from Drobo high performance. They've upgraded the processor. They've added
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:20.640]   two gigabit ethernet ports. So you could do port bonding. You could put SSDs as well as spitting
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:25.600]   hard drives in there. Of course, they've got the emset accelerator bay. All the drobos have that.
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:32.960]   I think I love that. That speeds up small file rights with a with a kind of a caching SSD.
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:38.240]   You also get remote data access and sharing. That's what you were talking about, Andy, plus
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:43.360]   disaster recovery for additional peace of mind. Drobo started when its founder had a hard drive
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:50.000]   crash. And he said, Oh, no problem. I've got raid, raid. And the raid didn't work. And he said,
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:55.520]   what? He wanted to create a better redundant storage solution. And that's when Drobo created
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:37:01.440]   Beyond raid. And we all, I think remember those those great days when Drobo was
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:06.240]   kind of like the they call it. What is it? Data robotics. They were like,
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:12.560]   Wow, look how big these drives are. They were USB drives. Now Drobo's got every kind of drive
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:17.360]   from drive arrays using Briand raid to network drives like the five and two.
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:22.560]   And I have a Drobo mini. You see that here right here? I love my mini because
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:29.200]   I use that as my data drive on my iMac. So I have so much storage. It's redundant. It's SSDs. So
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:34.400]   it's fast. I love my Drobo. You will love your Drobo to plus all Drobo's have a battery backed up
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:40.560]   cache, which means if the power goes out, you don't have data corruption. There's no right failure.
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:46.560]   It finishes the job. Drobo's are easy to use that front panel with the lights. That's magnetic.
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:51.840]   You pop it off. The lights tell the whole story. They they're green. If everything's good, when
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:58.000]   you start to run down, run out of space, the lights will change. So you know, which drive to swap out
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.360]   and they hot swap. The new five and two has these great Drobo apps, which include Drobo picks for
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:10.080]   photo backup, Plex, yes, for media streaming, cloud apps for backup and data syncing, developer
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:16.720]   tools to for programmers, websites is a complete lamp stack. There's no JS WordPress. You can work
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:22.960]   in C, go Pearl Python or Ruby. There's even a get client. The five and two is awesome. They're all
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:28.720]   awesome. And here's the deal. Go to Drobo store.com. Check out the complete line of products and save

[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:10.640]   Renee Richie from imore.com is here. The new yellow imore. The new app is out.
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:19.200]   Hello. Hello yellow. So all the time. And you had Florence Ion do your Galaxy S8 review
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:24.480]   shocking everybody. We weren't expecting that. I wasn't expecting that. She knocked it out the
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:29.600]   park to what a trip she did. She did. We had her on the new screensavers on Saturday. We both
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:34.480]   talked a lot about the Galaxy S8. I'll tell you, I'm a little disappointed. I don't know. I mean,
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:39.200]   it's not this isn't the show for it, but it ain't the God phone it was supposed to be. I'll tell you
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:44.400]   that. It's hard now. It's going to be hard for anybody at this point. It's just such a mature
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:49.360]   technology. And we've seen so much. It's it's yeah. Well, and I think the next the next big
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:53.440]   revolution to surprise us again. Oh, was Jeff Smith did that jingle, by the way, the Drobo jingle.
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:57.040]   Thank you, Jeff Smith. Thank you, Virgil, for telling me. I think though, it does set the tone
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:01.840]   for what the next Apple iPhone will be because bezel list that's going to be everybody's going
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:06.240]   to do that. Where this I mean, she and Samsung are major Apple suppliers. And if you look at what
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:12.000]   they're producing this year, that's with Apple. Yeah, Apple bought 100 million of these OLED screens.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.840]   You can now do you think Apple will do the tall thing? Because that's one thing that's weird about
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:20.960]   the S8, the aspect ratio. It's not another rumor. It says they're going to have almost a palm web
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:25.840]   OS S. Like touch bar, basically underneath the screen, which will help them make it narrower and
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:30.400]   taller, because they'll be dedicated control pixels at the bottom. Narrower means you can
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:36.000]   hold it in one hand. Yes. Which is important, I think. It's as awkwardly stated on the back of
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.520]   the Samsung box. So I'm not going to read it out for the children in the audience. But yes, it does.
[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:44.080]   Really? Yeah, the marketing on the back of the way they describe the length and
[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:49.680]   growth of that phone is very very odd. I miss that. I have to get my box back. It's all over
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:54.000]   Reddit. It's amazing. Oh, that's hysterical. But yeah, no, but I think it makes a lot of sense
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.760]   for the reason you said that way, like the Blackberry Passport was ridiculous. But any phone that's
[00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:01.600]   sufficiently wide, some of the Nexus has been very wide too. It just it makes one handed use and
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:05.840]   it makes even single handed use for people who don't have gargantuan basketball nits. I, after
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:11.840]   having the Nexus 6, which is a six inch screen, I thought, Oh, that's too big because it was wide.
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:17.280]   And you could barely hold it. Yeah, unless you had basketball hands. And I was mistaken because
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:23.120]   this is a 6.2 inch screen. But it's the same with as an iPhone 7 plus it just it's just you know,
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:27.600]   it's just like the iPhone 5 where they had one extra icon row. It's exactly that. You got this
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:34.000]   you know, an extra room for extra row of icons at the top. I don't know. Well, it'd be very
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:41.200]   interesting. So weird aspect ratio. It's 18.5 to nine. I'm really I'm really looking forward to
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:46.080]   seeing how Apple not only I think they're going to put in that big screen because if any company
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:50.400]   can just make great hay with a with a huge screen on a smaller form factor, it's Apple.
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:55.120]   But I'm also looking forward to seeing what tweaks they add to it to make it right easier for one
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:59.360]   handed you Samsung does something where you can you can able a mode where you can basically
[00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:04.880]   resize basically create a virtual screen of a smaller size like like the size of an iPhone 4
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:09.760]   screen so that it really is all in the left hand corner or the right hand corner and reachable
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:14.000]   with one thumb. But it's and it's nice. But I'm wondering if Apple will do something even more
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   elegant. They have the what is it? The double tap on the home button to scrunch the top of the
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:23.040]   screen down to the bottom of the screen. But it's I really that's an area where Apple can really
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:29.120]   excel give us a that really beautiful large screen but also make it so that we don't want to hire
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:32.640]   somebody to follow us around just offer us another finger for the for the top of the screen where we
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:39.120]   need it. Well, actually, you know what? Let let us go do iPhone as a little intermetso or refresher
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:45.680]   a little palette cleanser before we get to the next scandal from Uber. Let's let's let's let's
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:52.000]   cleanse the palette of bad CEOs. We're going to run a news group out with it with with a
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:58.880]   an iPhone of a chorus and then Lord. That's so one of the rumors which we poo pooed last week but I'll
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:04.720]   give you another chance to to address it is that because of challenges getting the you know the way
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:08.720]   Samsung handled a fingerprint reader because you don't have a home button anymore physical home
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:12.480]   button as they put it on the back like everybody else does. But Samsung did a terrible job the
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:17.040]   way they put it and the shape it is it's just it's just very hard to find you always end up.
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:20.160]   That was a fall back too. They wanted it under the class. They just couldn't do it.
[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:25.040]   So apparently Apple wants it under the glass but yeah. Are they going to have trouble do you think
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:28.000]   or different technology? I mean they're using the similar display. I mean Samsung I believe is
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.920]   supplying. There's a bunch of suppliers but the Apple has its own authentic technology that it
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:36.000]   bought when it bought the company. It's not using the synaptics fingerprint reader.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.160]   And but it's it's getting it's getting a camera underneath the display that can reliably because
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:44.720]   if it can't reliably be fingerprints as a deal breaker. You think they're going crazy working
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:48.560]   really hard right now staying up all night trying desperately to get that working.
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:52.560]   I mean this stuff is locked like a lot of the stuff gets locked down early on so I mean they
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:55.520]   probably have a very good idea of where they can go at this point. It might be down to a couple
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:44:00.160]   prototypes or variations but they've got to get their trucks lined up. Even if you're an iPhone
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:04.000]   person and you say I'm going to be using an iPhone as soon as anyone comes out. It's worth
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:09.760]   playing with this Galaxy S8 Plus because I think that that is a really interesting pointer
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:15.680]   to where Apple might be going. And the LG too which is very similar to not much publicity. Yeah.
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:20.480]   The G6 is quite good. I like the G6. Yeah. And it does what Apple does.
[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:23.040]   The LG that invented this with the dual cameras.
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:32.240]   Yeah. It's a great thing about even if you have no intention of switching from one platform to
[00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:36.880]   another it will help you to not only give you ambitions on to what an iPhone can do better
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:41.600]   or Mac can do better. It'll also really make you appreciate stuff that is brilliant about an
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:46.320]   Apple product that you've kind of forgotten about because you've been using Apple products for years
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:52.000]   and years and years and years because it's easy to become jaded. It's like in America.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:57.440]   Well, excuse me. I'm sorry. In most parts of America we take clean water for granted. I just
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:02.000]   well, I just want to bring the commercial. I went there. Exactly. During the commercial I went back
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.880]   to the kitchen sink. I poured myself another leader of fresh, cool, clean water. And I didn't
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:11.840]   even think about it. But you then you go to other countries where no, that means having to walk
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:16.560]   about three quarters of a mile at the right time of day and feeling up a can. I think as Apple users
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:21.280]   sometimes we forget how great and the things about an iPhone that are great that are uniquely
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:26.320]   iPhone the things about a Mac that are great that are uniquely Mac. So that's why I always
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:31.200]   recommend if you're at the mall check out the Microsoft store usually a Microsoft kiosk near the
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:37.120]   sun glass but try out a Surface, try out a Surface Pro and you'll see maybe you'll probably see two
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:41.040]   things that you wish the Mac did or the iPhone did and three or four things that said, oh my god,
[00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:44.720]   how do people live like this? I don't like you. I'll make you go back even better.
[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:48.720]   I am sure their Apple engineers carrying Samsung Galaxy S8. So they just ask,
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:53.600]   tell me, are you meeting this? She says, I heard you say something but I didn't hear any noise come
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:58.480]   out. Well, okay. Can you hear me now? Sorry, I'm sorry. I guess. Since we're talking about phones,
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:03.920]   I can say that right. Okay. So the thing, the thing to me that's sort of interesting about this is
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:11.280]   also seeing the direction that some things take on Android. There are some things that are very
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:15.680]   interesting and very useful to me when I've looked at Android phones and one of the things that,
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:20.960]   and you know, I've said this for years in some form or another and that's I want the other one
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:26.720]   to be great, whatever it is, like with iOS, I always want Android to do something cool and awesome.
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:31.760]   And on Mac OS, I always want Windows to do something cool and awesome because I want Apple to have to
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:36.960]   compete instead of sitting around and getting to go, you know, it would be great would be if
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:41.920]   we were able to make it so that there was a fingerprint sensor in the button on the front and then
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:45.280]   that would let you unlock your phone instead of having to type that passcode all the time.
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:49.520]   Like instead of sitting around and getting to sort of spitball stuff like that,
[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:54.240]   like instead they have to compete like Android did this cool awesome thing. We have to find our
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:47:00.720]   take on it. And that's one of the reasons that like I was on Andy's podcast not too long ago
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:04.720]   asking about an Android tablet because I want to see what Android's doing. I want to find out
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:10.080]   what it's up to. I want to see what that stuff looks like because I feel like they see things in iOS
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:15.520]   that end up getting an Android take. And I feel like there's also things in Android
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:21.040]   that you will end up seeing an Apple's take on in future versions of iOS. And so I'm always
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:25.280]   interested in what the other guy is doing. And I always want it to be great. I don't want it to
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:30.320]   be terrible. You know, everybody has a preference. And I want it to be something that's cool and
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:36.560]   awesome because watching Apple compete is super fun for me. And I enjoy getting to see what they
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:43.680]   do when they really have, you know, a worthy opponent as it were. So that's the thing that I
[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:49.840]   really like about about getting to see the Android phones. But my problem now is that
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:56.320]   not one of these phones will fit in my pocket because I'm a woman and I wear women's jeans.
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:48:02.640]   And it drives me up a wall and it's driven me up a wall since I got an iPhone 5. And the
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:06.960]   5 poked out the top of my side pocket, my front pocket and my pants. I don't carry it in my back
[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:12.720]   pocket because that way lies madness and probably broken phones. So I put it in my front pocket
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:18.160]   of my pants and then it doesn't fit there. And so like, I keep threatening to start a website
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:23.120]   where I just take my phone and put it in pockets and see which pants it fits and which pants it
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:28.560]   doesn't fit. You kind of get velcro. I think a lot of people be interested and I would really love
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:34.640]   to see you try the S8 because I feel like, first of all, it's slippery as hell. So this thing is
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:39.520]   pre lubricated for your convenience. And then I think it would just slide right in because
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:46.080]   it's look how narrow it is. Of course, it's not. But I have me tiny Japanese school girl hand.
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:51.120]   I know I want to like if I could push this through the screen, I would. So you could try it because I
[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:56.320]   really be curious. But it won't fit. I know it won't fit because girls have because even though
[00:48:56.320 --> 00:49:02.000]   these are my teeny, weeny little hands, like they don't fit entirely into the pockets of my jeans.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.480]   It's a weird cultural thing too because it's a lot of societies where people in general are
[00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:10.480]   much smaller than the McDonald's head culture we have here. And they want the biggest screen they
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:14.400]   can because it becomes their primary computer. They don't have a macro. See, and it's usually
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:19.840]   so you can make a 12 inch phone and they'd be like, yes, please another three. Right. And like
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:24.640]   and I know that there's a market for people who want the giant screen and I understand those people.
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:29.680]   I'm not those people. But I understand the need for that. I'm not going to be one of those like
[00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:33.200]   tech people who goes, well, if it's not for me, it's obviously not for anybody because I know that's
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:39.680]   not true. But for me, like I carry my phone in my front pocket because that's where my phone is
[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:43.760]   supposed to be. That way it's against my leg. If something goes off, if I need to get a hold of it
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:50.480]   is right there. And you know, that's why I never got a plus in the in the six plus and the S plus
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:55.920]   is the same size as the plus actually is very good. Yeah, I would never, I would never ever get
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:50:00.320]   one of those. I get people who do because they have whatever it is that they're doing with it
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:04.720]   that that bigger screen or that particular camera is really great for. But this,
[00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:11.520]   you know, even just the regular size six, you know, the one that I have, like that's it's super
[00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:17.440]   frustrating that I can't comfortably leave it in the pocket of my pants all day long. I wear jeans
[00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:21.360]   for the most part. Doesn't matter what kind of jeans I know people are going to start like
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:28.400]   trying to help tech support on my pants. But it's not easy. No, and leave eyes won't either. And I
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:33.760]   know why they're smaller and that doesn't make it any better. And I just want something that will
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:40.080]   fit in the pocket of my jeans where my phone I feel is supposed to go. You get the watch the
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:43.200]   the phone stays back home and the watch is just your interface everything. And then you get the
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:46.640]   air pod the air pod is everything's going to bring your watch with you. And then the implant
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:50.320]   arrives and you just never have to carry anything ever again. This is how they get us there. Okay,
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:54.640]   when I get there, then I will stop complaining about the size of the pockets and women's pants.
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:57.360]   How do you find it too big for my neck? How do you feel about the
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:03.440]   fingerprint reader on the back? Do you think Apple some people are? Yeah, a lot of people are
[00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:07.520]   saying that in the chair, I'm saying this too. Love it. I love it. Yeah, I personally love it.
[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:13.600]   There are disadvantages if it's in a stand or if it's lying on the table, you have to pick it up to
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:17.680]   it. On the other hand, it's a very natural to read. I mean, not for the Samsung because it's in the
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:21.760]   wrong spot. But if it's in the place where for instance, Google and LG put it, it's just very
[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:27.040]   natural to put your finger right there. So yeah, even out of the even out of the case,
[00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:30.720]   there's a let me take this out of the case. This is last year's. This is the last time we
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:34.560]   met the camera a lot Leo, but there is yes, but there is there is even out of the case,
[00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:39.120]   there is like a really natural indent that as I'm taking this out of my pocket, my finger just
[00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:43.200]   happens to go there and it just happens to be unlocked when I turn it around. Not only that.
[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:47.520]   So I think that's the best place for it. I think it's something I would love Apple to steal.
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:55.200]   And the other thing is that recently they added a feature to Android where you can use the
[00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:59.120]   fingerprint reader even when it's unlocked. So if you just simply swipe like this,
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:05.600]   that will drop down your notifications and scroll through them. So if this were not just for dropping
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:11.600]   down notifications, which is just awesome. If it were also this is we will accept that we will accept
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:17.440]   stroking down on the fingerprint reader on the back as a user tongue down scrolling.
[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:20.800]   Right. So I'm reading I'm reading something that's going to take me five minutes to get through
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:25.920]   at the bus stop or something. I could just simply go like this instead of whoop whoop whoop.
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:30.320]   That would be such a great innovation. That'd be such a great thing to put on the iPhone. I think
[00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:35.200]   I don't if anybody is afraid that this is the wrong place for it. The Samsung put it in the
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:39.520]   wrong place because they made it a little tick-tock and they put it right next to the camera lens.
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:43.760]   So you're always going to be greasing up the way. They actually had to put software. They actually
[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:48.880]   had to put software that checks the state of the camera lens and warns you to clean it. Yeah.
[00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:53.280]   There's a pop up. There's a pop up on here says, Oh yeah, you better clean. I swallowed the
[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:57.600]   bird to catch the fly. I don't know why. I don't know why. Well, and that's that's the cascade you're
[00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:00.640]   talking about where you had to do this. You had to do that. So you had to do this. You had to do
[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:06.160]   this. Yeah. And it's an endless parade. But so there are a lot of Apple users who including Kelly
[00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:10.640]   so angry, Leo, who don't want a fingerprint reader on the back. So if Apple can't put it on the front,
[00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:15.520]   which is better putting it on the back or doing face recognition, iris recognition,
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:18.640]   some form of on screen recognition or fingerprint.
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:21.200]   But a dongle. That's the solution. Exactly. Yeah.
[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:28.640]   Or Apple's company that says that, you know, we find that people only use four of their fingers. So
[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:35.040]   where if we your Apple retail will remove this finger, put it in an NFC chip to replace it with.
[00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:39.680]   But I'm sure I'm sure it'll go. Hey, I think again, I think it's a great place for it. I think that
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:45.520]   but if past history shows us anything, it's going to be that if this becomes an actual rumor,
[00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:49.840]   they're going to be four months of people saying, Oh, this is stupid. This is exactly why
[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:55.440]   Android developers have no taste and Apple wouldn't do that. And then three months after Apple does
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:54:00.640]   it, it's like, thank you, Apple for finally putting the fingerprint reader on the right place.
[00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:05.360]   No, they didn't do it first, but they did it right. See, they care about the fight like,
[00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:09.680]   Oh, for heaven's sake, it's okay to say that the revolutionized your print reader on the back.
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:13.200]   But today, Apple invents the fingerprint reader on the back.
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:20.080]   For me, the problem is is again, the size of the phone because it needs to be in a place where
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:29.200]   this hand can find that easily on the back. And, you know, a standard issue adult male size hand
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:34.960]   can also find it on the back because like everybody's bigger hands than I do. So it's to me, it seems
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:38.800]   like a really tough nut to crack. One of the nice things about having it on the front
[00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:44.480]   is whether you're a person who holds your phone in one hand and operates it with the other,
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:49.600]   or whether you're the pinky perch person with and you do everything with your thumb so that it's
[00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:53.360]   all one handed, what, you know, whether it's your right hand or your left hand, you know, if you're
[00:54:53.360 --> 00:55:00.160]   me, you're doing it left handed. It's still a thing that works to have it in the center on the front,
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:04.080]   you know, near the bottom. And so, you know, well, what you do is you just, you know,
[00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:08.640]   register your thumbs there. And then whichever hand you pick it up with, there's your thumb.
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:14.640]   And it seems like that was a really, to me, that was a really good way to solve that problem.
[00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:19.040]   And so it doesn't matter whether I'm right handed or left handed or I have big hands or I have
[00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:23.520]   small hands. That's a place that everybody can pretty reliably hit. And on the back,
[00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:25.680]   I don't know how you find that sweet spot.
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:31.760]   Well, we'll see. I mean, Apple's got a solid. It's an implementation thing. You can do it well,
[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:36.320]   and you can do it badly. And I hope if they do it well, well, well, they'll app their Apple,
[00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:40.160]   they'll do it well. But the problem is, one in the logo, but the logo is a bit high up on a
[00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:46.160]   seven plus. It will. I just, I have to predict it's going to be where Google and LG have put it
[00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:52.320]   because it's just really an HT, no, HCC didn't do that. HTC put on the front. I think the future
[00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:56.240]   is clearly bezel is phones, no physical home button, and a fingerprint reader on the back.
[00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:58.160]   But you squeeze them instead of having side buttons.
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:04.480]   There is a phone. The new HTC apparently you squeeze. I don't give your everything.
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:07.840]   Licking it is still kind of weird. It's the expresses.
[00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:11.600]   Licking it is actually I'm going to confess doing what you were talking about, Eddie.
[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:15.920]   There's a swipe down on the fingerprint reader that pulls down the notifications of the swipe
[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:17.840]   up on this weekend. Please, please.
[00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:23.120]   So I'm really just it's just a it's a I'm David Blaine. And this is my or whatever. Whoever the
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:28.000]   guy is Chris. I'm the I'm just Chris Angel Chris Angel. It's just a Chris Angel trick.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:34.640]   Wow. When I will lick my phone, my charge card comes up.
[00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:38.240]   Oh, we've broken it. Oh, there we go.
[00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:40.240]   The fingerprint sensors tell you it tastes like snow.
[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:43.920]   It's very good. It's a cheap trick.
[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:46.480]   Is a software telling you to clean your camera now, Leo?
[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:47.120]   Yeah, probably.
[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:50.960]   You know, when a tour of the of Apple's mysterious new spaceship factory,
[00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:54.000]   only seven winners for seven gold and iPhones,
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.200]   speaking of which, I think,
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:57:02.160]   we've achieved camera phone parody in the high end phones, right? The pixel
[00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:05.680]   and our time in our lifetimes, Leo, a parody and all time.
[00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:11.280]   Will Apple now jump ahead of the other guys? And what can they do to jump ahead of the other
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:11.520]   guys?
[00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:17.120]   Computational photography, not just putting more cleanses in where we saw we saw the start of it,
[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:20.960]   where it's just as simple as, Hey, great, we have telephoto and we have normal
[00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:27.200]   but also calculating in between now there's there's a there's a I can't remember the name of it,
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:32.800]   but there's a really experimental camera that I think it crowdfunded as a
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:40.080]   it looks like a big, thick phone, but it literally it looks like it looks like some sort of spider
[00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:45.280]   in micro photography. It has something like 16 little lenses on it of different focal lengths,
[00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:50.560]   different characteristics, because when you press the one shutter button, it is the first
[00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:56.880]   deciding which of these lenses is going to be most useful fires off a number of them simultaneously
[00:57:56.880 --> 00:58:05.040]   and then computationally builds a super high resolution super high, super high exposure
[00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:09.520]   contrast range picture from these things. So I really think that that's what Apple is going to do.
[00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:14.640]   They're going to be the company that says there are four lenses, just like they were very smart
[00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:19.680]   last year to say if I was when I was doing my review, I was talking to Apple directly,
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:23.760]   and they're making it very, very clear that we don't think of it as a telephoto lens and a
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:30.000]   wide angle lens. It is the camera system. And you're not meant to wonder or worry about which lens is
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:33.680]   primary being used because we're going to take as much information as we can. That's where they
[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:38.720]   can really do it. Every single camera that's doing exciting things is tricking us into thinking
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:45.680]   that this is this is a full frame full frame $3,000 camera. But no, it's a tiny, tiny little sensor,
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:49.200]   but there are like five of them in each of them. One of them does one thing really well.
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:55.920]   So but it's not about making better pictures so much as solving the problem of those little edge
[00:58:55.920 --> 00:59:02.960]   cases that a phone camera still doesn't do well. So if I go into copy square in a really sunny day,
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:06.400]   I've done this before. I kind of had to stop doing it because the high end cameras are so,
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:12.240]   high end phones are so similar now. But on a sunny day, take the same stock picture of the
[00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:18.000]   Boston Public Library and the Old South Church, Carolwell in the in the background. You can't tell
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:22.480]   the difference between five of these because it's a beautiful picture. But it's when you go inside
[00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:27.440]   the Boston Public Library and you're going into this really medieval lit room full of colorful
[00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:31.760]   murals, that's where the rubber meets the road. And that's where we're going to see improvements,
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:38.000]   not not in the test stand pictures, but oh my god, I'm so used to getting really crappy photos of my
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:42.960]   friends at parties and dark darkly lit with pulsating lights in the background. I'm used to
[00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:49.440]   like I posted a picture on Instagram was wearing like my NASA meatball shirt from Goddard Space
[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:55.680]   Center. But it's like a canary red shirt and no camera can no phone camera can get that red.
[00:59:55.680 --> 01:00:00.400]   It's always a pink or a salmon. I had to go and take it into Lightroom to make it look red because
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:06.080]   you're just firing off one third of your sensors just at full volume. Those edge cases are going to
[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:11.040]   start to fall away. And it's going to be which camera is fastest, which camera is easiest to use,
[01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:15.840]   which camera is I simply push the button I get a great picture under all circumstances. And that's
[01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:22.000]   that's a fight that Apple can definitely win. So my favorite is funny. Andy's yardstick is the
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:27.120]   Boston Public Library and my yardstick is Disneyland. Okay, fair enough. Because
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:33.840]   no flash photography. And so when you don't use a flash and you're inside, you don't like
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:37.840]   when you want a really great shot of something in Pirates of the Caribbean, something in it's
[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:43.360]   a small world, whatever, you know, not all of it is like super overly lit. It's sort of, you know,
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:50.720]   classroom on a day you have a film strip sort of lit. And so when you, you know, when you're in
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:56.640]   there, like I take I end up taking the same pictures like every time we go on on different
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:01.360]   rides at Disneyland every time I get a new phone because I'm curious how they have evolved. And so
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:07.040]   like the first pictures I got like with my iPhone 3G at Disneyland of Pirates of the Caribbean
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:13.280]   are crap. Like I'm not gonna lie. They were awesome. It was awesome. I was able to take that
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:17.680]   picture with the phone, but it was not an awesome picture, not by any stretch of the imagination.
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:22.960]   And they got better and they got better and they got better. And like the ones that I got
[01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:26.960]   with my success, the most recent time we went to Disneyland were decent. They were pretty good.
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:31.600]   I don't have a plus so I don't have the super duper camera, but I have a pretty good camera.
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:38.720]   And it's and I enjoy that. I think the evolution in cameras isn't necessarily even going to be
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:46.560]   the sensor. I think it's probably going to be the control. I remember Andy, I think it was you ages
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:53.920]   ago who said if I could have the Android controls with the iPhone camera, like I'd be unstoppable.
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:02:00.400]   And I still feel like that's kind of the case. There should be better from the OS. Not I'm
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:05.360]   gonna go use camera plus. You know, I have to launch camera plus instead of just using the camera app
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:12.000]   or whatever, having better control of what the camera of the picture the camera is actually going
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:19.280]   to take seems like where the evolution is going to come from, like better use of the data that
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:21.200]   what's already in there can already capture.
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:25.520]   Yeah, I think there's gonna be three things too that are really like I think Apple's gonna show
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:29.040]   off the screen and it'll be the same screen technology. But I think Apple and Google for that
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:32.960]   matter have way better color management than Samsung offers. And you if you won't have to do
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:38.160]   a lot of manually changing profiles, they're going to individually calibrate every sub pixel of every
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:42.000]   device read at the factory floor. So it's going to look really, really good as OLED. And I'm sure
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.160]   they're going to tout, you know, the strengths of the display. And then they'll do the photography
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:49.520]   like and like Andy mentioned, and then they'll if it's ready and it's working, they'll do the
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:53.200]   distance charging. I think when people see you just putting your phone down on the table and
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:55.920]   it charging without you having to worry about plugging anything in or putting it on anything
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:03:00.480]   magnetic, whether people end up liking that more and odd, it'll make for a great demo on stage.
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:08.960]   One thing we do know where we think we know or we might know, Apple's next iPhone may be
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:14.720]   wireless, not that they invented it, but it will be the best wireless phone ever. The CEO of
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:24.400]   PowerMat says yes. And PowerMat makes by the way a charger that is not the
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:28.880]   cheap charging standard, but the other standard, the PowerMat standard. He says, yes, it'll be a
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:33.520]   standard feature in the next iPhone. And I presume that he would know, Aylad Dubzinski
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:39.680]   said wireless charging would be a standard feature in the next iPhone. He may never again be invited
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:45.600]   to an Apple event. If you you know, Eli, if you're on a hangout with me, that's okay. So interesting.
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:50.720]   Yeah. And I've learned a little bit more since the last time we talked about a month or two ago.
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:54.800]   When we talk about like what Renee is saying, where you don't have to put it on the pad,
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:04:01.440]   even if it has multiple charging coils on it, it doesn't mean like a Tesla type tower in your
[01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:06.720]   backyard pulsating, cooking birds in the air. Over talked, we're talking about a match.
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:11.600]   I know that would be cool. Again, going to your backyard, just picking up squirrels and birds and
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:15.280]   saying, okay, I'll got to just take the fur off. And it's already fried. Great. Breakfast is taken
[01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:21.920]   care of. But basically, like imagine having like a little like sculpture dome nightlight on your
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:28.480]   nightstand. And so long as it is somewhere within six inches of it, you will get charged. That's
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:32.720]   very, very doable. And that might be interesting. I don't it's not going to happen. Andy, that
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:37.440]   scares the hell out of people. People don't even think Wi-Fi is a good idea. Oh, I've got a dome
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:44.640]   that is somehow a microwave emitting energy that I just put my phone near it. What else do I put
[01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:48.640]   New York? We'll scramble my eggs. You know, better sandwich. People are not going to go for that.
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:56.880]   I use the word without without malice. People will fall for a really great demo.
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:03.520]   Like, if they if the name made me raise the point that kind of made me start running for the first
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:09.520]   time, I don't think that Apple is tacky enough to choose a feature just because it will demo well.
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:13.440]   If you watch Shark Tank, you know that they're all saying, I this will demo great on
[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:18.080]   on on a on the home shopping channel. That's what we're looking for a good demoable product.
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:23.840]   But if there is a we we have found if we if we add this new co-processor, we find that we could
[01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:33.200]   increase Wi-Fi bandwidth up to 20 to maybe even 28 versus here is an LED light that lets you know
[01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:39.280]   when your ex wife or ex husband or child is doing something you don't approve of somewhere on social
[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:46.080]   media. It's like, that looks cool. That's cool. It's not like solving a problem that isn't a big
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:51.840]   problem. I like wireless chargers, but it's but you know, the the current wireless chargers just
[01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:56.400]   fine. In fact, I was actually I have to say I do prefer wireless because it's just easy at night.
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:06:00.320]   You just put your phone in but I have a little easily you just put your phone in it charges. It's
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:06.240]   not like I need something that's broadcasting energy through the room and I have a feeling that
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:12.080]   that will be a negative not a positive. It's what is the advantage of that. Well, again, it means
[01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:17.600]   that you don't have to it's not hard to turn this in the little stand. It just I get it wrong all
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:21.920]   the time. Well, you don't have you got to get one of these little stands there are good there are
[01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:26.000]   bad and good wireless chargers. I know but I've like turned over and knocked it with the the duvet
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:30.960]   cover and then it gets dislodged and wake up and it's not charged. It's or you could still not get
[01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:36.720]   away from the magic. You could you could say you could say the same thing about the magnetic charger
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:40.480]   and the on the Apple watch. I mean, it's I've done it plugged in chargers and not turned the power
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:44.800]   bar on. I mean, I have ways of messing up any technology. Yeah. You know, I think I think that maybe
[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:52.400]   Renee is projecting the wrong line of words. I mean, there's no QA engineer call me. I mean,
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:57.600]   I will show you why your product fails. Yes. This is what this is what I use. I use the
[01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:03.840]   review charger. The Renee test. Now we know why we always see so many Instagrams of your watch.
[01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:07.760]   You're flying to Cupertino. You don't have these insider briefings. You're not visiting friends.
[01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:13.280]   They're like, we think that only we think that no idiot could possibly be proof. But it wasn't
[01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:19.200]   true. God dang it. We shouldn't find it today. This is this is a cheap this is a
[01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:24.240]   charger and it just put your phone in it. It's very easy. You don't you're not going to get it
[01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:27.680]   wrong. In fact, unless you have it, you know, right next to you, you're not going to probably
[01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:33.360]   knock it off and it charges and that's you know, marginally easier than plugging in the connector.
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:38.720]   Although now with lightning and wireless lightning and type C connectors is easy enough. But
[01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:44.080]   you know, I don't really see a need for a dome that's spitting out energy a little farther. I don't
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:48.160]   see that you didn't know you wanted it until they made it. That's I don't know. I know. I know.
[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:55.440]   You want this. This would be this would be a doodad that people can see that has been designed by
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:59.920]   the Apple design team. It could it could just go. You don't have one Leo. You don't have wireless
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:09.760]   charger. Oh, you go. I'm sleeping with you. I said, okay, a cord like a caveman touch your
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:14.880]   charger like an animal. I will I will wait and see what they offer. And you know, if it's really
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:19.120]   cool, maybe recharging devices, just an edge case Apple can't make every single customer happy.
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:25.360]   I understand. Do you think do you think people like to buy lightning charging or do you think
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:30.880]   it's just that they're going to go to USB C so that everything's USB C all the time? I wish they would.
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:34.480]   But I think we've all agreed you weren't here, Kelly. But I think we've all agreed that that would
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:39.760]   be crazy. Tell you us be many as a thing and then lots of changing it'll be crazy. I mean,
[01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:44.960]   lightning is only six five six years old. And that was such a painful transition. I can't imagine
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:49.920]   Apple. Oh, it was not everybody just complained because they did not have a
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:55.280]   auto price 30 pin cables. When they launched it, they did not have adapters ready. And that was
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:09:01.520]   just horrible. They also every time I go to a hotel room, it's got a 30 pin connector.
[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:06.320]   Hotels don't want to buy new clocks every few years. It's your iPod doctor. The park enjoy.
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:14.240]   I feel it's likely to dock my phone in a hotel dock as I would be to use a toothbrush that I found
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:21.280]   by the way, a good case for wireless charging, right? One would hope. But I'm just curious because
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:27.520]   it seems like if they were going to change the charging, that to me feels like where it would go
[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:34.960]   because then this would be a way. It would be lengthy, but it would be a good way to sort of do
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:40.160]   customers a solid like I would love it. You computer that uses USB C already. So we're just
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:44.160]   going to do us a solid and you can use the same cord to charge your phone. I have a USB
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:47.600]   condom in here somewhere. Hold on a second. All the medical pro customers are like,
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:52.240]   you USB C need a death apple. This is a USB condom, Andy. You got to get one of these.
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:58.320]   What this is, is it does two things, which is really interesting. So it's charging only, right?
[01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:02.080]   So you're absolutely right. In fact, we should say this more often, Andy,
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:11.600]   do not plug your USB stuff into unknown holes because it's really a good way to get hacked.
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:15.440]   If you find a USB key on the ground, don't pick it up and stick it in your computer.
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:20.480]   That's a terrible idea. But these, this is a, this is a charging only connector.
[01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:25.840]   They're only a few bucks. It's called Porta Pal, P-O-R-T-A-P-O-W. But it also does something
[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:32.160]   else, which is I don't know, I haven't, I don't know, but it will take a regular charger and step
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:36.480]   it up to a high speed charger somehow. There's obviously circuitry in here. Steve Gibson sent me
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:40.320]   this. Well, yeah, there's something going on. You put a plastic sheet down before you use
[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:45.360]   someone else's charger? Absolutely. Yeah. The Porta Pal smart charge.
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:52.720]   So it will speed up your device charging if it can, and it will also protect you against bad
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:58.720]   stuff coming through the data ports on the USB. It only does charge it. It's an in- well,
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:03.680]   it's a type A. So you'd have to have a cable with a type A on one and not a type C on one.
[01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:09.600]   Or as most people call them, the regular USB. The normal. It's the normal. USB, micro USB,
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:19.040]   mini USB. Ming Chi Quo. How about that? He says the iPhone 8 is going to have severe shortages
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:24.000]   due to delayed production. It'll be announced in September, but you may not be able to get it
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:30.960]   till much later, partly because it's OLED. And we're talking about the, if the rumor mill is true,
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:36.400]   that the high end flagship one, there's apparently going to be a 7S and a 7S plus,
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:40.640]   and then this new magic iPhone that you'll want, but you won't be able to get to.
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:43.680]   The new AirPods? Is that what he says? Yeah, it's the new AirPods. He says,
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:47.920]   the new Nintendo mini. Yeah, and he has classic.
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:55.280]   Now it is continuing. So I hope you go. We made, we didn't make near enough of them,
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:58.640]   and everyone bought them and loved them. We should stop. Let's cancel it.
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:03.360]   You can't get a unicorn frappin. You can't get a Nintendo classic. Take that America.
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:10.160]   Take that America. So interesting. Ming Chico has mixed results, I think, in his projections.
[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:12.560]   He's probably the most reliable of the financial analyst.
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:15.520]   And he's the one that has the supply chain the best, right?
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:22.000]   His stuff is best when it's supply chain, because he's in China. He says production ramp up of OLED
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:27.760]   iPhone could be delayed to October, November. Production ramp up, which means it would be even
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:31.840]   after that before they'd come in any quantity into the US. That said, if new features,
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:36.400]   such as 3D sensing can provide good user experience, a temporary supply shortfall
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:41.280]   will undermine the actual demand, which may be deferred to 1H18.
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:45.440]   Can you translate that into financial? First half of 2000.
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:49.280]   First half. Okay. In that case, potential contribution starting. And again,
[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:56.000]   because he's a financial analyst, when he talks about Q2 2017, he's actually talking about
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:02.560]   January through March, right? 2018. It's very confusing. So he says,
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:09.360]   OLED iPhones delayed three to six months because of supply constraints.
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:13.280]   So don't get all excited about this magic drone.
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:18.240]   I'd like to ask you to ask for the correct USB first. I want to beat Renee to the most sensible
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:21.760]   thing that I know he's going to say, which is you can't say something's going to be delayed
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:25.440]   if it hasn't been announced yet. With even with even shifting. Okay. Sorry.
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:28.400]   Go ahead. No, that's a good point. I was just going to say also that, you know, a lot of
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:31.920]   like Apple thought the AirPods were going to ship on time and they got a surprise there. So I mean,
[01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:36.000]   even if even if, if right now he heard that they were on time, I still would not believe they're
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.880]   on time until I'm holding it in my hand. Yeah. That's just how these things work these days.
[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:44.240]   Well, and this seemed like a safe bet though, to say that they're going to announce a new thing
[01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:51.280]   and that it's going to be hard to come by because correct me if I'm wrong. But haven't we seen that
[01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:54.480]   with, let me see all of them?
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:14:00.160]   Anything that pushes a boundaries like Apple pencil like AirPods, when Apple does something
[01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:04.240]   that's really hard, it's very difficult to judge the timing of it. Well, and, and, and you know,
[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:08.000]   Google has set a new standard because we're six months into the pixel and you still can't get
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:12.880]   one of those. They're at customs behind the AirPods. I figured it out. They're at the bar at the
[01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:17.200]   airport waiting on customs. The AirPods are delaying them. They can't get through it. It's crazy.
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:22.400]   We live in a new world where people want to buy stuff, but there's just not enough of them.
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:26.960]   Yeah, it's like, but isn't there like sort of a lack of dignity to it? I really, I did, I did,
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:31.840]   I really did want like an NES classic because, you know, that's the circumstance under which I
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:35.040]   will have a game console. They're kind of old stuff that could be taken off my life for three
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:40.080]   weeks at a time and 60, 60, 70 bucks, great. I can spend that on some fun. But it's like,
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:45.280]   there's a certain amount of lack of dignity of I'm going to have to wait in the rain for six hours
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:50.080]   because I heard a rumor on Tumblr that maybe the store is going to be restocked this day.
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:55.200]   It's like, oh, please let me give you money for a product or service. It's like, I kind of like,
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:15:00.560]   I would, I don't know. My dignity is not worth a whole lot of money. But sometimes I do make,
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:05.840]   I do make that choice that maybe I will live without an NES classic if it means that I can
[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:12.320]   figure out that no, I did not have to beg. Please take my money. Oh my God. I'm so lucky. I got to
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:15.840]   buy this thing and other people didn't get to buy this thing. It's funny though.
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:20.160]   I mean, this is wrong. The pixel, the pixel is sort of BS. I don't mean that in a bad way,
[01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:23.920]   but it was a very last minute phone that I don't think they could source properly. Just don't,
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:27.280]   given how much Apple and Samsung and LG suck out of the supply system, I just don't think they
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:31.040]   had the resources to make the phone they wanted as fast as they wanted when their initial plans fell
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:34.320]   apart. And I think the other stuff like Apple changed the tip of the pencil and it became hard
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:37.920]   to supply. The AirPods, one analyst said the chip in there is incredibly powerful compared to
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:41.440]   even smartphones from a few years ago and just getting those chips and sensors in there turned
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:46.000]   out to be super hard and getting the distance charging on the screen in here and the touch ID
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:50.560]   working I think is going to prove super hard. And you either need a lot of time or you need a
[01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:55.920]   lot of preparation and sometimes those things don't work out. Right. Yeah, but it is a little
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:16:00.800]   worrisome though, because Apple isn't a Kickstarter startup that surprised at how long it takes to
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:06.720]   the right, but manufacturing. At this point, this is something we hear about almost every single
[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:11.200]   year that no, these that you cannot get the 64 gigabyte phone because we don't have, but we can give
[01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:14.800]   you that we can give you the four gigabyte phone because we have plenty of those. But that's it.
[01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:21.440]   Yeah. It's like you at some point, how many times one year out of how many failures in a road do
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:31.040]   you have to have before people who like your company are correct to say that either a you got a serious
[01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:35.200]   problem in how you do your math and the stuff you do not have the ability to anticipate
[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:39.520]   what how much people are going to need things when other companies seemingly can handle this
[01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:44.320]   or that be I don't think it's part of their strategy to create marketing hype because that's
[01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:48.320]   not as valuable as the actual cash that people have in their hands to give you, but saying that
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:53.280]   we believe that we're willing to sacrifice a certain number of sales if it means that we never ever
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:58.400]   ever have stock on hand that we don't know what to do with. So, or you drop features like Samsung,
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:01.440]   you move it to the back of the phone and you ship now, but are they willing to do that because then
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:06.400]   people go, God, why didn't they just wait until they could do it right? Yeah, but that's another
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:11.520]   good discussion. I'm sorry, Kelly, I'll I'll shut up quickly. But that's another good question that
[01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:21.680]   I would rather have a product that is somewhat imperfect, but the other 97% of it works great.
[01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:26.320]   Then, okay, well, I've been waiting for six months to try to buy this. I still can't get it. I'm just
[01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:30.960]   going to give up and continue to use my year old product that has every it has nothing this thing
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:35.520]   has, but at least I'm going to wait anyway. It's you wait and then all you get is a touch bar.
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:40.960]   I'm sorry, Kelly, go ahead. Well, no, that's fine. So first of all, I only disagree with you,
[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:49.600]   Andy, in that I feel like Apple, because we see this every year, they talk about how we made
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:54.960]   X number of X million more phones this year than last year. And we sold every single one of them
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:18:01.040]   and there's a huge demand. There's a huge wait list. I think, like from here, it seems like the
[01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:09.840]   problem is zero day. Everybody wants one the day it's out and nobody can wait until Tuesday or
[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:16.160]   next week or the beginning of October instead of the beginning of September. Nobody wants to wait
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:20.640]   until Thanksgiving for their phone, like somehow they feel as though they have lost and must question
[01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:26.960]   all of the choices that led them to this point as an adult, I guess. And I feel like that is the
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:34.080]   thing that's hanging everything up because you see in capital P people, like the masses at large,
[01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:42.080]   like you will see people who got a phone after the announcement of the new phone. They announced
[01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:50.000]   the sevens and people went out a week later and got a success and were just like fetch me my
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:56.960]   fainting couch. I'm so pleased with the amazing technology in my phone. And they are absolutely
[01:18:56.960 --> 01:19:05.120]   100% fine with that. And that's the deal. And I think for me, what it is is zero day. Like when
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:10.880]   I got my success, I went on in order to midnight and like Friday was the day that everybody was
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:17.360]   supposed to get them. And I got mine Saturday. And you know what, I still managed to live a
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:24.000]   full and productive life. And I feel like there's a certain amount of that that is a problem.
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:29.520]   Because one of the things that I think doesn't always get enough attention from Apple is the
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:34.400]   supply chain stuff, not because people want to tell us what's in the next iPhone, but because
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:41.040]   Apple makes more and more and more and more and more phones every summer. They make more of them
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:45.920]   and they sell all of them. And there's nothing like to me, that sounds like a good problem to have.
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:53.360]   But it seems like it's somehow considered a failing that Apple can't estimate how many people are
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:57.200]   going to want that phone. But let's be honest, basically everybody who has an iPhone now wants
[01:19:57.200 --> 01:20:02.080]   the new one. And now that it has gotten easier for people to obtain a new one every 12 months
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:10.240]   instead of every 24 or even 36. That's even more compelling. And even more people are now
[01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:15.040]   able to get them every September or every October or whatever. And stand in that line in the mall
[01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:22.880]   and confuse my parents when we go shopping. And so it's sort of, to me, I think it's a thing that
[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:25.840]   sometimes Apple doesn't get enough credit for. I don't think they get enough credit for battery
[01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:31.440]   technology and how that has evolved over time on their watch. And I also think they don't get
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:36.720]   enough credit for manufacturing because every year they tell us we made so many millions more
[01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:42.160]   phones than last time. And even if you just take that gap, here's how many more we made last year,
[01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:48.000]   this year than we made last year. That if you could take any other cell phone company and say,
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:53.600]   you're going to sell this many phones in a quarter, not just in a weekend, but in a quarter.
[01:20:53.600 --> 01:21:01.360]   Like the other ones would faint with glee at what sort of sales numbers that would be for them.
[01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:06.000]   And I feel like sometimes that doesn't always get the attention that it should because everybody
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:12.560]   wants to talk about what somebody heard from their best friends, cousins, brother's boyfriend,
[01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:19.120]   who saw somebody that works on iPhones pass out at 31 flavors last night. It's a whole thing.
[01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:24.000]   And I think sometimes that conversation gets lost because there is still a person somewhere
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:29.040]   who wanted an iPhone on zero day, not a minute later and didn't get one.
[01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:32.320]   All right, I got a quiz for you guys. Go ahead.
[01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:42.640]   On this day, well, actually, what is today? On the 24th round this day on the on April 24,
[01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:49.840]   2015, what magical thing happened? Magical and revolutionary. Oh, you know, he got it.
[01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:59.200]   The I watch the Apple watch came in the mail. You got your ship. It shipped. It was announced
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:04.960]   sometime earlier, but it actually shipped two years ago yesterday. Isn't that great?
[01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:11.520]   Birthday. Happy birthday, Apple watch. Had we been sitting here, you know,
[01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:16.960]   had we, what would we have said? I mean, would we say from that vantage point two years ago,
[01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:23.040]   looking at today that it was a success that I don't think we'd say was an unqualified success.
[01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:24.640]   We wouldn't say it was a failure either.
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:30.400]   It was a company. It would be headline success.
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:33.840]   As it was said, any other company be thrilled.
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:37.920]   If this was surface like like the surface is a huge success, and I think it sells a 10% of
[01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:41.440]   what an Apple watch sells or some ridiculous number like that. So it's just compared to
[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:46.960]   iPhone, nothing looks good. But if you say iPhone out of Apple, the Apple watch is incredibly
[01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:54.240]   sick. Fair to say it wasn't all Apple had hoped. Yes. Yeah. I mean, what I would say is that it's
[01:22:54.240 --> 01:23:01.440]   a remarkable commercial success. It's a beautiful watch. The thing that I got wrong mentally about
[01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:07.360]   the concept of the watch is that, again, this is the Apple watch now costs about as much as I paid
[01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:12.000]   for this watch. This is like a $200, $300 watch. I love it. And it's an analog watch.
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:17.040]   It's a time act, I think. It's a no, no, it's a mundane Swiss really watch, luminous with
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:22.880]   luminous hands, but again, it's people buy watches because they like the design, they like having
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:27.920]   them, they like putting on in the morning. And Apple was well positioned no matter what this watch does.
[01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:32.880]   If all it did was do notifications that had no fitness features and had this really wonderful
[01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:38.000]   system of interchangeable high end to low end watch band swap outs, it would be an excellent
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:42.320]   watch. It's a huge success on that basis. So that's something that I definitely got wrong. And I
[01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:46.080]   think that's something that Apple is maybe teaching a lot, their success is teaching a lot of other
[01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:50.960]   people that it doesn't have to be the revolutionary product. The only place that it's a failure
[01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:57.040]   is that it really is just a cool watch. It doesn't really bring anything in terms of moving
[01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:05.360]   humanity's relationship with technology forward or making people's lives better by again creating a
[01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:11.760]   brand new paradigm for computing. It's not that it's certainly not doesn't live up to the hype that
[01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:18.160]   Apple put into it when they introduced it. Again, it was a really I was there at the I was present
[01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:23.520]   in the room during the rollout and was one of the most confusing Apple presentations I've ever seen.
[01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:29.600]   It's like, and now we're going to show you live video of somebody of someone's garage door opening
[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:34.480]   up because he was able to open the garage door remotely. I'm saying I have never once in a million
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:38.880]   years ever thought, Oh no, this watch sucks because I can't open my garage door remotely and see live
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:45.040]   video of it. So it's not it didn't revolutionize the world the way that the iPhone did the way the
[01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:49.840]   iPad did. It didn't really it's not influenced that way. But like when they said really successful,
[01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:52.720]   you see lots of people wearing them and enjoying them. And that's really the only
[01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:57.680]   Metro success that needs to be again. Really it's a wonderful device. They make a cool watch
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:03.600]   people will buy it and wear it no matter what it does. I think it advanced the cause of the
[01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:11.840]   larger phones because everyone I know who first got one was really excited about it because they
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:20.240]   could leave their phone on the dock in the backpack in the purse wherever it was. And I think Andy,
[01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:25.280]   it sort of did make I don't know if it necessarily furthered people's relationship with technology,
[01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:29.680]   but it made a lot of people rethink it because now that you can get all your notifications on your
[01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:37.520]   arm, you really think a lot of people thought a lot harder about what needed to be what they
[01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:46.240]   needed to be notified about. I guess. And that's the thing to me that is
[01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:52.160]   you're going to have an audio trouble again. Yeah, what's going on? I don't know.
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:57.680]   That's the thing to me that's interesting about the Apple Watch is that I remember
[01:25:57.680 --> 01:26:02.720]   like right after everybody actually got them, there was a wave of articles about how to turn
[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:09.200]   all that crap off on your watch. And it was totally necessary because a lot of people were like,
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:14.240]   yeah, there's actually a lot of stuff that I've let my phone notify me about over time
[01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:20.880]   that I want to not be notified of anymore. And for me personally, one of the things that I like
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:28.240]   about it is the get up and move. Get off your took us alerts. I actually like those because
[01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:34.800]   they make me get up and walk around. They make me get up and take a break from my screen for
[01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:41.120]   even if it's just for a little while. I really like that. And I'm not a person who spends a ton of
[01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:45.920]   time exercising. So for me, the fact that it will track my steps and tell me to get up off my
[01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:54.080]   butt once in a while is great. And I like that I can get the notification on my arm for certain
[01:26:54.080 --> 01:27:00.240]   things or be able to briefly reply to text messages, things like that, smaller stuff.
[01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:07.360]   I really like that I have that opportunity. And so for me, I feel like it did change my
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:11.680]   relationship with technology because it also made me sort of go through all the notification on my
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:17.520]   phone. And my phone doesn't notify me about near as much stuff either. And I have opened my garage
[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:21.360]   door with my watch. And I think it's awesome. I'm just going to point that out.
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:27.120]   Okay, no, I'll power to you. I don't have that. I don't have that need for remote garage or
[01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:31.680]   access. But it's a person if I can do it with my phone, it's cool. If I can do it with my watch,
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:38.880]   it's even better. Because I'm that person like, I want to do it by talking to Shlomo. I'm so
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:45.040]   just to quickly respond to what Kelly was saying. My point is that these are all things that the
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:49.200]   Pebble watch was already doing and these are stuff that any fitness device with an OLED screen can do.
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:53.840]   And if anything, but at the time we haven't talked about this in the show for a couple of years,
[01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:59.360]   we'll just say it again, that I think that that was the thing that the Apple watch didn't get
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:04.240]   anywhere close to right. What I like about Android Wear is that it really does take the idea of
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:12.000]   the job of this watch is to remove distractions from your device as to make you have to look at
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:15.920]   screens less, not more. We will only put up a notification when it's timely and in the right
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:21.200]   context. And we will let you do it, get addressed, whatever happens through that device, that
[01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:26.480]   notification really quickly. Whereas my big problem with the Apple watch was that the designers
[01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:30.240]   really did think that this was going to be like an iPhone experience. I'd be fascinated by
[01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:34.800]   tapping through things. And the first thing I would want to see is this huge constellation of apps
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:40.240]   and that I would want to like respond to every single email through my watch as opposed to
[01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:43.200]   don't need that. Okay, thank you for alerting me, but that's not important to me right now.
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:49.120]   Good to dismiss. The thing for me is that I think Andy's absolutely right in that Apple's big failure
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:52.480]   with the initial Apple watch was not to deliver a minimally delightful product, which is what
[01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:56.880]   they did with iPhone and iPad. They weren't as certain what people would want. And that's because
[01:28:56.880 --> 01:29:00.720]   they entered the market way earlier than they did with tablet PC or with phones, which had a good
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:05.440]   10 years of observation behind them. But what they did do to me is they did what Apple typically
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:09.440]   does. And that is sort of co-aggulate on a few really useful features. And to me, that was all
[01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:13.520]   convenience. Now the Apple Watch now is second generation. So it's hard to compare it to like an
[01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:19.600]   iPhone 7 or an iPad Pro. It's more like the iPhone 3G or the iPad 2 where it's getting a little bit
[01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:24.160]   better. But already it's profound. For me, the difference is profound. I notice immediately if
[01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:28.080]   I'm not wearing it, the fitness thing's absolutely, but it's the convenience of everything. When you
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:32.160]   have ubiquitous Apple pay and all you're doing is tapping your wrist and not even reaching for a
[01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:37.120]   phone, it's magic. I was my waiter. I was like, it spoke me sandwich two days ago. The waiter was
[01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:40.320]   wearing an Apple Watch. And he's like, I can look at my text and my boss doesn't know because I'm not
[01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:45.840]   a lot to use my phone at the restaurant. And it's just all these little convenient use cases,
[01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:50.800]   whether it's like the fitness app or it's paying for things or it's checking your messages or it's
[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:55.040]   the guy who got, who's car got thrown and he couldn't reach his phone and he's still called 911 right
[01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:59.520]   off his Apple Watch or someone's heart rate monitor alerting them of a more serious problem.
[01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:03.440]   I think in subtle and profound ways, it has absolutely moved us forward technologically.
[01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:06.960]   I just think it's still so early that we haven't really seen the full effect, but we have the
[01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:11.680]   benefit of like eight, ten years a while. But again, you're mentioning features that are pretty
[01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:16.560]   much every phone. I mean, every phone had those things before iPhone. Nokia had every phone and
[01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:21.280]   Palm at every feature and iPhone had. I had pebbles. They were garbage. I mean, I love Eric, but they
[01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:24.960]   were garbage compared to the Apple Watch. Android, where I still don't think has this act together.
[01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:31.120]   So it just to me, it's a better wrist computer than it's ever been available before. And I think
[01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:35.200]   that was the benefit of having it. I feel compelled to point out that Renee did not
[01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:40.320]   point out to him the most compelling feature, which is the Pokemon like,
[01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:43.760]   appeal. That's a work out. That's like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:48.400]   I think it's the bands. I think he loves the bands. The bands. That's what I'm thinking about.
[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:52.720]   The bands are good and genuine. And George and Keith paintings are just lovely pictures of flowers.
[01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:56.960]   No, no, but the bands, the bands are a really good point because we've had traditional
[01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:00.560]   watchmakers making bands for years and they didn't make them as effortless and easy to
[01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:03.680]   change as Apple took Apple coming in with a fresh set of eyes and saying,
[01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:07.360]   maybe you don't need a jewelry case or to take it to a professional jeweler to have your links
[01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:10.960]   changed or your watch band swap. Maybe we can make that easy and they did. And I think we've
[01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:14.320]   seen a bunch of watch bands since that have benefited from the mentoring the market.
[01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:20.160]   What I meant was the Pokemon like, got to catch them all mentality that Renee apparently had.
[01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:26.400]   You cleverly weaved his two passions into one. Yeah, if you want to know what the new Apple
[01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:31.440]   watch bands look like, you go to Instagram and you look up Renee and there they all are.
[01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:33.200]   Yes, he's got it.
[01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:37.520]   He's Apple.com. I just don't have a way to organize them. If you have a way to organize them,
[01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:41.520]   let me know. Mine are in a box. Yeah, you know what? They're all in my drawer. I wish I had
[01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:45.360]   because unfortunately you're rubbing off on me. Maybe I shouldn't sit so close.
[01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:48.240]   Why isn't that a Kickstarter? This is the thing that I've wondered for months.
[01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:52.560]   A band box, a band. A band rack. Yeah, that's what mine looks like. Yeah.
[01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:57.520]   Or a band or a band or a white leather one. Is that an Apple white leather?
[01:31:57.520 --> 01:32:01.840]   Yeah, that would go nicely with the loop. That would go with the addition very well, I think.
[01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:04.480]   I've tried it with the addition. Yeah, it's not exactly the right white.
[01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:08.160]   That's why Apple did ship it. Apple's ID. Yes, that's the part of it about that.
[01:32:08.160 --> 01:32:12.400]   That's the other thing. If you want to see what the bands look like with all the different bodies,
[01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:17.680]   again, Renee's the guy. Renee's the guy. It's like Leo, I have to do it for the readers.
[01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:23.360]   Renee, I asked this question. It's out of love and it's not out of you. I'm just
[01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:28.960]   actually, I'm actually wondering about this. Have you ever just been close shopping and you had a
[01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:32.960]   choice between three or four different shirts and you made a pick based on, I actually have an Apple
[01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:36.320]   watch that this will go really well with. Have you ever done that? No, but I've seen people who
[01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:40.720]   coordinate their woven nylon with their shirts. I have seen people who do that. I am not one of
[01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:45.360]   them because I know we're nearly that coordinated, but I have seen those people. Shocking. Shocking.
[01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:48.800]   Or you have no money left for clothes and tops after you spend all your money on bands.
[01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:54.000]   Oh, it's true. Hashtag truth. All right. I have been known to change mine occasionally based on
[01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:59.840]   outfit or occasion, but I don't have a ton of them to choose from. So I don't do it a lot,
[01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:03.760]   but I do do it once in a while. I've been changing my bands a lot lately. My mom does it for spring
[01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:08.080]   and fall. She gets a new bought watch band and changes it up for no like watch bands before
[01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:10.960]   Labor Day after Labor Day after Labor Day. After Labor Day.
[01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:16.960]   Let's take a break and then we'll come up with the final outrage from the New York Times story.
[01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:21.760]   Has there been more since we started broadcast? No, I don't think
[01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:26.240]   calling paging Mike Isaac. Is there anything else you haven't said?
[01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:34.480]   Andy, not goes here. Kelly Guimant is here of or Gumant. She likes Gumant is here.
[01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:37.680]   Wait, what are you doing with the eye? You just throw in the eye out. There's no eye in Gumant.
[01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:42.720]   Yeah, it's my married name and that's how I was told it. Well, you're stuck with it. That's it.
[01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:45.760]   Yeah, it's not. Yeah, it's what you're. Can I ask what's your maiden name?
[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:50.080]   You can. It's spray, which is much easier to put out.
[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:51.600]   Spray SPR. A.Y.
[01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:54.480]   Yep. Or SPR. E.Y. A.Y.
[01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:56.480]   A.Y. Kelly spray.
[01:33:56.480 --> 01:33:57.920]   Canadian spelling. I can't like you. I can't like you.
[01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:00.240]   Why spray that could be your stage name.
[01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:06.400]   Because I don't know. It wouldn't be if I hadn't been married for a really long time.
[01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:10.160]   Really long time. Are you sure? What's great to have you? Great to have you. Renee,
[01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:13.600]   great to have you, Andy. Great to have all of you out there. And because you're geeks,
[01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:18.800]   I have something for you. From our friends at Quicken Loans, the best lender in the country,
[01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:22.400]   when it comes to buying a new home or refying your existing home,
[01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:27.360]   you got to go to the mortgage lender who's got your best interest in mind, who gives you a process.
[01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:34.320]   It's easy, transparent, fast, and there's none better than Quicken Loans and in Rocket Mortgage.
[01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:36.640]   I particularly like Rocket Mortgage because it's all online.
[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:41.680]   But I have to say, given our last mortgage experience, at least I bought a house about three years
[01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:47.520]   ago, bought our house. And it took more than a month to get a approval for the loan.
[01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:51.040]   Like we thought it can't possibly take more than a week or two. We're going on vacation in three
[01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:57.680]   weeks. It couldn't possibly, and we're faxing from vacation, not with Rocket Mortgage. Rocket
[01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:03.600]   Mortgage lets you submit everything you need with a push of a button. I mean, check stubs,
[01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:09.040]   check statements, pay stubs, any paperwork, and everybody's online now. So it's really easy.
[01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:12.800]   You could do it from your phone, your laptop, your tablet. You could do it on the road. You
[01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:17.280]   could do it at an open house. You could say, "Hey, let's buy this house." You could go through the
[01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:24.480]   whole thing, Quicken Loans dot com slash Mac break on your phone and adjust the rate and
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:29.680]   length of your loan in real time to make it just right for you. Press the go button.
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:34.400]   They probably should, they probably caught the lift off button. Press the lift off button,
[01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:38.320]   because it's Rocket Mortgage. And literally within minutes you will get approved for a loan that's
[01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:45.600]   just right for you. No paperwork, no wasted time. It's fast, it's efficient, it's for the modern world.

[01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:19.520]   because then you don't get the, you know, the buy line. So she's at Verso V-E-R-S-O. What's the
[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:25.680]   story of that on your Twitter handle? It means left, specifically when you open a book,
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:32.320]   on left hand page. There's the verse in the obverse. Yeah. And I'm left handed. And so I found that
[01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:36.800]   in the dictionary when I was very young. And so I went, Hey, left handed. I'll just use that. So
[01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:42.560]   your whole life, that's been kind of your handle. Like when you play Neopets and stuff. Basically,
[01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:51.040]   yeah. I'm a lefty too, but I just call myself Leo. I don't know. I haven't really come up with a
[01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:54.720]   great handle. I never, I chief Twitter is the closest I have to a handle. I use that.
[01:36:54.720 --> 01:37:02.080]   Sinestro, but I do have a really good motto. Because you know, I didn't Latin because all
[01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:07.920]   good models are in Latin. And you know that, you know, Vani Vidi Vidi, Vidi was the motto was it was
[01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:18.320]   a Caesar. I came, I saw I conquered Vani Vidi Vidi. So my motto is Adeo. I heard Vidio. I saw
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:25.440]   disco. I discovered. But actually it looks like audio video disco. So it's great. It works on both
[01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:33.840]   levels. I danced. I danced. I came I saw. I boogieed that. Boogie fever. All right. Let's get to,
[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:40.160]   let's get to the next outrage rate. Let's stop laughing, having fun and be angry at
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:49.600]   collaboration. And again, credit to John Gruber, who parsed Mike Isaac's post. Actually, others
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:56.240]   must have because the times then later had a story on it. And Jojo Hidayah, the CEO of Unroll
[01:37:56.240 --> 01:38:06.400]   Me had to make an apology. He called it heartbreaking. Heartbreaking. We can do better. So it turns
[01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:15.840]   out, and we learned this from Isaac's article at the very bottom. And it doesn't, it's, it's,
[01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:20.640]   it's just like kind of matter of fact, they spent so much of their time. Uber did one-upping
[01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:25.520]   rivals like Lyft. Uber devoted teams to competitive intelligence. Many businesses do this.
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:30.560]   Purchasing data from an analytics service you may have heard of. I just recently canceled
[01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:35.280]   the yesterday, my subscription to called slice intelligence. He uses a slice app. It tells you
[01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:40.080]   when you've got packages on the way in order to use that, you have to give them access to your email.
[01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:46.720]   Using an email digest service, slice owns called Unroll Me. We've even recommended Unroll.me. You
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:51.360]   Oh, it's so cool. Yeah. You just sign up for it and give it access to your email account. It looks
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:55.120]   for your subscriptions and unsubscribe. That's the problem. That's the problem. Looks through your
[01:38:55.120 --> 01:38:59.360]   email account. Looks through it again. Give it access to your email account. And if you're a
[01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:05.760]   Gmail user, it's not just today's emails. I have 11 years of emails that they can look through.
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:10.080]   We were talking to Corey Doctorow yesterday on triangulation, by the way, great interview.
[01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:14.960]   Corey's awesome. And he's very, you know, he's privacy focused. He uses pop mail still. He says,
[01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:21.680]   I don't want to leave years of my mail on somebody else's server. Duh. But that was the whole
[01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:25.840]   selling point of Gmail, right? You can leave all your mail here and search at any time. And
[01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:30.480]   anyway, Unroll Me turns out, and if you'd read the terms of service, you would have known this,
[01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:36.240]   had a nice business on the side. It was a free service as is slice. But apparently,
[01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:42.960]   they collected not when they went through your email, among other things, that your lift
[01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:49.360]   receipts from the inbox and sold the anonymized data to Uber. Uber used the data to kind of gauge
[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:56.320]   the health of Lyft's business. Slice confirmed it sells anonymized data. But you know,
[01:39:56.320 --> 01:40:01.920]   what we don't see in this article, but we all know, is that there's no such thing as anonymized
[01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:07.600]   data. We've seen so many experiments and universities and so forth, taking so-called anonymized data
[01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:12.880]   and figuring out exactly who it came from. So I wouldn't count on it being anonymized.
[01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:19.040]   And on top of that, if your privacy agreement says, hey, we will never sell identifiable
[01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:23.600]   information to you, that's fine. So long as they never make you click through another user
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:28.960]   agreement ever again, because they can always change that, put that at the bite number.
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:32.240]   Jojo Haddiah writes,
[01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:38.480]   "Our users are the heart of our company in service. So it's heartbreaking to see that some of our
[01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:44.800]   users are upset to learn about how we monetize our free service. It's in the terms of service.
[01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:50.480]   It's in their privacy policy. We need to do better." They are heartbroken because they got caught,
[01:40:50.480 --> 01:41:00.240]   not because... And that's what Gruber says. Gruber's take down is salty to say the least.
[01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:05.680]   He says, "Give me an F and break. They're not heartbroken. They're in damage control mode."
[01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:09.200]   Because they were operating under the radar. Now they've been revealed. I, of course,
[01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:16.480]   immediately unsubscribed from unrolled.me and slice. He calls them poop bags.
[01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:22.080]   He says, "If you sign up for unrolled.me, delete your account. They make money by selling
[01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:26.320]   your purchase receipts." The thing is, it's not just the lifter seats, right? That's the tip of
[01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:32.000]   the iceberg. Oh, wait a minute. They're mining that kind of stuff from my email and selling that
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:37.600]   to the highest bidder. To be clear, this kind of market basket analysis is not new.
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:42.560]   Traditionally, if you go to a 7-Eleven and you buy Coca-Cola, Coke has no idea who you are,
[01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:46.160]   but 7-Eleven might. They'll sell that data back to Coke. They'll sell it to Pepsi for
[01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:49.600]   competitive analysis. They'll sell it to Pringles because they want to try to motivate them to pay
[01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:53.680]   more for better shelf positioning or to do different sales and things like that. The difference is
[01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:57.680]   that you were going into their place and using it in a very specific transaction.
[01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:02.080]   We're here there in treating customers to provide unlimited access for in perpetuity to all sorts of
[01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:06.320]   data, either what they want now and what they might want in the future. That's just horrifying.
[01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:11.040]   There's all these services that want you to give, like Trippit, which just said, "Why are you
[01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:15.280]   emailing us your receipts, Renee? Just give us access to your Gmail and we'll scan for them and
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:20.560]   do it all for you." My reaction was, "Well, no, get off my planet." There's no amount of convenience
[01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:24.880]   that data is invaluable. It is so much more valuable than money, which is why these companies think
[01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:28.880]   of all these scumbag ways of trying to take our data from us. I don't think we've been taught from
[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:33.200]   a young age to value it the way we value it. When you have a service that's free,
[01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:40.080]   you've got to think about, "Well, this is not free for them, so how are they making money?"
[01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:45.200]   If you saw the data come out of your account, if you saw your intimate photos and you see it
[01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:49.040]   animated on the screen going to you'd say, "Oh my God, what are they taking? Stop, stop."
[01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:51.520]   But it's invisible to us, so it feels like it really is free.
[01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:57.440]   And for some people, Unroll Me was valuable enough that maybe they don't mind that their
[01:42:57.440 --> 01:43:02.880]   emails being mine. I know Gmail. Well, see, this is the difference. I know Google's looking through
[01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:07.520]   Gmail, but they're very clear about what they're looking for. As far as I know, they don't sell
[01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:12.400]   to third parties. They're looking for keywords that they can sell ads against, and they don't
[01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:17.440]   tell the ad company, "Oh, Leo's mentioning death a lot. You should offer him a coffin."
[01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:24.400]   But when coffin makers come to Google and say, "We want to buy ads for people who might be interested,"
[01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:28.480]   then Google, without revealing to them, says, "Yeah, well, we've got some people here who look
[01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:35.600]   at buying burial plots. They might be interested." So those kinds of things, I understand, and I
[01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:41.520]   promise we shouldn't assume about how they're doing it. And I, by the way, Gmail's worth it for
[01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:46.240]   me. And for that, I don't mind. In fact, I prefer customized ads. Now, on the other hand, if I knew
[01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:52.480]   that Google were selling anonymized receipts from my purchases to some other company,
[01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:54.640]   I might be a little upset. I hope they're not. Are they?
[01:43:54.640 --> 01:43:58.000]   And it was a diaper in the beer. You could identify someone at a 7-Eleven because they
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:01.200]   bought diaper in beer at the same time. You could pull the patterns out of these things,
[01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:04.800]   ended up not being anonymous at all. You get one piece of information, like a telephone number,
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:07.200]   an email address, and it's only going to do everything about that person.
[01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:11.440]   We've seen it over and over again. Researchers take anonymized Netflix data, and they're able
[01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:17.680]   to immediately pinpoint who it is. It's not, anonymization is, but am I being naive?
[01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:23.920]   Is this just the tip of the iceberg? Is what unroll me doing? Is it normal?
[01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:32.240]   Yep. Not yet. Well, it's, I'm good. Kelly says no. And he says, "Yes."
[01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:38.160]   I said, "Not yet." It is not normal now. That's why everybody's up in arms about it. This is the
[01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:42.000]   same thing as before when we were talking about Uber. It's not normal now.
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:46.080]   It's the new normal. But it's, I think it's going to be.
[01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:50.640]   Why do you think that this is common practice?
[01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:58.400]   When I look into various industries, again, if you are giving them data, they're going to
[01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:04.480]   use that data to whatever advantage they can have. This is the, what I always think of as the
[01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:10.720]   big bag of free money in the middle of the table concept where if business sees a big bag of free
[01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:13.920]   money in the middle of the table, they're not going to walk by the big bag of free money.
[01:45:13.920 --> 01:45:17.680]   They're going to take the big bag of free money. They're going to ask their, well, with the thing
[01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:20.960]   in their hand, they're going to ask their lawyers, "Is it legal for us to take this money?" And the
[01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:25.040]   legal guys can say, "Yes, absolutely." They say, "Great. I'm going to take the big bag of free money."
[01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:31.200]   And when it comes to user data, if there is no law stopping them from doing it, if there is an easy,
[01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:35.840]   if there is a law stopping them from doing it, but there is an easy way by slipping something into
[01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:42.800]   paragraph 2000 of a user agreement. They can't do it more closely. Here's an article from an
[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:48.800]   artist taken a year ago, eight years ago, Massachusetts Group Insurance Commission had a bright idea
[01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:54.560]   back in the mid-1990s. It decided to release anonymized data on state employees that showed
[01:45:54.560 --> 01:46:04.800]   every single hospital visit to help researchers. The state removed all obvious identifiers,
[01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:08.480]   like name, address, and social security number. But a graduate student in computer science
[01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:15.680]   got the data and was completely able to figure out exactly who it was. In fact, she found
[01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:23.360]   Governor Weld, the former governor of Massachusetts, with no problem. It was an easy task. This was
[01:46:23.920 --> 01:46:29.040]   2009. Actually, this was in the '90s. This article is in 2009, and it goes on.
[01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:36.800]   There are lots of examples. AOL researchers released a data sets of search queries. Netflix
[01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:42.880]   released that database. In both cases, people were able to identify specific individuals. So,
[01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:48.880]   anonymous is an anonymous. Companies, I agree, are monetizing. I would hope that
[01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:55.120]   Google says, "We're just doing it for ads. I hope that that's true. They're not lying,
[01:46:55.120 --> 01:47:00.560]   but you're right. There are so many clauses and paragraphs in every privacy statement that
[01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:08.640]   is impossible." I think part of the problem is not as much that companies are doing it,
[01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:15.440]   but that people are finding out about it. That's a big problem in my book, is that there
[01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:20.080]   did not used to be near as much awareness about this as there is now. There's a reason Cory Dr.
[01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:24.560]   Rowe, who's a privacy advocate, works for the EFF. There's a reason why he uses Popmail and
[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:29.440]   doesn't leave his email server anywhere. He says, "The most they can have is however many hours
[01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:34.080]   between the last time I come in." It costs him convenience. He says that. It's incredibly
[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:40.720]   inconvenient for him. So long as consumers understand the transaction that's happening,
[01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:46.480]   as long as that company is being really clear about their collection, they're collecting,
[01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:50.800]   I think that's okay. As long as every time they change the terms of service,
[01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:55.680]   they say there is a click through, say, "Yes, except all these." But before that,
[01:47:55.680 --> 01:47:59.040]   there are going to be four bullets saying, "Here's the major things that we're changing."
[01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:04.080]   They should say when you sign up, "Just so you know, by the way, we're parsing through your email,
[01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:09.200]   looking to find data for companies we'll buy for a variety of reasons, including competitive
[01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:13.440]   research. We take your name out just so you know. That's what we're doing. That's how we pay for
[01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:17.840]   this lovely free service. If that's okay, we've used sign up." The other problem is that
[01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:23.680]   you start off with the three or four founders of the company that want to make the world a better
[01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:30.080]   place and create this thing that then they got their angel wings on, they've got their halos on,
[01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:34.640]   and they say, "You know what? We can have a great successful company. We don't want to make
[01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:38.320]   a fortune, but we'll make enough money to make ourselves very comfortable, but we don't have to
[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:42.880]   screw over our customers." And then for your later company, they get investors.
[01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:46.080]   Not only that, but they've been through four or five rounds of financing,
[01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:49.840]   and now they don't have the ability to say, "We don't get..." They're going to say, "Well,
[01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:55.280]   they're going to be at a very, very cheap conference room with a very, very cheap executive
[01:48:55.280 --> 01:48:59.840]   saying that, "Well, we have all this data? Yes. Well, why are we not selling this data
[01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:04.640]   to mattress companies to sell people, discount mattresses, sell that information on?"
[01:49:04.640 --> 01:49:08.480]   Because that would be wrong. Again, here is a big bag of money in the middle of the table.
[01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:12.320]   We can do that. If the only objection is that you don't want to do that, guess what?
[01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:15.200]   We only 70% of the company were going to do that.
[01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:20.320]   Well, remember when Radio Shack went out of business? Remember the Radio Shack battery of the month
[01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:24.320]   club? Remember every time you went into a Radio Shack, they asked for your zip code and phone
[01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:28.640]   number. Well, that database was one of their assets when they went out of business.
[01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:36.560]   Well, I remember there was a big deal about that data and whether the new owner would get it,
[01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:42.320]   and you know what? It just puffed off in the distance. I don't know the upshot of it.
[01:49:42.320 --> 01:49:46.960]   I bet you didn't get it. Didn't the story say that Slice wanted service because they had those
[01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:53.040]   receipts. They knew they had that data. Yeah. So, bankrupt Radio Shack will sell the customer data.
[01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:59.040]   They promised to keep privates, says Boing Boing. People were nervous when Facebook bought
[01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:04.320]   Instagram. We forget the health information they have about us until those points.
[01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:08.960]   Yeah. It gets to what we were talking about earlier on. There's a lot of really great
[01:50:08.960 --> 01:50:14.240]   conversations in the show. One of them is that I think it was last year that I finally kind of
[01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:19.200]   gave up and started posting to Instagram and started posting to Facebook. I still don't trust
[01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:23.920]   Facebook. I still really don't like what they do and how they go about their business or their
[01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:29.600]   attitude, but it became a choice of I can still choose not to be on Facebook, but that is where
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:35.440]   all of my family and most of my friends are having the conversations. And I have the choice of either
[01:50:35.440 --> 01:50:42.160]   you know, creating a, if I really want to be a presence in their lives and if I want them to
[01:50:42.160 --> 01:50:48.080]   be a presence in my lives, I'm going to have to use Facebook. So, I decided that, okay, I hate this,
[01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:53.440]   but I don't feel as though I have a choice because I want to be able to see pictures
[01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:58.560]   of my niece's vacation in London. And I can certainly text her and we can
[01:50:58.560 --> 01:51:02.080]   swap things, but that's a burden on her. So, that's how these things happen.
[01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:07.120]   They got you the same thing. I didn't put, I don't put any of my personal photos on any service that's
[01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:11.280]   a social network, but I like my junk. They're not junkie, but they're sort of like pop culture
[01:51:11.280 --> 01:51:14.720]   leaves what I use Instagram for. They're not personal family photos. I've been meaning to talk to
[01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:17.760]   you about that because I would like to see more of your personal stuff on Facebook.
[01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:25.280]   Seriously. I'll put another question. Don't you consider as your friends, Renee?
[01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:28.080]   I'm a deeply private person. I just don't believe in putting that stuff.
[01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:36.000]   I hate the time. I want to see it. I just saw a good friend's baby sonogram.
[01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:43.200]   As it was being bought. I saw inside Dario Rose's tummy. It was live on a Facebook.
[01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:47.600]   She doesn't care about privacy. Why should you? Is everyone using the Macbreak weekly story?
[01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:51.760]   By the way, because I just went live. Does anybody want to guess that?
[01:51:51.760 --> 01:51:58.800]   Just for fun, there are engineers inside Facebook and Google saying,
[01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:03.120]   can we get facial recognition working starting with the sonogram?
[01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:05.360]   I guess they can. I bet you anything.
[01:52:05.360 --> 01:52:08.400]   Well, but remember Google had that commercial where they were encouraging the father to give his
[01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:11.440]   childhood gmail account from birth and people had a huge outcry against it?
[01:52:11.440 --> 01:52:13.120]   Just start your kids right away.
[01:52:13.120 --> 01:52:20.400]   I like that idea. It depends on how your mind is bent, which way you go.
[01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:25.520]   A couple of points to take away. First of all, this has always been going on back to 1992.
[01:52:25.520 --> 01:52:29.840]   Blockbuster sold their data. Echo Star when they sold out.
[01:52:29.840 --> 01:52:34.000]   Radio Shack sold their data to the highest bidder. They had an auction for it.
[01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:38.960]   This digital thing is nothing new, except that it's much more widespread and they have a lot more of our data.
[01:52:40.880 --> 01:52:45.920]   I think for people like us, we can run our own email server. We can be sophisticated enough to
[01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:53.360]   solve this and keep our data to ourselves somewhat or not post personal photos on Instagram.
[01:52:53.360 --> 01:52:57.840]   But most people are just going blindly ahead and they may not even know what's being given up.
[01:52:57.840 --> 01:52:59.280]   Maybe they don't care. I don't know.
[01:52:59.280 --> 01:53:03.120]   Convenience is a huge thing. Again, all these services that will just tie directly into your
[01:53:03.120 --> 01:53:06.720]   gmail and perpetuity, again, the same thing with Pokemon. There's all these services that will tell
[01:53:06.720 --> 01:53:10.320]   you exactly the power of all your creatures. If all you do is give them access to your Pokemon
[01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:16.240]   account and then you can meet your own boss. You think it used to be the old days, they'd say
[01:53:16.240 --> 01:53:19.360]   like three porn click here and you'd click on it and then all of a sudden you had the fire.
[01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:22.880]   It's just people are very willing to do a quick little click because they think they're getting
[01:53:22.880 --> 01:53:27.600]   something out of it. What Andy mentioned earlier, the value of the transaction is not explicit for
[01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:33.440]   them. I will point out that John Gruber points to a comment unverified on Hacker News by Carl
[01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:38.480]   Kotsky, who says, "I worked for a company that nearly acquired Unroll Me at the time,"
[01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:42.400]   which is over three years ago. They had a kept a copy of every single email of yours that you
[01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:48.720]   sent or received while a part of their service in a series of poorly secured Amazon S3 buckets.
[01:53:48.720 --> 01:53:54.800]   A large part of slice buying Unroll Me was for access to these email archives to look for keyword
[01:53:54.800 --> 01:53:59.600]   trends and receipts from online purchases. He goes on to say the founders of Unroll Me were
[01:53:59.600 --> 01:54:05.600]   pretty dishonest, which is why we didn't buy them. They had other issues as well. But mostly,
[01:54:05.600 --> 01:54:11.680]   I think the takeaway and this reason I bring this up is many of these companies don't secure this
[01:54:11.680 --> 01:54:20.080]   data very well. You may be giving permission to the company. He may say, "Well, I get enough from
[01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:24.960]   Gmail for that," but you may also be giving it to some Joe Hacker down the street.
[01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:29.600]   All right, let's take a break. We got to come back because we're running out of time. You're
[01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:37.360]   picks of the week. Prepare them, ladies and gentlemen. Our show today brought to you by FreshBooks.
[01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:43.280]   The all new version of FreshBooks accounting software has just gone up. You're going to love it.
[01:54:43.280 --> 01:54:48.640]   If you haven't looked at FreshBooks in a while, try it. You can try it free for 30 days at freshbooks.com/macbreak.
[01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:53.600]   It all started for me when I was using FreshBooks to invoice. This is 10 years ago, more than 10
[01:54:53.600 --> 01:54:58.720]   years ago, because I had invoicing Rogers in Canada. I had to do it in Canadian dollars. That
[01:54:58.720 --> 01:55:03.440]   was a pain. I used to fire up Excel and do the calculations. Then I had to send them expenses.
[01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:09.200]   FreshBooks solved it. I took pictures of the receipts, put it all in the invoice. I created 30
[01:55:09.200 --> 01:55:13.600]   seconds. It looked beautiful at my logo and everything. They did the currency calculations.
[01:55:13.600 --> 01:55:17.040]   Everything, not only that, I got paid faster and you will get paid faster because
[01:55:17.040 --> 01:55:23.520]   FreshBooks invoices enable your clients to pay you online right from the invoice using a credit
[01:55:23.520 --> 01:55:29.600]   card. No setup on your part. They could pay straight from the invoice. On average,
[01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:36.800]   FreshBooks users get paid 11 days faster. Plus the information is at your fingertips.
[01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:42.720]   You can see what invoices have been sent, what ones have been paid, not paid. You can even send out
[01:55:42.720 --> 01:55:49.120]   reminders growing increasingly less gentle. You can see even which invoices have been viewed,
[01:55:49.120 --> 01:55:54.000]   which is a very useful thing. Did they see that invoice? Oh, they did. They're just ignoring it.
[01:55:54.000 --> 01:56:00.400]   It's so awesome. Autopayment reminders, automatic late fees, if you want, recurring invoices.
[01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:04.640]   You can build, they have time tracking in the app and on the website, which means you can build
[01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:09.440]   for time, not only by client, but by specific project. You can even track your time to the
[01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:16.160]   minute and manage team time sheets as well. I can go on and on. It is fantastic. You could
[01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:21.840]   track expenses and integrate them right into whatever you use, stripe, Shopify, gusto,
[01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:28.960]   acuity, scheduling, concur and expensive. That do the expense reporting, right? If you want to
[01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:34.000]   keep track of business miles, things like that. It is awesome. I want you to check out FreshBooks.
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:38.800]   FreshBooks.com/Macbreak. You'll save two days of paperwork a month and make tax time
[01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:44.320]   of breeze next year. This is the time to do it. Remember, because the pain of tax time is still
[01:56:44.320 --> 01:56:50.880]   fresh in your memory. Fresh. I just did one. Do you want to do that again in a year?
[01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:53.680]   No, it may as well do my financial planning now. I'm already different.
[01:56:53.680 --> 01:57:01.040]   If you start FreshBooks now, next year, you get all the reports of your account in your book,

[01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:19.920]   us? Section say Macbreak Weekly. All right. Show a hand. Who has a pick? Anybody?
[01:57:19.920 --> 01:57:23.760]   Anybody? Kelly Guimot. Guimot. Can we mention one thing before we do Pixelio?
[01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:28.000]   Yes. The Apple changing the terms on their affiliate program.
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:32.800]   Yes. We didn't leave. We left that out because we were over time.
[01:57:32.800 --> 01:57:34.480]   I didn't want to make it a pick of a week, though.
[01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:38.720]   Don't make it a pick of a week. It's actually a big deal, though. They're reducing the commission
[01:57:38.720 --> 01:57:44.960]   considerably, like 5%. It's down from 7% to 2.5%. Nice. They gave one week's notice.
[01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:52.400]   That's a 64% cut. What does that mean? If you're an affiliate, wait a minute. That means you'll
[01:57:52.400 --> 01:57:57.600]   get less money. A lot of developers use affiliate links to supplement their app store income because
[01:57:57.600 --> 01:58:00.880]   it's not going to be easier to sell a paid app. I thought that meant they were taking less money.
[01:58:00.880 --> 01:58:05.120]   They're giving less money. Not such good news.
[01:58:07.120 --> 01:58:11.920]   Now, Google has always given 0%. It's not like there's a lot of competition in this area,
[01:58:11.920 --> 01:58:15.040]   but it's still absent to any word from Apple on why this is happening.
[01:58:15.040 --> 01:58:17.920]   That's actually a pretty big cut. 7% was generous.
[01:58:17.920 --> 01:58:23.600]   Frederico Vitticci says, "This change in affiliate commissions pretty much sucks.
[01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:28.560]   We don't rely on links alone, thankfully, but we'll be affected by it." Who is Frederico?
[01:58:28.560 --> 01:58:31.280]   runs maxstories.net. That's it.
[01:58:31.280 --> 01:58:33.920]   Tremendous, tremendous. Tremendous, right. That's sad.
[01:58:36.160 --> 01:58:39.840]   Back in the day, we used to pay a full-time app editor salary just off App Store affiliate
[01:58:39.840 --> 01:58:43.440]   revenue. It's gotten less and less over the years. We do it with Amazon, right?
[01:58:43.440 --> 01:58:46.880]   Amazon has cut their rates, too recently.
[01:58:46.880 --> 01:58:49.360]   They don't. Where are you going to go? What are you going to do?
[01:58:49.360 --> 01:58:53.120]   We try to get off ads by going to affiliate because the ads are getting worse, and now the
[01:58:53.120 --> 01:58:55.760]   affiliate's getting worse. Tiny violins are all right.
[01:58:55.760 --> 01:58:57.360]   Just means more ads, doesn't it?
[01:58:57.360 --> 01:59:01.360]   Sorry, Renee. Now, Kelly.
[01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:07.920]   Trust you. No, but no, we didn't get to a lot of stories, and I apologize, but I think we had
[01:59:07.920 --> 01:59:16.320]   some great conversations. Kelly, Guma, hey, Kelly, hey, Verso, what do you got for us?
[01:59:16.320 --> 01:59:23.200]   So, I have two things, and they're analog. One of them is sort of a bonus pick, but I'm going to
[01:59:23.200 --> 01:59:28.080]   start with an item from Uniball, which is the mechanical pencil.
[01:59:30.880 --> 01:59:36.400]   Right way up. It's the Kurutoga mechanical pencil. Now, I have the Hello Kitty one,
[01:59:36.400 --> 01:59:41.600]   and here's why it's awesome. Aside from having Hello Kitty on it, of course.
[01:59:41.600 --> 01:59:47.440]   Here's why the Kurutoga is awesome, because normally, when you use a mechanical pencil,
[01:59:47.440 --> 01:59:50.560]   you pick it up kind of the same way and hold it kind of the same all the time,
[01:59:50.560 --> 01:59:56.000]   and you write, and you write, and you end up with the long, sharp point on the lead.
[01:59:57.200 --> 02:00:04.160]   With this, the reason it's called Kurutoga is Japanese, and it's two words, and one of them is
[02:00:04.160 --> 02:00:10.160]   rotation, basically. I don't remember the exact translation off the top of my head,
[02:00:10.160 --> 02:00:14.560]   and the way it works is every time you pick it up and put it down, it rotates the lead around a
[02:00:14.560 --> 02:00:19.680]   tiny bit, a tiny, tiny bit, so you never get that long, sharp side, and you never end up slicing
[02:00:19.680 --> 02:00:26.560]   through your page. So, it's awesome. And they come in a few different point sizes. I have the 0.5,
[02:00:26.560 --> 02:00:32.800]   which I really like. Or you like a tiny point, yeah. I do, and it's because I'm left handed,
[02:00:32.800 --> 02:00:38.640]   it comes from having pens, because I'm not a hook writer, I don't do the hook hand, so I drag
[02:00:38.640 --> 02:00:42.640]   my hand across it, and I get blue hand, and so that's part of why I like pencils in the first place.
[02:00:42.640 --> 02:00:49.200]   Right. I am a kind of a, this is funny because I'm a big pen and mechanical pencil aficionado,
[02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:55.600]   and I never heard this, and they're not expensive. No, less than 10 bucks, and the other thing that
[02:00:55.600 --> 02:00:59.440]   I really like about them, I have another one that's plain, but why would I show you the plain one
[02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:04.080]   when I have one with a little kitty on it? Right. And there's sort of a rubber grip here. This red
[02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:09.920]   part is rubber, and so when you hold onto it, it's a little coshanina, a little soft and grippy,
[02:01:09.920 --> 02:01:13.520]   so you're not necessarily having to hold on to just the plastic part and have it slide around in
[02:01:13.520 --> 02:01:19.040]   your hand. So, and it does have the standard issue take off the top, there's an eraser in there,
[02:01:19.040 --> 02:01:25.440]   you know, the whole thing. So, that's my one pick. My big pick is this one. I like to pick stuff that
[02:01:25.440 --> 02:01:33.040]   is super useful and not necessarily very expensive. So, here it is, and you don't have to get a Hello Kitty
[02:01:33.040 --> 02:01:38.320]   one. There's a red and white, but there's also lots of other designs. So, like, if you like all your
[02:01:38.320 --> 02:01:44.160]   pens to be blue or orange or green or whatever, they have a lot of different body styles, but it's
[02:01:44.160 --> 02:01:53.840]   still the Uniball Kurutoga is the great one. And I like it to write in my Staples Arc notebook.
[02:01:54.400 --> 02:02:02.160]   Which is also Hello Kitty. Yes, I have, I've also covered my instickers. And I see didn't come that
[02:02:02.160 --> 02:02:07.920]   way. No, it came plain blue and then, you know, meet Kelly through the stickers on her notebook.
[02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:14.480]   So, there you go. The thing that I like about this is that it's got these little rings,
[02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:19.440]   and then everything snaps on and off of it. And what's in there? Okay, hey, a CD. All right.
[02:02:20.480 --> 02:02:28.400]   So, you can peel off and put in there whatever you want. So, I have this clear zipper envelope
[02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:33.360]   that I can keep stuff in. I have other stuff in here for different projects that I'm working on.
[02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:40.000]   There's dividers. And you can add different paper. You can get a hole punch and you can punch holes in
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:46.640]   regular paper and put in there. There's loads and loads of stuff that you can do to customize it so
[02:02:46.640 --> 02:02:53.120]   that you get the notebook that you want. Which for some people is very difficult. And for some people
[02:02:53.120 --> 02:02:57.280]   is, you know, not impossible. If you need to carry around a lot of paper, you can get bigger
[02:02:57.280 --> 02:03:02.640]   physical discs in order to have more pages. You can have all different kinds of covers. If you
[02:03:02.640 --> 02:03:08.400]   don't want to put stickers on it, there's like the quilted leather that's super awesome. If you want
[02:03:08.400 --> 02:03:13.840]   no tabs, you don't have to have the little tab things at all. If you have a full, this is sort of a
[02:03:13.840 --> 02:03:21.520]   half size one. And there's one that will hold standard 8.5 by 11 sheets of paper. And with that one,
[02:03:21.520 --> 02:03:26.640]   you can get a lot of other stuff as well. And if you needed to carry around other things, you can,
[02:03:26.640 --> 02:03:33.280]   like I said, get the hole punch and punch all those out. The Levenger's Thirka is what it's like. But
[02:03:33.280 --> 02:03:36.400]   it's a little bit more affordable and a little bit more easily available because you can go to
[02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:39.840]   staples and like pick everything up and touch it and put your hands on it and see what you think.
[02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:47.120]   And I really like it. I do have the larger full size one. I use that strictly for house projects
[02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:51.840]   because whenever I have to get estimates for something on the driveway or something on the house
[02:03:51.840 --> 02:03:55.440]   or whatever, whenever I get those, they're these full size pieces of paper and you can get like
[02:03:55.440 --> 02:04:01.440]   portfolio pockets for them and the whole thing. And I love them because I can make it be the
[02:04:01.440 --> 02:04:08.640]   notebook that I need and not just the notebook that I can buy. Perfect. Pen and paper. Who to
[02:04:08.640 --> 02:04:16.960]   think it? I write so much more stuff down even like in 2017 with all the technology we have available.
[02:04:16.960 --> 02:04:20.000]   You know, I have the watch. We've, you know, we talked about it. I have a phone. I have all
[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:27.360]   those things. But I still find that for me, the most comforting, I guess, in a way is when I
[02:04:27.360 --> 02:04:34.320]   have a lot of stuff to do. And it's all on my mind and I can't shake it. Typing it into a to-do list
[02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:39.360]   isn't the thing that helps me. What helps me is to sit down and write it all out by hand
[02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:43.680]   with my karutoga pencil that has Hello Kitty on it because they didn't have Star Wars.
[02:04:43.680 --> 02:04:50.640]   Yes. But how is Google supposed to scrape your information if you keep using pen and paper?
[02:04:50.640 --> 02:04:57.120]   You're not helping. That's their problem. That's not my problem. My problem is when I type it,
[02:04:57.120 --> 02:05:02.320]   I don't remember as well as when I write things down. So that's why I still take notes by hand
[02:05:02.320 --> 02:05:08.160]   and everything. So yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you, Kelly. How about you, Andy and Naka? What do you
[02:05:08.160 --> 02:05:14.720]   got for us? This is one of my favorite things. I think you have my son's graduation president is
[02:05:14.720 --> 02:05:22.800]   what you have. Yeah, this is really nice. This is the Mi Photo Walkabout Air monopod. I love monopods.
[02:05:22.800 --> 02:05:28.880]   I've been trying to find it is very lightsaber-like. I like the design of it.
[02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:37.440]   The reasons for having a monopod is that tripods, even the tiny travel tripods,
[02:05:37.440 --> 02:05:41.760]   are way too bulky. I think to just carry with it whether you know you're going to need it or not.
[02:05:41.760 --> 02:05:46.960]   And monopods, if they're not if they're not a crappy one, are almost as good because they're
[02:05:46.960 --> 02:05:52.080]   just a solid, solid pole so that you don't think you can't stand it up and walk away from it.
[02:05:52.080 --> 02:05:56.240]   But it means that if you're inside a museum or something or if you're shooting video and you
[02:05:56.240 --> 02:06:03.280]   don't want to get that sort of, you know, again, bouncy, bouncy puppet effect, they really do wonders.
[02:06:03.280 --> 02:06:09.600]   And so this is, I like this one the most because I already had a Mi Photo actual tripod and I
[02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:14.880]   really like the construction of them. But also, I really like the way that you extend it. You just
[02:06:14.880 --> 02:06:20.640]   twist this and just pull it and then twist it again and it's locked. And that's it. And then
[02:06:20.640 --> 02:06:25.680]   after you get your shot, you twist it again, you push it and you twist it and it's locked.
[02:06:25.680 --> 02:06:28.800]   And you can go do that for any length. And the maximum length is about
[02:06:28.800 --> 02:06:32.960]   eye height. I'm an average average American male. And it's about a little, actually a little bit
[02:06:32.960 --> 02:06:38.880]   above my eye line. So you can really get just for sports photography for really anything.
[02:06:38.880 --> 02:06:46.560]   And it's just it's it'd be great if it were just a little bit shorter. It's about 13 inches and a
[02:06:46.560 --> 02:06:53.600]   little bit more. But it is small enough that I can stick it in my laptop bag or hang it off of it.
[02:06:53.600 --> 02:06:56.640]   I've traveled with my travel tripod about this long,
[02:06:56.640 --> 02:07:03.920]   strapped to the outside of my laptop bag. It works, but you really do feel like Dorcas Augustus,
[02:07:03.920 --> 02:07:08.160]   like, Hey, look at me. I've got a big tripod with me wherever I go. Whereas this just makes it
[02:07:08.160 --> 02:07:12.320]   look like please don't mug me because I've got a big thing. This could have electrodes on the
[02:07:12.320 --> 02:07:19.920]   end of it. It's it's also available in seven colors. I got the black, but it's also lime green,
[02:07:19.920 --> 02:07:26.320]   orange, purple, red, silver, and not and also not only that, but you can also get a top for it.
[02:07:26.320 --> 02:07:31.200]   That's just sort of like a walking stick top in the same color with a little compass in it. So you
[02:07:31.200 --> 02:07:38.240]   can actually use as a walking stick. It's 70 bucks, which is a $65, which is not terribly cheap. But
[02:07:38.240 --> 02:07:44.560]   again, it's not a $300 monopod, which you can get. It's also not a $10 monopod on Amazon, where
[02:07:44.560 --> 02:07:49.520]   it's just going to fold in half. And it's not going to be as compact. And it's not going to be as easy to
[02:07:49.520 --> 02:07:55.120]   extend and put it back again. The only the only warning is that it really is designed, is sold
[02:07:55.120 --> 02:08:00.400]   as a monopod, which means that it comes with nothing to attach your camera to just like a quarter
[02:08:00.400 --> 02:08:07.680]   inch post. And so go on Amazon or anywhere else and you can get a decent head for anywhere from
[02:08:07.680 --> 02:08:12.880]   five bucks, which will work fine too. A nicer one, this like 20 or $25 that has this one has a quick
[02:08:12.880 --> 02:08:17.680]   release plate and you can pivot it and then lock it down. So it's there are still times when I like
[02:08:17.680 --> 02:08:22.720]   to travel with a tripod. But this is now this is my solution for I don't know if I'm going to
[02:08:22.720 --> 02:08:27.840]   want a tripod or not. So we'll just take this with me. And the other and the last thing the last
[02:08:27.840 --> 02:08:33.600]   reason to have it is that I don't want it. I don't I could die. You can be hit by a bus at any moment.
[02:08:33.600 --> 02:08:39.360]   I do not want it to be said that ever bought a selfie stick. However, however, you can use this
[02:08:39.360 --> 02:08:47.120]   as a selfie stick without saying that no, no, no, this is this is my me photo professional monopod.
[02:08:47.120 --> 02:08:51.840]   I'm a selfie stick. Even though I'm using it, I'm working with like, hey, look, I'm a cyclist.
[02:08:51.840 --> 02:08:59.120]   I'm a major fan of monopods. They're really much more convenient. There's they can go places that
[02:08:59.120 --> 02:09:04.400]   tripods can't go as you say. And they're also again, they're times where I've extended it because
[02:09:04.400 --> 02:09:09.040]   I wanted to get like I'm taking pictures of a monument that I really a piece of public
[02:09:09.040 --> 02:09:13.840]   sculpture that I like outside in a park and the as I realized that, wait a minute, I can just extend
[02:09:13.840 --> 02:09:19.920]   this and now be get the shot like six feet higher than my eye line. I can actually get a portrait
[02:09:19.920 --> 02:09:24.160]   of that face. So this has been one of the against it's this is one of those purchases that really,
[02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:27.680]   really worked out for me very, very happy with that. It's not even that expensive either. Nice.
[02:09:27.680 --> 02:09:34.720]   Renee Richie, you're gonna live up to your reputation here, I think. Yeah, no, just add anything.
[02:09:34.720 --> 02:09:38.480]   If you're like a gorilla, blogger, reviewer, and you've got to shoot your video in public places where
[02:09:38.480 --> 02:09:43.120]   tripods are illegal, they often do not have laws against monopods. You right, you they can't say
[02:09:43.120 --> 02:09:48.560]   anything to use those. So they're terrific. Just add one post script also,
[02:09:48.560 --> 02:09:52.240]   there are rules against them, but what they really don't want what there's it's really against
[02:09:52.240 --> 02:09:59.120]   is you like being disruptive. Even if there's a rule against against monopods, it's like there
[02:09:59.120 --> 02:10:04.240]   was I've had situations where the the guard or whatever will see you like I'm it's extended in
[02:10:04.240 --> 02:10:09.280]   10 seconds in like five seconds. I got my shot. It's again away in another three seconds. So they're
[02:10:09.280 --> 02:10:15.280]   like, okay, I don't need to interfere. He's not the time they come to hassle you. You've already
[02:10:15.280 --> 02:10:19.440]   got to put away. And I got this big piece of steel in my hand. So that's good. Sorry.
[02:10:19.440 --> 02:10:25.040]   In honor of the Apple Watch's anniversary, I thought I would be I'd live up to this stereotype. I
[02:10:25.040 --> 02:10:29.600]   would own the cliche and I did Apple's fitness challenge. They did Earth Day Fitness Challenge,
[02:10:29.600 --> 02:10:34.080]   and I mistakenly wore a yellow leather band and it was just not the best thing. Yeah, I just I
[02:10:34.080 --> 02:10:39.120]   went out so eager before thinking about it. So Apple now sells the Nike plus band
[02:10:39.120 --> 02:10:43.520]   separately. So you can get them in black and gold, which is green color. You can get them in
[02:10:43.520 --> 02:10:48.160]   anthracite and black, which is like a dark charcoal gray and black. And you can get them in this one,
[02:10:48.160 --> 02:10:53.120]   which is off white and white. I think it's platinum and white is the official terminology.
[02:10:53.120 --> 02:10:59.040]   Which one looks best on this ceramic? Oh, this one. Yeah, the platinum white. Just it's like less.
[02:10:59.040 --> 02:11:02.640]   What do we say last time? It's like not less Nesbine, but the other character from WKRP. Yes.
[02:11:02.640 --> 02:11:10.560]   Turb, garlic, but in watch form. Oh my god, it is. It's just a really I like it. It's a very clean,
[02:11:10.560 --> 02:11:14.960]   it's very it's a very nice look at matches the ceramic perfectly, but the black one is really
[02:11:14.960 --> 02:11:18.800]   great too. And they're all they're exactly like the sports bands. But the sports bands would
[02:11:18.800 --> 02:11:23.200]   sometimes get sweaty and because these are perforated, it gives you a lot more breathability. And it
[02:11:23.200 --> 02:11:28.640]   just makes for a really interesting look. I'm really sold on it. So yeah, all it needs a Hello Kitty
[02:11:28.640 --> 02:11:32.080]   sticker. And I think you've got something there. I'm Kelly. I'm going to call you right after
[02:11:32.880 --> 02:11:37.200]   the if it were red and white. If there were a make you plus red and white, right there,
[02:11:37.200 --> 02:11:43.680]   right there, white white, orange and white, so many opportunities. And as usual for
[02:11:43.680 --> 02:11:51.520]   $49 Apple gets a premium price for it's and they have they have fake sweat every day just
[02:11:51.520 --> 02:11:58.880]   to make sure doesn't your fake sweat to know every day just to know. Thank you boy and girl.
[02:11:58.880 --> 02:12:03.600]   It's been a lot of fun Renee Richie's at imore.com. He's great podcast there and
[02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:11.920]   it all is right writing and just good stuff. imore.com Apple talk the podcast and others.
[02:12:11.920 --> 02:12:15.600]   The next 10 words we changed the name on you. Just oh that's right. Next 10 words.
[02:12:15.600 --> 02:12:19.840]   Was there did Apple send you a cease and desistors on? No, not at all. We just wanted to go beyond
[02:12:19.840 --> 02:12:22.400]   Apple. So this week we have Matthew Panzarino on talking about the
[02:12:22.400 --> 02:12:28.000]   Oh, nice. Fragmentation of messaging apps. And he was also at that event at that five person
[02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:31.600]   Well, that was the whole thing is that like Apple Apple called a mulligan on that. What
[02:12:31.600 --> 02:12:35.840]   will be next call a mulligan on cross platform iMessage test screen maps. I mean the max I mean
[02:12:35.840 --> 02:12:39.280]   there's a whole possibilities. Oh cross message message iMessage would be
[02:12:39.280 --> 02:12:43.920]   cross platform iMessage would be fantastic. I'm waiting for that because Google's just dropped
[02:12:43.920 --> 02:12:48.080]   the ball completely. Or as Ben Behair and said Windows only not for Android but we'll do it for
[02:12:48.080 --> 02:12:54.000]   Winters. Yeah, maybe Andy and I coach Chicago's son. Time's always a slice. Are you working on
[02:12:54.000 --> 02:13:00.160]   anything for the times? Yeah, finally getting around reviewing the MacBook Pro. So basically
[02:13:00.160 --> 02:13:08.560]   basically savoring. I got no problem with that because I really think these thoughtful
[02:13:08.560 --> 02:13:13.920]   launch most people who are going to buy the new MacBook Pro haven't bought it yet. So it's
[02:13:13.920 --> 02:13:19.600]   really good to have those thoughtful well well design well research. It's been something that
[02:13:19.600 --> 02:13:24.720]   I've actually been working on for several months because I wanted to really stress test my conclusions.
[02:13:24.720 --> 02:13:31.840]   And your editors must be very tolerant. Yeah, they've pretty much I've broken their spirits to
[02:13:31.840 --> 02:13:37.040]   this stage that they've given up and they're just well checked do a spell check make sure that I
[02:13:37.040 --> 02:13:45.680]   don't mention any name brands those. Okay, I like it. Which also so I'd like to add so I'll
[02:13:45.680 --> 02:13:51.040]   probably be looking for a new columnist position. I'd say in two weeks time. No, no, no, no.
[02:13:51.040 --> 02:13:56.400]   Again, anybody got a slot open? Well, you'd be quite a catch for anybody.
[02:13:56.400 --> 02:13:59.760]   Thank you, Andrew. Well, thank you. I do keep in shape.
[02:13:59.760 --> 02:14:05.760]   I might see we're going out. Well, maybe we're not going out. I don't know.
[02:14:05.760 --> 02:14:12.160]   But we got a webby for triangulation. But then I've all worked Leo. Thank you. Carsten has just
[02:14:12.160 --> 02:14:17.280]   told me that I have to come up with a five word. It's a competition to see you guys on stage with
[02:14:17.280 --> 02:14:22.320]   the person with the best acceptance speech. I said it. I said it before the show. I will now
[02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:28.640]   say it on the public record again by a $2,000 Kylo Ren costume wear to the show and your speeches.
[02:14:28.640 --> 02:14:33.600]   This costume is now tax deductible. Perfect. And you will have it and you will have a
