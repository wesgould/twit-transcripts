[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   We're back, Sam.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   That was my best.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   This is as close as I get to Leo.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   I started and then I was like, you know, I'm not going to be Leo.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   This is Mac Break Weekly.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   And Leo is in Tasmania.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Hopefully not spending too much.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   And of course we have the regular folks.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   We're here still holding down the fort.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Andy, Anako?
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Andy?
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Hello, Alex.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Hello.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   I suggest you need a better catchphrase to open these shows with when you host.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   When I host?
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Yes.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   This is...
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   This is...
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   It's Mac Break Weekly!
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Hey, how about that?
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Hey, Alex, come at you off the power of the Internet.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Everybody, shut up.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   I'm Alex Lindsay.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   I've got unlimited bandwidth of love and it's all for you here, Mac Break Weekly.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   It's done another week.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Hey, we've got Andy Anako here.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Andy, how you doing today?
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   That sounds much better.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   I think I'll use that next one.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Now who's gorging with the sports?
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Merlin Mann here also.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Hey, Merlin.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Everybody, shut up.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Hi, Alex.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   How are you?
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   I just think it's a great catchphrase.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Alex, everybody, shut up.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   I like that.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   It comes out and comes out fluently.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   I do wonderfully well.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Thank you for leading the show this week.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Oh, it's truly, truly my pleasure.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   I haven't done this for a while.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   I feel a little uncomfortable.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   I want other shows, but this one, I'm a little nervous, a little nervous.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Also here, Scott Born.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   He's got...
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   He can't take on different facets of Leo's role.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Like one of us can be distracted reading the Internet while others are talking.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Evidently, I guess there's a drinking game now related to when Leo is surfing the web during
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Mac Break Weekly.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   I didn't mean to interrupt your introduction to Scott.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Yes, we should talk about the drinking game, but I'm sorry I interrupted you.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Scott?
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.520]   I am here and thank you for welcoming me.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.000]   I do want to point out that you host 16 podcasts and you start each and every one.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   I'm the same with "Hey, everybody."
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   I know.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Well, that's me saying hello.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   That's all.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   It's just...
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Hi, everybody.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   We're here.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   We're hanging out.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   That's just the way I...
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   I've been doing that for 15 years.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   I've been doing that for 15 years.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   If I were listening only to the first 10 or 15 seconds while you were cooking media or
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.560]   Twitch, I could just pick one at random and it would be the same show.
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.560]   So I agree with Merlin and Andy.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.240]   You should start with everybody shut up.
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.240]   Everybody shut up.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.040]   Beyond a Twitch, you could say put a sock in it instead or sit on it.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.120]   Like from Happy Days.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.560]   Yes, or I could say...
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.560]   I can't say that.
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:18.160]   You're still a dingy from Alice.
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.560]   For the millions of French-speaking people in our audience, you could say famine.com.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.080]   For the Zimbabwean listeners, I could say...
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.080]   Sorry.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.840]   But that's okay.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.840]   Alice, that's okay.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.000]   If you need to go to the Wikipedia to find out what you would say in Zimbabwe...
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   No, no.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.680]   For some reason, I say it a lot actually.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.920]   And for the one time that I actually have to say it here, I forgot what I was gonna say.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.200]   You tell people in Zimbabwe to shut up your brave.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.200]   I don't say shut up.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.200]   I say mukasay.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.200]   And then they say dumukka.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.200]   Then I say kana mukka.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.720]   And then we go on to our business.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.800]   So anyway, that's a whole other story.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.760]   We've got all kinds of fun stuff coming up here.
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.680]   Now once again, we have a drinking game now that everyone can take part in.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.320]   This has been set up.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.160]   This was on the delicious list of...
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.280]   Everyone gets to drink when Leo is surfing the web.
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.760]   So we can prepare for this when Leo gets back.
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.200]   Does anyone have any specific drinks that they suggest?
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.480]   I think you're basic gin and tonic with beefyater gin.
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.600]   Well, when they do it, they've got a...
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.800]   If you follow the link, they've got a whole hierarchy.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.400]   So there's a one drink, two drink, three drink, five drink.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.400]   Right.
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.560]   So I mean, there's some typical foods.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.600]   Whenever we talk about our kids, you take a drink.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.600]   Right.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.520]   Obviously, Chris Breen's hair gets a drink.
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.520]   You move further up the ladder.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.520]   You get to...
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.520]   Somebody says they're out there.
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.520]   You play the rat hole theme.
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.560]   Well, I think the interesting thing is that this is really a great opportunity to get totally
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.280]   hammered while listening to Macbreak.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.520]   I was going to say, because today is actually...
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.360]   We're taping on Wednesday, so this is new comic book day.
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.280]   So if I mentioned the first issue of bramichael bennison is secret invasion, then now lots
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.760]   of people are having two drinks.
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.200]   So I don't want to get alcohol poisoning.
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.160]   This isn't spring break time, but every 15 minutes during this podcast, I'm going to
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.560]   try to make a comic book reference so that by the end of the hour, hour and a half, you
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.520]   will have injected eight drinks of hard alcohol.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.880]   My gift to you, Macbreak weekly listeners, as my thanks for being devoted listeners.
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.960]   I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves also, but I don't know if you guys saw a link
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.280]   because I can't find the link right now, but somewhere there was a guy who made a backpack
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.280]   out of a Mac SC.
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.280]   I don't know if you saw that this week.
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.000]   That's been around, hasn't it?
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.040]   That's been floating around for a little while, hasn't it?
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.040]   That's two drinks.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.040]   Two drinks.
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.040]   There you go.
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.040]   Nice.
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.360]   None of that counts because that was all inorganic.
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.240]   That was all right.
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:44.680]   That shouldn't count.
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:51.280]   Now there is, to get to some of the actual news, there appears to be a iPhone shortage.
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.120]   Scott, do you have any inside tips related to this?
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.360]   Well, we've been hearing about it for a month or so.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.240]   I don't think that it means the 3G phone is going to ship next week or anything like
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.240]   that.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.000]   I still think from what I understand, the information that I've received is that Apple
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:14.560]   still has to file a FCC application to use the new phone because it contains additional
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.360]   radio, a new radio, a different radio, which means it has to be cleared.
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.880]   And until we see that, I don't think we'll see a phone.
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.880]   Everything we see is looking at like June perhaps.
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.600]   So it could just be strong demand.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:36.800]   Recently, in my opinion, somewhat happy analyst was predicting a 45 million iPhone sales number
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.800]   next year.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:45.120]   As an iPhone fan, I think that number is a little, let's just say, the optimistic.
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.320]   But I think there are strong sales everywhere and I think that that's probably most of it.
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.320]   I don't think we're going to see the phone next week, although I'd be thrilled if we
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.520]   did just because it gives us something to talk about over at the Apple phone show.
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.480]   Do we think the main thing that we're going to see is of course the support for the SDK
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.040]   and the 3G.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.920]   Is there anything else that we really think is going to be coming with this with any kind
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.200]   of update if there an update does occur?
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.200]   The thinner phone, that's what one of the things people are talking about because they're
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.960]   going to change the glass.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.120]   But, you know, I'm kind of glad that it's the thickness it is.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.800]   I dropped it like four times in one day last week.
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.560]   And just like I've never dropped it before.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.360]   In fact, I said it to someone like two days before, you know, never actually dropped it.
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.960]   I don't really know whether it'll survive or not.
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:31.240]   And I dropped it on soft surfaces, hard surfaces, the pavement.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.840]   And I had a different shirt on it.
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.600]   I put it in my front pocket and it doesn't have a little flap on it.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:41.400]   And it turns out when you bend over it, you know, it just shoots right out.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.880]   It's smooth.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.040]   It slides right out like I like a bullet out of a gun.
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.320]   It really does.
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.120]   And it's surprising how many times it'll bounce.
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:52.520]   You know, I was I was I thought that there might be a little rubber in there given the
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:53.520]   number.
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.520]   So I just broke my first case.
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:58.800]   This case that I liked a lot that just, you know, the fatigue of taking it in and out of
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.160]   the pocket for the kind of work down.
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:05.040]   And I'm very nervous now walking around with it kind of nude like that.
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.040]   I have it now.
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:11.280]   I gotta say, you got to put something like, you know, one of those film transfer things
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.320]   on it like invisible shield or there's two.
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.320]   I got that on the front.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.320]   I've got that on.
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.320]   I've got that on the glass.
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.320]   I just I feel like I don't want to Alex's bounce theory.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:23.760]   Like I'm surprised that maybe I just take better care of my toys and you guys do, but
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:28.600]   I don't have I actually have it encased in a in a chassis case with those clear acrylic
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.600]   like plastic cases really cool.
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:34.360]   But I did not put the film on the front of it because every time I put every time I tried
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.640]   putting film on one of these devices, it looks great for a couple days.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.760]   And then there's some sort of like a bubble or a wet spot on it.
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.760]   And then there's some sort of piece of dust underneath it.
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:46.400]   And I'm looking at essentially like a fridge photo that my mom put on her fridge 12 years
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:51.600]   ago, you know, I'm much I'm still using my original iPhone from, you know, six months
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.600]   ago.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.960]   And it's still looks, you know, salon perfect.
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.160]   Well mine mine's not any kind of case at all, but I did use I guess, rad tech.
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.480]   I think ships with some of the stuff I was testing, rad tech ships, some of one of those
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:07.120]   films and it worked remarkably well, except now it looks like I keep on looking at going,
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.440]   Oh my gosh, look what I did to the glass.
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:13.200]   And then I realized, yeah, how did we turn into like our grandparents?
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.400]   Remember that you'd spend your Sunday, your grandparents house and if she let you sit
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.600]   on the sofa, it would be covered in plastic.
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:22.440]   Your tough skins got on the actual original upholstery.
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.440]   Exactly.
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.720]   Everybody everybody at my church had that.
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.680]   So I assumed it was a sacrament of some kind.
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:28.920]   I never understood like you had to have the plastic.
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:33.160]   I am the thing that I'm curious about not to get on a rat hole, but did you guys see
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:37.760]   the thing that came out that gives you like a when you're using the phone, you get like
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.000]   tactile kind of feedback from it?
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.360]   Did you see that the case?
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.360]   It vibrates.
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.320]   Oh man, I should really read things before I get on the show.
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.320]   No, it's case.
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:51.000]   And it's got a very slight I think it's got a very slight like rubbery.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.760]   So like when you're when you're typing numbers on it, for example, you get kind of feedback
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:55.760]   from it.
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.360]   I will go that feedback.
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.360]   It's not like a we.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:03.960]   That sounds like a grad student who's been overthinking the problem.
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:08.200]   But if there's a one kind of buzz when there's numbers, another kind of buzz when there's
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:12.200]   letters, that means that we could train the brain to just keep going on.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.800]   So you get the grant money and now now, you know, congratulations.
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:18.400]   You got $30,000 from the National Endowment of the Arts and Sciences, but you actually
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.400]   produce a really wonderfully unmarketable product.
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:25.200]   Now it now it does turn out though, that's important though, because most iPhone users,
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:29.760]   according to a new study, they're young and rich.
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.600]   That appears halfway there.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.360]   I've got the other half relatively speaking, Scott.
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.840]   So we're covered.
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.400]   I don't think I have either.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:45.200]   So they sampled 460 iPhone users and they said that that half are under 30.
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:49.080]   So there's still another half there for the rest of us.
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.080]   And that's the price.
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.560]   See, that seems high to me.
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.560]   That half are under 30?
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.600]   Yeah, doesn't that seem like a lot of dough for somebody under 30?
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:59.240]   Oh, everyone's had a Christmas and most of them have had a birthday since the last two.
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.240]   You're right.
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.240]   Right.
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.240]   You're going to have a sing.
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.240]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, I guess I could see that.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.240]   My son is asking for one.
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.240]   I just don't know.
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.240]   He's 10 years old.
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:12.240]   I'm like, you know, I was like, we'll see.
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:19.160]   But so half are under 30, tech savvy and besides telephony primarily use the device for email,
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.520]   texting and web browsing.
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:25.440]   So that's the, but it seems that they're much more sophisticated.
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.920]   And I guess this is in some ways, maybe this is the cross where rim, where iPhone different
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:34.280]   is itself from rim because I bet you rim has a much higher percentage of users that are
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.040]   older than 30.
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.320]   What do you think?
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.320]   I would say definitely.
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.320]   Yeah.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.920]   I would say that's a very much a business device in my mind.
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:43.920]   Yeah.
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.760]   The difference between the blackberry and the iPhone is that the iPhones would you buy for
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:50.720]   yourself and the blackberry is what people buy what company buys for you.
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:51.960]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.440]   This is what you're going to use.
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.160]   So now do you guys use blackberries?
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.040]   I have one in my test bed system and I use it when I have to test something, but I don't
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:04.640]   want to have a voluntary choice of what phone is never the blackberry.
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.640]   I see it.
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.440]   I think about using it.
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.440]   It's cool.
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:13.480]   What it does is really if all you're about is keeping on top of email, I do think it's
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:16.600]   better than the iPhone probably just because of its enterprise features.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.760]   But in terms of the one device that can rule them all, I mean, that's not the thing that
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.080]   I'm putting in my pocket.
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.920]   What are we going to say?
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.440]   Yeah, you're just going to say, I mean, it's something where it's very interesting to me
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:30.280]   because the somebody who's a little bit of an observer of how people use email, I'm interested
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.440]   in the patterns for how people use these different devices.
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:38.400]   And I mean, I think it's not a completely unfair stereotype that blackberry people
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:42.880]   are on it for a very high heavy usage of email.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.560]   And for that, really, as that kind of, I only spend more time with this than I have, but
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.720]   it strikes me that it's a device that's very well suited for that purpose.
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:53.200]   When I watch people use blackberries, they're very adept at it.
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.200]   You know what I mean?
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.440]   They use it a lot and they get really good at it.
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.440]   It's part of...
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.960]   Yes, it is.
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:00.960]   It's very much...
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:04.040]   You see people who it's just like their default thing to be doing.
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:08.920]   You know, if there's any spare moment, they're not required to pretend to be looking at something
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:09.920]   else.
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:10.920]   No, I have a question.
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.160]   How long do you guys keep your iPhone on Wi-Fi?
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.480]   Do you guys use the Wi-Fi feature that much?
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:16.680]   I use it every day.
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:17.680]   Every day.
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:23.840]   I've gotten really parsimonious about which, for example, I've deleted the AP called LinkSIS
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:26.720]   because I so often get nothing out of that.
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:30.480]   And I do ask for approval before I join networks.
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:34.960]   But since I'm at home so much, yeah, I'm on a network a lot.
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:35.960]   But when I go out, not much.
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.000]   In fact, it really gets in my way to play the truth.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.680]   I almost wish I could say, stop asking me.
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:45.440]   Sometimes I have done this, shut off the wireless because when you've only got a second at
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.240]   Castro Station, you know what I mean?
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:51.280]   In your underground, you've got a second to check something and you get an AP popping
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.280]   up.
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.280]   Well, that's...
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:54.280]   I leave mine off most of the time.
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.600]   Andy, Andy, do you leave it on?
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:00.120]   Actually, I try to remember to turn it off whenever I leave the house or whenever I'm
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.040]   not in a really good trusted location.
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:05.920]   I mean, I was just going to say that the bane of my existence is Brookline, Massachusetts,
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.320]   which is a wonderful, wonderful little town.
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:12.440]   And they had this half-hearted attempt a year ago to wire up the entire town with free
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.440]   Wi-Fi for everybody.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:17.240]   Then they realized that, oh, wait, if we charge people like 80 bucks per month for it, we
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.520]   would get 80 bucks a month.
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:21.760]   So as a result, every time I'm back in Brookline, it keeps...
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.120]   I try to get my email, sort of getting my email.
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:27.960]   It says, "Hi, we'd like to join Brookline free Wi-Fi only $80 a month.
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.680]   It's like, no, I want my email.
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.120]   Please just keep it on the edge connection."
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.840]   So yeah, I'm with you.
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.800]   Wi-Fi is great.
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:40.840]   I've trained myself to only turn it on for a specific purpose, then turn it off later.
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:46.000]   Well, I've also found that when it's looking for Wi-Fi and when the Wi-Fi is on, my battery
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.760]   life is probably half of what it is.
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.960]   Yeah, that's one thing to point out.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:55.800]   If you're connected to Wi-Fi versus looking for Wi-Fi, you have...
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:56.800]   Oh, really?
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:57.800]   Yeah.
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:58.800]   ...and battery results.
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:05.720]   Now, I'm mostly at home or at the office where I have Wi-Fi networks that are secure.
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.920]   I connect to those and stay connected and I get all day battery life.
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:13.920]   But if I'm out driving around and forget to turn the Wi-Fi off, then I do experience
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:17.360]   heavy battery usage because it's constantly seeking.
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.360]   Andy is reading Andy's columns.
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:24.120]   It's taught me to be a little bit more nervous about where I Wi-Fi.
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:29.440]   So I try to be a little more careful than I used to in the old days, but I don't store
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:34.440]   anything on my iPhone that I wouldn't want the world to see anyway.
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:40.720]   So, Netarathol, do you guys have the locking on?
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:41.720]   Yeah.
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:42.720]   Yeah.
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:43.720]   I do.
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:44.720]   Yeah.
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.080]   You mean to type in a password or open it?
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.920]   Yeah, the four-digit, the four-digit lock.
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:49.920]   Absolutely.
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:50.920]   Me too.
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:51.920]   I know so many people who don't.
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:57.320]   You thought for one second about all the stuff you're automatically logged into on your iPhone.
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.320]   It's mind-blowing.
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.320]   Yeah, I've not so much that.
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.640]   I just want to deny the thief the right to use the phone.
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:05.880]   I would lose the phone in a heartbeat rather than losing all my stuff that's on there,
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:06.880]   like this access that gives.
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:07.880]   I don't know.
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:09.920]   I'm probably just a raving paranoia about that stuff.
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:10.920]   No, I'd...
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.880]   Actually, I would like more than four dishes.
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:13.880]   [laughter]
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:18.000]   Well, I have to admit that habit for me started.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:24.760]   I forgot my trio in the Las Vegas airport charging.
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:28.720]   What was amazing was that I actually got it back.
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:32.560]   I called Southwest and they...
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:37.520]   I was sitting there, I was text messaging with someone.
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:41.160]   Suddenly, I'd mentioned that I had lost my iPhone, or not my iPhone, my trio, and he
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.080]   goes, "I know where your phone is."
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.560]   I was like, "How do you know where my phone is?"
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:46.520]   He goes, "Because Southwest called me on it."
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:51.480]   So they literally Southwest found my phone and started calling numbers until they got
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:55.200]   to somebody who could tell me that my phone was missing.
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:17:01.920]   They FedExed it back to me, but I was terrified by the idea that my phone with all the information
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:05.880]   that my trio had, which is a lot more than my iPhone has, would be sitting there floating
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:07.440]   around.
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:13.480]   I've left less on my phone, and then also I definitely locked that bad boy up.
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:18.800]   Another good reason to use one password, because now one password works on the iPhone.
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.440]   You use it, Scott?
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:27.120]   You know, several people in my office do, but I don't know how to use it in my morning.
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:29.520]   Pretty much one password, which we've pimped a million times on here.
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:33.200]   It's just a good app for basically a work with Kichai.
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:37.360]   All the people in my office swear by it, but they're all younger and smarter than me.
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:40.840]   Well, all it takes is one fairly easy password.
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:45.040]   It's a little extra layer of protection, but you've ever had to re-type in a really long
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:47.720]   password, especially when you're holding a kid in one hand.
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.040]   It's a huge pain in the butt.
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.040]   I'm there with you.
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:52.040]   Yeah, it's really good.
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:55.920]   I decided, so the funny part was that I said this before, but I got into using the really
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:59.600]   crazy strong passwords once I started using one password, because it will generate like
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:04.080]   a 30 character password for you and then remember it for you.
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.800]   Got whoa, but tied you if you have to type that in manually.
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.720]   That's the reason why, though.
[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:15.080]   I've been trying to train myself not to use these automated password systems.
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:20.440]   Even I'm trying to wean myself off slightly use of the key chain in the OS 10 chiefly
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:26.640]   because I had to drag out a computer that was three, four years old out of storage to
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.640]   set up for my sister.
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:31.200]   Of course, there's a system password on there that I've completely forgotten because I probably
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:34.480]   only entered it and manually like two or three times.
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:40.120]   I was able to dig it back up again after driving 40 minutes back for my sister's house back
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:48.080]   to my place because I have a full proof password system that lets me assign really, really
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:52.280]   tough to guess passwords that are easy for me to recover without leaving a list anywhere.
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:54.280]   I have to like.
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:57.560]   No, there's there's I'll tell you this.
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:01.560]   There used to be there's there's usual I can share the secrets I've published it and also
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:04.200]   it won't tell you anything.
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:08.240]   There's always one book in my office that generates all my passwords a month ago.
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:14.160]   It was like the 1978 edition of the prime time guide to television.
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:19.600]   And so essentially I know that the password has to be some TV show that debuted in 1977
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.120]   the book the year this was published.
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.640]   So I just simply flipped through flip through and to take guesses until.
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.640]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:29.040]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, because there was a Jack Klugman pilot his first show after after the
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:30.040]   odd couple.
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.040]   Maybe that's it.
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.040]   Yes, there it is.
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.040]   And that's the one.
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:36.560]   So but if I'm just afraid that if I use one of these strong password generators, we really
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:40.720]   solve a lot of security problems, but I would find myself like if I have a phone that I
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:43.720]   was using for like a couple of weeks, then put it away for a month, then came back and
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.440]   like, Oh, gosh, you like it.
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.440]   Right.
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:51.560]   I don't even use the I have to admit that I also don't use the password system on the
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:57.920]   iPhone because this is a this is an anthropological problem for me that I will use it and I'll
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.840]   prep myself on the back for being secure.
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.960]   But then the fourth and fifth time I'm just I'm in a report thinking, Oh, dang it.
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:06.360]   I just want to know what my flight is, but I have to type in a four digit password before
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:07.360]   I can find it.
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.200]   You know, I'm just going to turn this off just for this trip.
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.480]   I'll turn it right back on again.
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:11.680]   And then I never turn it back on again.
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:12.680]   Right.
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:13.680]   I can't wait.
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:14.680]   I can go.
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:19.080]   I can top all these and my password is my Albert's and grocery card number because I
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:24.160]   figure that's the one number nobody can actually ever remember that they own.
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:30.320]   So so attention all users who work for Albert's and we can now get in the Scott's apartment
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:31.320]   and Scott's computer.
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:32.600]   Let me tell you that's that's better.
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:33.600]   My old password system.
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:37.680]   I mean, as I've been getting a little bit, you know, grayer of hair, these passwords
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:38.840]   are hard to remember.
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:44.520]   So I went to simple ones like one and then I moved to two and then I changed to three.
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:48.000]   The best one I've heard if you're if you're only going to if you just want to try one
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.280]   thing that makes you a little more secure.
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:53.040]   And I mean, you'd be amazed if you see the stats on people who are still doing, you know,
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:55.080]   dictionary words, it's mind boggling.
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.960]   I mean, at least do something like what I was going to say, land Andy based on what you
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.760]   were saying is come up with a sense.
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:05.640]   Like you could go if you said something like my favorite actor on happy days in 1978 was
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.440]   Donnie most.
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:11.880]   Some kind of a sentence that like is just very weird, but you would never forget.
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:17.440]   You type the first letter and numeral of that sentence and you got a pretty good password.
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:21.000]   I mean, that's kind of it's not the most secure thing in the world.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.040]   But I mean, if you're doing a mix and if you do some mix add in a little bit of punctuation,
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:27.000]   you come up with a pretty good password based on.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.840]   It really does depend on me there are garbage passwords that I have just for message boards
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:35.080]   that require me to register before I can like post anything and I'm only going to use it
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:36.640]   once or twice a month.
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:40.920]   If you if you guess one password, you will get access to about 10 different message boards
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.160]   that I never ever use.
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:47.160]   However, but then if you want to go into my online banking, that is 48 characters and
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:51.960]   it is almost a completely random sequence of digits and numbers because it is a combination
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:53.640]   of five different sequences.
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:59.520]   So if there's a big payoff to having a good 48 character totally random password, then
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.520]   you should go for it.
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:04.480]   But it's okay to have a sliding scale of security to pay somewhat.
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:08.240]   I worry about the I don't know what you call it kind of the Dr. Strangela scenario where
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:15.040]   you like worry about like one MySQL crash because the problem is when people assume
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:19.320]   this like that everything will always be secure on everything they do and the trouble
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:23.840]   is it's kind of the opposite where like the weak link could really expose you.
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.080]   Well, that's why I think that I don't use this.
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:26.080]   I don't use heavy.
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.800]   I mean, I don't use the same pod.
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:32.080]   I do the kind of the similar to what Andy does where I have, you know, there are certain
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:35.840]   passwords that I use for things that I just don't think are that important, you know,
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:39.880]   that that's fine or a lot of some is that would be compromised doesn't also.
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.640]   No, no, that doesn't those are completely sequestered from everything else.
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.840]   I mean, those are just like me, you know, it's required.
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:47.120]   I just have to be able to remember what it is.
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:51.240]   Now, a lot of times I'll use the, you know, the, I mean, a lot of times I'll use some kind
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:54.680]   of dare derivation of the website that I'm on.
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:57.440]   If it's like something totally stupid, like you're kind of like, why are they asking me
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.640]   for a password kind of thing?
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:02.560]   You know, like the New York Times, I really don't care what my password is for the New
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:03.560]   York Times.
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:07.720]   You know, so I have a username and then I have my password is the New York Times.
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:10.560]   You know, it's like, you know, it doesn't, you know, with a bunch of a couple of things
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:14.280]   added to it, but it's, but the main thing is is that I don't need to, I just remember
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:17.040]   what it is because I don't understand why they're asking for that in the first place.
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:20.040]   So then it's more important to them that it's correct than me.
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.720]   You know, I'm not doing anything in there.
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.920]   And it's probably a good idea for me to mention that I'm using these passwords just
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:29.840]   on things like the jinksworld.com, a comic book based website.
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:34.760]   So for instance, when Brian and Michael Bendis was in the middle of doing stuff for the
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:40.800]   New Avengers, which ended issue number 37 just two months ago, then, you know, for discussion
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:43.920]   on that, I don't care if people that can read what I've been posting there.
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:47.040]   And chiefly the reason why I bring it up is to give people a chance to get another two
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.040]   genotonics.
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:49.040]   Again, yes.
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:50.040]   Nice.
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.040]   Very well done.
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:54.360]   You squeeze one lime and you get the juice right and there being to begin with.
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:58.160]   The other one just sort of diffuses the juice into the tank array or the, or the, over the
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.160]   beef eater James.
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:01.440]   Now, speaking of security and then we'll end security now, Mac.
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.480]   I was going to say Mac version here.
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:04.480]   Yeah.
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:11.760]   The, uh, is did you see that the, that a Mac book air was, was seized in two minutes flat.
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:12.920]   Wow.
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.080]   So this was, this was a hacking contest.
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:16.080]   Yeah.
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:17.080]   Yeah.
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:23.120]   At the, the, uh, uh, the canned sec West, um, you know, so they, uh, so they had a, they,
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:29.840]   they could choose whether it was, uh, I believe Linux, uh, Vista or, or OS X and this and
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:35.560]   uh, Charlie Miller, um, who I guess used to work at the NSA, um, hacked through this,
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:36.800]   uh, in about two minutes.
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:40.520]   And he said this was the easiest one to, as far as he was concerned.
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:41.520]   Yeah.
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:42.640]   They got in through quick time, didn't they?
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:43.640]   They got through safari.
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:44.640]   Oh, safari.
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:45.640]   We came in through safari.
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:46.640]   Yeah.
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:49.680]   No one ever, every, every exploit seems to either you hit a safari or quick time and it's
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:51.400]   always really, really quick.
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:52.400]   Unfortunately, frightening.
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.720]   And it was, it was clicking a link.
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:55.800]   Is that what it was?
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:59.040]   Um, he was, he won't say it was like, well, there was, there was sort of like a, a, a
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:03.080]   multi stages to this contest on the first day they gave you nothing.
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.840]   There's just some machine on the internet, somewhere on the network and you have to find
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:06.840]   it and get at it.
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:11.640]   The second one you were allowed to, the second day you were allowed to email somebody a link
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:13.520]   or get tricked somebody to clicking a link.
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:18.320]   The third day, I believe that they opened it up to like to, like for secure files, sharing
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:19.320]   and that sort of thing.
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:20.720]   I believe that he got it on the very first day.
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:21.720]   No, no, it was second day.
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.240]   He couldn't, he didn't hack through it where the computers were just sitting in.
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.240]   No, no one won that.
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.240]   Okay.
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.240]   Okay.
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.240]   I think it was.
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.200]   So what, so it was tricking somebody into clicking the link that made something nasty
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:31.200]   happen to you.
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.200]   Right.
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:35.320]   And, and he, um, I guess he's, he's NDA according to the contest.
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:38.480]   They've reported what the bug was to Apple, but they're not going to tell everyone what
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.440]   it was.
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:43.000]   And then Apple fixes it.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.280]   That's what they said.
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:49.920]   So, so that's why, so that's why we've heard that big press release from Apple thanking
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.800]   those, this contest and announcing they fixed it.
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:52.960]   They patched it right already, right?
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:53.960]   We're waiting for it.
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.400]   We, I don't think we've done it yet.
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:56.400]   I don't know if they've done it yet.
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:59.760]   So, um, so what we can say is that it's been hacked and we don't know what it is.
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:03.960]   So, um, everyone use Firefox for the next two days and then we'll be, then we'll go back
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:05.600]   to our normally scheduled program.
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:11.480]   Now, did you see this, uh, you know, what, one thing that, uh, uh, you know, April Fools
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:17.320]   is April Fools, but it's also the, the birthday for Apple, you know, April one.
[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:22.600]   And this was the 32nd birthday, which I thought was very binary.
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:26.760]   Um, you know, I think that that's kind of like being, uh, that's like, what is it?
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.200]   It's like, it's like really being true.
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:34.640]   No, no, no, four in, um, uh, you know, kind of a binary sort of sense.
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:39.560]   So they, they, there was a, um, uh, so ours, technical had this great list.
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:42.920]   Did you guys see this list of the, of the 32 memorable Apple products?
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:48.160]   Yeah, I saw a list of what they consider to be the 32 memorable Apple.
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.320]   You disagree.
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:53.560]   Not necessarily, but I think it's a little, I mean, I don't know.
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:57.360]   I think that you could are, you could make arguments for and against individual ones.
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.120]   Yeah.
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:58.320]   Yeah.
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:01.760]   I mean, you know, I think some of these were, uh, um, not the ones that I would have
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:04.280]   considered, uh, in those, which ones would you have considered?
[00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:06.480]   I mean, the centrist 650 sucked.
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:07.440]   Yeah.
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.800]   I was, that was my first one to pop up at the mining.
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:11.440]   I was like, I had one of those.
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:14.400]   Well, the, the, uh, I mean, the 650 was fine.
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.160]   We had one.
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:19.640]   The, the real, the, what they missed were a handful of what I would consider classic.
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:26.320]   You know, not, not, not as in the app, Macintosh classic, but the classic, um, uh,
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:30.640]   computers, the, the 840 AV, I thought was a, oh, yeah, that was one of the best
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:32.320]   machines, you know, of its time.
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.840]   Um, uh, I think it was a very classic machine.
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:37.600]   I think that the, the two CI was also an AI.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:37.880]   Yeah.
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:38.400]   Yeah.
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:43.200]   I was going to say, um, and, and so the, those were just incredible machines that
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:46.400]   just, just hit the right mix of what you needed when you needed it.
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:51.240]   Um, that I, that I really felt like, um, you know, they should have, uh, um,
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:55.360]   I would have replaced some of these with, uh, with those also the power book,
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:56.720]   3400, I thought was,
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.320]   But what about, what about E world?
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:27:59.720]   E world.
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:00.600]   Yeah.
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:01.240]   I think that was.
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:02.320]   E world made the list.
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.520]   I think that was more of a, are you insane?
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.840]   I think that was, it was, it was memorable, but probably not.
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:07.760]   It was kind of memorable.
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:09.560]   It's a good thing for nostalgia.
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:10.680]   Exactly.
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.040]   Oh, those were the days.
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:13.400]   Macintosh TV.
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:14.120]   Come on.
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.920]   That was, I don't know.
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:16.520]   To me, I don't know.
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:16.880]   I have.
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.720]   I've blocked a lot of this out.
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:20.920]   For sure.
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:21.400]   It was cool.
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:23.520]   It was cool for for sheer freakishness.
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.880]   You have to, you have to give them credit for that.
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:25.480]   Yeah.
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:25.840]   Yeah.
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:28.480]   And the 20th anniversary Mac, you can't beat that one.
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:29.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:30.320]   So 10 grand.
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:31.840]   So, and it had a CD ROM.
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:32.680]   So, you know,
[00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:36.560]   And so it's like, so consumers, you either have a Macintosh for every room
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:39.520]   into your house, including the bathroom, or you could have this one.
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:44.640]   I mean, what was incredible was, is that there was that, that one point in time
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:48.600]   where there were so many Macatoches with so many minor changes in the, in the
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:53.960]   configuration right around the Macintosh TV era that I couldn't, I remember, I was
[00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:54.840]   going to buy one for my parents.
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:56.840]   I literally couldn't figure out which one to buy.
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:57.960]   Yeah.
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:01.880]   And we have to keep it on the list on the list of on the Wikipedia on the list of
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:04.040]   products discontinued by Apple Incorporated.
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:05.560]   I'm just coming up with bust.
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:07.160]   This is, this is just underperformers.
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:07.720]   Okay.
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:10.320]   You got the Macintosh performer, right?
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:10.800]   Right.
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:21.040]   The former 200, 252, 75, 400, 5, 4, 10, 4, 34, 54, 64, 66, 4, 67, 4, 75, 4, 76, 5, 25, 55, 65, 65, 75, 75, 75, 75, 75, 75, 75, 75, 75, 80,
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.880]   CD, 600 and 600 CD.
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:24.640]   This goes on.
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:24.880]   Yeah.
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:25.240]   There's more.
[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:26.600]   It was, it was the, it was the, I see.
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:29.760]   Oh, you got to remember, of course, the 52, 20 CD.
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:30.560]   That was the hell of a model.
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:35.120]   Like ordering from like a catalog of nuts and bolts.
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:35.360]   Yeah.
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:36.200]   You know, yeah.
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:39.920]   And, and, and, and fortunately, Steve came in to save us from all of that.
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:43.600]   So that was, you know, the, the, the, the list says memorable Apple products.
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.720]   It doesn't say great Apple products.
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:46.400]   Right.
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:53.360]   But even, even using that as a, you know, modifier, um, you know, for instance, it
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:56.520]   doesn't say good products, but I think the Lisa was pretty memorable.
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:57.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:59.760]   I mean, it changed a lot of people's thinking.
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:03.560]   It didn't take off, but it, you know, uh, it was very memorable.
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:05.840]   No, what about the, what about the two VX?
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:07.880]   That was on the market for almost four months.
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:11.480]   And then there was the LC.
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:13.360]   I don't think they, they, they included the LC.
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:18.960]   Some of my favorites on the list was the, um, they, they did put the Newton on there,
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:19.880]   which I was glad to see.
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:21.040]   Oh, they do have a lease on there.
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:21.640]   I take it back.
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:22.320]   It's up there.
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.520]   They put it out of order.
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:25.160]   So the lease is on there.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:29.240]   I'm glad that I'm glad to see that they put the Newton on there because once again,
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:31.120]   memorable, it was memorable.
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:33.160]   I still have my G four cube.
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:37.360]   Yeah, I'm not so sure that was all that memorable unless you want to look at bad
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:37.880]   memories.
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:39.360]   I love the G four cube.
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:40.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:42.040]   Why is that such a punchline?
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:44.120]   Why, why is, why is the cubes such a punchline?
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:44.920]   I've never understood that.
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:47.080]   It was a great design.
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:48.440]   It was absolutely dead silent.
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:52.160]   I still used, I used it for years and years and years just by virtue of the fact
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:56.200]   that it's the one semi powerful Mac I could leave on all the time and it'll be low
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:58.640]   power and it would create no noise while I was watching movies.
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:01.080]   Yeah, I thought it was a great every time.
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:03.920]   I mean, every time I, every time I yanked it out of that cube to like do maintenance,
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:07.800]   I felt like, you know, just, I was disabling how in 2001.
[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:09.160]   Cause that's a cool pop up handle.
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.440]   I'm like a junk.
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:11.680]   Yeah.
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:11.840]   I know.
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:15.360]   I, the other than, then it restarts when I shake it and still works pretty well.
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:17.040]   Well, don't shake it.
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:18.400]   I don't, I don't anymore.
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.200]   I don't anymore.
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:20.480]   Art Simpson mode.
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:20.840]   Yeah.
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:21.200]   Exactly.
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:23.120]   You just keep wobbling and then suddenly it'll do.
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:24.200]   All right.
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:30.080]   Speaking of something that looks almost like the, like the, the, the cube, have you
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:30.920]   seen this?
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:32.000]   I think it's the Micah.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.960]   Have you guys seen this little Micah?
[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:35.600]   I have not.
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:36.000]   Oh, no, it's not.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.600]   Micah is a, it looks like it basically looks like an Apple TV.
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:40.600]   Well, it looks like a Mac mini.
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:42.560]   So it's a little bit thicker than an Apple TV.
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:44.600]   It's the same, pretty much the same form factor.
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:49.800]   And what this, what the, what it's, M Y K A and it's it's Micah.TV.
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:54.040]   And it is a bit torrent version of the Apple TV.
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:32:00.920]   So I heard about this and it looks, you know, it looks like a very, very interesting,
[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:02.640]   possible competitor.
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:05.120]   Now it's, it's literally branded with bit torrents.
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:11.080]   So this is really a, you know, it's, it's a, I'm assuming some kind of a collaborative
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:14.880]   process with BitTorrent, but what we can say, Merlin?
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.520]   No, I didn't say anything.
[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:21.600]   No, okay, so the, it, it, it looks like it could be, you know, kind of a fascinating
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:22.040]   opportunity.
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.480]   The thing is, is that one of the problems with BitTorrent, of course, is that we're
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:27.360]   always using it and as soon as it's done, we get off of it and we move on to something
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:27.760]   else.
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:31.720]   And if you had something that was actually a hardware device that's really kind of
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:37.240]   managing that in some, in some respects, and it seems like the, the Bit torrenting
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:42.000]   would be much more efficient as far as sending even bigger image, you know, bigger
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.360]   stuff to everyone without feeling the, the brunt of it.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.560]   So I didn't know if anyone had seen this or not, but it looks like it's going to be
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:52.400]   a fairly fascinating piece of hardware if people actually rumor is that it won't
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:54.120]   work so good if you have Comcast.
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:58.400]   Yeah, but neither does video, right?
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:01.480]   I mean, have you seen, have you seen the com get the stills?
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:06.760]   Have you seen the stills from Comcast's not even their DVR, just their cable in New
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:08.720]   York? Now, Andy, what do you have for cable?
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.200]   Um, I have Verizon files.
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:14.360]   Oh, that's what everybody wants.
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:15.200]   Mean guy.
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.800]   You get to, they promise it's one of those.
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:21.480]   I don't believe that that's why this is between a phone company and a cable company.
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:25.640]   The phone company is not as good as lying to you as the cable company is because the
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:29.160]   phone company, they promised me like up length of something like 200 K and I'm
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:30.800]   getting 380, 390.
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:36.200]   Uh, they, they, they routinely bust through like every single prediction, every
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:36.320]   single one.
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:37.440]   What's the download speed on that?
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:40.040]   Uh, I routinely get on it.
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:45.320]   When I'm downloading stuff at vampire hours, I routinely get anywhere from high
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:48.400]   400s to low to mid 600s.
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:51.160]   I think the highest I got was a little above 700, but I could be wrong.
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:52.040]   Are you kidding me?
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:56.240]   I was getting, I was getting that, but then that's, that's during vampire hours right
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:00.440]   now in, you know, in suburban Boston, the more typical download speed would be
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:02.000]   somewhere around high 200s.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:02.240]   Low.
[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:03.040]   I've got the best.
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:08.040]   I still bet it might be one at the best Comcast you can buy, um, over cable and,
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:12.640]   and I'm sure they're shaping this because it, it basically right around two, two K,
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:17.240]   around 2000, it just tops off and I used to get, so if I do it in verse, like if I
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:22.400]   do the speed test.net, it's telling me that I'm capable of like 12,013,000.
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:24.200]   And you're getting 400.
[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:24.720]   Is that what you said?
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:25.040]   Hang on.
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:26.720]   Let me, let me test it right now.
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:29.760]   This is, it's four, it's a little before five o'clock in the afternoon.
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:31.600]   Lots of kids are on here right now.
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:33.160]   Uh, hang on.
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:34.160]   We'll give us that.
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:34.680]   You're not right.
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:35.840]   Excuse me.
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.880]   You're not, you're not, you're not your usual layer, right?
[00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:42.480]   I'm not, I, I actually bought, I like this so much at home that I'm spending, I'm
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:45.160]   spending a lot of time at my folks house cause they're, they're needing a little bit
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:45.400]   of help.
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:46.400]   So I actually bought them.
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:47.640]   They already had the, the cable.
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:51.640]   So I just bought them a broadband just so I wouldn't have to keep using my iPhone
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:53.200]   for getting my email.
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:58.520]   Uh, uh, so they have actually the slower version, I have the higher version at home.
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:01.320]   So hang on speed test.net.
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.760]   Yeah.
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:04.560]   So you're already, that's, that's pretty nice.
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:08.560]   Cause I'll say a Comcast used to, used to fly when I, when I first got Comcast,
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:09.960]   and you're still using Comcast.
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:10.960]   What are you using?
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:12.480]   Uh, we use speakeasy.
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:14.160]   And you like that better?
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:14.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:17.480]   I mean, I don't cast, I have no love for Comcast.
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:18.800]   I have no love for Comcast.
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.120]   Like, I have negative.
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:22.120]   Anywhere in the city, Alex, what?
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:24.560]   Can we get speakeasy anywhere in the city?
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.960]   Anywhere in, anywhere in San Francisco, you can get speakeasy.
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:27.760]   We have it at the house.
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:28.200]   We have it.
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:30.080]   I have, uh, we have a DSL at the house.
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:31.400]   We have a DSL here at the office.
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:34.360]   We have a T one here at the office and all of it feeds through speakeasy.
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:35.200]   I know.
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:35.720]   I'll have a look.
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:36.320]   I'll have a look.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:36.960]   They're awesome.
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.040]   Okay.
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:46.200]   It's, it's only getting three, so we're up and down, but the peak is giving me about
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:50.520]   700 800 900 1500 kilovits per second.
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:52.200]   Wow.
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:53.360]   Kilovits or kilobytes.
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.920]   I'm sorry.
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:55.320]   Yeah.
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:55.840]   Little bites.
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:56.280]   Okay.
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:56.840]   Sorry.
[00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:57.400]   Sorry about that.
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:58.360]   Sorry about that.
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:35:59.040]   Okay.
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:01.960]   So six point, about six and a half kilo megabits, right?
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:02.760]   Right.
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:04.000]   Okay.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:04.640]   So, okay.
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:05.600]   The last test is over.
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:10.640]   So I'm getting, I'm getting three megs down one point, one point six up.
[00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:11.400]   Nice.
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:12.160]   Nothing wrong with that.
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:12.880]   No, that'll work.
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:13.720]   That'll do.
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:15.880]   And like this, this is the slow version.
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:19.360]   I pay an extra like $4 a month for like much faster than this.
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:20.440]   Wow.
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:22.280]   I blame Comcast.
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:22.880]   Okay.
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:24.000]   Well, I want to make sure we mentioned something.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.680]   I think this was on which wants to submit it this so we can credit it.
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:29.960]   We got this on the MBW ideas.
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:30.920]   I want to say.
[00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:31.840]   No, it was on.
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:37.960]   No, this is under the popular Mac tag first sent to delicious by a Pizz many.
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:38.880]   On delicious.
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:41.680]   Have you seen John Hicks from Hicks Design?
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:44.040]   Have you seen his Mac mini media center right up?
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:44.720]   No.
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:50.680]   He's got a nice write up on basically the setup that he did with his Mac mini,
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:52.800]   including the apps that he has installed.
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:57.480]   And it's I'm going to use this as a template for for setting up my own mini,
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:59.440]   I think, for a multimedia center.
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:01.440]   That's it's really.
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:02.320]   You know, that's your deal, right?
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:02.920]   Alex here.
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:03.160]   You're.
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:04.160]   Yeah, it's it's great.
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:11.640]   I mean, he uses the Ener Perian syncopation, handbrake, ITV and pi TV are his picks for that.
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:14.040]   His his probably looks like it's more complicated than mine.
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:18.080]   But that's the great thing about using using that platform.
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:20.040]   You can make it as simple as complicated as you want.
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:24.240]   I'm really one fight that I really had really long and hard with.
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:28.240]   I'm doing the I'm doing consumers digest annual like here's what to buy in terms
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:33.960]   of computers feature and they wanted to do a category for for media center PCs.
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:36.920]   And I said, well, no, the first one's going to be the cheaper one.
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:38.480]   The cheapest one is going to be the Apple TV.
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:40.560]   I'm sorry, actually was Apple TV.
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:45.280]   They kibosh that because they didn't think it was a real computer, which was a sort of a credible point.
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.200]   So I said, OK, great.
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.840]   Let's go with the Mac mini because it's dirt cheap.
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:52.040]   It runs real soft where you add some free software that turns into a great media center
[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:53.080]   and they kibosh it.
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:57.520]   And I was just really disappointed because it's just it's almost as if Apple could do
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:02.400]   $300 with a rebranding for the entire product line and turn it into one of the most
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:05.480]   kick butt devices that you can you can buy at the best.
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:07.600]   The reasoning on that.
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:10.720]   This is there was a lot of bureaucracy involved.
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:16.680]   They were going by the 2003 2004 definition of media center PC meeting a very
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:21.360]   specific specification from Microsoft for a Windows machine that has video features.
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:27.080]   And that was one of those long conversations where I had to like over the course
[00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:30.280]   of two weeks explaining them that this is one of those great ideas that they had
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:34.480]   at 2003 2004, but then they saw something else brighter and shinier in the distance
[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:35.440]   and they lost interest in it.
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:38.920]   There are exactly six machines on the market right now that you could call a media
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:42.760]   center PC and you're basically and if we stick to that, that's all we're going to
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:44.320]   have to talk about and I don't want to talk about it.
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.760]   I want to talk about something really, really good.
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:49.880]   So I got to say the Mac mini is just like the ultimate what to have in here.
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:53.720]   Should I should I wait because everybody looks at me and rolls their eyes like I've
[00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:54.960]   been waiting for one thing.
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:57.000]   I've been watching now for whatever's next.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   I don't want to be that guy.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.200]   I don't want to be Leo.
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:01.560]   I know I know in terms of firepower.
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:04.840]   Well, the thing is that I guess as a media center, I don't think that there's
[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:08.280]   anything that sure they might make a new Mac mini that's a little bit faster.
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:12.000]   I think if they trick this out with more firepower, is there what are you going to get?
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.120]   What are you going to get out of it?
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:14.560]   It's going to play back the same.
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:15.520]   It's going to play back the video.
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:17.440]   Like I like I derive value.
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:18.720]   I don't want to get lead.
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:24.000]   Yeah, but the Merlin think about the the upgrade vector of this machine.
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:27.920]   Apple has been very, very content to let that be a placeholder in the product line
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:31.720]   and not really aggressively do anything with it that goes beyond.
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:34.600]   Well, look, we're not going to just buy quantities of this one processor just for
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:35.320]   this one thing.
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:39.560]   We're going to upgrade the performance of the Mac mini because we're buying these
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:42.240]   chips and lots of what's made will toss them into the Mac mini.
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:45.160]   I really think that the Mac mini is a very, very static product.
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:49.160]   And if they were if Apple were interested in a revolution on this product,
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:50.440]   then they would have done it already.
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:52.920]   I think that they I'm surprised I haven't killed it already.
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:54.760]   I've been giving it such a little attention.
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:56.320]   The speculation has certainly been there.
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:58.760]   So would you recommend this
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:01.880]   to gigahertz, one gig gram, 120 gig hard drive?
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:03.160]   Is that the one that I get their best one?
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:07.040]   Yeah, I mean, if you're if you're buying it as a media center and you're not buying
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:10.240]   it as a day to day, you know, workhorse, absolutely, because you're not.
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:14.280]   I don't think if Apple puts more performance into that, I don't think you'll see
[00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:17.480]   greater performance on what you're going to use it for hooked up to a TV set.
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:18.960]   I think that's a very safe purchase.
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:20.600]   I don't know if they're going to release something in a couple of months.
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:21.840]   I'm just saying I think that's safe.
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:24.680]   So people for our friends out there who are kind enough to listen to the show
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:28.920]   and keep track of these things, please make a mark on your eye cow that on April
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:36.520]   2nd, I was advised to get the MB 3.0 and LL/A, which which I will probably go ahead
[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:41.880]   and do. And so when we meet next week and a new version has come out that comes
[00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:46.160]   with more RAM, a bigger hard drive and Heather Locklear, I will know that.
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:48.440]   OK, OK, that's fine.
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:51.920]   Listeners, the listener who's actually writing this down and who will email us
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:55.480]   forever also take down the date and the time and say that I said that Merlin should
[00:40:55.480 --> 00:41:01.200]   run three or four miles every other day, should only read me once per week maximum
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:05.880]   and should make sure that could cause alcohol intake to maybe four or five times.
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:08.160]   OK, easy, easy, let's call every restriction to 40.
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:12.000]   So let's just say that I gave you the advice that caused you to buy a Mac mini
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.840]   right before it was upgraded, but Merlin, I also gave the advice.
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:18.040]   I was going to extend your life and your enjoyment of that beautiful,
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:20.440]   beautiful new child of yours by another 20 or 30 years.
[00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:22.640]   And when I die, which one I can be more.
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:25.520]   Now, I will say, I will say, you know, we I have whatever the last one was.
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:28.840]   Merlin, you'll grow old enough to watch everybody you love grow old and die before.
[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:30.160]   That's my wish for you.
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:31.880]   That's the stuff.
[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:34.960]   You know, I have to say that, you know, I don't even know what Mac mini I bought.
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:37.000]   I think I don't even think I got the most expensive one.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.360]   I think I got the one, the cheapest one I could buy.
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:43.080]   And and it plays all the videos back as as well as they're going to play back.
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:46.320]   You know, the one thing I would suggest if you're going to get a Mac mini is that
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:49.920]   you go ahead and buy the external hard drive because you're going to build up
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:53.120]   your your your library and it's easier to just build it into an external drive
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:54.360]   because you're going to want one.
[00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:59.760]   So the I think that there's two of them that are the same form factor as the Mac
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:03.360]   Mini. I think OWC makes or new tech makes a mini stack.
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:05.720]   And then there's also Lacy's mini stack.
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:09.920]   And I believe Ben Durban has a Lacy one.
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:12.440]   He'll tell you that it sounds like a jet engine.
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:16.720]   But the I believe the newer tech one is supposed to be very quiet.
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:19.440]   I have like just one of those my books, you know, hooked up to it.
[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:23.040]   I've been planning to move to something that looks nicer, but it's been fine.
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:24.960]   It's like 750 gigs and I've been filling it up.
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:26.360]   She's a little hard drive.
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:28.280]   It's gotten you can just go to Costco now and pick up.
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:29.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.120]   He had car drive for nothing.
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:33.680]   Hey, I want to I want to institute a rat hole.
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:35.080]   I never get to do a rat hole.
[00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:35.600]   Right.
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:35.960]   Oh, right.
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:37.680]   I don't have the music.
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:38.920]   It's all you can say.
[00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:40.120]   And for you.
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:40.880]   But the boom.
[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:42.120]   I think it's a one.
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:47.520]   So are the Western digital terabyte drives they sell at Costco for like two seventy nine?
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:48.920]   Does anybody know if those are any good?
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:50.280]   How big are they?
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:51.320]   For two or five.
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:52.480]   I've got one and I'm not sure.
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:55.520]   I've got two and I'm not sure I trust them.
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:57.120]   Yeah, I don't like your things.
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:58.800]   Are these the are these the terabyte ones?
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:00.320]   Yeah, there's five.
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:04.640]   There's there's a 500 for one twenty nine and if one.
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:05.480]   Yeah, we have a couple of them around.
[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:08.040]   I mean, all I can say is we have a couple of them around and they haven't and they
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:09.680]   haven't failed.
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:11.560]   So that's always a good thing.
[00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:15.520]   You know, we we have a you mean those are like the my books or whatever.
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:16.800]   Those little yeah, they're my books.
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:17.240]   They're my books.
[00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:20.760]   Yeah, so we have a handful of those handful of Western digitals.
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:24.760]   I have to look I do look at them going like this was too cheap and I don't know
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:26.440]   whether it's going to keep on surviving.
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:29.040]   But you know, it's we haven't had any trouble with it so far.
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:32.360]   And so they seem fine to me.
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:35.800]   Does anyone else have any experience with them?
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:38.800]   Just just anecdotally, I've got I've got two.
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:39.240]   We'll see.
[00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:40.240]   What have I got?
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:42.200]   God, I have too many hard drives.
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:44.000]   They have not broken for me yet.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.360]   Knock on wood, but you hear things.
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:49.760]   But we have we have like we've had like four to see failures, but I have to say
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:52.520]   that that's four to see failures out of.
[00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:56.040]   I think we have 30 30 some will see drives.
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:57.080]   There's a part of me.
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:44:00.720]   I know this is stupid and I know people are going to correct me, but there's a part
[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:03.480]   of me that thinks the whole thing is voodoo, you know, and it's like it's like
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:06.000]   you know, when you read about a restaurant, you live on Yelp and somebody says
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.680]   they found a cat in their soup and you're like, well, you know, like what?
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:11.880]   Maybe you went there on some insane night, but I've never had anything but good.
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:12.360]   You know what I mean?
[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:15.000]   I think that happens and I think it's the same with hard drives.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.920]   I mean, I remember when I was
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:22.040]   the kind of the Mac guy at my company, I'd done all so much research and everybody's
[00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:22.880]   like, OK, let's see.
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:24.880]   God, if I was see, these are the best.
[00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:26.240]   These things are fantastic.
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:31.640]   And I my hand to God, like I think three of them died the same week, which if you
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:33.360]   think about it, makes sense, right?
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:36.240]   They probably came off the line on the same bad day.
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:36.880]   Right.
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:37.840]   Do you know what I mean?
[00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:39.880]   So I I don't know.
[00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:43.960]   I mean, you have this on this on this at all, Andy, is there anything to like
[00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:49.440]   buying one hard drive over another in terms of it really depends on your personal
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:50.440]   strategy.
[00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:55.280]   I tend to go on price and I tend to trust the mechanism and the manufacturer.
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:59.760]   When I'm buying multiple drives, I am superstitious enough that I won't buy
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:01.640]   four drives from the same manufacturer.
[00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:03.560]   I do like to spread my luck out a little bit.
[00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:05.800]   And it's mostly for the reasons that you specify.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:11.480]   It's not that one manufacturer is notoriously better or worse than the others.
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:15.120]   In terms of what's once you make into the national marketplace, if you're crap,
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:18.120]   I'm sorry, if you're if you're a terrible maker, you're you're going to watch out
[00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:21.880]   really early, but it's more of a case of this was a bad day on the assembly line
[00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:23.440]   where lots of stuff got through.
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:26.920]   So if you buy one mechanism from one manufacturer, another mechanism from another
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:29.760]   manufacturer, you're sort of spreading out your risk.
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:31.360]   And that's usually the smartest way to go.
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:32.480]   Question question question.
[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:37.720]   Is it also true, the the conventional wisdom slash mythology that if your hard
[00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:40.360]   drive crashes, it'll crash in the first 30 days?
[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:41.800]   Is that true?
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:43.400]   I wouldn't say so.
[00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:44.120]   Thank you.
[00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:48.000]   Typically, yeah, although I do, you know, there's there's so many maxims that I've
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.720]   just been doing for so long, you know, my life and, you know, my battle with
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:55.880]   technology that I don't know how much of it is just religious dogma at this point
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:58.200]   and how much is just situations that work.
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:02.640]   But I am the sort of guy who when I buy something brand new, I will leave
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:03.640]   it on.
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:06.920]   We'll leave it plugged in and try to run it hard, nonstop for three, four, five
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:11.160]   days, because if there are any week what week sold or joints, if there's anything
[00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:14.800]   that's a little bit sketchy, getting the heat level up, getting the stress on the
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:17.840]   system, we'll tend to flake that out really, really quickly and well within
[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:18.920]   warranty.
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:24.400]   Yeah, I find that my my the myth that I've been kind of perpetuating is that if
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:28.800]   you if you drop your hard drive, it fails pretty soon after that.
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:30.560]   Hey, Scott, you know, one thing.
[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:34.600]   This is something that I'm trying to do that I'm still you know how it is with
[00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:37.720]   backup with backup, you're either 100% or you're zero, you know what I mean?
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:39.120]   It's like either pregnant or you're not.
[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:40.920]   I'm not where I should be with backup.
[00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:43.960]   But the thing that I'm trying to do that I think I've talked about before on here
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:49.440]   is what I did was I from Costco, I got two of those 500 drive.
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:52.920]   And what I'll do is every time it occurs to me, yes, this should be automated.
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:57.520]   Every time it occurs to me, I'll do a full R sync or you super duper of my disc
[00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:00.600]   to a bootable external drive.
[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:05.440]   And for you who's going between an office and home, what I would do is just I would
[00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:09.800]   treat that like your total emergency backup where you just do your super core
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:14.200]   stuff backed up and then, you know, once a month or so, switch them around.
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:14.920]   You know what I mean?
[00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:19.440]   Take one home, one to work and that way you've got a pretty reliable.
[00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:24.680]   Like, you know, for my home solution, I'm going to try the Drobo based on partly
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:27.880]   the Cindy's review of it, but this is for up at our office.
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:33.520]   We're starting to amass large quantities of video files as does Alex.
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:36.200]   And we wanted to just buy some drives to stick them on.
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:40.200]   We were going to buy two for everyone we needed thinking in terms of backup.
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:44.000]   And we were going to put everything on one and keep it at the office and then
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.400]   you buy a naked don't you Alex?
[00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:46.560]   Don't you just buy them all naked.
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:48.000]   We have a hundred of them.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.920]   So we buy Seagate.
[00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:50.960]   No, literally.
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:51.880]   I'm sorry.
[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:54.480]   Just I just had a vision of a big neon sign from your office.
[00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:55.840]   One hundred naked hard drives.
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:57.280]   One hundred.
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:58.280]   One hundred.
[00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:00.720]   You already know each.
[00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:04.160]   It's a beautiful naked hard drives, Andy.
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:06.480]   Three ugly ones.
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:08.400]   Do you bring a flashlight anyway?
[00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:08.920]   Yeah.
[00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:12.640]   So we we buy all of our drives and we buy them by the case.
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:15.360]   I mean, we go through so many drives.
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:20.880]   We buy their 500 gig Seagate 7200 RPM drives.
[00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:24.720]   And I don't know what the exact devices, but they're, you know, their SATA drives.
[00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:29.480]   The kind that you would just put into your into your Mac Pro or whatever.
[00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:30.800]   And what do you pay for?
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:33.680]   They cost $112 on Amazon.
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:36.960]   And you have a case to slip them in.
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:40.600]   We just what that's what happened is we've been keeping them in these in the cases
[00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:41.880]   that they came in.
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:46.080]   And we finally we betek what happens is we betek has this little connector that
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:48.200]   you that you pop onto the back of it.
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:49.560]   So it hooks onto the E.
[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:51.160]   Sata and then it's just a firewire drive.
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:53.200]   You just plug it in and then you load stuff onto it.
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:54.280]   You don't want to use it.
[00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:55.520]   You use it to back stuff up.
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:58.480]   You don't work off that drive because it's sitting there and exposed and everything
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:01.840]   else, but but we back stuff up onto it and then we put it back in there.
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:05.200]   They have like a static case that that that they come in.
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:06.960]   And then we started designing cases.
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:09.960]   So we were actually talking to someone who could manufacture these little
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:13.200]   these nice little cases for us and we could get them for about two or three
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:13.840]   dollars a piece.
[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:16.080]   And then we found that we betek
[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:19.320]   just last month makes just started making cases for them.
[00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:21.240]   So they're about five bucks each.
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:23.800]   And they make it look like you have like little tape.
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:28.440]   They look like cassette tapes like a set holders for HD cam, not for
[00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:32.200]   not for cassette cassettes, but like for film cassettes, higher end film cassettes.
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:34.960]   They just look like that, which is exactly what we wanted.
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:39.560]   And so so we just have a bunch of shelves and then we can we what we do is we when
[00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:42.360]   you back them up, we back them up, the important stuff gets backed up to two
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:48.520]   drives because nothing something doesn't exist unless it exists in two places.
[00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:53.640]   So the so the so you put it on two drives and then you put them in and then what
[00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:57.520]   we do is we label them very carefully and then we run them through disc tracker.
[00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:59.040]   And I wish there was a better tool than
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:02.520]   disc tracker because it's not really designed to use the heavy use that we use
[00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:06.800]   it on because the the what disc tracker does is it catalogs the entire drive.
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:10.320]   I used to have something like that in the 90s for CDs that was really bad.
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:10.800]   Yeah.
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.400]   What it does is it just it just catalogs all of the so you put everything
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:17.880]   onto the drive and then you catalog it and we we obviously are grouping things
[00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:20.800]   together according to shows and and so on so forth.
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:23.240]   But we catalog the drive.
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:25.720]   Then we want to figure out where that file is.
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:29.400]   If you've named if you've used some sort of naming convention and organization and
[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:31.840]   what we do is then we just go into disc tracker.
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:36.480]   We track it and it says go to TRC, 014 or whatever and it's there.
[00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:38.960]   You know, and then we go find that drive and plug it in.
[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:40.160]   And it's not enough. There it is.
[00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:44.520]   And it takes literally five or ten minutes to find just about any file we need.
[00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:45.760]   Well, thank you.
[00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:47.680]   Thank you for letting me go down the rad hole.
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:48.560]   Yeah, we may have.
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:49.960]   That's a good one, Scott.
[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:50.600]   I like that.
[00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:54.800]   We may eventually somehow get to Macintosh topics today, but I wanted to do.
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:56.400]   I think that's actually a good Macintosh topic.
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:59.320]   There's a lot of I think a lot of our listeners are using, you know, or all
[00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:01.320]   starting to go through a lot of data.
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:07.440]   We we have the issue where we go through probably two or three terabytes of a week.
[00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:08.600]   So I think this is.
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:10.920]   I mean, as much as I got it so funny, what do we talk about?
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:14.120]   I feel like from my point of view, we always talk about ways to steal videos
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:15.720]   from YouTube and backup.
[00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:19.880]   But still not a perfect solution to either one.
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:22.000]   And I think we're getting closer.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:22.800]   We're getting closer.
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:24.800]   Like I really I'm super duper.
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:27.200]   I don't know if that's smart update was a little faster.
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:29.760]   The super duper is so close to what I want.
[00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:31.800]   And our sink is really close to what I want.
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:35.200]   But I mean, I think the person that solves this is.
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:38.400]   I think that for me, the big future is in this.
[00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:44.280]   There's a great Mac break tech on ZFS.
[00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:48.480]   I mean, ZFS is the exciting thing that's over there in the future, which is
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:52.080]   basically a cloud of a cloud of drives, you know, where you just have a bunch
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:56.520]   of drives all hooked in and it's kind of like a raid five on zero on steroids.
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:52:00.840]   You know, so you have you can take the old drives out, not all at one time.
[00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:03.320]   But if you take a couple of them out and add a couple new ones on the front,
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:07.960]   you know, like that cloud of information just keeps on kind of gelling itself.
[00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:11.480]   Because as the storage becomes cheaper and cheaper and larger and larger,
[00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:14.920]   it's easy to get rid of these old drives and you just keep them all kind of, you
[00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:19.600]   know, in the system, being able to kind of softly move the old ones out and the
[00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:23.680]   new ones in that to me is going to be the that's what we're looking at it as the
[00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:24.880]   future someday.
[00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:25.560]   I agree.
[00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:27.760]   I just I get hung up on the initial upload.
[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:32.880]   Like I keep trying to use the jungle scan, you know, I keep trying to use MOSI.
[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:37.360]   God, I want MOSI to work and it just the processors just start tearing ass and
[00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:39.680]   crazy. And I got a quitter and you know, log out.
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:41.120]   I guess we got through so much data.
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:42.320]   It's just it's not even practical.
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:43.320]   So we don't even think about it.
[00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:44.360]   Yeah, no, for you, sure.
[00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:46.480]   But I mean, like what I've done is I've really honed down.
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:50.200]   So like, for example, I think one great tip that's going to be probably obvious
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:53.400]   to a lot of people, but still is good to know about is how you can go in and set
[00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:57.880]   time machine to only kind of really surgically go grab certain folders.
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:02.400]   I think the time machine is a great way to get like your super core crazy
[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:03.280]   important data.
[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:07.200]   Like the next level out though, somewhere between super core crazy core data
[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:12.040]   and like Alex with his HD video is really that's where the devil is.
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:15.240]   You know, it's trying to figure out how to get the stuff where, yeah, you know,
[00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:18.080]   I really hope I don't lose more than a week of Ed.
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:21.400]   You know, that's the best area where it gets complicated.
[00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:22.040]   Yeah.
[00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:25.480]   I mean, people usually when people talk about backup, we keep talking about these
[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:28.600]   half terabyte full terabyte, RAID, multi terabyte drives.
[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:33.000]   When I think for many, if not most users, we're just talking about that one or two
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:37.080]   absolutely super mission critical gigabytes of super mission critical data.
[00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:41.680]   I mean, I recently after the crash of January,
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:43.880]   did another.
[00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:45.320]   That was I was there.
[00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:45.880]   I was there.
[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:46.880]   I witnessed the crash.
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:49.360]   I got a lot of material out of it.
[00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:54.320]   Oh, it came out OK, but you know, after crashes when you do you gather the
[00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:57.680]   you gather the team around and you know, assign blame, fire people.
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:01.040]   That's what I think people bring cats or apples and potted plants.
[00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:05.760]   Mostly mostly I go into that metaphorical, like enormous boardroom where I'm at one
[00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:09.720]   and all my employees are towering at the other end, like five 50 feet away.
[00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:14.640]   And so we realized we were not really realized that we needed network storage.
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:19.080]   And that's when I once again found another small use for dot Mac.
[00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:23.040]   Dot Mac is not a use where you will find one thing that makes it all worthwhile,
[00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:24.480]   but it's a good resource to have.
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:28.840]   And I find the most useful things that I have right now are that nightly one or two
[00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:33.400]   gigabyte backup of just documents that have been touched in the past day.
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:37.480]   That happens automatically at two times during the during the day and just makes
[00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:42.400]   me once again sort of hunger for greater integration with the iPod, greater
[00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:46.960]   integration with the iPhone that I hope a really killer feature would be what if
[00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:50.200]   in addition to putting things on dot Mac, what if there's a Bluetooth connection
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:55.760]   to my iPhone that if my if my laptop or my desktop computer can sense the presence
[00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:59.600]   of my iPhone within the room and it has a tethered relationship to say, oh, gee,
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:02.880]   I'll just wire, I'll see transfer the past days for the documents here so that,
[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:04.880]   you know, again, he's in San Francisco.
[00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:08.200]   He's just lost everything, but he has a copy with him on his iPhone.
[00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:11.640]   And if he just can get a USB cable, he can listen to the copy that stuff back
[00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:13.200]   on any computer he has.
[00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:15.520]   I think I think that's that's this is
[00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:17.480]   remember me ranting about the whole dot Mac thing.
[00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:22.240]   I think I think that's the dot Mac fantasy is that like super smart, like.
[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:23.680]   So you've almost identified this.
[00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:26.640]   If you think about like the way I target what a target looks like, you know,
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:29.960]   like with the little bullseye in the center, that little centerpiece represents
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:33.960]   like super critical one gig, like if you lost this one gig of stuff, you'd be
[00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:37.560]   really bummed and then it moves out in concentric circles to get to like photos.
[00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:40.840]   I've been meaning to delete anyway, you know, I mean, or like things that are
[00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:42.320]   in the trash that I haven't deleted.
[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:44.120]   But like it's a part of that dot
[00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:48.640]   next strategy, I think would be to understand like stuff inside that core,
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:52.760]   like middle of the target, like go way out of your way to keep super updated
[00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:54.080]   and super redundantly.
[00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:58.760]   Yeah. I mean, in Hollywood, you talk about the elevator pitch where you can talk
[00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:01.280]   about two hours about this thing that you've got this idea you have.
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:04.480]   But if you can't concise it down to one 22nd
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:07.000]   paracens is you can give to somebody in the elevator.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.440]   You don't understand what this product is and you shouldn't go to market.
[00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:13.520]   The elevator pitch for dot Mac is it is the conduit that glues all of your
[00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:15.160]   Macs together and all your hardware.
[00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:16.240]   When it works.
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:20.400]   Well, no, I'm saying that's what that's what that's what should roll.
[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:24.920]   You only talk about that after you get your first level of funding after that.
[00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:27.440]   They say, OK, well, here's why we're going to need number 20 million by the end of the
[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:28.480]   next quarter.
[00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:30.720]   Blue Scott, but that's the sort of thing.
[00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:34.160]   The more features that Apple puts in a dot Mac that makes it easier for all the
[00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:37.080]   hardware that I own with an Apple logo and even the stuff that runs off the mic
[00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:38.800]   or the micro whatever software.
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:43.680]   If it makes it all work together as one cohesion co coherent unit, that makes it
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:44.680]   worth the one.
[00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:48.120]   And for some people, I mean, my wife doesn't shoot that many photos.
[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:53.760]   You know, she she we were looking at she's looking at getting an air and
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:58.200]   and we were looking at what it would take to move her computer over to the air
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:03.280]   and she has like 140 megabytes of stuff in her user account.
[00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:05.520]   You know, I was like, yeah, we could upload that to the web.
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:10.200]   You know, so it's yeah, it's not that way, but I have a 512 megabyte thumb drive
[00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:11.560]   that still has exactly exactly.
[00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:12.720]   Let me back this up on this.
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:13.400]   I do that.
[00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:15.520]   I got at Mac world for us being a speaker.
[00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:18.640]   I do have three I do have three raw photos on it, but I bet there's still another
[00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:19.280]   100 meg's left.
[00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:21.120]   Actually, let me ask you.
[00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:21.640]   Let me ask.
[00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:23.200]   Can we do one existential rattle?
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:24.000]   I'm curious.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:28.160]   So I'm guessing and you had like super duper special backups of the really deep
[00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:32.160]   stuff that you lost, but I'm just curious because I mean, I'm wondering if you can
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:35.640]   verify a phenomenon that I've seen, which is like you worry and you worry
[00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:38.960]   and you worry about losing stuff, but like a month or two after you've had a
[00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:40.920]   catastrophic hard drive failure failure.
[00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:46.000]   Yes, there's stuff you like insanely miss, but like, is it that bad after a month?
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.520]   In my experience, it's like, well, you know what?
[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:49.440]   Actually, I didn't need so much of that.
[00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:50.800]   I thought I really might.
[00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:53.440]   It's it's it's absolutely huge.
[00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:57.480]   This is this sort of thing that absolutely keeps me up at night.
[00:57:57.680 --> 00:57:59.520]   This is why I have backups.
[00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:02.960]   You know, I'm sort of like an international jewel thief who keeps like fake
[00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:06.000]   passports, security everywhere he's likely to go.
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:07.760]   So he's never like without reaching it.
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:09.200]   What kind of stuff is that?
[00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:09.840]   What did you miss?
[00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:11.560]   OK, let me.
[00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:12.160]   Let me.
[00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:14.760]   Well, I'm in the business of coming up with an idea and then later on,
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:17.280]   trying to get people to pay me for those ideas.
[00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:22.040]   This is again, I joke about it, but it's actually less of a joke.
[00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:27.080]   The more I realize how true it is, my job is to is to convert
[00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:30.400]   the synaptic misfiring into discretionary income.
[00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:33.760]   And this is absolutely no joke on the PowerBook 100.
[00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:35.520]   I had a folder with my documents on it.
[00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:40.600]   The very first PowerBook ever got when upgraded to a PowerBook 140 or something.
[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:44.040]   I copied the documents folder from the PowerBook 100 onto the 140.
[00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:47.440]   When I upgraded that PowerBook, just copy the folder on it and it got a little
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:49.880]   bigger every time all the way to this brand new MacBook.
[00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:53.960]   The first thing I did when it became my real machine was to take this now 1.8,
[00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:58.040]   2.3 gigabyte documents folder, which doesn't have any pictures, just has like
[00:58:58.040 --> 00:59:02.440]   text documents, novels, screenplays, every article that I've written and just moved
[00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:03.360]   it to the next level.
[00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:07.640]   If I did not have multiple backups of this, if I just if I could not remember
[00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:11.200]   that two weeks ago, I had an idea for a project I wanted to work on in three or
[00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:14.000]   four months and I wrote it down because I knew it was going to forget it.
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:18.920]   It would drive me absolutely bats trying to figure out what it was.
[00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:21.280]   And I thought that was so good that he just got back.
[00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:23.600]   For me, that's the stuff that lives on .Mac.
[00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:25.440]   I see your point.
[00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:26.040]   I see your point.
[00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:30.960]   In my feeling, I've done several super huge backups of my iTunes stuff because
[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:35.800]   increasingly I've gotten rid of CDs and it would be a pain to get that stuff again.
[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:39.280]   I would really gosh, I would be heartbroken if I lost some of the pictures of my
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:42.920]   daughter, thank God those are on Flickr, a lot of them.
[00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:44.840]   But I got to tell you, it's funny.
[00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:46.280]   This started happening.
[00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:49.280]   I used to have more hard drive failures, I think, in the 90s.
[00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:52.440]   For some reason, I feel like things have gotten better maybe because of
[00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:54.000]   journaling or something like that.
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:55.320]   I just have a lot more.
[00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:59.240]   I definitely have my stuff spread out into a lot of a lot.
[00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:02.920]   I had a lot of hard drive failures and I have them fairly constantly.
[01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:06.160]   These little portable drives that you can buy, if you actually make them portable
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:09.520]   and you actually carry them around a lot, they fail like all the time.
[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:12.520]   So but I treat them like they're going to fail all the time.
[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:15.080]   So anything that's important is on two of them.
[01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:18.200]   And I usually assume I won't lose both of them on the same trip.
[01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:21.280]   And so the vice president can't fly with the president.
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:22.120]   Exactly.
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:22.560]   Exactly.
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:25.360]   In fact, I should call I think our next ones will be called the president and the
[01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:25.960]   vice president.
[01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:29.000]   I don't know who they'll be, but they'll be there to be somewhere in there.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.440]   But now speaking of we're going to move out of this rat hole.
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:32.840]   We're going to dig our way out of this one here.
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:37.040]   And this is but I think that that has been a useful coverage there.
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:37.760]   But have you seen this?
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:41.120]   Have you seen this millions of cover lawsuit that Apple's getting hit by?
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:42.240]   Oh, God.
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:44.480]   What day is it?
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:45.200]   What day?
[01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:48.360]   I just I just see these people going, what about it?
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:49.840]   992.
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:52.760]   I think I think you're going to sue them.
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:54.640]   You should have to count each each color.
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:55.320]   Exactly.
[01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:56.640]   That's fine.
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:58.520]   We'll give you a dollar for every color that's missing.
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:00.360]   You just have to write them all out in long hand.
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:01.560]   All the ones you think are missing.
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:02.640]   Yeah, that would be perfect.
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:06.280]   Just the well, you have nine nine hundred nine nine thousand nine.
[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:10.600]   So it turns out that the 20 inch instead of having 16 million, seven hundred,
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:14.560]   twenty seven thousand two hundred and sixteen colors evidently.
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:19.560]   It only has two hundred sixty two thousand colors.
[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:22.960]   Yeah, I'm looking forward to turning on the TV at two.
[01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:25.080]   I am and hearing it slipped in falls.
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:26.160]   Work when comps fun.
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:27.720]   Jears modern not have enough colors.
[01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:31.320]   Call me at one eight hundred lawyers because we mean business.
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:34.320]   Now they got they got an entire graduating class.
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:39.680]   I think it's Stanford law that just specializes in suing Apple.
[01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:44.320]   Yeah. And now now the Apple agreed to a settlement last week to a similar class
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:46.480]   action suit by two professional photographers.
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:50.040]   So the who said that this really affected them when they
[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:55.400]   because they're using dithering and their laptops didn't show all the colors.
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:58.040]   You know, and you know who got all the money from that?
[01:01:58.040 --> 01:01:59.640]   The lawyers, the lawyers, of course,
[01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:03.680]   lawyers, the photographers got checks for 16 cents probably.
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:04.920]   Well, that's the way it works.
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:07.760]   They probably got they probably got 60 percent of it.
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:10.320]   That's that or minus all the expenses.
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:13.320]   And they've 40 percent of it said the son of a lawyer.
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:15.400]   What said the son of a lawyer?
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:16.320]   Exactly.
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:16.920]   Exactly.
[01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:20.160]   So they, you know, that's that's the cost of going to going to court.
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:22.200]   But the
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:26.680]   that you ever had that saying it's a it's a machine in which you enter as a pig and
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:28.480]   leave as a sausage.
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:29.560]   And that's about that.
[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:33.680]   You know, that is definitely an accurate assumption when it comes to the law.
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:37.280]   The so anyway, so now the people who are, of course, bringing
[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:41.800]   photographers and the last thing that I have on our little list here, of course,
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:44.720]   is that Apple has released Aputure 2.1.
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:47.320]   Scott, do you have any have you been playing with it at all?
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:48.040]   I have.
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:48.680]   It's big.
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:49.840]   It's really big.
[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:51.760]   And I'll tell you why it's big.
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:59.760]   Joe Shor, who is the head honcho over Aputure at Apple, spoke with me days.
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:05.400]   And I mean days after Aputure was released, when we were at Mackerel,
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:07.680]   it's a session where we were teaching people how to use it.
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:11.080]   And I asked him point blank, I said, are you ever going to open this thing up to
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:12.640]   third party plug-in development?
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:16.000]   And he said what he always has to say was an Apple employee.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.920]   We don't talk about future software plans, blah, blah, blah.
[01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:20.080]   I love my family.
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:20.800]   I love my family.
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:22.560]   Please stop asking me questions.
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:27.120]   But then he made it pretty clear to me that there were divisions within the company.
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:31.400]   And I got from other sources that verified that there was like half the old
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:33.800]   executives that have been with Apple for a long time.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:34.800]   Absolutely not.
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:35.880]   We're not going to open this thing up.
[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:37.160]   We don't do that here at Apple.
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:40.560]   All the new guys, and they brought in a lot of new people, including Joe Shor,
[01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:47.680]   who had worked on IV Multimedia Pro and on some other image management software.
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:51.440]   And I think some of the newer people were like, hey, we got to open it up.
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:55.160]   Well, apparently that two-year battle came to an end because we now see
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:59.480]   Aputure opening up to third party plug-ins.
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:01.720]   Now, there's other features by the way, Aputure 2.1.
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:05.720]   I think this is the most important thing to mention is that you can now do
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:07.120]   significant photo editing.
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:10.840]   I never thought this would happen because I was afraid that Apple would be
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:15.360]   a bit tepid when it came to potentially making Adobe angry because if
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:18.760]   we remember back when Adobe quit doing video software for the Mac,
[01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:22.120]   if they ever quit doing Photoshop for the Mac, that could hurt Mac sales.
[01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:25.040]   And I really never thought they would do it, but they did do it.
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:30.280]   And companies like DV Garage are releasing
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:33.960]   plug-ins and Nick Software and Noise Ninja is going to be available.
[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:38.040]   This is this is pretty huge because now it is literally conceivable that you
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.800]   would not need Photoshop.
[01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:45.760]   You could be a professional photographer, use Aputure and not need a Adobe product.
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:49.440]   And the architecture, I think, is both somewhat limited in certain places and
[01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:51.360]   also extremely robust in others.
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:54.880]   I mean, one of the things about it from from our experience, we're developing a
[01:04:54.880 --> 01:05:00.440]   green screen plugin, green screen removal plugin as well as an HDR plugin.
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:05.240]   And the the limitation is really that you're not really working.
[01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:07.720]   It's it's it's destructive editing.
[01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:11.360]   So what happens is you grab the photos, you work on them, and then you save it back
[01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:16.880]   as a tiff. So it in some ways, that's very much the way
[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.840]   that it works with Photoshop.
[01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:21.440]   When you do a plugin for Photoshop, you're grabbing the image, you're doing some
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:23.840]   work on it, and then you're handing it back to Photoshop.
[01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:25.080]   So it's very similar to that.
[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:29.400]   But when you look at, like, for instance, the new Lightroom beta, what you're
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:33.280]   doing is some some of those things being applied to the actual image, you know,
[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:34.240]   floating over top of it.
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:38.360]   And I think a lot of people were hoping they'd get more, you know, in that area.
[01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:42.080]   The other side of it, though, is that it is very robust as far as I mean, we have
[01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:46.360]   an enormous amount of access to the system from that from that plugin architecture.
[01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:48.160]   So there's a lot that we can do.
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:50.920]   I mean, we, you know, we think that we could probably fit something like
[01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:53.240]   Conduit, you know, into Aputure.
[01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:55.760]   You could you could put I mean, one thing I'd love to see is something like
[01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:59.640]   the oscillator, which is, you know, a cocoa app, you know, you could theoretically
[01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:04.000]   take that entire thing and make it a plugin for Aputure.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.280]   We did see.
[01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:06.680]   I bought Aputure.
[01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:07.600]   You bought it?
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:08.120]   Yeah.
[01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:08.560]   Yeah.
[01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:10.600]   I loved the demo deal.
[01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:12.600]   I'm going to give it a spin.
[01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:13.720]   Yeah, it's.
[01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:14.240]   Wow.
[01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:16.480]   That's that's Apple calling to say thank you.
[01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:19.600]   Yeah, it's it's really it's a beautiful application.
[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:22.760]   I'm still getting my head around that whole different look.
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:24.920]   You know, the applications are starting to take on.
[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:28.760]   And got just some of the stuff like importing a folder of photos.
[01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:32.080]   It's just beautiful and the really nice.
[01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:37.960]   The interface is what has always shown, even when it wasn't as good in 1.0,
[01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:41.080]   the Aputure interface has always been a star to me.
[01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:41.560]   Yeah.
[01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:45.960]   And I got some free movies you can watch over at lynda.com if you want to learn
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:46.480]   something about it.
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:49.400]   And can I and this has a flicker plug in somewhere, right?
[01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:51.080]   But I can get.
[01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:53.760]   Export to flicker with a plugin.
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:54.800]   Cool.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:55.480]   Nice.
[01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:59.480]   Yeah, it's so it's so it should be should be fairly interesting.
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:02.920]   I think that we're going to I think we could see an enormous number of incredible
[01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:04.680]   plugins coming out for this.
[01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:06.720]   And so and hopefully action to the lightroom.
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:10.360]   It's a reaction to the lightroom changes because I saw Gruber talking about
[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:12.880]   kind of crying about these that ability to do that.
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:16.080]   Is this was at the timing that made them want to put these plugins out?
[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:17.920]   Do you think it was just a coincidence?
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:21.760]   I know Lightroom had to kind of respond in turn with their 2.0 beta release.
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:23.440]   And I believe earlier than they planned on.
[01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:23.800]   Yeah.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.040]   Is that what I see?
[01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:28.280]   OK, I think I think if anyone I don't know if anyone had to react to anyone else,
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:31.160]   but I don't think that I know that Apple was just kind of plodding along with it.
[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:33.160]   I assume that Apple was plodding along with it.
[01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:39.640]   I don't think they're really paying that much attention to Lightroom's schedule.
[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:41.040]   You know, working on that process.
[01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:47.080]   So the anyway, so now do we have any does anyone have an audible pick for the week?
[01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:48.480]   Yes, I do.
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:52.040]   This is I love Julia Sweeney.
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:56.920]   I think she is one of the greatest monologists that we have.
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:59.080]   Maybe one of the best ones that I've ever heard.
[01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:01.640]   And she you know her from Saturday Night Live.
[01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:06.280]   I hope you're not going to say, oh, it's that it's Pat Lady because no one.
[01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:12.080]   After since like maybe since maybe 1994 comedians don't come to Saturday Night
[01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:14.080]   Live to do the best work of their career.
[01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:17.520]   They go to Saturday Night Live to put themselves in a position to do the best
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:18.320]   work of their career.
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:21.760]   And the one woman stage shows that Julia Sweeney comes out with every two or three
[01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:23.680]   years are the best work of her careers.
[01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:27.960]   It's just her telling a very personal but incredibly funny story on a very,
[01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:33.360]   very simple set and they all get recorded and they all went up on on audible.com.
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:37.680]   I'm going to recommend her most recent one because it is the most recent one.
[01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:45.080]   It's called letting go of God and it is about her process from being what I from
[01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:50.040]   beginning I gather as a traditional she believed in God because she was she'd
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:52.160]   believed in God's never really given a lot of thought.
[01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:57.760]   But the process she went through of lots of questions and lots of explorations
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:02.480]   to finally realize that she was she didn't believe in God anymore and that was OK.
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:06.800]   Now there are a lot of people who kind of are tightening up in their cars or in
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:10.480]   their offices because you don't like to be talking about the God thing,
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:12.920]   especially in a lighthearted podcast like this.
[01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:18.040]   But this isn't one of those this isn't one of those audio books in which she's
[01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:23.080]   trying to sell you on her beliefs nor does she is her point because there's so
[01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:26.600]   many really popular best-selling books on both sides that issue that are so
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:30.760]   tedious because they come down to I insist to you that the opinion that I pull
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:33.760]   out of my butt is much, much more valid than the opinion that you pulled out of
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:35.440]   your butt and this isn't about that.
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:39.200]   It's a it's a it's a really nice story about how one person went through a certain
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:44.160]   process and came to a certain answer and I just found that it was like all of
[01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:48.920]   the analogs it was funny it made you think it made you think that you spent you
[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:52.160]   made a good investment of time and listening to this and also makes you really
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:55.160]   looking forward to whatever her next audio book is going to be.
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:59.200]   She's very she's very open to being she's very humane and like no matter
[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:04.240]   whether or not you agree with her, she's incredibly frank and that's very
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:07.280]   disarming and even if it doesn't matter if you agree with her or not just hearing
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:10.000]   her narrate her thought process through dealing with things like you know,
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.960]   religion in her family is it's really funny and it's it's I wouldn't say this
[01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:16.880]   a lot of stuff it's really touching to and like a non cheesy way.
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:17.640]   Exactly.
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:22.000]   There's nothing it's it's all about her and that's that what's it makes it such
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.680]   an important story because like I said, I can't I can't stress enough.
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:28.800]   This is one of those things that sort of annoys me when people are plugging their
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:31.520]   book and they're saying that no, I'm right, you're wrong, you're an idiot.
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:34.280]   If you if you if you disagree with me, then clearly there's something wrong with
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:37.480]   you and I'm going to I'm not going to be bothered to tell you how wrong you are.
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:41.120]   She just wants to to to tell you the story about this interesting part of her
[01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:44.880]   life and where she came at the end of it and like I said, no matter where you are
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:48.520]   on this on the decision of whether there's a God or not or whether you just don't
[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:51.520]   care whether you don't think that applies to you and that's perfectly valid to you.
[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:56.840]   You will find this just a a sorely entertaining piece of piece of piece of
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:00.320]   a drama piece of a woman's show edge for lack of a bit of word.
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:03.280]   So definitely check it out and we'd like to thank Audible for their ongoing
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:09.080]   support of Mac Break Weekly. Audible is one of the is the largest collection of
[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:13.760]   audio books available on the internet and you can get a discount if you go up to
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:16.400]   audible.com/macbreakweekly.
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:20.720]   Now that we have picks for the day, Alex, Alex would be tandering if I went back
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:24.120]   and just double underscore what I believe was a previous recommendation.
[01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:28.160]   I've been listening to the listening to that Steve Martin born standing up.
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:29.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:32.880]   And we've talked about this already, but like I'm just really struck with how good
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:38.520]   it is and how if you do anything creative, that's it's it's his description of his
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:40.360]   like where how he got to where he was.
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:40.840]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:45.480]   So entertaining and he's just hearing how he like worked at Disneyland and a
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:49.680]   magic shop and met these people and he like it's like almost like reading the
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:52.920]   footnotes for the Wasteland like where he's describing where every one of his
[01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:54.200]   influences comes from.
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:58.760]   And if you're a nerd and you enjoy comedy and you ever loved and recited Steve Martin
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:01.640]   as a kid, like I just want to double triple underscore born standing in the
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:02.400]   comics.
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:06.720]   What I love the most about is that you know that I was a kid and he was just
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:09.720]   like that wacky guy who jumped on stage with the hour of the head and do the happy
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:13.280]   feet dance and you think that he's just like doing things off the top of the head
[01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:14.200]   off top of his head.
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:18.960]   This book is like the textbook on how every part of that act was really well
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:20.440]   thought out and road tested.
[01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:24.600]   You get to the section which he's saying he's talking about theories of comedy and
[01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:27.480]   what causes what the relationship is between the comedian in the audience.
[01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:30.720]   He's saying that well, the thing is though, all these set up punch line jokes,
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:32.720]   set up punch line jokes, set up punch line laughter.
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:35.960]   The the audience gets a Q as to when it's time to laugh.
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:39.960]   This is point where he's saying at this stage in my comedy, I thought, what if I
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:43.920]   don't give them any cues whatsoever that I've just told them a joke?
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:45.080]   Would they still laugh?
[01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:48.400]   Would they pick their own moments to to say think that's funny?
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:49.400]   I'm going to laugh right now.
[01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:53.640]   And that's when you're thinking my God that that's he is he is thinking on a whole
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:55.920]   level. He's like a comedy scientist, basically.
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:56.240]   Yeah.
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:59.520]   And that doesn't even drain the entertainment out of this book.
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:02.760]   It's just that it's just like when you when you see when you see Norm
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:06.520]   from, you know, build a build a screen door, it's it's an object you didn't
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:07.200]   really think about.
[01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:09.480]   You didn't think about the plan that went into it, but they think, my God,
[01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:12.280]   I can't believe it's so cool to see how this is made and how much thought went
[01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:13.280]   into it.
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:14.040]   Yeah, totally.
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:14.520]   Anyway, sorry.
[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:17.000]   It's a media, media, rat hole, but
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:22.000]   who'll be hauling through a rat hole?
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:25.240]   I'm have a snack in a rat hole.
[01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:29.080]   Put up your feet and stand by.
[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:30.560]   You don't give a need a.
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:34.200]   For the next opportunity for rat hole, do we have any picks for the week?
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:35.720]   Oh, go ahead.
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:39.320]   Scott, my pick is sound so pro.
[01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:40.760]   How do you like it?
[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:42.160]   I love it.
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:47.320]   For those of us that record audio, whether it's for use in video or podcast
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:53.000]   or slide shows as photographers, we all know that there's the occasional odd
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:59.080]   unwanted sound noise, click or pop people that record vinyl, for instance,
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:00.480]   turn it into digital.
[01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:02.640]   We'll have to deal with clicks and pops.
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:07.320]   There are two choices, sound soap pro and the regular sound soap edition.
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:08.480]   Either one works well.
[01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:10.360]   For me, sound soap pro is the way to go.
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:15.400]   Sound soap too is the current entry level product between a hundred and three
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:17.120]   hundred dollars, depending on which one you get.
[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:19.840]   I don't know the exact price anymore because I can't remember.
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:24.800]   I bought it a while ago, but I'll tell you, if you want to remove hum or rumble,
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:28.720]   low frequency noise, if you live in a building with a big air conditioner on top
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:32.160]   of that 60 cycle hum problem, boom, this will just take care of it.
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:36.440]   And if you're in a really nasty place where there's just some bad background sound,
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:42.600]   all you got to do is record two or three seconds of that before you before you do
[01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:44.880]   your interview and then just subtracts it.
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:49.080]   It basically goes in and learns that noise and says, OK, that's all gone.
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:54.880]   So now have you have you tested it again, compared its results to for instance,
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:57.440]   soundtrack pro has a similar feature.
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:15:04.240]   It's soundtrack pro does is more like I would say the entry level version of sound.
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:06.560]   So it doesn't give you as much control.
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:07.560]   Right.
[01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:14.920]   You know, you can do the basic stuff, but here you got, you know, basically frequency
[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:19.720]   by frequency control, you can control the attack and the release manually,
[01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:23.880]   as opposed to letting the computer set what it thinks is the way to do that,
[01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:26.480]   which is how you avoid that phasing sound.
[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:31.960]   Sometimes you get when you use these things, you can dial in specific frequencies,
[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:39.920]   very simply, and you get a really nice visual representation of the area of the
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:44.000]   of the waveform that sound soap is removing.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.120]   You can of course protect the the voice.
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:47.400]   Right.
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:52.720]   You can actually do snapshots, which you can't do on things like a soundtrack pro
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:54.560]   or the basic version sound soap.
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:16:00.560]   The snapshots are really cool because you can do like an ABCD version of your clean
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:03.520]   up and then boom, boom, boom, right back and forth.
[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:04.920]   Listen to them, see which ones go.
[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:07.880]   You can make custom presets.
[01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:13.200]   I have to tell you, I use this almost every day and I can't believe I had never
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:14.600]   thought to name it as a pick.
[01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:17.320]   If you're serious about audio, this is the way to go.
[01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:17.720]   Right.
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:22.480]   It's available from bias, ink, bias, hyphen, ink, INC.
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:25.680]   com or just do a Google search for sound soap.
[01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:26.800]   There you go.
[01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:28.840]   And Merlin, do you have a do you have a pick for us?
[01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:29.440]   Yeah, I do.
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:30.320]   I have a pick and a half.
[01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:33.600]   My half pick is apparently every week I'm going to mention something new that I
[01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:35.200]   really like about Safari stand.
[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:39.200]   And this one this week, I completely blew my mind.
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:42.160]   You know that dorky cover scan or whatever it's called?
[01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:43.600]   What's it called cover cover scan?
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:44.440]   Is that what it's called?
[01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:45.360]   I don't know.
[01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:47.360]   You know, the thing where you can flip through.
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:47.880]   Yeah.
[01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:49.800]   Yeah.
[01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:51.360]   Cover flow, cover flow.
[01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:53.320]   You know, it's fine.
[01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:54.360]   It's whatever.
[01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:55.160]   I have no idea.
[01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:59.000]   It must be something that capitalizes on recent technologies that would cause
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.160]   them to put it everywhere, even where it doesn't belong.
[01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:04.160]   But man, you talk about a great use for cover flow.
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:07.760]   Safari stand, the very latest version, I think in the last week or two, has
[01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:09.240]   something called history flow.
[01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:10.680]   And so you're inside Safari.
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:13.520]   Safari stand, obviously, is a plug in for the Safari browser.
[01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:17.720]   You pop this sucker up, you hit history flow and you can flow through.
[01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:19.640]   You just flip through internet history.
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:23.920]   So, you know, the thing is if you go and you like whatever, you option command B to go
[01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:26.840]   in and kind of surf your history by, I don't know if you're like me, but I think
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:29.840]   much more visually when it comes to stuff like the web, I have still have a
[01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:31.800]   pseudo photographic memory for stuff.
[01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:34.560]   And it's much easier for me to go like remembering what the page looked like
[01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:35.560]   and what the title was.
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:37.640]   And you just sit there and if you're like me and you got this little
[01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:41.440]   logitech mouse with the little wheel, you can just fly through all of your
[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:44.600]   recent history. Anyway, that's still part of Safari stand, which you can you can
[01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:46.240]   just Google Safari stand.
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:49.680]   I promise that'll be the last thing I say about it for a while, but it's such a
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:50.360]   good plug in.
[01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:51.240]   That's awesome.
[01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:58.520]   My pick comes via my favorite Mac website during fireball and John points to the
[01:17:58.520 --> 01:17:59.440]   most hilarious.
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:03.800]   John Gruber points to the most hilarious screen saver.
[01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:06.320]   I'm already going to forget the name of it.
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:08.680]   It's called drop clock.
[01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:14.280]   And I think Google on one word drop clock, you'll land at SCR dot SC is the site.
[01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:21.600]   And it's it's like it's like a hundred and how many megabyte download of this
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:26.400]   exquisitely gorgeous screen saver where it's nothing but slow motion,
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:32.040]   helvetica, bold, moom, falling into glasses of water in super slow motion.
[01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:33.040]   Oh my God.
[01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:35.360]   And it's all very like it's like grid porn.
[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:37.720]   It's like beautiful, you know, grid design.
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:39.240]   It's incredibly clunky.
[01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:40.360]   It's way too heavy.
[01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:44.560]   And I don't know if it's really worth the how much 15 dollars that they want.
[01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:48.520]   But it's if you got some cycles to burn, it takes like it takes like five seconds
[01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:50.760]   to get it to stop on my Mac Pro.
[01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:53.080]   A hundred meg screen saver.
[01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:56.400]   Anyway, it's beautiful and it's available at SCR dot SC.
[01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:59.280]   The easiest way is to Google for drop clock.
[01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:00.160]   What word do you do?
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:01.200]   A PC LOCK.
[01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:02.080]   Oh my God.
[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:04.040]   It's you can see if you're seeing the movie.
[01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:05.720]   Yeah, no, it's insane.
[01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:09.480]   It is insane. Like there is someone with way too much time.
[01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:12.720]   If you're a Helvetica nerd, though, and I know a lot of us are out there,
[01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:16.280]   it's a totally sexy way to greet your computer in the morning.
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:17.360]   Can we just go back?
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:19.480]   Is there kind of porn I haven't heard of?
[01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:20.720]   Yeah, Helvetica porn.
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:23.960]   Basically, it's made by it's made mostly by people in Switzerland.
[01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:25.880]   I have intercourse and of course on a grid.
[01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:28.800]   And that's all part of the new typography.
[01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:32.240]   So it's very it's German around the edges.
[01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:34.960]   And the water, I think, is self-explanatory.
[01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:36.520]   I just don't want to miss anything.
[01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:37.640]   No, no, believe me.
[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:41.280]   If there's any new porn, you will be the first to know.
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:45.040]   That is not as my guarantee to use Scott.
[01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:47.800]   Andy, Andy, do you have a pick?
[01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:49.560]   I do have a pick.
[01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:53.520]   Going back to like my great hard rod crash of January 2008,
[01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:58.040]   one of the great side effects of swapping out like my 160 gig MacBook drive
[01:19:58.040 --> 01:20:03.440]   for 320 gig is that I now had enough space to do VMware in like a really serious way.
[01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:07.200]   Before then, I'd only use virtualization just to educate myself on it.
[01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:11.520]   I had a test bed set up in the office and sometimes I'd fire it up just to see how
[01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:15.200]   something worked well and do some benchmarks by never really use it on a daily basis.
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:16.160]   But I finally had enough space.
[01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:21.680]   I could have like a Windows partition and really partitions for all kinds of different stuff.
[01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:27.560]   And later on, I discovered that a lot of people have heard of the one laptop per child initiative.
[01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:32.600]   That's that really cool looking cheap, a hundred dollar, becoming a hundred thirty dollar,
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:34.840]   becoming a hundred maybe had one in the office here earlier.
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:36.040]   There you go.
[01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:39.480]   The laptop that they're going to try to get all all nations of all worlds,
[01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:43.560]   of all the economic statuses to buy one for every kid has a suite of like simple
[01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:48.240]   child educational software, word processors, a web browser, RSS, all kinds of cool stuff.
[01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:52.240]   And it is a cool thing, but you don't get to really play with it because you have
[01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:54.240]   to either have bought a O.L.
[01:20:54.240 --> 01:21:00.280]   PC and bought another one to give away or have a friend who bought one and play with it that way.
[01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:05.160]   But if you have VMware, they have actually you can actually run the O.L.
[01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:08.280]   PC operating system and software in VMware.
[01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:13.520]   You just download you download the just a
[01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:16.840]   you just download a virtual machine image that has the entire operating system
[01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:20.320]   and all the software in it and you simply double click on it and it just simply launches
[01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:23.120]   and VMware and your screen turns into an O.L.
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:25.360]   PC. It's there.
[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:28.560]   There's very, very little that doesn't appear to work.
[01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:29.960]   It's good for playing with.
[01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:32.720]   I mean, because I'm sure that everybody who's heard of the O.L.
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:37.120]   PC wants to play with it and see how interesting the environment is.
[01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:40.960]   This is one of the most thought out.
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:43.160]   I'm not going to prejudice by saying well thought out.
[01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:47.440]   I'm saying that the sort of thing where lots of people like sat around a table with coffee
[01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:51.600]   and stroke their beards, but if we're going to make the ultimate third world operating
[01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:55.880]   system for children, we must not have any English language.
[01:21:56.080 --> 01:22:00.360]   We must develop a system of iconography and a new way of it and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:01.520]   And they thought that.
[01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:02.200]   Exactly.
[01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:06.120]   And so I don't think it's a really useful thing, but it's fun.
[01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:10.640]   It's kind of it's kind of like that part of the adventure game where you finally
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:14.360]   have managed to activate a terminal on the alien ship and part of the games to figure out
[01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:15.840]   how the software works.
[01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:16.360]   Right.
[01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:19.640]   And say, well, gee, that doesn't make any sense, but I bet this wheel.
[01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:21.480]   Oh, that's what they're using the launcher for.
[01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:24.440]   There's a wheel and if you turn the wheel and it melts over it.
[01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:25.400]   Oh, that's what happens.
[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:26.480]   OK, good.
[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:30.560]   But the cool thing is, I mean, it's all these virtual machines are available for free
[01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:31.440]   download.
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:33.080]   It's not well publicized.
[01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:37.800]   There's no front door when you knock on and say, please, my mother may have a virtual
[01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:39.160]   machine for the old PC.
[01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:47.680]   But if you go to the project's website, go to dev.laptop.org/pub/virtualbox.
[01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:52.320]   You will just get an FTP directory of essentially every build of this OS and
[01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:58.040]   software that they have. Just get the latest one, latest dated one of the ship.whatever
[01:22:58.040 --> 01:22:59.640]   oil PC software.
[01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:04.160]   If it's 230 something megabytes, you're probably onto a good thing there.
[01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:06.880]   And that's like I said, you'll install it.
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:08.080]   You'll probably keep it on your machine.
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:09.640]   You'll have some fun playing with it.
[01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:13.120]   I don't think you'll actually use it for word processing or for surfing the web
[01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:15.560]   because you have Safari for God's sakes.
[01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:18.120]   You have Firefox for double God's sake.
[01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:21.560]   But like I said, it's a very cheap and very, very available way to play with this
[01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:22.760]   and cool.
[01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:24.760]   It was actually one of the reasons that I got it.
[01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:27.840]   And then I got rid of it because I realized I could virtualize it exactly what
[01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:28.480]   you're talking about.
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:29.800]   We got one and it was great.
[01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:33.680]   And I actually did a 3D scan of it because I'm testing a 3D scanner right now
[01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:34.120]   in the office.
[01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:36.480]   And so we're playing with it.
[01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:39.080]   It's really small, the OLPC itself.
[01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:43.920]   And I was going to say, I was just really, there's nothing to do with this.
[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:49.520]   I was really disappointed because I'm just like 18 miles away from OLPC
[01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:54.360]   and I wanted to just take a look at it so I could write about it for the Sun
[01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:58.200]   times, but every time I contacted someone about it, they assumed that I was
[01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:01.600]   someone trying to buy one or I'm trying to get to borrow one and they would always
[01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:03.320]   give me this canned form response.
[01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:07.080]   I'm saying, no, I'm a columnist for a great metropolitan newspaper.
[01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:08.760]   I can drive to your office.
[01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:12.840]   Let me have 15 minutes with one of these things that I'm guessing you have in the
[01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:15.960]   office so I can write about it and tell people you're doing a good project.
[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:20.880]   So I couldn't drive 18 miles to the world headquarters of this project,
[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:24.800]   but I could load in a virtual, loaded free of them or on my Mac download.
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:28.080]   If you actually want to borrow one Andy, we now have one floating around here.
[01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:32.400]   So we so the I bought one and then waited for, you know, I don't know, four
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:34.400]   months or whatever for it to actually show up.
[01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:35.280]   I would borrow it.
[01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:40.440]   I don't want someone to think that I beat up some Guatemalan kid and stole his laptop.
[01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:43.200]   Well, there's always a Randy, please, I need that for writing.
[01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:46.080]   So that's how you're so how much is VMware now?
[01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:48.000]   Oh, yeah, I don't even know.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.440]   It's reasonably priced at attractive prices.
[01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:52.000]   It's like $100 or something like that.
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.840]   So it's not it's not particularly expensive.
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:57.520]   If you want windows, you have to buy windows as well if you're going to virtualize
[01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:00.200]   that, but but the OPC is free, right?
[01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:01.960]   OPC is absolutely free.
[01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:06.400]   Otherwise, it's a good opportunity to mention that this is a good time to buy
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:10.200]   XP if you want to run VMware on it because
[01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:14.360]   Microsoft is starting to pull back support of XP and this rumblings that it will
[01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:17.080]   not be available for for individual sale anymore.
[01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:19.480]   The rumor is I guess it's that it's going to June, right?
[01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:20.360]   June 30th.
[01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:24.200]   Yeah, they don't want they they're trying to really force people to switch to Vista
[01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:25.720]   and you don't want to be running Vista.
[01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:29.280]   You don't want to be running Vista on an actual windows machine, much less on a
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:34.680]   Macintosh XP runs so much more slick or so much better and virtually everything
[01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:38.000]   you could possibly do in Vista in terms of software that you want to download and
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.160]   use you can use on X-P.
[01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:43.120]   That seems like a crime against nature, you know, running Vista on your Mac.
[01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:44.320]   It seems wrong.
[01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:45.360]   I agree.
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:46.120]   I agree.
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:46.920]   I kind of wanted that.
[01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:47.320]   I did.
[01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:47.960]   I did Twitter.
[01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:52.800]   But, you know, I'm just saying that I'll say the I admit that as soon as I got it
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:56.200]   up and running, I had a Twitter that, you know, seeing Vista running on your
[01:25:56.200 --> 01:26:00.200]   MacBook is like catching your your father in women's clothing.
[01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:05.440]   It's like you're you're you're you're you're changed by the experience in a way
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:07.240]   that you don't wish to acknowledge.
[01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:09.800]   I want my life back.
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:14.840]   Yeah, the I have to admit it is really convenient, though, to be able to.
[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:17.000]   I mean, that's what like my wife is now looking to get any.
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.760]   She has an old G4 laptop and she's looking to getting an air mostly because she
[01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:27.800]   can run, you know, she can run PC financial applications, specifically QuickBooks
[01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:33.720]   on on the PC side because QuickBooks on the Mac is, you know, not really, you know,
[01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:34.280]   usable.
[01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:40.160]   So so that so she but her being able to go back and forth and being able to really
[01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:44.400]   easily move stuff back and forth between the two operating systems is a huge plus
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:46.240]   for people who absolutely have to have that.
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:48.600]   So it's it's VMware is great.
[01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:50.440]   I've used parallels, which has been great as well.
[01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:55.680]   But for some reason, I find VMware to be just a little bit more and the user
[01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:58.240]   experience, I think, is a little bit better for me anyway.
[01:26:58.240 --> 01:26:59.480]   Yeah, that's what I came up to.
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:00.520]   I like parallels.
[01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:04.040]   I like what's trying to do, but I found that I have copies of both.
[01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:08.280]   It's just it just seems I could do more with VMware and VMware was working more
[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:12.200]   the way that I would have expected a virtualization product to work.
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:13.920]   Yeah, definitely.
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:19.880]   So last but not least, well, maybe least I have my little my little pick.
[01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:23.120]   And that is this is it's it's it's free.
[01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:23.440]   It's free.
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:27.560]   I've been really on this role of a lot of free applications here and
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:31.720]   this one is one was actually sent in by a listener of this week in media.
[01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:35.960]   So they were listening to Twim and we were talking about ABC and Hulu and all
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:40.920]   the online video stuff and how it was a pain with ABC that if you want to like
[01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:45.720]   with Hulu, if you want to just use snaps or something and just record the video
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:51.520]   you can with with ABC, it would stop for the ads and then you have to click to
[01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:53.520]   continue and all the stuff and I was complaining about it.
[01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:57.680]   And someone pointed out that there is a plug-in, which you might as well download
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:27:59.720]   right now because it'll only work for the next week or two.
[01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:03.760]   At first, I was thinking I wouldn't tell anyone because it's so great.
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:07.680]   And it was so awesome that I was like, you know, I shouldn't tell anyone about
[01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:08.560]   this so I can enjoy it.
[01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:12.840]   But I know that the gig is going to be up soon enough.
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:18.280]   If you there's a there's a a plug-in for Safari called Safari Adblocker.
[01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:20.400]   Does anyone have that?
[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:22.600]   Has anyone heard of Safari Adblocker?
[01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:23.080]   What is it?
[01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:25.320]   Safari ad blocker.
[01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:27.280]   I've got hit helmet, but I don't know that one.
[01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:28.600]   I'd like to see that.
[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:29.840]   Well, all I know is it Safari.
[01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:30.840]   I don't know how I don't know.
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:33.880]   I don't know the differences, but I know that was Safari ad blocker.
[01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:38.120]   When you install it, what essentially happens is all the ads
[01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:39.240]   stop being loaded.
[01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:41.160]   So ours Technica looks very bare.
[01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:42.720]   There's a lot of gray.
[01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:43.880]   You know, it's a 3D folder.
[01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:45.240]   It's pretty bare.
[01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:48.160]   It's just like it's just like it's just like it's suddenly it's gone.
[01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:49.160]   Like all the ads are gone.
[01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:51.720]   Suddenly somebody shuts up all the lights and times square.
[01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:52.320]   Exactly.
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:55.240]   It's just like, oh my God, there's just buildings here.
[01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:56.000]   Exactly.
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.760]   So it's just it's just like if we had a real job.
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:28:59.520]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:01.000]   So.
[01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:09.280]   So so the so anyway, so the it blocks the ads, not only in web pages.
[01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:11.200]   You'll suddenly notice that the web pages are a lot.
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:14.680]   There's a lot more white space available on the web pages than you than you thought.
[01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:16.320]   Then you remember the last time you saw it.
[01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:20.280]   And if you open up what you should do is open up Firefox and Safari and load the same page
[01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:23.200]   and you really get to see how much you're not seeing.
[01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:28.280]   But the more interesting thing is is that if you go to ABC.com or if you go to
[01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:32.080]   Hulu, it actually eliminates all the ads in between the
[01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:34.600]   and running in the middle of the content.
[01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:37.240]   So I didn't believe it would work.
[01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:39.040]   I loaded it on a bit of a whim.
[01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:44.080]   And and literally if you go to Hulu and you and you you start watching it and there's
[01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:47.120]   a little glitch where the ad was going to be and then boom, you're back to the
[01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:48.920]   back of the content.
[01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:53.720]   So isn't that the reason why I don't use a lot of these ad blockers is that
[01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:57.640]   it's less distracting to have that little ad that I don't look at anyway than to
[01:29:57.640 --> 01:30:00.760]   have that big orange like question mark or no, no, there's nothing.
[01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:04.400]   Literally like it just it just like if you pasted the two of them together.
[01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:07.480]   Yeah, we'll put the helmet one thing with pit helmet, which is currently, I think,
[01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:12.280]   broken on the current Safari, but pit helmet is and I'm sorry, I'm always
[01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:14.000]   hijacking people's picks and I'm going to do that.
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.720]   One reason I love pit helmet is it just collapses the section.
[01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:17.600]   Yeah, that's what happens.
[01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:18.280]   That's what happens.
[01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:18.720]   You don't see it.
[01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:23.400]   Second, it's got it's got this red jacks functionality called machete where you
[01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:26.560]   can actually go in and get like crazy specific about what you want to filter if
[01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:30.480]   you want to per site and you can also go in and define which you can do
[01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:32.040]   in style sheets per site.
[01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:35.160]   So if you decide there's this one way you want to really reroll the New York
[01:30:35.160 --> 01:30:37.800]   Times, you can do that.
[01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:40.960]   The king of this, in my opinion, my favorite for that kind of stuff is
[01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:41.720]   Omni Web.
[01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:47.400]   My friends at Omni Group have per site like type and style preferences that are
[01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:51.480]   super easy to use, but Firefox has us pretty peppered on this stuff.
[01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:54.720]   But I'll say there's a few of these plugins that can just change your world on a Mac.
[01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:55.240]   Yeah.
[01:30:55.240 --> 01:30:55.720]   Yeah.
[01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:58.640]   And all the ones that is a WebKit, is that what it's it's blocking?
[01:30:58.840 --> 01:31:01.040]   What's nice is in Net Newswire, it'll do the same thing.
[01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:03.040]   I'm not 100% sure.
[01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:06.840]   The impression that I have is that it is a
[01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:09.880]   that what it's looking for is active requests.
[01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:13.040]   Usually they need to most do at least a couple of things.
[01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:17.280]   They will first of all block anything that it detects to be a standard ad unit size.
[01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:21.960]   And then second, it usually is preloaded with a whole bunch of URLs to block
[01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:24.160]   right based on they serve ads.
[01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:24.600]   Yeah.
[01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:28.360]   So anyway, I was I was amazed, amazed by how
[01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:29.080]   active it was.
[01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:32.720]   And so it it really makes it now what you should do right now is you go to Hulu
[01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:36.240]   and you should just hit this thing and just record all the stuff that you actually
[01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:41.680]   need and then before that before they do something that that makes it not work so
[01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:41.920]   well.
[01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:45.800]   So you get all the sliders, you can get all the sliders and all the medium that you
[01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:47.280]   ever wanted.
[01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:50.760]   That sound you're hearing is like NBC executives podding their heads against
[01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:53.600]   the table again and again.
[01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:56.560]   We were charging up two bucks per show.
[01:31:56.760 --> 01:32:00.800]   Now we're giving it to you for free saying just wait five seconds and look at a car
[01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:03.080]   ad, but no, that's not enough for you.
[01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:06.600]   You know what the funny thing is is that the issue with the only reason it came up
[01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:09.440]   is my issue with ABC is that I just just wanted to play through.
[01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:10.160]   I don't want it to.
[01:32:10.160 --> 01:32:11.760]   I don't want to have to click to continue.
[01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:13.240]   It's a real pain in the ass.
[01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:17.640]   You know, and so they spend three million dollars on an episode, but one click is
[01:32:17.640 --> 01:32:18.400]   too much trouble.
[01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:19.000]   It is.
[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:20.360]   It's too much.
[01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:21.400]   It's too much.
[01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:25.640]   Enjoy the enjoy the drunken cat with a lemon helmet video on YouTube because that's
[01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:28.560]   going to be very classy.
[01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:30.400]   Alex, now Jim Belushi can't buy his boat.
[01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:33.200]   You know, you know, the thing is, is that the funny thing is, is that there,
[01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:36.080]   that some of the ads have actually been on on us.
[01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:37.240]   I think it's on ABC.
[01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:39.760]   Some of the ads have actually been really good.
[01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:45.960]   There are there are these comfort in ads that you know,
[01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:47.560]   trying to get back into your comfort zone.
[01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:52.360]   So it's people doing, you know, stupid, you know, people doing stupid tricks and
[01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:55.760]   they the ads that they have to be so I mean, they must have figured out that
[01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:56.960]   I don't know how much they spent.
[01:32:56.960 --> 01:32:58.000]   I'm sure it's in Hollywood.
[01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:02.360]   So they probably spent $150,000 on them, but they should have cost about 10 or 15
[01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:06.440]   because they're a single, the camera doesn't move to lock off and there.
[01:33:06.440 --> 01:33:10.440]   And something happens that's very, you know, it's very curbier enthusiasm.
[01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:14.440]   Like and I actually found myself enjoying them so much.
[01:33:14.440 --> 01:33:17.720]   We got to the end of one of the shows where at the end of lost and I realized
[01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:21.360]   that there wasn't going to be another ad break and they had all the ads listed
[01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:23.600]   at the bottom and I just went through and watched the rest of them because I had
[01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:25.880]   sure I saw them all because they were they were that good.
[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:30.360]   And I think that if you're able to do something like that, then I'll watch them.
[01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:36.840]   But until until then, I'm going to go back and I'm going to get rid of them.
[01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:39.400]   Do we lose you all? Well, I'll play it.
[01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:40.800]   No, I played there, Alec.
[01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:41.360]   Yeah.
[01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:43.640]   Of course, you realize there's a movie out there.
[01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:49.400]   I urge everybody to rent called "Idiocracy" and that's where we're going.
[01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:51.680]   Thanks to this stuff.
[01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:52.880]   Thanks to what?
[01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:54.040]   Welcome to Costco.
[01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:54.840]   I love you.
[01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:57.480]   Thanks to the fact that nobody wants to see ads.
[01:33:57.480 --> 01:33:58.920]   Nobody wants to pay for anything.
[01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:02.560]   Everybody wants stuff for free and then OK, and he was right.
[01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:03.960]   We are going to get it.
[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:04.720]   Watch the movie.
[01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:05.280]   You'll see.
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:08.920]   We're going to get a guy who's he's a movie star because he lets people kick him
[01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:09.680]   in the groin.
[01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:10.120]   Yeah.
[01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:14.520]   The thing is that I guess my only thing about that is is that Trent Reznor
[01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:17.680]   just made $1.6 million giving his album away on the internet.
[01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:20.680]   He put it on Pirate Bay himself or his band.
[01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:24.680]   You know, there are ways to, you know, there are indirect revenue streams.
[01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:28.040]   And I think that that's what once you teach those people how to make money
[01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:31.200]   doing those same things, Alex, I'll agree that that's the way to go.
[01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:35.240]   But I think I think anybody who does this stuff else because somebody who, you know,
[01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:37.120]   has ads on his site, it's a moving target.
[01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:39.240]   I mean, all of this stuff is a moving target.
[01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:42.480]   And I think the thing that's hardest for people because what would a week of
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:44.640]   Macbreak weekly be without talking about the music business?
[01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:48.560]   I think the part is that people got really fat and happy on an unsustainable
[01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:49.680]   economy for 80 years.
[01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:53.080]   And now that they have to go out and work for a living, you know what I mean?
[01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:55.600]   It's like you got to actually talk to your fans and stuff.
[01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:56.840]   My God, what a pain.
[01:34:56.840 --> 01:35:00.640]   Well, I think that you have to look at how to make it a service, you know,
[01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:04.440]   and how to make it something that, you know, like when we talk about audible stuff,
[01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:06.360]   I mean, audible is a sponsor of the show.
[01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:08.480]   But the thing is, is the tips are great.
[01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:11.200]   You know, I mean, the thing is, is that the people I don't think people are
[01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:14.760]   upset about the fact that we bring up an audible, you know, we talk about an audible
[01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:16.840]   book because they're great books and they're things that you want to listen to.
[01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:19.480]   And I don't, you know, I don't think that that's a problem.
[01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:21.880]   You know, I think that's the, it's complicated.
[01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:25.160]   And also, I mean, like it's really complicated because, you know, I mean,
[01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:29.720]   I don't know if there's enough ad blocking going on right now to make a big
[01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:32.800]   difference. The joke I make with my friends is all of us are one firefox plug
[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:34.560]   in away from not having a job anymore.
[01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:38.760]   But, you know, that just teaches you to try and make your ecosystem a little richer
[01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:41.760]   and never, you know, you learn at the first time you ever laid off by a company
[01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:46.040]   is that you never want to have to rely on one person, you know, for your livelihood
[01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:46.800]   again.
[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:47.200]   Right.
[01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:49.200]   Anyway, gosh, I didn't mean to turn that into a.
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:50.400]   No, it's fine.
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:51.320]   It's a little weird episode.
[01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:52.200]   It's fine.
[01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:53.360]   I'm going to take it off right now.
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:54.800]   I'm going into Safari.
[01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:56.040]   I'm going to get rid of the ad block.
[01:35:56.040 --> 01:35:57.720]   That's OK, Alex.
[01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:00.560]   UPS has a depot just a few miles from my house.
[01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:02.400]   I won't even need a car to get there.
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:03.440]   I'm going to.
[01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:07.600]   OK, I'll tell Eleanor she can come see me at RBs when I'm thinking about the show.
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:11.720]   I'll tell you what I'll tell you what bridge I'm living under.
[01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:14.400]   Hey, Alice, could you pay me a card block?
[01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:16.920]   Sorry about that five second click.
[01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:17.520]   You had to go through.
[01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:18.000]   You're right.
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:18.920]   I was out of line.
[01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:22.520]   Andy, we're going to bad for you, son.
[01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:26.960]   Unfortunately, we had too many people blocking ads on your articles.
[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:30.440]   Alex, you're going to finish the hot dog.
[01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:32.640]   It'd be great to have some protein.
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:33.800]   Thanks, Perry White.
[01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:34.560]   Thanks, Perry White.
[01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:36.920]   Can I sleep under your desk?
[01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:38.240]   I'm thinking about it.
[01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:40.040]   I'm thinking of writing one for Safari.
[01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:42.200]   So Safari add adder.
[01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:43.720]   What's Leo coming back?
[01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:45.800]   Leo wants me to earn a living.
[01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:47.640]   Can I add an ad in here somewhere?
[01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:49.760]   I just want to help him finish the show.
[01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:51.120]   Not disruptive.
[01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:56.000]   Listeners, canned goods, non-perishable food items, clothing and good, but
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:59.480]   restorable condition, peel box 851.
[01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:04.040]   If this meant save save the independent journalist today, please go.
[01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:06.840]   Show the page on filtered and just reload a few times.
[01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:07.920]   That's all you need to do.
[01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:09.720]   Just go reload.
[01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:13.440]   Just go punch our Ashton Kutcher in the face just three times.
[01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:14.400]   Paris Hilton once.
[01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:15.920]   That's all we're asking.
[01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:16.720]   Merlin.
[01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:17.920]   Go to the website.
[01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:19.280]   Merlin, where can people find you on the web?
[01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:22.080]   This is like me on 43 folders, but I want to speak directly to something.
[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:23.560]   I'm not, you know me.
[01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:24.040]   I'm Merlin.
[01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:25.360]   I'm not a guy who pimps this stuff.
[01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:28.200]   I just want to say that ever since I bought my flip last week, I've been really
[01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:29.880]   having fun playing with video.
[01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:33.880]   And so I'll mention that if you go to vimeo.com/merlin, you can see videos I've
[01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:34.160]   done.
[01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:37.160]   The reason I'm mentioning today, VIMEO, Vimeo.
[01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:38.280]   It's a really cool video.
[01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:39.600]   Vimeo.com/merlin.
[01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:40.920]   And I think that's correct.
[01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:46.000]   And I just want you to know that the latest video is me explaining slash
[01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:50.760]   fending the purchase of tactical internet pants from 5 11.com.
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:52.760]   You know, I was thinking of getting some
[01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:54.240]   I had gotten so much Andy.
[01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:59.080]   I have gotten so much grief today about my elastic internet pants.
[01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:01.440]   Oh, they looked great.
[01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:02.240]   It's hard less.
[01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:05.440]   My wife has just been laying a beaten on me because she thinks I look like an
[01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:08.560]   electronic hobo.
[01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:11.000]   Do you get do you get remarks, Andy?
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:11.840]   I believe it or not.
[01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:13.800]   Just today, my second order of internet
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.880]   that was 5 11 internet pants came in.
[01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:17.280]   I was so pleased for the first pair.
[01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:23.120]   I've just gotten the updated the 2.1, the debug fix update, the the ammo, the ammo
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:25.960]   clip pocket that was almost big enough for an iPhone.
[01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:27.920]   They've added the extra half an inch now.
[01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:29.680]   It's the perfect size for an iPhone.
[01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:31.040]   It is not officially an iPhone.
[01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:33.280]   Yeah, I bought my pants too early.
[01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:39.520]   My wife thought my wife said, oh, I can't even buy pants today.
[01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:41.200]   Don't get your car in the picture.
[01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:45.760]   I said, you know, actually, you know, let's not talk about this.
[01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:46.720]   She said, no, I'm curious.
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:50.520]   I said, Andy and I co told me about internet pants.
[01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:54.800]   And so I decided to give them a I got an internet shirt and some internet pants.
[01:38:54.800 --> 01:38:56.800]   She said, well, why don't you why don't you go try a modern show me?
[01:38:56.800 --> 01:38:59.760]   I said, you know, I don't think you're going to want to see these.
[01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:03.480]   I said, you know, well, two words, cargo pockets.
[01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:06.600]   But I was unprepared for the reaction to the semi-elastic waste.
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:08.280]   It was it was not a positive.
[01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:11.320]   She said she's her exact what was they look.
[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:12.560]   Comfortable.
[01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:18.600]   Which is code for like, you know, why don't you just eat a large pizza and then
[01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:20.360]   just watch TV on live.
[01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:22.680]   They're definitely buffet rated.
[01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:24.880]   I'm generally standard is for buffet pants.
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:26.560]   They are they will pass that certification.
[01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:28.360]   Andy, where can people find you on the web?
[01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:34.040]   You can find me at Andy not goes celestial waste of bandwidth at c w o b dot com.
[01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:38.000]   Also on the mighty Chicago Sun Times website at suntimes.com.
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.600]   And Scott, where can people find you on the web?
[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:43.720]   No, Apple phone, many shows this week in
[01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:45.760]   Vittar, he with you.
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:49.000]   I'm on Twitter is Scott Born, all one word.
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.200]   I'm starting to Twitter once a day.
[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:53.400]   I'm not nearly as prolific as in.
[01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:54.560]   I don't play.
[01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:58.400]   But I actually I Twittered twice today and I kind of feel guilty.
[01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:01.080]   I thought a man your age had to Twitter a lot more often than that.
[01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:04.160]   Well, you know, we got drugs for that now, Merle.
[01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:07.840]   Ever ever ever ever since he got the elastic pants, you know, there's not quite
[01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:11.640]   pressure down there, nobody needs to know when I had to Twitter.
[01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:14.880]   I have to tell you, I have to tell you that, you know, you guys are way
[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:18.440]   behind on this internet pants and I got in that underwear.
[01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:20.640]   Are they tying Bahamas?
[01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:22.880]   Of course they are.
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:24.760]   I only wear Tommy Bahama everything.
[01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:29.840]   I know I know I was I was I was dressing up on last weekend and I was thinking,
[01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:32.520]   you know, what I really needed some time, Bahama pants.
[01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:33.280]   I've got them.
[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:35.560]   They're always made of silk, by the way, man.
[01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:36.400]   I'm going to have to go.
[01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:37.600]   I'm going to have to go shopping.
[01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:38.520]   It's only a block away too.
[01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:39.600]   So I'm just going to want to go.
[01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:42.040]   Internet tactical pants.
[01:40:42.040 --> 01:40:47.360]   You know, the gap actually made some great, great cargo pants with an iPhone pocket,
[01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:47.920]   which I have.
[01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:50.960]   I'm going to go ahead and right now, since I need to really go, I'm thinking I might
[01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:55.480]   just wet myself in them just just to see whether it's just fine.
[01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:57.320]   I'm just going to say, am I sticking the ground?
[01:40:57.320 --> 01:40:58.800]   I might do another video about this.
[01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:01.200]   I don't think it's going to show why you're instinct.
[01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:02.080]   We'll find out.
[01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:03.000]   Don't do it.
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:03.800]   Don't do it.
[01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:05.320]   Talk about an angry wife.
[01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:06.360]   Wow.
[01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:08.920]   So you're at that stage in parenthood.
[01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:10.360]   You just want to annoy each other.
[01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:16.120]   I was reading the wiki entry for Mozart and I got very busy and I nature took its
[01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:17.080]   course.
[01:41:17.080 --> 01:41:20.240]   Well, at least you're not.
[01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:22.520]   You're not ever they're talking to your daughter telling her not to.
[01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:24.040]   And there's no pooping while they're scooping.
[01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:26.400]   That's always the key.
[01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:28.000]   Great line.
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:29.760]   Are we near an end to this?
[01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:30.240]   Yes.
[01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:31.640]   God, I hope so.
[01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:32.920]   Oh, there we go.
[01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:33.720]   Another.
[01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:34.200]   Fixed fault.
[01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:35.000]   Oh, straight.
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:35.880]   What?
[01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:37.320]   You have to fix all this in post.
[01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:38.520]   No, we're not going to fix anything in post.
[01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:40.440]   We're going to give it to Dane and Dane is going to finish it off.
[01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:44.560]   But before we end it, I got that wonderful audio plug and can do something about
[01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:45.960]   these podcasts.
[01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:50.080]   Yeah, I can make it about an hour and 58 minutes shorter.
[01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:50.440]   Sure.
[01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:53.880]   I'm sure our listeners will each contribute to the development of a special plug in.
[01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:54.800]   There you go.
[01:41:54.800 --> 01:41:58.040]   Like a film strip thing where every once in a while there's a tone to let you know
[01:41:58.040 --> 01:42:00.360]   that you should go to the bathroom.
[01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:05.480]   And that's why the West Coast Avengers was one of those wonderful comic books that
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:06.680]   should be brought back.
[01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:09.680]   John Byrne, Al Milgram, Steve Engelhardt.
[01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:11.000]   Yes, drink, drink, drink.
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:12.240]   That's your second drink.
[01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:13.280]   All right, everybody.
[01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:14.960]   Break time is over.
[01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:30.460]   [music]
