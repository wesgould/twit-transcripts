[00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.220]   Renee Richie from i'm wars dot-com is here. I go I went to i'm more soon as I got my new Apple watch
[00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.540]   Looking for all the tips and tricks and things I need to know about the new Apple watch
[00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.740]   That's the right place to get it. We are you went on to that's where I've been learning
[00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:57.620]   Oh, did you get?
[00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.340]   Why did you get the gray or the white the gray ceramic? Yes, so did I yeah?
[00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.280]   Yeah, we twins ease and then your boss is gonna steal it right?
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.860]   I'm still using the fluro elastomer band that came with it. Just I've been testing. Yeah. Yeah, it's time to test bands
[00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.340]   Yes, just make sure you know it pairs rightly. I don't any wrong pairings
[00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.620]   I have a question for you a second, but first let's introduce the rest of the panel Alex Lindsey is here from the pixel core
[00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:27.220]   Thrilled to have you Alex using a real microphone for a change. I know I figured you know you sound so good easier
[00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.220]   It's easier you sound so much better that way
[00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.700]   and all the way from
[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.140]   No, England where the weather is starting to turn and drew a not go
[00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.740]   Less like we had some frost of the pumpkins. I feel like you're the official photography
[00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.860]   official photographer of the Boston public library now I
[00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:54.140]   They should almost give me a free library card there. I shouldn't have to pay $30 every time I visit. Oh really like that
[00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.580]   No, no, no, it's and the Boston public library is indeed free. Yeah
[00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:05.020]   I've I had to so the one of the cool things about doing NPR is that they often record one of renovations of the new
[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:13.340]   We're wing meaning built 45 years ago is that they added they created like an NPR radio studio in there
[00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.140]   So I will do so so I did so I did
[00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:23.580]   Did a half hour of talking tech and then was able to take my usual like afternoon long photo walk of the Boston public library and
[00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.460]   The public garden shooting squirrels with the new iPhones
[00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:31.180]   Uh, but yeah, I obviously it's the it's it's a two prong thing where
[00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:38.300]   The I've been shabby pictures in this. Oh, that that's video too. By the way. Oh, really? That's still out of the video. Wow. Oh, it's a
[00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.980]   video. Oh, look at him. Oh, he's so cute
[00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.380]   and
[00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.300]   It's there are things that I can only find out
[00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:52.140]   I started off taking pictures of squirrels in the public garden as a joke after I think the it was the iPhone 4 came out
[00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.260]   And they had this really incredibly hyper close-up picture of a squirrel as one of the demo pictures
[00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.660]   And I felt that well, I can't if I'm gonna test
[00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.660]   I'm gonna see if this if I can take as good a picture, but it turns out that that will test fast focusing you'll test handling
[00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.940]   Uh, it's test video. I use the slow motion feature
[00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:16.780]   Uh, and I also have 200 frame 240 frame per second video of a similar squirrel also eating
[00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.260]   And here's the portrait lighting. Uh, the stage lighting for it
[00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:28.300]   I'm not a big fan. I have to say having now been playing with the iPhone 8 plus since uh, I got back on friday
[00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.420]   Not a big fan of these new uh filters the studio. It's super. Yeah, it's probably like an alpha than a beta
[00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.820]   Yeah, glad but look how the ear of the squirrels will cut off. It just feels like it's truncated
[00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.020]   Not that well that that's that's a really hard test case
[00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.940]   It's always using AI to figure out if there's a better one. Uh, there's a bust of some dead guy
[00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:53.340]   Bust of us that actually uses that actually uses portrait lighting. I have a chinese dish bust of some dead guy
[00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.460]   Um, let me see here. Uh, tell me when I get to it. You'll see it. Yeah
[00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.580]   Well, either with smooth edges. Oh that anything that's gonna look great and believe it and that
[00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.140]   And that is with that is with portrait lighting and I took I took one without portrait lighting and it was very
[00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.100]   Very flat not quite as interesting
[00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:17.740]   Uh, even so I would say that if you look at like the left edge of the of the of the head, that's a little too crisp
[00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.500]   It's a little too sharp
[00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.660]   But they did say that portrait lighting is uh is a is a beta at this point
[00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.580]   So uh and there and i've seen i've seen well set up shots
[00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.860]   Like where there's a lot of distance between the foreground and the background
[00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:36.300]   Uh, where a lot of these shots look just amazing, but you've been very impressed in it with the dynamic range
[00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.100]   Uh, effect. Here's a shot to give you a good example
[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.980]   Yeah, that's that's uh
[00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.060]   If you uh, I believe I believe it selected hdr automatically for that one
[00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.060]   But i'm also taking pictures with a pixel right next to it and it's also available
[00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:55.420]   It also is allowed to use hdr if it wants and the thing is it's not it didn't just capture that really
[00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:01.420]   Subtle subtle disk of light being projected through the windows and that those doors
[00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:06.300]   But you can also look at the doors themselves and see that even though they're almost black in shadow
[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.740]   It's like a leathery covered in a leathery substance. There are like rivets and studs in it
[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.100]   I was very pleased with it
[00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.100]   Some of the hdr that I got from the iphone 8 were kind of artificial
[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:22.620]   I wasn't posting if there's a I took an hdr picture at like little or that magic hour
[00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:27.580]   Uh in boston. Common where you can see the skyline of boston with a ball fields in front of it
[00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.380]   And it was a little it was it was a very pretty picture
[00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:35.900]   But it was a little unnatural uh to my eye not not as natural as the hdr plus that the google pixel does
[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.700]   And also later on I was taking other pictures that were like, that's really so cartoony that
[00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:47.500]   I'm not an example. I see this a lot of kind of blown out images and i'm not sure why the iphone
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:52.780]   Yeah, well, that's confused here. That's panorama mode panorama. They're there. You can't do much about that
[00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.540]   Yeah, there are a few things that the I think that the pixel phones do better
[00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:03.340]   I think that the way that the way that it does panoramas on google phones is much much better
[00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:07.100]   It's kind of annoying to have to really i'm i'm kind of over the idea
[00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:10.220]   I'm going to have to carefully make sure the arrow is on the line
[00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:18.940]   It's kind of no no too fast. No, no too slow. Whereas the the google stock camera app. It just basically it's it's almost like augmented reality
[00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:20.700]   just simply
[00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.700]   puts circle targets
[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:26.380]   Ring targets like in over the live
[00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:32.620]   Live image that you're looking at and you just simply move until you line up a blue dot
[00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.940]   Inside each one of those targets. So
[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:39.260]   uh, like uh one of the later pictures, uh, there's uh tour groups come in through
[00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:46.620]   Uh, the library about once an hour hour and a half and you know, nothing will ruin a panorama like oh suddenly there are like 30 tourists
[00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:51.660]   Just standing right where you need to be so I was in the middle of a panorama with a google phone
[00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.340]   I was able to simply
[00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:58.300]   Send stand there patiently like that scene in the movie where someone is holding on to the the grenade
[00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.180]   And the moment he was like he drops it like the brain
[00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:01.980]   Gonna go off
[00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:06.700]   So I was standing there with the holding the phone in place for a good like eight to ten minutes
[00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:09.820]   And as soon as the crowd left then I could continue making this with the shot
[00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:11.180]   So
[00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.860]   But um, but to more of the point
[00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:16.860]   I mean, I was really really pleased with the iPhone 8 when I still think that the
[00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.340]   iPhone is
[00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:25.900]   Consistently my favorite phone camera, even though it doesn't necessarily always take the best pictures in every situation
[00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:33.820]   It's the one that acts most like a camera where you're you're there to hold up frame frame of compose a picture press a button and get a picture
[00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:39.500]   Uh, and that at that it's the most natural the most beautiful the most
[00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:45.100]   Inattressive way to get pictures unreliable too. So I'm I have to say that I'm now a notch
[00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:51.260]   It won't happen this year, but next year when next year I might buy an iPhone is my daily carry
[00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.740]   I just it's it's a nice phone man
[00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:59.420]   Well, I guess I had I didn't have the 8 on our vacation
[00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:02.540]   But I was but there were a couple of times when I didn't
[00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:08.060]   Bring my big camera my big heavy camera with me, but instead took pictures
[00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:13.900]   Using the iPhone and I have to say even the iPhone 7 plus I was I was very
[00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:19.900]   Happy with the images. I was getting um with the 7 plus effect. I I don't
[00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:23.020]   I know the 8 is an incremental
[00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:27.420]   Increment this is these are natural library low light 60 watt bulb of images
[00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:32.620]   I know the 8 is incrementally better, but I don't know if it's so much better that I would say to people if you've got a 7
[00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:37.260]   Plus you should go get an 8 plus would you no I would agree if you I
[00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.460]   For the past two or three generations, I think that uh
[00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.420]   Apple's been doing
[00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.580]   It's been for the past couple generations it's been
[00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:51.980]   Incrementally better than the model that came just before it but so much better the one that came just before that
[00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:57.420]   Yeah, so if you haven't bought a so if you're most people will upgrade their phones on a two or three year cycle
[00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.780]   Those are the people are gonna say oh my god. I can't believe the pictures
[00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:02.860]   I'm I can instantly tell but I look in instagram
[00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:05.660]   Which ones I took with the old camera which one I took with a new one?
[00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:11.420]   But it's not a reason it's been a while since there's been a reason to upgrade a phone just to get the new camera
[00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:14.940]   These are also I'm interested because even though I'm taking with a seven
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.340]   I guess because of iOS 11. These are stored
[00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.980]   In heic
[00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:26.940]   Format so that's interesting hia. Yeah, it says heic is the extension, but I know it's it's hef
[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.860]   Yeah, yeah, but I presume this c is just some variant on that
[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:35.740]   Um, there is a little compression softness, but I think that's google. These are google photos
[00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:38.460]   I don't have a as you know, yeah, I don't have a mac and tush
[00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:41.980]   The biggest difference for me is that the iPhone 7 took pictures iPhone 7 plus took pictures
[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:45.580]   I couldn't get previously and the iPhone 8 plus just takes those pictures better
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:50.940]   So it's like the textures are better. The separation is better, but it's subtle leaves in it. Yeah, no totally
[00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:55.660]   Side-by-side ab comparison to really totally but like any said it's not yeah
[00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:57.980]   Most they don't really intend people to upgrade year after year
[00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:01.500]   They mean for people who were like two years on three years on to be getting that phone
[00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:05.980]   I keep meaning to write a column just about not about any particular phone camera
[00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:11.020]   But about how now I really think differently about phone cameras in general that I
[00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:16.940]   I've stopped doing those kind of meticulous side-by-side comparisons because I think that that's just a way to convince yourself
[00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:22.220]   That if you want to think that the iPhone 8 is will blow away the the iPhone 7
[00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:27.820]   Find a slightly challenging picture and then really zoom in on the pixels and say aha
[00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:31.500]   Yes, yeah, I can see more a little bit more noise when I magnified by a thousand times
[00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:36.060]   Right now if you spend if you spend a high end for amount of money for any phone
[00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:39.180]   You're almost never going to get a picture that's any less than good
[00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:44.860]   And when you go from model to model maker to maker you're going to find that there are some situations that
[00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:48.140]   One one phone will do better at than the others
[00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.700]   I will say that they're the only
[00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:57.420]   I think that the iPhone does have one quirk that seems to remain solid since the iPhone 7 it does have a tendency to
[00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:01.340]   I think it's oh, I think that internally it's philosophically okay
[00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:05.740]   With the occasional blowout like if you have if you're if you're
[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.860]   Taking a picture of someone with like a shiny forehead
[00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:15.020]   You're more likely to get just this blown out like dot of white on that on that highlight on an iPhone
[00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:19.740]   Picture then on something I took with my pixel or with a with a Samsung phone
[00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:24.380]   I don't necessarily know what that is. It's I don't consider it a defect. I consider it a quirk
[00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:30.220]   I think it just says that if I can overexpose a little bit and make sure that the skin tones are good
[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.580]   For instance skin tones are boy to those things pop
[00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:39.500]   That's I I don't I hesitate to pick to do like selfies as part of like my test because
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:43.580]   You know, I was I was lucky that I shaved that I shaved that morning
[00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:46.700]   I was wearing something nice because they have cameras in the studio
[00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:51.100]   Normally I might be like in work mode where oh god i haven't shaved for two days
[00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:57.740]   But this I included that one be at the bpl because again those skin they're vibrant. They're alive
[00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:00.860]   There's nothing flat about it. It was a really beautiful job
[00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:04.540]   Alex you're still using the success because you need a headphone jack. Do you
[00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:08.860]   Are you looking at these images and I you're a serious photographer too
[00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:13.900]   No, I I go back and forth. So I I actually carry both a seven and a success at this point
[00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:19.020]   So I have both of them usually in my pocket my my seven is my my T-Mobile that I
[00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:24.060]   Use primarily when i'm overseas and then my my success is the kind of the one that i'm using most of the time
[00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:29.020]   But I usually have them both and I and I admit that I if i'm gonna if i'm serious about a picture
[00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:32.300]   I'll usually pull out my seven and take a picture. Yeah, so it's definitely a
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:38.140]   I mean just the ability to zoom makes a difference. Yeah, you know you get you get used to that zoom and you're like
[00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:42.940]   Ah, you know, just even if you're just gonna go to two x just being able to just tap it and get a little bit of a closer shot
[00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:48.140]   We should say it's not fair to compare it to the pixel because that's a year old phone and tomorrow
[00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:51.100]   Google will announce the next generation
[00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:57.980]   Pixel and the one of the rumors that I would love to be true is that they will follow an lg's footsteps and do a really wide
[00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:01.420]   Do a two lens solution with 125 degree
[00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:07.020]   Uh angle on on the lg some of the lg wide angle shots. I've seen her just really great really cool
[00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:11.500]   And just oh I guess that the video is also really nice with the 60 frames per second 10 ADP
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:16.300]   We had a huge about a fun with that especially people who work on youtube seem to especially enamored
[00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:19.500]   Yeah with the 60 frames a second gives a point that go pro
[00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:26.140]   120 frame a second gives you kind of the go pro feel you know that so if someone wants to use that that's that's good solution
[00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:31.180]   Renee is the iphone 10 that's going to be the same camera, right?
[00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:39.740]   It's a slightly different instead of uh 2.8 is 2.4 on the telephoto and both of them are optically image stabilized
[00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:42.460]   Oh, and that's not the case on the eight plus yeah
[00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:47.820]   On the eight plus it's the same as the seven plus where the the quote unquote telephoto is don't actually that's it
[00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:51.180]   Well, I in my opinion a significant difference
[00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:53.660]   Uh, you have to go on that telephoto
[00:14:53.660 --> 00:15:00.380]   Yeah, you you might not notice it, but if some of your pictures whether you take with the with the zoom on the iphone seven or the iphone eight
[00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:03.900]   Seem like they're a little less sharp than others
[00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:09.820]   It's because when you zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom and you're using the using the uh the optical uh doubling
[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:14.380]   If the if if you're in a low light situation the iphone says okay
[00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:20.140]   The light is so bad that I think that a better picture will result if I actually use the wide angle lens
[00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:24.380]   The normal lens that is more light sensitive and then just do a digital zoom
[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:32.140]   Then to give the person the optical zoom through a lens that can let in less light. So that will get rid of one quote problem unquote. Yeah
[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.860]   um
[00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:37.660]   I guess the so the question in people's minds at this point
[00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:44.460]   There are two one is if I have a six or six s or seven should I upgrade to the eight and then the second question is
[00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:46.940]   Should I just skip the eight and go right to the 10?
[00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:49.500]   the 10 is
[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.500]   Just as I would say that the eight
[00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:55.420]   Plus is to the seven plus as the 10 is to the eight plus does that make
[00:15:55.420 --> 00:16:00.940]   It's a it's incremental. I could be a big difference on the screen. It's going to have face not touch
[00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:04.780]   The true depth camera the camera will be better. Yeah
[00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:10.220]   I my opinion is that I think that the iphone 10 has to be considered like it's a
[00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:16.540]   Different platform and a different thing you are partly right you have to swipe the ways that are different
[00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:21.100]   Yeah, you're not gonna have the home keep home button, but I I predict that people are going to be over that by
[00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:25.420]   The first week. I think once you get used to it. Uh, I think you'll get used to it
[00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:28.700]   It'll be it'll be like my adjustment on ios 10 on my ipad pro
[00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:35.580]   Where again, I'm I keep wanting to turn off and on wifi and keep forgetting how to do that but then gradually
[00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:38.620]   Um, I think it's gonna be it's it's gonna be a tough choice
[00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:42.700]   chiefly because remember that apple has apple apple is on its second or maybe even
[00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:48.860]   At least it's second iteration of building phones designed on this body type with the iphone 8 and the 8 plus
[00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:53.660]   So you know that everything is really locked down very very well. This is something they've with the iphone 10
[00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:57.020]   This is something they've never done before they've never built these before in volume
[00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:03.580]   There are going to be things that in this model that are going to be different in three months and different in the iphone
[00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:07.340]   x plus x plus one if whatever they decide to call it
[00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:14.860]   And it's you're not going to get a performance improvement because they really get they're gonna have the same cpu's and the same stuff like that
[00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:20.220]   I've met the only thing that makes it kind of an interesting question for people who are thinking about this is that
[00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:24.060]   They are probably going to be in really short supply. It's probably going to be really hard to get them
[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:28.300]   Uh when you think you want to have them so and given that apple has the
[00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:35.260]   Has there two weeks we don't care. We don't even need a reason just return it with a box and everything it came with and we'll give you your money back thing
[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:40.460]   I for that reason I think that it's not if you're interested in the iphone 10 as a daily carry
[00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:43.740]   It's not a bad idea to camp out in your living room
[00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:48.780]   With the with the apple app and try to get your order in as early as possible
[00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:54.060]   So that maybe you'll get it in the within the first month with the idea that you're just going to be testing it out for
[00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:56.700]   Two weeks minus four hours
[00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:02.060]   Uh and you'll be able to return it because believe me by the time you get by the time you get that iphone 10 ships
[00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:07.100]   You will be able to get any iphone 8 or 8 plus you want in any color with any size storage
[00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:09.580]   How hard is it going to be to get the iphone 10?
[00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:17.820]   Unknown but probably really hard easy. Yeah, but there was that story in the wall street journal last week about romeo and juliette
[00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:21.580]   Oh god a pair of components in the face id
[00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:23.260]   Uh
[00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:28.300]   What one of them i don't remember which one was delayed and they two go together
[00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:32.540]   So that's the component that's holding things up according to the journal journal is pretty good about this. Isn't it?
[00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:36.700]   Renee no, I mean it's good. It's it's every generation. I mean one year
[00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:42.620]   It's the retina display controls the next year is the a you know the a series processor the next year
[00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:47.340]   It's the touch i the touch i'd always always have to produce in such massive quantities
[00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:49.740]   It's brand like to anti-stirler point is brand new technology
[00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:53.340]   They're trying to produce at scale and this thing is full of quote unquote reveille boards
[00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:57.580]   So it's you know, it's all brand like the essential phone which only sold 5,000
[00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:59.980]   That's not so hard, right?
[00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:05.020]   Well, I mean, why are you 750 million? It's a you know, it's another matter entirely
[00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:09.980]   It will be easy to get an iphone 10. It will not be easy to get it anytime soon. Yeah, so yeah, right
[00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:17.100]   I mean, I think that everyone that orders between midnight and 1205 will probably get one in the first get one in two
[00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:22.140]   You think we'll get a october third. That's the ship date. No, no, no, no, no vember third
[00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:26.140]   Not me no vember third. Sorry. Yeah, uh, do you think some people will get it?
[00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:28.380]   No, I think some people will
[00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:36.300]   But again, I think I think all the one that says that the bulk he believes the because china is such an important market apple
[00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.340]   And they've been slipping in china and china is so status
[00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:47.420]   Sensitive and and and the chinese market really wants the latest greatest that the bulk of iphone 10s that they can make will be ships china
[00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:52.300]   Not to hear it'll probably I mean if they were really concerned they would only do the launch in the us and maybe china
[00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:55.260]   That's what they've done in the past when they were incredibly concerned about supply
[00:19:55.260 --> 00:20:00.220]   The fact that they're doing it and you know five or six or eight even countries means they're probably not critical
[00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:03.500]   On the amount of volume, but it will be constrained within each of those
[00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:10.060]   Constraints and constraints apply creates more press it creates more drive, you know, demand it's
[00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:16.700]   Horrible it's not bad for them. Especially if you have an iphone eight to sell you have something to sell people when they come in the store
[00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:19.580]   And there's also there's like there's a really interesting duality this year
[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:23.420]   Like when apple went from the iphone five s to the iphone six or a lot of people who weren't happy
[00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:26.140]   They just did not want a bigger phone for a variety of reasons
[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:28.140]   I feel it was in their hands or the design or whatever
[00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:32.380]   They wanted a better iphone five and it took apple 18 months to give them the iphone se
[00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:36.380]   And this year, you know if apple had just done the iphone six sorry the iphone 10
[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:39.980]   Be much people say I just I don't want that I want touch idea. I want a home button
[00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:42.220]   I want I want what I want I just want it better
[00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:49.420]   And this year they're taking a lot of pressure off iphone 10 by saying if all you want is the iphone six or six s or whatever that you currently have
[00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:54.220]   Just a lot better version of it. You can go buy an iphone eight today. You'll have your home button. You'll have your touch ID
[00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:57.740]   Everything you're used to you don't have to worry about it. Nothing's going to change
[00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:03.500]   Go get it if you are bored to tears with this design. We heard you last year if you are bored to tears of design
[00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:07.340]   We have something all new for you. You got to pay a little bit of a price to get that all new thing
[00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:09.340]   But if you are bored now
[00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:11.820]   You can get the x-pon you in the hot and exciting right away
[00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:16.780]   And I think that that's actually the the confusing part for me is why the seven is still being sold
[00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:20.380]   You know, I think that the you know, the eight is and is close enough to the seven
[00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:25.180]   The six gives you your headphone the five c is cheap and gives you a really small phone
[00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:29.660]   And the ten is different. It just seems like as the eight came out the seven doesn't
[00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:33.500]   Make as much kept so many phones Alex. It kept like every phone
[00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:35.660]   Yeah line up
[00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:40.380]   I know it's I just feel like we're getting back into the like the apple in the mid 90s where there's so many
[00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:44.060]   There were so many computers that I literally couldn't buy one because I couldn't figure out which one
[00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:48.460]   Did what I wanted to do and I feel like it's starting to get muddy
[00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:52.860]   There's some evidence too. I think that people are not trying to get the iphone eight in the normal
[00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:57.820]   quantities of past years that there are a lot of people waiting for the iphone
[00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:04.620]   Ten slices and the hard part is like the intelligence which you know, I use slice a lot of people use slice to keep track of their shipments
[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:07.500]   They say the shipments are down by like half
[00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:13.900]   According to the people who use slice really complex because you're gonna have a lot of people who want the there's a lot of you know a lot of
[00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:20.460]   Apple users have been trained to you know buy the new thing every year and they want the new thing the big new thing
[00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:25.260]   And they're all gonna wait and then the problem is they're all gonna wait and then it's gonna be six months or nine months
[00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:28.620]   We might get to the the iphone 11 before they finish
[00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:33.740]   I need anyway because they couldn't get the 10 or they couldn't get it when they wanted it. Yeah
[00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:37.660]   And then there's seven then I mean if you've got a seven you can wait for quite some time
[00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:40.620]   Yeah, and plus they're not
[00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:48.300]   If you really there's only wireless charging in terms of a here is a brand new thing that you will recognize as a brand new thing
[00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:51.660]   In the iphone 8 that is not in the iphone 7 right now
[00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:58.860]   And of course, there's more a lot more than just wireless charging but in terms of here is how my life will be different with an iphone 8 as opposed to my iphone 7
[00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:02.060]   Wireless is great though. I do really like
[00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:04.460]   It's awesome. I've always like yeah
[00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:09.020]   What I would love to do is put an iphone 8 and a nexus 4 on a table and just let them race
[00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:15.420]   New vision in life. I just got to find my nexus 4. I it's funny. I wish I mean, I don't know
[00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:23.100]   There was for a while google was making this modular phone that they had inherited from mo to roa and there are indeed of the era
[00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:29.660]   And I think that maybe that would be a good if you could do it without it being janky and feeling like a lego brick in your hand
[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:34.940]   It would be kind of cool to because I want a headphone jack for instance. I'd be willing to give up something for a headphone jack
[00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:38.860]   Um, you know, it just be nice to be able to choose the things you want
[00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:46.460]   Getting rid of more did you hear the rumors this year leo for the before the before the the bigger rumors for the pixel leaked is that there were two prototypes one
[00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:51.660]   With no buttons which like the htc 11, which is I think the one they're gonna ship and one with no ports
[00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:56.460]   But they couldn't get the the remote the wireless dfu stuff working in time
[00:23:56.460 --> 00:24:01.340]   But it looks like that that's where we're headed. We're heading. Oh, I agree. Why have no ports right
[00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:06.940]   Why have a port at all everything? It should just be a slab of glass that magically charges
[00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:12.060]   And magical they mess their things zero mechanical failure points is is there
[00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:17.740]   A speaker grill. Otherwise, it would be really you could make it totally waterproof. We say that but we don't know what they're recommending
[00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:23.500]   Speakers that go through the glass. I think there are TVs with speakers that go through the glass
[00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:27.660]   They'll be all magnetic charging and they'll have wireless dfu
[00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:34.380]   I could that doesn't seem too far off that and that also feels like more futuristic just a phone no lightning no type C no connectors
[00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:36.860]   No headphone jack
[00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:39.260]   Apple just I have enough trouble
[00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:44.460]   I have enough trouble with my with my wireless that I'm I don't I think we're a long way away from
[00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:47.180]   Doing that responsibly
[00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:50.300]   I think apple will follow suit on that one. Yeah, well, yeah
[00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:57.420]   I feel like that's also that's the one thing apple might take the lead in just because of steve jabs hereditary hatred of buttons and ports
[00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:03.100]   Well apple tv apple tv 4k doesn't have a usb anymore. It does remote you have to use xcode over y5
[00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:07.980]   And do remote it really so that's it that's interesting that by step
[00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:14.300]   Well, that does eat all the ports to eat all the tables the we will know you're not you're not supposed to you're not supposed to have been using the usb port in that thing anyway
[00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:19.340]   Uh, but it's it's developers because that's who used it. Yeah developers developers did but hey they're
[00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:25.820]   The teles developer know you gotta do it while there's there's a certain cat and dog
[00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:29.500]   There's a sort of chocolate and pickles animal had to be going on with those two things
[00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.500]   but yeah, it's I
[00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:33.500]   had that same sort of
[00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:37.580]   Problem with the testing the iphone 8 over the weekend where but that was the end of the day
[00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:42.300]   That's when I started doing my my squirrel tests and battery was like down to like 10%
[00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:48.140]   And I wanted to use the the volume button on the on the on the headphones as like a remote shutter
[00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:53.020]   So that I could just sort of leave it set up and let the let the squirrels eat in peace without being
[00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:56.620]   Shied away by the nerd with the whole load of the camera. It's like oh that that's fine
[00:25:56.620 --> 00:26:01.900]   I'll just like plug it all plug it into like this 20 million gajillion battery charger. I've got that
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:06.860]   Oh, that's right. I've got one port that has to be for both power and for the headphones
[00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:11.500]   So I can't do that. It's a it's a sort of feature. You don't notice it until those
[00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:16.380]   Four times a year some for some people four times a month where it's like boy
[00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:21.820]   My life would be a lot simpler if this had it and then you again think about all the phones that do have it
[00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:28.140]   I I had I was talking about on my google show last week. I that jelly phone that tiny tiny tiny
[00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:30.620]   I've got the room tiny tiny tiny android phone
[00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:35.020]   That is literally if I if I put it behind these two fingers, you would not be able to see it
[00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:38.780]   That's how small it is. And so what we're talking about I could not resist saying
[00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:40.060]   you know
[00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:44.940]   Here's here's a phone that is about one quarter the size of the iPhone 8
[00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:51.660]   Somehow these random Chinese engineers were able to fit a headphone jack in there
[00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:57.420]   Despite well, okay, maybe that's maybe apple just not clever enough to be able to put everything they want and a headphone jack in
[00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:01.180]   I don't know what you know what the iPhone doesn't have an FM radio
[00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:06.380]   Yes, that's true. Actually, I thought this is an interesting story. We talked about it on twitter on sunday
[00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:12.940]   Of course agit pi who has now been confirmed for a complete term as chairman of the fcc
[00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:17.020]   Uh went along with the national association of broadcasters. I have to point this out
[00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:20.620]   There's been a move from radio and others along for a long time to
[00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:27.740]   Enable the FM radio in phones because it's good in case of emergency and agit pi blamed
[00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:29.260]   apple
[00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:35.180]   Among you know, it's why doesn't apple should should put the FM radio in or turn it on
[00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:38.220]   It's already in there just flip a switch just flip a switch
[00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:45.100]   He says this is a agit pi quote apple is the one major phone manufacturer that has resisted doing so
[00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:48.460]   But I hope the company will reconsider its position
[00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:53.980]   That's why i'm act asking apple to activate the FM chips that are in its phone to which apple replied
[00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:57.980]   Well, we care about the safety of our users, but
[00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:03.340]   iPhone 7 and 8 models don't have FM radio chips and in order they have antennas
[00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:09.020]   Designed to support FM signal so it is not possible to enable FM reception in these products
[00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:14.620]   Now I wonder because we talked about this on sunday. There isn't really a chip. It's a software defined radio
[00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:17.100]   All you need is a dsp so they could do that
[00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:21.900]   Uh the antenna on most phones like the lg's that do continue to have FM radios
[00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:24.300]   Uh are the headphones
[00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.940]   That's the antenna. Of course. You don't have a headphone check
[00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:30.780]   So maybe that's why apple called out the iphone 7 and 8 without a headphone
[00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:34.380]   Well on a lot of them like the on reason i've previously apple would buy broadcom
[00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:38.780]   I mean most of the industry would buy broadcom ships and they would have wi-fi and bluetooth and they'd have FM radio
[00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:41.900]   Just bakes in part of this thing. It's just a block on the chip
[00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:46.700]   But apple doesn't buy commodity chips even when some of the teardown companies think they're using commodity chips
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:49.020]   Almost never do they use the modernity chips?
[00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:51.020]   They've taped off the FM radio stuff
[00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:54.140]   I don't know what the exact technical term is like it could be dark atoms
[00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:58.540]   It's just apple asks for very specific things for a whole range of power management and other issues
[00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:03.020]   And though that block is not existent on the versions of the chips that apple has it's just no
[00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:08.540]   We know that that's a fact that yeah, and they did call it the 7 and 8 which are the
[00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:13.500]   New phones there are other phones that still have that block but that block is not internally connected to anything
[00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:16.380]   Like it's not connected to any way that would help you get sound or signal
[00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:20.300]   Oh, and there's no you on it's not a switch you could flip with existing phones, but you could put it on
[00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.940]   Well, maybe it is with older phones. It depends
[00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:28.060]   It's like when it's sorry. Go ahead. You're about to say go ahead. Go ahead. Andy go ahead
[00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:32.300]   I was just gonna say like Renee says that if you can you can download the spec sheets for
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:36.220]   for the lte modem chips that are in pretty much any phone and
[00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:41.980]   The Qualcomm spec sheet will say that there is FM there is an FM radio decoder
[00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:44.460]   Decoder in there that would not be that difficult to support
[00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:48.700]   But you don't know if once once somebody is buying in so in sufficient quantity
[00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:54.300]   They might ask for changes that if they don't care about the FM chip then that functionality goes
[00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:58.940]   It's either not on the block or they just simply disconnect it for whatever reason they deem valuable
[00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:02.300]   However, I do think that it's a it's a really good thing
[00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:08.300]   You're used to seeing phones that are really international like when Motorola came up with it
[00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:12.860]   Try to start going up with phones that cost less than 200 dollars and even less than 100
[00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:16.700]   Dollars a feature that you start you suddenly started to see on all motor roof motor
[00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:21.820]   Rolla phones was FM radio and you're wondering gee why FM radio and the reason and the the
[00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:27.020]   Rational reason that was the first to come to mind was that oh, there's that's how people in Pakistan
[00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:33.580]   India get their cricket scores off FM radio not through streaming via broadband, but he but uh
[00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:38.300]   I this is probably the first time I have said this since a gpie became director the FCC
[00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:41.900]   He's making an excellent point that there are times when I have
[00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:47.740]   I've never thank goodness suffered through a a natural disaster
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:53.580]   Anywhere close to the the level that people have been going through in perterico in texas
[00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:55.900]   however, I have been in situations where
[00:30:56.140 --> 00:31:00.300]   The power is out for an entire week. I don't when it's going to come back on and a day and a half
[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:04.940]   It's I'm I wish that apple had vetted its statement a little bit better by saying oh well
[00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:11.500]   That's why we we do care about the safety of because that's why we have our 911 feature and set up to automatically receive
[00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:19.020]   Emergency things emergency texts from but yeah, you're missing the point after a day and a half when infrastructure goes away completely
[00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:22.700]   That cell tower is going to be dead in about a day and a half
[00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:27.020]   Whereas there are going to be FM transmitters everywhere that you can simply pick things up
[00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:31.900]   This is why I after after my first multi-day hurricane related blackout
[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:37.260]   I made sure that I have multiple cheap $10 FM radios in the house because that's the way you're gonna
[00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:41.100]   So just buy a gosh darn radio, especially a hand one. Yeah, that's not a power
[00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:45.180]   But again, you already have this radio you already have this thing in your pocket
[00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:50.860]   You probably were already already really really concerned to make sure that we've got this charged up and if I have a battery charger
[00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:56.380]   I've got the charger charged up. You may not already have double a batteries and desell batteries set aside
[00:31:56.380 --> 00:32:01.180]   This is a I can't speak to how difficult it would be for apple to enable FM
[00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:05.020]   Enable or or add FM radio into these devices
[00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:11.820]   But I can't you can't deny that this is be a really really good thoughtful feature to put in the radio industry
[00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:14.460]   Has been lobbying for this. I remember nab a year. Well, I
[00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:18.140]   I don't think that the radio industry is lobbying for emergency reasons
[00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:20.540]   No, they just want you to listen to radio, please
[00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:23.740]   And to be fair, it's probably
[00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:26.460]   Not the manufacturers, but the cell the cell
[00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:32.060]   companies companies are against it would like you to listen to expensive streaming the ipods had this feature for a while
[00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:35.420]   Right, I thought companies. Yeah, the cell companies did not want it on phones. Yeah
[00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:39.580]   All right, let's take a break. We're gonna come back in just a second when we do
[00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:42.860]   I'd like to talk about the watch since rene and I both have red dots
[00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:45.660]   We're not it red dots
[00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:54.140]   Uh, and uh, there's an interesting article from harris diddio at a simko about how he you know how he's calculated sales numbers
[00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:58.700]   Which are pretty amazing, but first let's talk about our sponsor video

[00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:08.060]   Uh, how do you so how long have you had the your series three watch running? I just got mine yesterday
[00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:10.780]   So I can't listen a couple weeks battery life
[00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:14.620]   Uh, it's fine. I mean, I think it's even I think it's better
[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:20.700]   Better, but yeah, it seems like it's better. I don't I don't curse myself. Yeah now if you make a lot of phone calls
[00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:23.180]   We know that depletes the yes. Yeah, uh
[00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:26.300]   What about the lte issue
[00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:31.340]   We talked a lot about it on sunday and greg pharaoh who has a lot of engineering experience
[00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:35.340]   Says this is going to be a tough one to fix. I thought it'd be easy this captive portal problem
[00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:40.060]   Yeah, there's two problems one is I don't think it was clearly understood that
[00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:44.140]   Uh in order to use some of the functionality your iphone doesn't have to be with you
[00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:48.220]   But it still has to be on the network like things like like sms as opposed to ims
[00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:51.820]   You so that's where sms is get sent through the phone
[00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:56.460]   Well, your number still has to be active on the phone because it's not giving you a home
[00:35:56.460 --> 00:36:01.500]   Yes, it can be at home, but it has to be and I think a lot of reporters just put it in airplane mode and then went for a job
[00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:03.900]   Right and then had issues sending things like sms
[00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:09.900]   Really no, but it's also wasn't clearly spelled out like I don't think apple was clear about how you should you know
[00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:12.940]   How normal people expected to use it was just leaving your phone at home
[00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:16.700]   Not taking your phone with you putting in airplane mode and then also yeah, this capture a gate thing
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:18.780]   And I think there are a lot of people who were testing it
[00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:24.460]   They're they are engineers and by nature. They do not trust like they just will never use starbucks wifi for example
[00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:28.460]   And this absolutely is that why they missed it. Is that why they missed it? You think yeah, I mean
[00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:32.140]   I know people who've been using this watch for like three months four months and never noticed
[00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:33.420]   I'll be with it
[00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:36.700]   And I you know I know they go to coffee shops because I see how much coffee they drink
[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:39.260]   But they're not the kind of people who would join those networks
[00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:44.620]   But it's so the basic issue is that there are a lot of places that have wifi that use captured portals
[00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:48.860]   So for example, you might just have to agree as simple as agreeing to a terms of service and hitting okay
[00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:55.580]   But it could also be a username and password and there's no facility to do that on the apple watch if you've previously joined on your iphone
[00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:58.940]   It'll remember it and it'll just it'll work transparently on your apple watch
[00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:02.140]   But if you've never been there with your iphone and it tries to be an apple watch
[00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:06.380]   It'll just be stuck on wifi that can't connect and it won't go to lt
[00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:10.140]   I thought it was the other way around that if you had logged in on your iphone the apple watch said
[00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:15.500]   Oh, I know how to be there, but with the iphone not there it it can't get it. So it isn't that way
[00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:21.660]   It's uh, it's it it breaks lte it breaks all connectivity in places
[00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:29.180]   Open yeah, wifi access points would that use the captive portal technology? That's when a page pops up says log in agree to our terms
[00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:31.660]   It even if i've never been there before
[00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:34.620]   Yeah, if you oh that's terrible before it'll work
[00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:37.900]   But if it hasn't been there before because there's no web kit on the watch there's no way for it to pop up a way
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:40.700]   I thought it was the other way around I misunderstood the problem completely
[00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:42.220]   I might be mis-understand I
[00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:48.940]   Believe though, it's just there's no ability for a watch to join a new wifi point that has the captured what point technology
[00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:50.940]   I would try to
[00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:55.740]   Because it sees wifi and it always tries the way that the lte works is similar to how the gps works
[00:37:55.740 --> 00:38:00.140]   In that it tries every way possible not to have to use it for battery for battery reasons
[00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:03.820]   So it's incredibly conservative. It'll jump on your iphone instead of jumping on lte
[00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:09.900]   It'll jump on wifi if instead of jumping an lte it only goes to lte if it absolutely has to so it sees oh great
[00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:14.060]   Well, if I connection i'll just join that and then it gets stuck at the portal and can't continue
[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:17.980]   I'm a little you can you can explain something that i'm a little confused on
[00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:21.820]   So one of the reasons why i'm kind of interested in getting the lte for myself is
[00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:25.340]   Not only just the convenience, but also sometimes the battery
[00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:29.820]   I'm walking around with a dead battery in my phone. I would like to I like the idea that okay
[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:35.100]   Well, at least I can still receive text messages and emergency even if I can't you know help hop on instagram
[00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:41.740]   So if the phone is if my the phone is tethered to is just dead it's turned off no battery no power no nothing
[00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:43.980]   What can the lte watch do?
[00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:47.900]   Everything except for regular green bubble sms messages is my understanding
[00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:50.940]   Yeah, it does sense because sms is gone is done differently
[00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:56.380]   Well, well, I have a four. I mean t-mobile. I don't get 10 bucks a month. I have a t-mobile phone number
[00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:59.420]   It should work, but the e-sim doesn't like the e-sim has its own number
[00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:04.540]   But I believe that that number is not used. Yeah, it'll act like it's using your phone number and your phone number is no longer on the network
[00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:06.380]   Right that makes that's terrible
[00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:08.060]   That's really bad
[00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:15.020]   If if something it's it's okay to optimize things for messages because i can do magical things if it controls end-to-end
[00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:18.540]   But I think a lot of people are going to be thinking well again
[00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:23.020]   I'm going to go out for a run if I if I run into trouble or if I get lost or have a medical thing
[00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:30.700]   I can still send and receive a text message to my friends to my boss to my to my spouse who does not necessarily have
[00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:33.020]   messages on his phone and
[00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:41.260]   To have that to add the coda sill that will if you will get hit by car and you need to tell if your spouse that you're going to the hospital
[00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:45.740]   Don't worry so long as your phone is matches a certain
[00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:47.900]   Set of
[00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:49.900]   constrictions back at home in your office
[00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:54.620]   You might be able to get a text message out if that's the case that's
[00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:59.260]   Terrible that is a terrible implementation. That's not what people are expecting
[00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:03.100]   When apple says we have a phone that we haven't watched that has lte on it. That is
[00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:07.580]   Well, it's not what people got if they used for instance a samsung lte watch
[00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:12.060]   Uh, it was it was a phone, but of course it was huge
[00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:15.740]   But it was a phone. It did all the things your phone would do
[00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:17.580]   I'm boy
[00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:20.940]   I now I feel like I'd have to buy one and test it out because that's I
[00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:28.060]   I'm I'm not trying to come up with a catchphrase here. I that is I my first impression of that is that is
[00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:30.860]   Terrible that that means there's if
[00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:34.140]   Unless unless they're okay. I should shut up
[00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:38.860]   No, it will this there's there's things like you can't do long. I believe you can't do long distance phone calls
[00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:45.100]   You can't do roaming there's there's just an incredible amount of limitations on what they're they're able to proxy at this point
[00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:49.820]   And hopefully they'll improve it, but I haven't heard what the what the problem is or why
[00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:52.620]   It might be hard to fix
[00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:58.540]   Well, I mean everything it can be fixed in time. It's just a question of what what that e-sim is capable of doing given the implementation
[00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:00.540]   They're using it for
[00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:05.260]   Well, you should know before you buy one that there are some limitations totally and apps
[00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:07.580]   I think you know there's a lot of things that apps can't do yet
[00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:11.980]   Whether that's just a factor of those apps updating or whether it's limitations of what the apps can access or not
[00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:17.020]   Isn't clear to me. I think for us it's more we're more worried about battery life. I have to admit then
[00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:21.820]   Phone calls a battery life is actually yeah my experience as with Renee
[00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:25.020]   No, no, it's better phone calls, but if you're making phone calls, it's gonna drain
[00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:29.100]   Phone calls is about an hour about an hour a ton time is Apple spec
[00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:32.380]   Yep
[00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:34.380]   Yeah, and that's that's I mean
[00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:41.100]   It's wife. It does everything possible not to use lte because that is such a power hungry radio technology still
[00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:43.340]   Um, I don't think it just can't just
[00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:48.860]   I just don't think that people have people who have a walking to the store and they've got two
[00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:52.940]   They're looking at two different series three watches one cost a little bit more and has lte
[00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:57.100]   The other one costs a little bit less and does not the reason why they're going to say I want the else
[00:41:57.260 --> 00:42:00.460]   I can afford it. I would much rather have the p the lte model
[00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:02.860]   They are thinking about peace of mind
[00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:08.140]   They're thinking about I would the only reason why I take my phone with me when I run is in case there's an emergency or
[00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:12.140]   If if I if I'm going out with on a date and the babies
[00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:14.540]   I want to be able to make sure the babysitter can get in touch with there's a problem
[00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:17.180]   But I don't want to be bothered distracted by the phone again
[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:23.420]   My my difficulty with this is that I don't think that people who say oh lte for only a hundred dollars more
[00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:29.420]   I'll definitely get that they are not expecting it's a kind of lte that still requires
[00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:35.180]   And yeah, I mean that that's it's such a bad thing that I would think that
[00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:40.540]   My again first impressions with 10 minutes worth of knowledge about this this problem
[00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:47.500]   Is that I would I would almost think that apple would try not to call it an lte watch they would call it a we have a special
[00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:53.900]   Like tethering plus that under certain circumstances it will be able to behave like it is tethered to your phone
[00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:57.660]   Even though you are miles and miles away from the phone. That is I think they are
[00:42:57.660 --> 00:43:00.620]   Again, I think I think I think that
[00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:07.260]   When I looked at it and of course, I'm not going to be surprised by what it does and doesn't do when I ordered it
[00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:12.220]   I looked at the fact that I can leave my phone in my car at stinton beach and
[00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:17.980]   Not have to think about it and know that I can at least get some communication back and forth and and I admit that
[00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:23.500]   I don't have a lot of people that I interact with on a regular basis that aren't you know that aren't using either
[00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:26.380]   Some kind of some messaging program where I'm I mean I don't use SMS
[00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:32.380]   That often yeah, and if they're if everybody would just use apple products none of this would be a problem
[00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:34.860]   No, no, no, but I don't think that it's just gonna be apple products
[00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:39.420]   I think it's gonna be I mean if you're using slack if you're using messenger if you're using i'm i'm gonna
[00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:41.980]   Bet that those are gonna work
[00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:43.980]   watch
[00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:46.860]   I can you
[00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:54.620]   I think I think their design goal for this watch and maybe you know to Andy's point
[00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:57.180]   They should have called it the apple watch outdoors or something
[00:43:57.180 --> 00:44:01.660]   Is that you leave your phone at home and you go for a jog and if you have to do phony things while you're out on the jog
[00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:04.140]   You can do those but your phone is at home when you're doing it
[00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:07.820]   It's not it's not at all kippel yet of being an independent device
[00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:14.860]   Uh, it is selling well apple claim to be the biggest watchmaker in the world at the event
[00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:16.700]   um
[00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:19.980]   And uh according to a horist eddie who did the math
[00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:24.460]   Um, he believes that in fact, uh apple
[00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:32.460]   The he says apple sold okay, so let me give you the numbers rolex which is number two sold a million watches a year
[00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:38.300]   Uh rolex had sales of 4.7 billion last year that means about $4,700 a watch
[00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:42.620]   About right for rolex. That's the cheap rolex my estimate
[00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:50.860]   According to horus has been that apple sold about 15 million watches in the last 12 months at an average price of $330 that puts their
[00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:55.260]   revenue at 4.9 billion indeed 200 million higher
[00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:58.140]   Then rolex it also fits with apples
[00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:04.220]   Quote that their sales increased 50 that would have been from a roughly 2 million in q2
[00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:06.060]   to uh
[00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:08.060]   2016 to 3 million in q2
[00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:10.700]   2017
[00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:15.740]   Overall 33 million he says apple watch units he estimates have been sold since lost
[00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:18.460]   launch a 12 billion dollar
[00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:22.860]   Business that is quite a success story that is quite a trajectory
[00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:26.540]   And I see nothing wrong with those numbers. They all seem to work
[00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:34.860]   A lot of watches that's a lot of watches. I'm watching and I see more of and I see more and more of them all the time
[00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:38.860]   Uh, the funniest thing for me is the people that used to see me wearing apple watches
[00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:43.100]   Like I'll go into pay for something at a restaurant or I'll go to use my boarding pass at an airport
[00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:48.060]   Or I'll go to pick up something and the person at the counter now like holds up their apple watch. I got one too now
[00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:51.660]   Yeah, that was a big shift here. I think partly because the price went down
[00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:58.300]   Uh, you're you're just seeing them everywhere now. I'm serious one is way down now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's that was one
[00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:02.700]   That was one of my favorite announcements that now that they're a lot of companies have are sort of
[00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:09.660]   Been alerted to the fact that you can sell a really good fitness device that wears like a watch for
[00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:12.060]   200 to 280
[00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:17.740]   And that's where a lot of the cool stuff with fitbit stuff and garment stuff and other makers are really going
[00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:20.300]   So the fact that apple is right there in the middle of it
[00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:25.340]   That's they're they're they're charging no more for the apple watch if you want even if you want to get in just on the ground floor
[00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:28.540]   That any other maker is is charging and that's
[00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:32.460]   Even the minimum buy-in is one of the best
[00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:36.300]   Devices in this category you can possibly buy that's that's exciting
[00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:42.460]   I love this story from uh in the wall street journal
[00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:49.820]   Samsung makes about four billion dollars more a year making iPhone 10 parts than it does for the galaxy s8
[00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:52.140]   There's a story like two years ago
[00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:56.860]   Yeah, where they did uh they did a samsung event they announced a phone and the people there said it was it looked more like
[00:46:56.860 --> 00:46:59.740]   A parts demo for apple than an actual phone event
[00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:04.700]   And I keep remit thinking back to that because now you have the iphone 10 which uses quite a lot of samsung again
[00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:07.820]   Well, it's the samsung screen right although they're trying to second source it with lg
[00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:10.380]   I think it's a sam the panel is samsung
[00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:14.700]   Yeah, they're doing a lot of other stuff underneath it, but the the raw all that is right is samsung
[00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:19.980]   Just I mean again this has to do with the vast number of phones apple cells
[00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:23.500]   Um the s8 will sell about 50 million phones
[00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:26.300]   in in uh in this first year
[00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:30.060]   Uh, but that's I mean that's a that's probably you know
[00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:34.380]   A half or you know a third what apple's gonna sell
[00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:40.220]   Yeah, that's why and I think that we I mean it it seems like it's a good business model for samsung at the moment
[00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:46.780]   But if if you want to ask imagine technology imagination technologies, uh, you know how it looked yeah, they relied on apple
[00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:49.260]   They were the gpu manufacturer till apple said
[00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:51.740]   And nevermind
[00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:54.220]   And now they're and I think they basically bust right
[00:47:55.020 --> 00:48:01.260]   You feel like apple would love to not be you know sharing ideas or talking to samsung about anything
[00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:07.980]   Uh, and you know at some point that could slide out from under my think that the the sheer numbers that they have to produce still
[00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:11.740]   And still leaves them dependent on samsung, but I don't know if it'll be like that forever
[00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:16.460]   Oh malach had a great uh post on his blog ome.com
[00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:21.100]   about when when the i when the iphone was announced on just
[00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:27.340]   Something we don't really pay that much attention to with the but the the chip fab
[00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:33.420]   That what apple is done with custom silicon is kind of remarkable really
[00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:41.100]   Um, this is an incredibly fast chip. I don't know if you need a chip with the speed of an a11 bionic in any phone
[00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:46.460]   But you notice it but you just like on the or the a 10 on an iphone 7 if you went into portrait motor
[00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:49.500]   You did some really intense ar you'd feel it pegging the processor
[00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:52.140]   I say I assume it was pegging least because the phone would get hot
[00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:55.420]   And you might have some issues with like not deal breaker issues
[00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:58.940]   But it would just like you'd feel like you were pushing that thing into the red as hard as you could go
[00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:01.980]   We're on iphone 8. It just it feels like it's about halfway
[00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:06.860]   Maybe like you're you're just cruising along and you're doing portrait mode and portrait lighting and ar you're letting the cpu
[00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:11.180]   Handle all the scaling and all the you know, and you're letting the jeep you render all those textures
[00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:17.980]   And it's just fine. I think the overhead is what's really nice with the a11. Yeah as well as all the neural nets the head the headroom
[00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:24.220]   Yeah, yeah, there's a lot of headroom you have a lot more processor than you'll like the neural net scare me leo
[00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:27.980]   I heard them describing the neural nets. This was like the I don't want to say creepy because that's not the right word
[00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:31.980]   But the most uh thought provoking moment from you when they were talking about the
[00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:36.540]   a11 chip was they were talking about training it and they had two different neural networks
[00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:43.980]   One that would identify faces and one that would try to fool it and they're basically training each other and no one is talking about coding machines here
[00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:46.220]   They're talking about these things like they're training pets
[00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:50.940]   And they're they're just talking that and there was another article about it would not relate to apple
[00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:56.060]   But where someone's like it's gotten way more accurate, but we have no idea how anymore because they're basically just talking to each other
[00:49:56.060 --> 00:50:01.660]   Well, and i worked in it. I worked in a life company
[00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:04.300]   um in the 90s early 90s
[00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:09.660]   I'm in 90s. Um, and you know a lot of it. Uh, we we were training training pets
[00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:13.500]   The problem is you just give it goals you say, okay
[00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:19.420]   I want I'm gonna give you a goal of what you what you need to do and you allow it to um, you know, uh
[00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:24.060]   Non-entropic reduction mapping if we've been my friends from an arca
[00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:30.140]   Um or listening but but it um, but basically how do you derive a solution that makes that go away?
[00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:36.300]   You know and but it but it is beyond a person because it's calculating so fast. It's trying to figure out
[00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:38.620]   You know and it may come up with entirely
[00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:42.060]   Uh novel solutions to something that may to be good and maybe bad
[00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:47.980]   You know that might may do something completely off the because it's decided that because you didn't create another constraint that says
[00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:50.460]   Yeah, but don't you know don't kill all your friends
[00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:56.060]   You do the best you can but don't kill it because you know, you know, not that it did it this in this case
[00:50:56.060 --> 00:50:59.260]   But you know when you talk about it like you know an organism you just be said
[00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:03.340]   You know stay alive as long as you can and it may decide that the best thing to do is to you know
[00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:08.140]   You know eat all its friends and and do all the other things and and so so and that's that makes sense
[00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:12.060]   So you have to build a constraint that says that and so that defines that but it is
[00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:15.580]   Anytime you're working with neural networks or artificial life
[00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:17.580]   especially
[00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:21.980]   You are definitely dealing with some kind of bionic organism that is
[00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:27.500]   Uh making calculations about it from its from its from its own personal point of view
[00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:30.220]   Um at a rate that you can't do from the outside
[00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:33.660]   I do have to say that this is apple secret sauce because
[00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:37.260]   Uh, I think they would love to make every single piece
[00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:40.540]   Inside the phone and uh to quote ohm
[00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:44.940]   Every single event leaves me more in awe of apple's semiconductor group
[00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:50.540]   Apples ability to design custom silicon its new a 11 bionic processing unit a new gpu
[00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:56.780]   That's the one they took off of uh imagines shoulders new image processing chips that we we should mention this new
[00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:59.260]   One thing about the series three watch is
[00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:03.180]   Mon noticeably faster. Yeah, it now has uh, its own s3
[00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:10.300]   Dual core processor which makes a huge difference low power wireless chips the w2 chip true depth camera system
[00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:13.420]   Uh, there's 21 letters in the alphabet left leo
[00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:18.380]   It's it's really remarkable and I think that if if you
[00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:22.780]   As as much as I carp on apple for non innovating and so forth the
[00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:28.380]   The one thing that apple really has shown and I guess this is really where tim cook strength is because he comes from
[00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:32.460]   You know a production point of view and and logistics point of view
[00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:40.060]   Is their ability to make it more and more and more of this phone and they've really become a a giant in terms of
[00:52:40.060 --> 00:52:47.340]   Controlors econ's they just every all the clue and sign. Yeah, ultimately. That's the goal, right? They would prefer not to buy anything from sam's song
[00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:50.700]   They'd love not to buy anything from quarkam right at quarkam especially
[00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:56.220]   Does the eight have any quarkam processors? Yeah, because it still has to run on verizon and sprint in the us
[00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:58.620]   Same quarkam boat. Yeah
[00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:04.300]   That was another argument about the including fm capabilities that they were using intel and quarkam
[00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:07.020]   Chips on depending on the model
[00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:11.740]   Even within the iphone eight would say and the other the other problem is remember that there was a
[00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:15.660]   I think with the seven I think was with the seven people were noticing the other gosh
[00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:18.540]   How come these how come this these two exact same?
[00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:23.340]   iPhones are benchmarking differently from the same location on lte speeds
[00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:29.180]   And was because the I think was the intel chips were faster than they were much slower. They were half as fast
[00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:32.060]   I'm sorry the other way around but the and so
[00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:36.780]   Apples apples answer. I think was to slow down the quarkam's motor
[00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:40.060]   So make sure that all of iphones would perform the same way
[00:53:40.060 --> 00:53:45.100]   It's actually one of the points in quarkam's lawsuit against apple. Yeah, they're not too happy about that
[00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:49.420]   Well, I happen a lot. I know one thing to know about one would be too happy
[00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:54.220]   I know I mean by the way, I should mention quarkam's a sponsor. So I have a dog in this hunt that but uh
[00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:58.860]   That happens often with our our chips as well, you know, the chips are
[00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:02.380]   You know the chips that we have in our computers a lot of times can go faster than that
[00:54:02.380 --> 00:54:03.980]   You know, we overclock them and do all kinds of things
[00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:12.700]   But but a lot of times the chips they'll decide that the reason one chips more expensive or or less expensive is because as they tested it
[00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:17.900]   It tested it made it through all the tests at this speed. They're all coming out of the same fab
[00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:20.220]   It's just like they they but they well worse than that
[00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:24.700]   I've learned not I'm gonna stop by an i7 processors for laptops
[00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:27.100]   because of thermal constraints the
[00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:31.340]   The general the latest generations of i7s are so hot that they've
[00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:34.300]   Rarely if ever run at full speed
[00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:39.820]   So you're if you look at the clocks the nominal clock speed of an i7 processor in a lap top
[00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:44.060]   Almost immediately you're never going to hit that because they be it's just too hot
[00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:50.460]   So uh, I'm I'm realized i'm wasting i always buy my sevens and i'm realized i think i'm wasting money
[00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:52.860]   Because i'm never really getting the speed that you're supposed to get
[00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:55.100]   You mean an apple thing with like when they dual score
[00:54:55.100 --> 00:54:58.220]   Yeah, I just use an i5
[00:54:58.220 --> 00:55:00.540]   Uh, I don't think I don't think that evens out over
[00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:05.020]   You should look you should look at what happens because of the not true in desktops
[00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:09.180]   But if thermal constraints within laptops, you should look at what happens to these i7s
[00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:14.060]   They're rarely running at full clock speed because I know with video with some video especially real-time video
[00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:17.900]   We definitely could see the difference between i5s and i7s. Are you using laptops?
[00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:22.380]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, laptops. Yeah. I mean it was definitely like a night and day
[00:55:23.180 --> 00:55:27.900]   Really kind of problem. It shouldn't even be night and day. I mean it's the that's the long time ago. It wasn't
[00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:34.060]   Yeah, well, that's right. Oh, no. I'm not talking about the the latest the skylakes the cave. Yeah, the coffee likes
[00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:39.420]   The latest processors a lot of people will just tell you not to give until the extra money and you're fine
[00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:43.420]   Yeah, uh, the one thing though, uh
[00:55:43.420 --> 00:55:47.340]   The one apple bite when apple does multi source things because they make things at such huge scale
[00:55:47.420 --> 00:55:53.180]   So sometimes they've multi source the or dual source the processor or the screens or other source of technology is they set
[00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:59.260]   Uh, they set a sort of a spec that they need and some manufacturers blow right past that spec and some just achieve it
[00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:01.260]   But for apple as long as they meet that spec
[00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:05.020]   So it's almost like if the world if the if to qualify for the olympics
[00:56:05.020 --> 00:56:06.860]   You've got to run a hundred meters in 10 seconds
[00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:10.300]   They don't care if you run at nine or eight to them as long as you run in 10 seconds
[00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:15.020]   You're qualified for iphone. So whether the chipset is more powerful or the modem is faster
[00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:20.940]   They they have set a limit in what they want for that phone and that is what they are going to ship with so the individual parts
[00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:26.300]   It's an it's like an implementation detail and it's a super nerdy detail, but they just lock that down way in advance
[00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:34.220]   So let's take a break when we come back apples created a new page on its website that will make many people feel good until they
[00:56:34.220 --> 00:56:38.860]   See the transparency reports and learn what the governments have been asking apple for lately
[00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:43.820]   We'll talk about that in just a second, but first a word from our sponsor word press dot com
[00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:47.100]   8% of the web runs word press
[00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:52.780]   That's that's dominant. That's dominant and there's good reason for it
[00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:59.980]   WordPress is the best way to create your next website if you're a business and you don't have your own website
[00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:04.060]   I don't mean your own facebook page. I don't mean your own twitter account. I mean your own
[00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:06.380]   domain your own
[00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:10.460]   Website you're missing the boat. You're really uh, you're not modern
[00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:13.340]   It's like not having a phone
[00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:16.860]   Everyday millions of people go online to search for local businesses
[00:57:16.860 --> 00:57:22.460]   You know it doesn't have to be a tech company could be a wedding photographer could be a restaurant could be a plumber
[00:57:22.460 --> 00:57:24.940]   You have to be online
[00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:29.420]   And it is a great way to generate more business and more traffic and more loyalty
[00:57:29.420 --> 00:57:33.900]   And I know why you haven't done it because it's you don't want to be a web designer
[00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:38.460]   But you don't have to be with wordpress.com wordpress.com makes it easier

[00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:36.140]   You know, sometimes they they always I think their heart's always in the right place
[00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:44.940]   But sometimes their actions aren't quite the same, but I think this is exactly what a company like apple needs to do apple dot com slash
[00:59:44.940 --> 00:59:47.020]   privacy
[00:59:47.020 --> 00:59:51.020]   Where it's not just add copy about privacy, but it really tells you
[00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:56.780]   Uh, what apple's philosophy is about privacy their approach to privacy
[00:59:56.780 --> 00:59:59.740]   It has a tab to manage your privacy
[01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:03.420]   Which is really important how to secure your device
[01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:08.380]   Uh, this is the kind of thing with videos and instructions that everybody
[01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:12.460]   You know, you get you get your uh less techy friends to go
[01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:17.260]   Visit this why to factor is important how to turn it on
[01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:21.820]   All of that stuff and then of course you go to the transparency report
[01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:25.500]   And you and you find out oh my god
[01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:31.500]   Despite all the things apple's doing it's it's getting harder and harder for a tech company these days
[01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:35.500]   Uh to stay private we've we've the number of
[01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:41.180]   Requests for information by government from uh from apple has
[01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:48.860]   Doubled this year and it's not those that's not those kind of average everyday requests that uh, you know
[01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:52.220]   Those have actually gone down the it's received
[01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:57.580]   Uh, 6% reduction in the request to access devices
[01:00:57.580 --> 01:01:04.380]   But the national security orders those are the scary ones the ones apple can't even tell you about
[01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:10.300]   Those are spiking i'm sorry what i say doubled tripled
[01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:17.820]   Triple the secret and classified orders have tripled over the last year and this comes from apple's own transparency report
[01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:21.420]   Uh, i believe they were low previously and now they're coming closer to the industry
[01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:23.420]   They were low before yeah
[01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:27.980]   They were getting roughly one third. What a microsoft or a google didn't that might make sense because they're not a server company
[01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:30.620]   Right by nature, but now they're they're getting up to those
[01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:37.740]   It is in a huge number you're right so apple got 30 000 demands to access 233 000 devices in the first half of the year
[01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:39.500]   That's down 6%
[01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:46.460]   But they got 3000 requests for data on 43 000 accounts like icloud content stored photos email context
[01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:51.340]   Device backups those are down by 15 compared to last year
[01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:55.820]   They can't say exactly how many national security orders
[01:01:55.820 --> 01:02:02.380]   They've received of course that's forbidden allowed they're not allowed to so they have to give you a range
[01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:04.780]   13,000
[01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:06.780]   250 to 13,499
[01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:15.340]   Uh nsl's affecting between 9 000 and 9,249 accounts and that is tripling
[01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:21.100]   That is the largest number of national security orders apple has ever reported in five years of transparency
[01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:23.980]   reports
[01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:27.020]   All the companies are now doing these transparency reports so we can at least know
[01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:30.780]   That's not just us government by the way. This is worldwide, right?
[01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:34.300]   Lots of i'm not sure i didn't check
[01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:39.660]   Think so is it i don't know now that's a good you're right let me uh
[01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:43.740]   This is their first biannual transparency
[01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:46.540]   I know they have separate websites up for different countries
[01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:52.380]   But I don't know if it what the requirement the legal requirements or or legal restrictions are in reporting on the country by country basis
[01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:55.500]   Well, here's the good news apple.com/privacy you can read it
[01:02:55.500 --> 01:03:00.300]   They would if they're being honest who would probably have to make it international because
[01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:03.820]   Remember that a lot of the government the us government has a lot of like
[01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:11.180]   A lot of mutual agreements with other agent other international agencies that says that if you we're not allowed to surveil our people
[01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:16.060]   But hey france would be really nice if you were to surveil these four people and tell us what you find out
[01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:21.420]   Well, actually the nsl's are us only because because that's that we're the ones who us else
[01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:24.460]   But there is a table in here that breaks it down country by country
[01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:29.420]   So you can you can read that and find out if which countries are asking for your information
[01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:34.700]   Does it kind of I think that's why increasingly they're doing like a lot of the new stuff they've built out
[01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:37.980]   It whatever the data you have like for example, they don't want to know it
[01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:41.900]   For the upcoming iMessage think yeah, absolutely or the the syri data sync
[01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:44.940]   They encrypt it on your device using the keys on that device
[01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:46.780]   They transit it through apple service
[01:03:46.780 --> 01:03:52.620]   But it is a it is a binary blob that they have absolutely no insight into and then they give it to your other device
[01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:57.980]   And they delete it from their servers as rapidly as possible so that there is absolutely nothing of yours that is maintained on there
[01:03:57.980 --> 01:04:06.220]   Yeah, read read. This is a really well done. I encourage other companies to do what to step beyond a transparent support. It's a full kind of privacy page
[01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:07.740]   uh
[01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:12.060]   Much more than a privacy policy about what apple does apple.com/privacy
[01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:18.700]   Another thing that's really cool is that they are built like as they are doing new product development and they highlighted this with things like face ID
[01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:24.940]   It's not that at the very end they say we've made face ID here lawyers go go and give us a yula that makes us private
[01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:30.380]   It's they have the privacy team in there from the beginning of this of the idea for the product
[01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:34.700]   Challenging it along the ways and all the different ways that they have to do it and maintain privacy
[01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:41.500]   Up to and including things like you cannot report that you have this type of data on your device because someone would know that that data exists then
[01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:46.140]   On that device and that's information and you have to make sure that you know there's zero knowledge coming out of this
[01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:49.660]   So they're designing it to be as much as this design first is privacy first
[01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:52.620]   And I think that apple really views privacy
[01:04:52.620 --> 01:05:00.300]   As a you know key differentiator because they can do things because they're not running advertising they can do things that that their competitors
[01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:03.260]   Yeah, it's a market it's like really on the platform. Yeah
[01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:06.540]   On the other hand it's a disadvantage because Siri isn't as smart
[01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:11.820]   They can't do a google now style informational page things like that because they don't know enough
[01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:12.860]   Yeah
[01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:18.300]   Well, and and they and they know that they're stepping away from those markets thinking that they you know, the decision is definitely
[01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:25.340]   I think made that that privacy is more important to their consumers than necessarily being smarter and people will make their their own decision about that
[01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:29.020]   But I think the fewer windows users created over Cortana
[01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:34.540]   Microsoft's speech assistant because in order if you were going to use Cortana on windows 10
[01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:39.980]   You had to create all sorts of information going back to the servers because that's how Cortana needed to work
[01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:42.460]   And people really resented that they turn it off
[01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:47.980]   And you know, they're able to do things like for instance, uh, you know, they're they're starting to turn off the tracking
[01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:49.980]   So it's throwing throwing tracking away
[01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:51.980]   Um, you know after a day
[01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:55.980]   They are also turning off auto play on the videos
[01:05:55.980 --> 01:06:00.780]   I mean and I have to admit that I don't use safari that often and now I find myself every morning
[01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:06.220]   I've kind of moved a lot of my stuff over to you know, I get up really early and and I kind of surf around the web and
[01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:11.020]   And uh, and I have suddenly realized oh my gosh if I use safari, I don't have to there's no
[01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:15.500]   No video playing ever and there's per site settings you can tell it to remember
[01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:17.980]   Reader mode for this one site. How do you hate this site?
[01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:21.820]   You can tell to always show me this site in reader mode, which is oh, I love that too
[01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:27.180]   See that's enough to make me want to abandon my microsoft surface studio as much as I love this screen
[01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:31.100]   Because I can't run safari on it and I would love to have those features. It's a
[01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:34.060]   The auto start video by itself is
[01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:41.580]   This is cute. It'll be okay, but but I was like, but now I'm just like finding myself. Oh, no
[01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:43.180]   It's
[01:06:43.180 --> 01:06:44.220]   Crazy
[01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:48.300]   Yes, you open up chrome and you're like oh my gosh. I can't handle it like then you get overwhelmed
[01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:51.340]   You get overwhelmed as soon as you're used to silence suddenly. It's like everyone's yelling at me
[01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:55.020]   I don't understand. Yeah, yeah, I don't know what happened, but it's like
[01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:59.180]   All at once maybe seven to nine months ago
[01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:04.140]   It must have been like what it was like in 70s when like venereal disease suddenly like made
[01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:10.780]   I don't want raps, cuz there are drugs anymore people are I mean because it's not it's not just it's not just the desktop stuff
[01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:13.100]   I used a year ago today
[01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:15.740]   I would be on my ipad pro
[01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:20.620]   Listening to music like in the background while I'm working and I'm doing research like on the way
[01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:24.060]   But I can't do that anymore because I will be going to some
[01:07:24.060 --> 01:07:31.660]   Completely legitimate site and some ad will auto play and then grab the the grab the speaker away from my music app
[01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:39.580]   And because the music app doesn't have a setting that says essentially be aware of when you've had your you've had control the speaker taken away from you
[01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:42.060]   And then grab it back at first opportunity
[01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:48.700]   I then have to tab back into that music app restart the the music playing and this is why like now I have to listen to this again
[01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:51.340]   It's not the worst worst burden in the world
[01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:57.660]   But it annoys me that now I have to listen to music through a separate device because otherwise these stupid ads that I don't care about
[01:07:57.660 --> 01:08:04.860]   Never once watched more than two seconds of how long it took to figure out where the close button is and then click the damn thing
[01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:07.660]   It's I don't I don't
[01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:15.900]   I really want a a good discussion with the people who sell these ads that tell me why is there anybody who doesn't
[01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:23.340]   Hate these things. Does it make me if if I were within if I were if there's a hundred point scale of buying product day and product be
[01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:30.060]   And product be on the day of purchasing decision hit me with a pop of video ad I would not buy product be that would be the
[01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:35.180]   That would be the reason well and I i'm i'm looking at you bloomberg and cnet both start their
[01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:41.020]   Videos automatically and I use the ages cna I go to those pages all the time during the shows
[01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:46.700]   I've just you know, it's very frustrating. Yeah, uh, but but apple affect to back to security though
[01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:49.420]   It's important that apple not only trumpet
[01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:53.100]   One of the big one of the key advantages of their entire platform
[01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:58.300]   But also educate people on why they should care to begin with I I know that I believe that more
[01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:01.740]   iPhone users and mac users care about privacy then
[01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:07.660]   Users of any other phone or any other desktop. However, I don't believe that most even iphone users
[01:09:08.140 --> 01:09:12.700]   Are terribly aware of how important it is that they be on alert about such things
[01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:17.340]   Because it's it's just one of the things that makes it really difficult
[01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:21.820]   Uh to fight this battle is that yes, you can decide that i'm going to use all the
[01:09:21.820 --> 01:09:25.260]   I'm going to take advantage of everything that apple does for me to protect my privacy
[01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:27.580]   But as soon as you go on to the web
[01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:31.900]   Okay, you've just lost the entire ball games as you visit any website
[01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:37.260]   Uh, and you really it's just important for apple to tell people here is what it's like here is what the
[01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:39.580]   We are we are we keep you in this beautiful
[01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:42.460]   impenetrable dome
[01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:46.540]   Uh, but here is what the here is what the mutant fighting is like outside the dome
[01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:50.140]   Here's what the colonial marines have to put up with every second of their lives
[01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:57.340]   It's just it's the the scariest thing that I do for a lot of people is when I suggest that they install ghostery
[01:09:57.340 --> 01:10:02.700]   Or it's some sort of ad blocker and so why does this okay? Why is there like the number 41
[01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:06.300]   Uh next to the little ghost icon. I say well to
[01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:07.980]   Well, George
[01:10:07.980 --> 01:10:09.020]   That's how many
[01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:16.300]   Trackers and beacons and add things it stopped from from communicating and then they realized that so for the past several
[01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:18.700]   God and how to notice how many years
[01:10:18.700 --> 01:10:25.980]   Every single website I hit has been communicating back to various alien mother ships at least three dozen times. Yeah. Yeah, jordan
[01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:28.700]   That's how bad things is
[01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:33.820]   You still you still you want to take back some of the comments you you you lofted at me in 2015 about trusting google
[01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:43.420]   Well, we had a big long conversation on sunday. I we don't have time for it here today, but about uh silicon valley kind of losing
[01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:47.900]   the trust of america and uh and how uh
[01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:53.900]   Government regulate expect government regulators start moving in on our big tech companies because
[01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:54.860]   uh
[01:10:54.860 --> 01:11:03.740]   This kind of silicon valley which was you know for many of us kind of oh, this is the this is the source of innovation and growth in this country
[01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:07.020]   Is now being seen as i'm starting to be seen as the enemy
[01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:09.820]   Yeah, um
[01:11:09.820 --> 01:11:14.220]   Let's see when you find go ahead. Go ahead. Sorry. No, just again not not to turn not to
[01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:17.020]   I can guess what the conversation was like
[01:11:17.020 --> 01:11:21.660]   Uh, that you don't want to get that you don't want to get into because it takes much time. Well, it's a good conversation. Yeah, I didn't
[01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:28.300]   It's not the way you find when you find out that okay number one here's how many like russian-backed
[01:11:28.540 --> 01:11:33.500]   Organizations were buying ads to keep keep divisions stirring during the election
[01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:39.020]   So, how come well, how come if they took out like a regular a regular political ad they'd have to identify themselves
[01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:45.020]   But they weren't they weren't forced to identify themselves on facebook or google said well because in 2010 google
[01:11:45.020 --> 01:11:52.300]   Ask the as the federal election commissioners. Is it okay if we don't have to actually comply with that because look how teeny these ads are
[01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:55.180]   And they said okay, you could do that google then facebook says hey
[01:11:55.660 --> 01:11:59.900]   You let google not have things on their ads. You should let it okay fine look
[01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:05.020]   From car ride home. I don't want arguments you can have what google has since like
[01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:11.180]   Facebook has finally started to come forward on all of this they're they've taught partly because congress is as
[01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:13.100]   Yeah, but they're feet to the fire
[01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:16.300]   But they've they have said that they are going to let people see
[01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:20.140]   Well, part of the problem was that these ads these russian ads were purchased
[01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:23.420]   But nobody could see him except the people they were targeted at facebook said now
[01:12:23.420 --> 01:12:27.740]   We're going to let you see the ads so you can you know these these ads aren't going to be dark anymore
[01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:31.100]   Uh, I think that's not just not just for political ads
[01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:35.900]   But you can just click every ad you click on where it came from and and it will show you here are the other ads at this company
[01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:39.500]   This buyer has already also bought that would be interesting
[01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:42.540]   Yeah, if you see what the internet what is it the internet research
[01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:45.980]   But do they call themselves internet research committee or something the russian
[01:12:45.980 --> 01:12:51.660]   Um arm that's buying all these ads if you see that they bought ads on all sides of the equation
[01:12:52.060 --> 01:12:55.260]   It might be oh, there's something you might be able to put a thread together
[01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:56.300]   What's on moosan scurro?
[01:12:56.300 --> 01:13:03.180]   Yeah, look how look how quickly things happen when a when a company is terrified that congress people are going to start regulating their industries
[01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:06.940]   Things happen real quick. Uh, the internet research agency
[01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:11.660]   That's a good name, isn't it for a russian disinformation operation
[01:13:11.660 --> 01:13:14.540]   Uh a couple of quick things here. Let's see
[01:13:14.540 --> 01:13:18.860]   The crackling earpiece issue which I never experienced
[01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:24.060]   In the iphone 8 has been fixed ios updated it was software
[01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:28.060]   11.0.2. I never experienced it. Did you anybody? No
[01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:30.540]   No, but it was even a small apple
[01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:34.060]   It says a small percentage of users, but small percentage of iphone levels is huge
[01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:42.300]   Thousands maybe millions. Yeah, so 1102 is out it fixes that crackling issue addresses an issue that caused cause some photos to be hidden
[01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:45.020]   Esmine encrypted emails wouldn't open
[01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:47.260]   um
[01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:51.740]   I'm actually already on the because I guess I stayed on the beta and now i'm at 11.1 on the beta
[01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:56.140]   Yep, so that's public beta, I guess right because i'm not a developer and the developer
[01:13:56.140 --> 01:14:02.060]   There are some people who are confused because they didn't get 11.0.1 last week and I think they mistake the beta program for an early access program
[01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:03.820]   But it's it's really a beta program
[01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:04.300]   Right
[01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:11.260]   So you don't get like you don't get the normal releases and then the next day developers got 11.1 and i think two days later the public beta got a
[01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:13.580]   Should I uh turn that off you think
[01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:17.580]   It depends if you still want to be part of the beta program and you're getting 11.1
[01:14:17.580 --> 01:14:21.500]   I just said it's not an early access program, but you are getting it before other people are getting it
[01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:25.820]   So if you're happy to continue to be on the beta, that's fine. Otherwise, you just go into general
[01:14:25.820 --> 01:14:29.020]   Settings general profiles you delete the beta profile
[01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:31.740]   You reboot and you won't be getting further data
[01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:33.020]   Yeah, I might do that
[01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:36.460]   I did it just because I knew 11 was going to come out before I got back from vacation
[01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:38.780]   So I wanted to have 11 on there
[01:14:38.780 --> 01:14:43.500]   During my vacation and I have to say I love iOS 11, especially on an ipad pro
[01:14:44.140 --> 01:14:46.140]   It is fantastic
[01:14:46.140 --> 01:14:49.820]   The best thing for me that the best like hidden feature for me is that there was always these problems
[01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:51.820]   Like when you used to cms for example
[01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:56.220]   Just reordering web widgets or anything that allowed you to reorder web widgets and because of drag and drop
[01:14:56.220 --> 01:15:02.700]   I can reorder anything on so far now. So we're just like we're dragging things from files dropping it into droople pulling the images around it
[01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:05.980]   All just it's just particularly works. Wow, that's an interesting use case. I didn't even think of
[01:15:05.980 --> 01:15:07.820]   Yeah, it's interesting
[01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:11.820]   I have really beefed up my control center. I don't think there's any more room on the screen for
[01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:17.740]   For more buttons that video recorder is amazing the screen recorder. Yeah, there's a lot of stuff in there
[01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:22.380]   I loved the apple tv remote. I can do a quick note one thing you might want to I wish you could take out
[01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:27.500]   But you can't the bluetooth and Wi-Fi button those don't do what you think they might do
[01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:32.620]   No, they changed their behavior. They don't do anything or what what do they do terminate the current connection?
[01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:38.140]   Okay, so if you're currently on and they terminate and they terminate with external connections, right? I mean they
[01:15:39.820 --> 01:15:48.940]   It doesn't turn off the radio. So the problem they were trying to solve is that people were hitting those buttons and then not understanding why they're apple pencil or they're apple watch or something else didn't work anymore
[01:15:48.940 --> 01:15:51.660]   So now what that does is it'll those things aren't gonna work
[01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:57.660]   Yeah, but it's not transparent to like I guess mainstream people that that's how that technology is still turn off bluetooth
[01:15:57.660 --> 01:15:59.260]   You just have to do it in settings
[01:15:59.260 --> 01:16:04.300]   You want to turn off the radio you go to settings if you want to kill whatever the current connection is like you're in starbucks
[01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:06.300]   And you really don't want to use starbucks Wi-Fi
[01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:11.420]   You hit the Wi-Fi button it'll kill starbucks Wi-Fi, but it'll keep sending Wi-Fi between your phone and your apple
[01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:14.220]   That's actually useful if they would communicate that
[01:16:14.220 --> 01:16:18.620]   Yes, oftentimes that's all I want to do and I have to turn off Wi-Fi
[01:16:18.620 --> 01:16:23.580]   But will I really don't want is just whatever I that Wi-Fi signal i'm on right now that I don't really want to be on
[01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:27.020]   Leave me alone at and tea leave me alone. Yeah, yeah, XFINITY is a good example
[01:16:27.020 --> 01:16:32.700]   Uh, the XFINITY Wi-Fi which is everywhere in petaluma. I don't want to be on it because a lot of times there's nothing on it
[01:16:33.180 --> 01:16:37.420]   Uh, so I turn off Wi-Fi, but I really don't want to turn off Wi-Fi. That's overkill
[01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:42.940]   So that's so they just need to do a better job of communicating that those control center buttons don't turn off
[01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:47.500]   Wi-Fi and bluetooth they disconnect the current Wi-Fi or bluetooth connection
[01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:52.300]   It's the same with split screen and ipad a lot of people just thought it was gone because they couldn't drag from the left of the screen anymore to start
[01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:58.060]   A split view you have to do it from the dock now and they just they didn't know what was wrong their ipad was just broken because none of that stuff
[01:16:58.060 --> 01:17:00.220]   Yeah, there are pop-ups that eventually come up
[01:17:00.620 --> 01:17:05.980]   But there are hundreds of millions of people use these things and there's no clean way to educate them and that's you know, that's the apple
[01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:11.740]   Lost effects. Yeah, they do they do videos and stuff, but they don't there's no manuals. Nobody would read them anyway, even if they made them
[01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:17.820]   So anyway, if you want to turn off like really turn off Wi-Fi and bluetooth you still can just have to do in settings
[01:17:17.820 --> 01:17:22.300]   And actually this is a better explanation than the oh my god. It doesn't turn off bluetooth
[01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:28.060]   It does actually something very useful. It's just not what you think it was. It wasn't what you thought it used to do
[01:17:28.380 --> 01:17:33.980]   Is that what it used to do? I'm I'm still waiting for my long press to choose specifically among several bluetooth and
[01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:36.700]   Things to connect through you can yeah
[01:17:36.700 --> 01:17:43.420]   Long press long press gives you more it doesn't let I don't think oh no it gives you more choices. It doesn't give you all the right? Okay, never mind
[01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:49.180]   That's not long press is 3d touch. Sorry long press on ipad
[01:17:49.180 --> 01:17:55.740]   I did don't say it gives it does it is nice. It does give you a lot of options. Yeah, I really like that
[01:17:55.740 --> 01:17:57.740]   I think I think there's still a few things that
[01:17:57.740 --> 01:18:04.700]   That the iphone sends you two settings for that you feel like I feel like you could just pass me the salt
[01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:10.860]   Shake or that's right there at your table rather than ask me to get up and go into the kitchen and get another salt
[01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:15.980]   It's hard aggressive. It's hard think about it
[01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:19.420]   I mean there's so many users there's so many different ways of thinking about it
[01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:26.060]   There's only so much screen real estate. It's this ui stuff is is I can imagine the debates that go on internally?
[01:18:26.060 --> 01:18:33.180]   Probably all the people hate learning anything right right? I don't want to know that there's this thing called Wi-Fi
[01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:39.020]   I wanted to believe that ideally it would just be intuitive and it would do kind of what you intuitively thought it would do
[01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:45.820]   But that's you know everybody got has a different intuition about all this and some people have nothing no knowledge of how things work
[01:18:45.820 --> 01:18:49.100]   Other people want to manage it to the money exactly for those people
[01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:53.340]   I don't there's the Android. I don't have to I don't have to know how a fuel injector works
[01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:58.140]   I do have to know that a car needs gas and oil and where those things go in the engine
[01:18:58.140 --> 01:19:04.060]   That's totally my difference. I was very happy that my iphone did not split open while charging some people say it does
[01:19:04.060 --> 01:19:11.500]   Two people two people one person really two people. There's two there was there's there's one person who's it's split while charging one person got it
[01:19:11.820 --> 01:19:15.740]   Out of the box and it was these are from a swollen lithium ion battery
[01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:20.540]   Always not good, but inevitable in you know, I mean these things happen
[01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:23.580]   I'm sure apple immediately, you know gave her a new one
[01:19:23.580 --> 01:19:28.540]   I asked jerry hildenbrandt from android central who's like a radio engineer like and he's like
[01:19:28.540 --> 01:19:35.180]   He gave me the statistics from yale that out of so many formula times pi 100 hours
[01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:39.260]   Alyssia my on battery will fail and you'll have this many per device is made
[01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:45.180]   His his thing was like oh this split open so cleanly. I'm not worried about incendiary problems with this
[01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:51.020]   Okay, jerry good. That's how it should have happened. It's the breakaway iphone. It's intended to split
[01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:52.780]   Well, there's always when there's a large
[01:19:52.780 --> 01:19:57.260]   So the problem with the samsung galaxy note seven is that it was much higher than it was acceptable
[01:19:57.260 --> 01:20:01.580]   Like you there's a certain amount of failure rate with lithium miron for every phone and every year you'll find
[01:20:01.580 --> 01:20:06.940]   Almost any phone manufacturer at scale will have a few problems with swollen batteries or batteries that don't hold a charge
[01:20:07.100 --> 01:20:10.700]   Or batteries that will not will not charge to begin with or batteries that do burn
[01:20:10.700 --> 01:20:15.900]   But it's when they go beyond those that normal failure rate and I hate calling any failure rate normal
[01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:20.140]   But lithium my on is not a stable technology when you go anything beyond those rates
[01:20:20.140 --> 01:20:23.340]   That's when it becomes worrisome. That's when you have things like the galaxy note
[01:20:23.340 --> 01:20:29.500]   You call mike has been too so far. So it's pretty good. It's not too bad. Microsoft has killed its groove music surface
[01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:34.860]   For microsoft. They just can't win meanwhile apple says we've got over 30 million subscribers
[01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:40.860]   We are growing those are paid subscribers paid subscribers here 10 million more since december
[01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:43.180]   3 million more since june
[01:20:43.180 --> 01:20:47.180]   That's about keeping pace with spotify's growth rate. Although of course, they're not quite as big as
[01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:53.180]   Spotify, you know what's gonna help when I could put apple music on my series three watch which I still can't do
[01:20:53.180 --> 01:20:55.820]   No, it's not out yet
[01:20:55.820 --> 01:20:59.180]   It's a bunch of features that are coming this fall like apple pay person to person
[01:20:59.180 --> 01:21:02.700]   Isn't that the reason you on the apple live i'm like one of the chief reasons you wanted a
[01:21:03.180 --> 01:21:06.060]   LTE connected watch so you could listen to music if you left your iPhone behind
[01:21:06.060 --> 01:21:10.300]   No, I want to listen to audiobooks and podcasts and actually there's signs that they might do that
[01:21:10.300 --> 01:21:15.820]   But it's not it's not on official road. If I could put my audio on the Korean audiobook on my yeah, there's enough storage
[01:21:15.820 --> 01:21:21.100]   It's not just go out with your air with your your pod air pods on it's fantastic. I can't find my air pods
[01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:26.140]   I'm so devastated. Oh no use my my air bomb. No, you can't because it says you're not connected right now
[01:21:26.140 --> 01:21:28.860]   Yeah, but as soon as they connect, I'll let you know
[01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:36.220]   I'm not sure if I brought him to Europe and left him there or took him out of my bag because I didn't want to bring him to Europe
[01:21:36.220 --> 01:21:40.300]   I didn't think I did no and then I'll tell you how I lost how'd you lose yours?
[01:21:40.300 --> 01:21:43.500]   I lost mine. I found him. I found him, but it took a little while
[01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:50.940]   It turns out that the that I discovered something at a dinner party that you can fit those little that little case right in the little pocket on your
[01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:54.300]   Oh, yeah, I'm sure it's in some scottie vest pocket somewhere
[01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:57.180]   Well, no it wasn't a scottie vest though. It was like it was a dress jacket
[01:21:57.180 --> 01:21:59.980]   Yeah, and they have those little little little pockets. Yeah, yeah
[01:22:00.620 --> 01:22:05.020]   And and I found it. Oh, it's called a watch pocket and then don't you have a watch to find it?
[01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:09.100]   I do not have a watch to put it, but I did but it works good for a dxo camera
[01:22:09.100 --> 01:22:12.220]   And and it fits also the the the little headphones
[01:22:12.220 --> 01:22:17.180]   And and it took me it took me a couple days to figure out and I was like in Amsterdam really worried about the fact that I
[01:22:17.180 --> 01:22:21.500]   I knew that they're here somewhere. I just can't figure out where I've looked everywhere, but I'm sure it's exactly what I did
[01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:24.380]   It's in some pocket somewhere because I have way too many pockets
[01:22:24.380 --> 01:22:28.140]   But I just ordered another pair because I love them so much. I don't want to be without them so they're
[01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:34.380]   Plus now that I have a series three watch. I really have to have there's no other there's that's it right?
[01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:36.540]   There's no earphone jack hidden away on this right
[01:22:36.540 --> 01:22:41.340]   No, no, no, no, no, god. I got I get some bluetooth's
[01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:44.540]   Can you pair it you compare it to other bluetooth headphones? I guess
[01:22:44.540 --> 01:22:50.380]   How about the apple tv 4k I took my time ordering it now. It's five weeks out
[01:22:50.380 --> 01:22:54.620]   Are people getting it yet or yeah? Yeah, I mean you had to get it right away
[01:22:54.620 --> 01:22:58.540]   I think it's so funny because there's um, I forget who it is it might be Neil cyber
[01:22:58.540 --> 01:23:02.780]   But someone always tweets about the disconnect between a lot of the tech industry and a lot of people's buying habits
[01:23:02.780 --> 01:23:08.140]   And this was apple tv 4k doesn't do xyz, but then oh, it's it's all sold out and I was lucky
[01:23:08.140 --> 01:23:11.340]   I bought mine the first day I literally landed at the airport ran to the apple store
[01:23:11.340 --> 01:23:14.140]   Bought my apple tv. I just bought the lg
[01:23:14.140 --> 01:23:17.820]   C7p perfect. Yep. Yeah, because it does both
[01:23:17.820 --> 01:23:19.340]   HTR
[01:23:19.340 --> 01:23:26.220]   And Dolby vision and you plug that in leo and things like the beginning of jessica jones is suddenly like so bright and colorful dairdevil looks
[01:23:26.620 --> 01:23:33.500]   red and itunes um there wasn't a lot I got it actually right before the apple tv shipped and there wasn't a lot of
[01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:38.380]   HDR content and I care about hdr way more than 4k much more important
[01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:42.700]   I agree and then itunes came out and there's just there's a lot of the movies that I recently bought
[01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:46.540]   And also because hdr includes the p3 color space
[01:23:46.540 --> 01:23:52.460]   I was just watching like the end of guardians of the galaxies to the galaxy too and then the reds and the greens and I
[01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:54.460]   am never going back it is
[01:23:54.700 --> 01:24:00.140]   Transformative so the problems that ne lie patel and others have pointed out are just you need to know
[01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:06.620]   I don't think there are deal breakers, but no atmos who cares? I don't want sound coming from that's coming in a future
[01:24:06.620 --> 01:24:09.260]   I don't know why that didn't ship with it, but it's coming in a future update
[01:24:09.260 --> 01:24:14.540]   No hdr 4k hdr from youtube, but that's a that's an issue with the youtube
[01:24:14.540 --> 01:24:20.380]   Format they use vp9 to encode 4k for youtube and apple is only supporting
[01:24:20.780 --> 01:24:24.300]   hvc right now and one of those that that hammer
[01:24:24.300 --> 01:24:29.020]   The movable moveable object and yours is before us. I have to yield. Yeah
[01:24:29.020 --> 01:24:33.100]   They have one of them has to break the weird thing you'd have thought that have a good deal with Disney
[01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:36.700]   But they don't so neither Disney nor marvel movies will come in 4k hdr
[01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:41.740]   Yeah, which includes star wars too because Disney now is 80% of our childhood kind of a bummer but not the end of the world
[01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:46.620]   The one big one that you should pay attention to is it insists on doing upscaling
[01:24:47.100 --> 01:24:51.820]   Itself even if you had something else like your tv that could do a better job. So some 1080
[01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:55.260]   Contents not gonna look very good. It's gonna upscale it to 4k
[01:24:55.260 --> 01:24:59.180]   And it's not gonna look good. Is that that's what I don't have one have you know?
[01:24:59.180 --> 01:25:00.700]   I have not run into that problem yet
[01:25:00.700 --> 01:25:05.420]   I'm sure i'm gonna have to ask you know for some samples that i'm sure it happens because apple prioritized
[01:25:05.420 --> 01:25:09.260]   Normal person plugs the box in we don't want them to get the screen where it changes
[01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:12.380]   Goes black maybe doesn't come back. Maybe does come back
[01:25:12.700 --> 01:25:19.020]   But in the apple tv not the previous one but the one before that you could do like some konami code where you did like down up left
[01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:22.060]   Right button button button and it would give you a video selector
[01:25:22.060 --> 01:25:28.460]   And I think they re-enable that nerds would be super happy and non-ners would never have to know that it exists. That's a great idea
[01:25:28.460 --> 01:25:32.700]   That's a great idea because you sometimes you want to turn the upscaling off and
[01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:37.100]   Let's something else like or if the sdr is not nicely converting to hdr
[01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:41.180]   Whatever because what apple does is it outputs the best possible signal for your television
[01:25:41.340 --> 01:25:43.900]   So for example mine it will always spit out 4k
[01:25:43.900 --> 01:25:49.420]   Dolby vision if it can that's its priority and just some stuff may not look good that way same thing with refresh rate
[01:25:49.420 --> 01:25:53.580]   It'll it'll scale it up to 60 Hertz as well because they want the UI don't look really good
[01:25:53.580 --> 01:25:56.940]   But some people would rather prioritize not for UI but for you know the right yeah
[01:25:56.940 --> 01:26:00.140]   So apple picks its own video upscaling
[01:26:00.140 --> 01:26:04.940]   And does it itself and as usual with apple, you know, it doesn't give you a choice
[01:26:04.940 --> 01:26:09.020]   But one thing that they can put back that konami konami code back in
[01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:13.420]   One thing that is an issue that apple can control is that the studio gets to pick which version of hdr
[01:26:13.420 --> 01:26:17.100]   It gets like apple will get hdr 10 or it will get Dolby vision the studio gets to decide
[01:26:17.100 --> 01:26:20.940]   So some of the earlier televisions only had hdr 10 and no Dolby vision
[01:26:20.940 --> 01:26:24.300]   And you can't some people think well, I should just be able to choose hdr 10
[01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:29.820]   But apple literally does not have that's the code into the content nothing you can do about it
[01:26:29.820 --> 01:26:31.980]   All right
[01:26:31.980 --> 01:26:36.780]   Any other small bits or pieces we would cover before oh, this is really important
[01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:43.100]   And good news for you rene drunk canoeing is no longer a driving offense in canada
[01:26:43.100 --> 01:26:44.700]   Oh
[01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:48.860]   Uh, is it all kinds of drunk canoeing if you're drunk with navel syrup and a moose
[01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:52.060]   Is it different than drunk with the bee? I don't know. I don't know this
[01:26:52.060 --> 01:26:54.460]   Well, what about dry?
[01:26:54.460 --> 01:26:56.460]   That would be about the moose cap
[01:26:56.460 --> 01:27:02.540]   There is some other good news from canada this week though leo yesterday yesterday our new governor general was sworn in and she is an
[01:27:02.540 --> 01:27:06.220]   Astronaut who speaks six languages. I am so impressed. I'm so impressed right now
[01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:13.580]   Your governor general is the most awesome human. I just I mean what now. What does the governor general do?
[01:27:13.580 --> 01:27:16.220]   It is the queen's representative in country
[01:27:16.220 --> 01:27:23.020]   So when the queen of canada is legally a separate entity from the queen of the uk and the other commonwealth territories
[01:27:23.020 --> 01:27:26.620]   So when the queen is not in canada, she acts as the vice regal agent
[01:27:26.620 --> 01:27:31.260]   So she's commander-in-chief head of states and all those other things in less than until queen
[01:27:31.260 --> 01:27:33.980]   Elizabeth says otherwise she's got an amazing
[01:27:33.980 --> 01:27:36.780]   resume including being an astronaut
[01:27:36.780 --> 01:27:44.380]   Yeah, and uh, so julie payette is now the governor general of canada and should the queen
[01:27:44.380 --> 01:27:48.220]   Need some help or maybe even want to go into space
[01:27:48.220 --> 01:27:55.100]   Julie can help we have this nice thing in canada where if the parlament reaches an impasse they can the government can be dissolved
[01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:57.740]   You have to go to an election and she'd be the one that dissolves it. Yes
[01:27:58.620 --> 01:28:05.180]   Yeah, let's let's let before before we canonize this woman. Let's just let's just ask ourselves
[01:28:05.180 --> 01:28:12.140]   How much money did she raise for the queen's reelection campaign? I'm guessing it's less than the people
[01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:14.700]   contributed to our
[01:28:14.700 --> 01:28:18.060]   She's queen for life. She's not to the you know
[01:28:18.060 --> 01:28:21.580]   She's so I mean she's an astronaut so that's you know great
[01:28:21.580 --> 01:28:26.060]   So she's had her life in government jobs. She's never had to work in the free market
[01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:29.100]   Hey, we didn't get to errors
[01:28:29.100 --> 01:28:34.700]   I'm hoping in previous episodes. You talked about high sierra and and all that. Yes
[01:28:34.700 --> 01:28:40.940]   Yes, yes. Yes. Yes. We talked about the new file system we talked about APFS and all that
[01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:45.900]   You know in fact I should have told you I should have given you a horn or a button or something to do if I if I covered
[01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:49.340]   An issue that you'd already covered because I haven't had a chance to listen to the last couple
[01:28:49.340 --> 01:28:52.860]   Thank you ring the bell in perfect sync now by the way
[01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:55.580]   Uh, did you cover the efi issue?
[01:28:56.540 --> 01:28:58.540]   Is the security?
[01:28:58.540 --> 01:29:00.140]   Yeah
[01:29:00.140 --> 01:29:04.540]   I I wasn't on last week so I defer to any not because it came out from where he came out
[01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:08.140]   So this is not a max specific problem
[01:29:08.140 --> 01:29:11.260]   Because it turns out that efi
[01:29:11.260 --> 01:29:16.060]   Which is the firmware in most modern computers
[01:29:16.060 --> 01:29:21.420]   When it gets updated sometimes the update can fail without warning and you will never get it up another chance
[01:29:21.900 --> 01:29:28.460]   So, uh, there's some research been done that said a lot of max have out of date firmware
[01:29:28.460 --> 01:29:31.820]   Even if apple had pushed out updates to the firmware code
[01:29:31.820 --> 01:29:38.940]   They did the testing with max because it was easier. There's no reason to assume that pcs don't have exactly the same issue
[01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:45.100]   Uh, this company duo security analyzed 73 000 apple max used by its customers
[01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:50.940]   Uh and compared the firmware version with the version the computer ought to have given its operating system
[01:29:51.340 --> 01:29:57.100]   and a surprisingly large number 4.2 percent of the max had the wrong efi version
[01:29:57.100 --> 01:30:03.580]   Suggesting that the update had failed without warning and wasn't attempted again
[01:30:03.580 --> 01:30:10.860]   Uh, this it could be a security issue because uh, there are there are known security flaws in older efi
[01:30:10.860 --> 01:30:17.340]   Also, you want the new ones because they introduced new features like high cera pushes system integrity protection down to the firmware level
[01:30:17.340 --> 01:30:20.380]   I believe and you sort of you want those definitions in that protection for now
[01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:22.540]   Um
[01:30:22.540 --> 01:30:28.220]   When when apple's approached this they did point out that one of the things that's in high cera and I suspect this is not a coincidence is
[01:30:28.220 --> 01:30:30.620]   A weekly efi check. Yeah
[01:30:30.620 --> 01:30:36.620]   Uh, so my it's my guess that if you're running high c this would be a good reason to run high cera
[01:30:36.620 --> 01:30:45.340]   That if your efi is not up to date that high cera will eventually catch this and and uh, and give you an update although
[01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:52.780]   It's unclear whether it merely catches hacked, uh efi or actually out of date, uh efi
[01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:59.740]   But I would guess that if it doesn't catch out of date efi it will soon since they've got that check built in that wouldn't be a hard thing
[01:30:59.740 --> 01:31:00.860]   I think
[01:31:00.860 --> 01:31:07.420]   Too bad, but I I wanted to make sure we mentioned that and uh, so that's a good reason if you haven't if you can't upgrade a high cera
[01:31:07.420 --> 01:31:11.500]   And you have it I can see no reason not to oh, I can't actually if you have a fusion drive
[01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:16.700]   If you have well you can still update it just won't do the apf you won't get apf part of the update
[01:31:16.700 --> 01:31:18.780]   Yeah, you'll get everything has anybody
[01:31:18.780 --> 01:31:25.020]   Has it ever has it happened that apf update is attempted and then people lose data or is that not they're pretty good at detecting?
[01:31:25.020 --> 01:31:26.220]   I
[01:31:26.220 --> 01:31:30.780]   There might have been a few issues. I don't think they were related to fusion or because they want to hard drives either
[01:31:30.780 --> 01:31:35.340]   And like companies like drobo will tell you don't don't do anything without promise with it. Yeah. Yeah, it has
[01:31:35.340 --> 01:31:37.340]   Leave those on hfs plus
[01:31:37.340 --> 01:31:40.220]   Yeah, most of the most of those makers have actually put letters on their sites
[01:31:40.460 --> 01:31:45.420]   Saying here's what you should think about before you start doing the stuff and the makers of drobo did something that do yeah
[01:31:45.420 --> 01:31:50.300]   Uh, disc utility on high cera does not recognize
[01:31:50.300 --> 01:31:53.420]   Unformatted disks according to tiny apps
[01:31:53.420 --> 01:32:00.780]   Unless they'll tip for you click view show all devices quick quick disc utility and then relaunch it
[01:32:00.780 --> 01:32:07.740]   Okay, just a little fix a little work around that is weird sure we'll get us
[01:32:08.140 --> 01:32:10.460]   That'll be a dot one release and by the way the
[01:32:10.460 --> 01:32:15.980]   See serenity came up with a fix for the wife. I think does that actually work if you are
[01:32:15.980 --> 01:32:21.260]   Did you do did get to a captive portal and lost access? I don't know how you would know if you lost connectivity
[01:32:21.260 --> 01:32:24.780]   But if you did turn the Wi-Fi off and on again, and it's fine
[01:32:24.780 --> 01:32:30.380]   Is that right? We do I do that all the time. So I yeah, right? I definitely maybe make a
[01:32:30.380 --> 01:32:34.860]   That's for the same issue or not, but she has done a boatload of testing okay, that's a lot
[01:32:34.860 --> 01:32:36.060]   You know what go to i'm more
[01:32:36.060 --> 01:32:37.740]   I'm still testing
[01:32:37.740 --> 01:32:41.020]   Oh, go ahead. No, I'm done. I'm just saying read syringe. I'm still
[01:32:41.020 --> 01:32:43.980]   I'm still testing whether
[01:32:43.980 --> 01:32:47.340]   It's shaking the phone makes a web page load faster
[01:32:47.340 --> 01:32:53.020]   So I'm doing a lot of research. How do you shake it? I walk around and sometimes, you know, oh, it's how you shake it
[01:32:53.020 --> 01:32:55.020]   Yeah, you gotta do it like a polaroid
[01:32:55.020 --> 01:32:58.060]   Like a polaroid
[01:32:58.060 --> 01:33:03.740]   I've been shaking it like a hammer and not like a polaroid and because I feel like that shaking is telling the phone that no
[01:33:03.740 --> 01:33:06.140]   Really I want this to load right now
[01:33:06.140 --> 01:33:07.900]   um
[01:33:07.900 --> 01:33:09.740]   And anyway, so it's and now a facial idea
[01:33:09.740 --> 01:33:10.860]   I'm hoping that it just show it
[01:33:10.860 --> 01:33:14.300]   I don't have to shake it that I just have to show my my my
[01:33:14.300 --> 01:33:20.940]   Disappointment but the phone and that shame will cause it to download the page faster
[01:33:20.940 --> 01:33:23.420]   That's really that's the that's the big future that I think apple name
[01:33:23.420 --> 01:33:25.900]   shame shame shame shame
[01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:29.100]   apple says they improve the gyroscopes just to
[01:33:29.820 --> 01:33:34.060]   cope with uh, augmented reality, but it's really so that they can detect a wider range of anger
[01:33:34.060 --> 01:33:40.620]   We're gonna take a break come back with your picks of the week gentlemen start your picks but meanwhile
[01:33:40.620 --> 01:33:46.620]   Let me tell you what saved my life as I was flying hours and hours on an airplane texture
[01:33:46.620 --> 01:33:52.380]   Texture is awesome texture is like netflix for magazines one low monthly fee
[01:33:52.380 --> 01:33:58.780]   That's actually a lot less than subscribing to a couple of magazines you get all the magazines 200
[01:33:59.420 --> 01:34:01.980]   magazines on your phone on your tablet
[01:34:01.980 --> 01:34:07.100]   Uh on your uh, iPad it looks beautiful on the iPad pro
[01:34:07.100 --> 01:34:11.820]   This is kind of like no wonder apple said it's one of the top 2016 top ipad apps
[01:34:11.820 --> 01:34:15.020]   It's it's kind of the must have app with texture
[01:34:15.020 --> 01:34:20.060]   Uh, you you get to read all the articles you want in all the magazines you want
[01:34:20.060 --> 01:34:22.140]   And it's inevitable that there's always something
[01:34:22.140 --> 01:34:25.580]   You know enrolling stoner vanity fair or the new yorker that I want to read
[01:34:25.580 --> 01:34:28.940]   But if you were to subscribe to 10 magazines you'd not only spend a lot more
[01:34:29.660 --> 01:34:31.420]   Imagine the clutter
[01:34:31.420 --> 01:34:34.380]   The coffee table would be groaning under its burden
[01:34:34.380 --> 01:34:38.300]   Uh, and I always felt guilty throwing out those magazines. In fact, actually
[01:34:38.300 --> 01:34:41.580]   Is what the new yorker was which is weekly
[01:34:41.580 --> 01:34:45.580]   I I felt guilty. I'd see this pile of unread new yorkers
[01:34:45.580 --> 01:34:49.100]   And I oh I gotta read that it actually made me feel bad with texture. I don't even worry about it
[01:34:49.100 --> 01:34:53.100]   You automatically you pick the the favorites you automatically download them
[01:34:53.100 --> 01:34:55.260]   So even when you're on an airplane with no connectivity

[01:35:47.580 --> 01:35:54.860]   I'm a big you know, I love photography the imagery on in the photography magazines like national geographic and shutturbug
[01:35:55.100 --> 01:35:59.500]   Looks 10 times better and of course it does. It's not screened to print

[01:36:17.820 --> 01:36:20.060]   So so much great stuff being done
[01:36:20.540 --> 01:36:22.140]   and magazines
[01:36:22.140 --> 01:36:25.980]   All right time for our picks of the week. Eenie meenie meenie meen
[01:36:25.980 --> 01:36:29.340]   I'm gonna start with rene richie from imore.com
[01:36:29.340 --> 01:36:36.780]   So my my pick to the surprise of no one is the latest generation of apple watch bands and the new one they introduced is the sport loop
[01:36:36.780 --> 01:36:39.020]   I'm so mad at you
[01:36:39.020 --> 01:36:44.140]   Why I want the black sport loop and it's they don't make it for 42 millimeters anymore
[01:36:44.300 --> 01:36:49.820]   Ran out, but I showed you showed one on your instagram. You can you can still some stores have it in stock
[01:36:49.820 --> 01:36:53.900]   So you can I want this go to the apple store and you might find it on the shelf
[01:36:53.900 --> 01:36:56.780]   It's velcro, but it's my erotent. I'm sorry hook and loop
[01:36:56.780 --> 01:37:01.020]   But it's hook it. Yeah, it's a hook and loop hook and loop, but it's a better hook and loop, right?
[01:37:01.020 --> 01:37:05.020]   I mean, I I'm not an velcro expert. Are you a hick and looper?
[01:37:05.020 --> 01:37:08.540]   I make it but so they have a variety of colors
[01:37:08.540 --> 01:37:10.300]   There are some Nike colors as well
[01:37:10.300 --> 01:37:12.300]   But basically I would show you mine
[01:37:12.300 --> 01:37:15.580]   But I actually gave it to a friend of mine this morning because he tried it on and didn't want to give it back to me
[01:37:15.580 --> 01:37:17.580]   So I told him you could just keep it
[01:37:17.580 --> 01:37:21.820]   But one what looks best with the gray band the black the black
[01:37:21.820 --> 01:37:25.020]   That's the one I want are both really nice looking what I want
[01:37:25.020 --> 01:37:26.460]   I'm wearing a variation of the wet
[01:37:26.460 --> 01:37:31.020]   I think it's called pearl mine has stripes on it though, but you can get a version that does not have stripes on it just
[01:37:31.020 --> 01:37:33.980]   The I'm finding this
[01:37:33.980 --> 01:37:35.980]   I'm sorry. You shouldn't wear that after labor day
[01:37:35.980 --> 01:37:37.580]   That's
[01:37:37.580 --> 01:37:42.540]   True. Yeah, that's true or after Canadian Thanksgiving at least but the sports loop is super comfortable
[01:37:42.540 --> 01:37:44.380]   You loop it through you pull on it
[01:37:44.380 --> 01:37:47.260]   It's you can adjust it to the size just like any of apple loops
[01:37:47.260 --> 01:37:51.100]   You can adjust it throughout the day if you know your wrist is feeling a little bit bigger or a little bit smaller
[01:37:51.100 --> 01:37:54.780]   But it's not metal like the millenaz loop and it's not leather like the leather loop
[01:37:54.780 --> 01:38:00.860]   It really is the same sort of really comfortable nylon fabric that sports bands are famous for I love your tip
[01:38:00.860 --> 01:38:04.460]   My local apple store still has one. Yes
[01:38:05.420 --> 01:38:06.380]   Yay
[01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:08.700]   Yep, you can get it Leo and it's got flex of color in it
[01:38:08.700 --> 01:38:13.340]   So it really it looks great with the ceramic watch but it looks great with all the watches because there's a little flex of gold
[01:38:13.340 --> 01:38:17.820]   A little flex of different colors in it. Yeah, so it really sets it up and it looks it looks classy enough
[01:38:17.820 --> 01:38:19.820]   Like you can wear it for a workout
[01:38:19.820 --> 01:38:24.380]   Absolutely and they recommend you do it backwards for water activities because you can more easily, you know
[01:38:24.380 --> 01:38:26.380]   Open it up and close it again if you want to
[01:38:26.380 --> 01:38:31.500]   Uh, but again, you can go wear it out later if you want to because it looks it looks really nice in person
[01:38:31.980 --> 01:38:34.540]   So if you want something more flashy they have it with neon colors
[01:38:34.540 --> 01:38:36.140]   You have the pinks and they have the bright yellows
[01:38:36.140 --> 01:38:39.500]   And they have an olive version too so you can get as many colors as you want
[01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:42.860]   I like the black one the white one is really nice too, but the sport loop
[01:38:42.860 --> 01:38:46.460]   I'm really happy with it is the it is the next generation in apple sport bands
[01:38:46.460 --> 01:38:48.380]   I think I actually have to go to the store though
[01:38:48.380 --> 01:38:50.700]   It doesn't look like I can buy it online and then pick it up
[01:38:50.700 --> 01:38:52.460]   I have to actually go to the store to get it
[01:38:52.460 --> 01:38:58.140]   Is that makes sense? I thought you would be able to do that you should be able to yeah, but it doesn't it's not letting me
[01:38:58.140 --> 01:39:00.860]   It's not letting me
[01:39:00.860 --> 01:39:02.860]   Still says unavailable
[01:39:02.860 --> 01:39:05.980]   Breakdown
[01:39:05.980 --> 01:39:09.420]   And the other tip I'll give you is apple watch bands are seasonal
[01:39:09.420 --> 01:39:11.420]   Some people were like why can't I still get the old colors?
[01:39:11.420 --> 01:39:14.140]   Apple stops making the old colors and makes the new ones
[01:39:14.140 --> 01:39:17.580]   So if you see a color you like just grab it because their chances are
[01:39:17.580 --> 01:39:20.700]   Depending on when exactly it is you may not get any more of that stuff
[01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:22.700]   which
[01:39:22.700 --> 01:39:24.700]   This is a bonus pick
[01:39:24.700 --> 01:39:28.380]   Which blue which wireless charger are you using?
[01:39:29.100 --> 01:39:31.100]   For the iPhone yeah, because apple doesn't make one
[01:39:31.100 --> 01:39:37.020]   I'm using the mophie. I generally go towards belkin because I think that apple spends a lot of time rigorously testing the belkin stuff
[01:39:37.020 --> 01:39:41.740]   Because they're almost always a first adopter of apples new technologies, but the belkin one's just a little bit big
[01:39:41.740 --> 01:39:49.180]   Bigger than the mophie one and I like the smaller one and my usual caveat with the wireless chargers is pong got this so right with the touchstone
[01:39:49.180 --> 01:39:50.700]   It was just so magnetic
[01:39:50.700 --> 01:39:57.580]   But ever since then especially Qi chargers you have to really make sure you put it down and you visibly look that it is charging
[01:39:57.820 --> 01:40:03.980]   Because if you are off at all or if it is close enough to your bed well you will knock it or you have a pet who might walk across it or something
[01:40:03.980 --> 01:40:09.900]   It could theoretically not charge it might be dislodged just enough that the magnet is no longer in place than it does in charge
[01:40:09.900 --> 01:40:12.140]   So just I like the mophie right now
[01:40:12.140 --> 01:40:13.020]   If you do get it though
[01:40:13.020 --> 01:40:16.540]   Make sure you put your phone down and you see that wireless charging image for that
[01:40:16.540 --> 01:40:18.860]   I have a solution and at least to my pick of the week
[01:40:18.860 --> 01:40:24.300]   Which I've tested and it works and it's now only $30. This is from tilt tylt
[01:40:24.700 --> 01:40:28.140]   The VU with an oomle out so that makes it v
[01:40:28.140 --> 01:40:30.540]   Wireless charger
[01:40:30.540 --> 01:40:35.100]   V it has you can't miss first of all it's an easel which is really nice
[01:40:35.100 --> 01:40:37.180]   So the phone just sits right on it
[01:40:37.180 --> 01:40:39.740]   Very easy, but it has three coils
[01:40:39.740 --> 01:40:42.860]   So if you if you put the phone on it it will charge
[01:40:42.860 --> 01:40:50.620]   And it doesn't slip off it doesn't slide away because it's not lying down it's sitting up and I love the v
[01:40:51.740 --> 01:40:56.700]   So uh, it comes in all sorts of fun colors and uh, I've recommended it before but I just want
[01:40:56.700 --> 01:40:59.500]   Want to report back it works great with the iPhone 8
[01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:06.380]   And it has doesn't have that issue of you know, you could perfect aim for your uh for your Qi charger
[01:41:06.380 --> 01:41:08.780]   the v
[01:41:08.780 --> 01:41:10.780]   Nice thing about a standard
[01:41:10.780 --> 01:41:14.700]   I'm so happy that apple supports Qi now because that means Qi's gonna be everywhere
[01:41:14.700 --> 01:41:19.580]   And they're they it looks like they're going to force Qi to evolve very quickly to meet what they want to do
[01:41:19.580 --> 01:41:21.500]   Yeah as they should
[01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:23.500]   Andy and not go pick of the week, sir
[01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:26.700]   I got a pick and a tip. Uh, we mentioned before about
[01:41:26.700 --> 01:41:29.500]   User's guides for iOS 11 actually
[01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:32.860]   Apple usually does have a really good pdf
[01:41:32.860 --> 01:41:36.780]   Excuse me really good user's guides to their new stuff on the iBook store
[01:41:36.780 --> 01:41:43.260]   And just double checked in. Yes, they've got the iphone user guide for iOS 11 and the ipad user guide for iOS 11
[01:41:43.260 --> 01:41:47.180]   Both on the iBook store if you just do a web do a search for it
[01:41:47.180 --> 01:41:50.860]   You'll find both of them and they're really and I was saying there's no manual, but there is
[01:41:51.100 --> 01:41:55.020]   Yeah, they are literally the missing manual only without having to pay
[01:41:55.020 --> 01:42:00.140]   David any any fourth a bit. Yes, so they're really really good
[01:42:00.140 --> 01:42:04.380]   It's not it's not like the a pdf of the fold out thing you would get packed with the box
[01:42:04.380 --> 01:42:06.620]   It really is like a commercial book
[01:42:06.620 --> 01:42:07.900]   uh book quality
[01:42:07.900 --> 01:42:09.900]   Uh, and the second is kind of a tip
[01:42:09.900 --> 01:42:14.300]   Uh, that's kind of my standard advice every time that apple comes out with a new piece of hardware
[01:42:14.300 --> 01:42:18.460]   Particularly if it's a radically new design like the iphone 10 for instance
[01:42:18.860 --> 01:42:22.300]   uh less the iphone 8 the 8 plus for the first couple weeks
[01:42:22.300 --> 01:42:25.900]   You might want to be a little bit more
[01:42:25.900 --> 01:42:32.140]   Uh a little bit more ambitious about taking back things that have problems with them
[01:42:32.140 --> 01:42:33.980]   like if you if you
[01:42:33.980 --> 01:42:36.940]   You know the iphone 8 has the glass back and now
[01:42:36.940 --> 01:42:40.780]   You for years you've been putting your old iphone on the armrest of your sofa
[01:42:40.780 --> 01:42:45.100]   And then now because the glass back it slid off and smashed the pieces on your tile floor
[01:42:45.420 --> 01:42:49.340]   You might want to consider particularly the first two or three weeks of the release of a brand new thing
[01:42:49.340 --> 01:42:55.260]   Take it back to the apple store and see what they do because they do normally have their were awesome policy
[01:42:55.260 --> 01:42:59.260]   But they also I haven't heard any news about this in the past couple of years
[01:42:59.260 --> 01:43:03.020]   But I knew that last time I talked to people who were allowed to talk to me about this a few years ago
[01:43:03.020 --> 01:43:05.900]   They apple is often for the
[01:43:05.900 --> 01:43:11.820]   They stores have like a hunting list or a request list from the from the mothership saying that if
[01:43:12.460 --> 01:43:18.380]   Someone comes in with a brand new iphone 8 that is having a Wi-Fi connectivity issue
[01:43:18.380 --> 01:43:22.380]   And you just determine that's not due to software swap it out give them a brand new one
[01:43:22.380 --> 01:43:27.740]   Because we want to see iPhones and how we're having Wi-Fi issues or if you have one that has a damaged
[01:43:27.740 --> 01:43:33.100]   A cracked back but not a cracked front again. They they'll actually put it into i've been there
[01:43:33.100 --> 01:43:40.300]   They've actually put it in what looks like the sarcophagus that they fired spots body to the genesis planet in
[01:43:40.620 --> 01:43:46.460]   It's it goes directly to kupertino because they they want to find out how their designs are performing in the real world
[01:43:46.460 --> 01:43:50.060]   So that they can improve either manufacturing or improve the design
[01:43:50.060 --> 01:43:54.460]   That doesn't mean that again. This doesn't change the warranty. It doesn't change what they are likely to do
[01:43:54.460 --> 01:44:00.540]   But realize that as far as I haven't I haven't heard any contradiction to the idea that again in the first few weeks
[01:44:00.540 --> 01:44:03.820]   They are have their eyes open to oh well look there
[01:44:03.820 --> 01:44:09.100]   There's a broken connector at the base doesn't even matter that you mishandled the device
[01:44:09.580 --> 01:44:14.940]   So long as you weren't trying to shoot a youtube video if you know what I mean about how much abuse these things contain
[01:44:14.940 --> 01:44:19.260]   It's worth an extra choice if if you were if you would have been hesitant before to say
[01:44:19.260 --> 01:44:23.900]   I shouldn't I really shouldn't say that I dropped it in a bowl of pudding
[01:44:23.900 --> 01:44:29.340]   And forgot it was there until the pudding was cooked. It's possible that again at your local store
[01:44:29.340 --> 01:44:35.020]   They've received an email from kupertino saying we're looking we're looking for food related in grass problems
[01:44:35.020 --> 01:44:39.420]   And they will maybe they will swap up you on a brand new phone. So somebody to keep in mind
[01:44:40.300 --> 01:44:45.500]   Thank you and drew and the nakos is Chicago Sun times at cwob.com
[01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:48.540]   Finally lasts but most expensive
[01:44:48.540 --> 01:44:56.380]   You know, it's thinking about really expensive and then I said not too soon. We'll save that from the day
[01:44:56.380 --> 01:45:00.460]   But I have a so I buy a lot of tripods
[01:45:00.460 --> 01:45:05.180]   and little ones and big ones and ones that I can fit in my pack and ones that'll fit in my
[01:45:06.300 --> 01:45:09.020]   My carry-ons and everything else and the one that I've kind of
[01:45:09.020 --> 01:45:14.860]   Coalesced around at least for my backpack is the I think it's smart tree smart
[01:45:14.860 --> 01:45:19.500]   I I always thought of as smart tree, but I always have to look for it. Yes. M a t r e
[01:45:19.500 --> 01:45:22.460]   Smart tree. I never heard of this
[01:45:22.460 --> 01:45:25.580]   Smart tree. It's mad tree. So this one they make they make a lot of
[01:45:25.580 --> 01:45:30.780]   A lot of different little monopods, but I think this one's the best one now of course is the most expensive one
[01:45:30.780 --> 01:45:35.020]   But it is it's $43. It's not like it's a bad or tripod
[01:45:35.500 --> 01:45:37.740]   It it goes about it goes about four feet high
[01:45:37.740 --> 01:45:42.220]   So it's not enough to kind of you know, take a you know be full size there
[01:45:42.220 --> 01:45:45.980]   But you can set it on something now this one's built for the osmo
[01:45:45.980 --> 01:45:50.380]   Which I have but that's not really what I the nice thing is it's just a quarter 20
[01:45:50.380 --> 01:45:56.300]   And that that quarter 20 top will fit in any phone. I use it for more for spherical
[01:45:56.300 --> 01:45:59.500]   Cameras than I do for
[01:45:59.500 --> 01:46:01.740]   40 inches. I'm sorry not quite four feet
[01:46:02.380 --> 01:46:05.420]   The nice thing is is that the base is a little bit beefier
[01:46:05.420 --> 01:46:06.620]   They make a couple a lot
[01:46:06.620 --> 01:46:10.220]   There's a lot of these little monopods and a lot of them have really cheap bases
[01:46:10.220 --> 01:46:14.700]   And then it just you're you're afraid that your little 360 camera is going to fall over
[01:46:14.700 --> 01:46:16.860]   So this one's a little bit beefier
[01:46:16.860 --> 01:46:22.620]   It does you can unscrew that that and use it as a selfie stick or use it as a general stick
[01:46:22.620 --> 01:46:24.620]   And you can use the base is also a quarter 20
[01:46:24.620 --> 01:46:27.260]   So you can put if you just want like a little base to hold up your camera
[01:46:27.580 --> 01:46:32.300]   You can use that as well and it it's relatively light and it fits in my in my my rush 24
[01:46:32.300 --> 01:46:37.900]   So so anyway, so it is um, I you know, I I have probably bought in the last year
[01:46:37.900 --> 01:46:43.020]   Eight or 10 of these tripods trying to figure out we build kits for
[01:46:43.020 --> 01:46:46.780]   clients and stuff like that and that you need little tripods like this and so
[01:46:46.780 --> 01:46:47.980]   um
[01:46:47.980 --> 01:46:49.980]   And this one is definitely the beefiest
[01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:51.180]   uh
[01:46:51.180 --> 01:46:52.380]   of the little
[01:46:52.380 --> 01:46:54.940]   easy to use tripods we because it should be
[01:46:55.180 --> 01:47:00.780]   like if you uh, you would put a camera on this for skyping or something like that or
[01:47:00.780 --> 01:47:03.100]   Yeah, yeah, we would put a yes
[01:47:03.100 --> 01:47:08.540]   The lara it's too head. It's too thin for that. Yeah, but like but if you have like a theta or if you have a
[01:47:08.540 --> 01:47:13.100]   Uh, of course, it's built for the osmos, but if you have a theta or if you have the samson
[01:47:13.100 --> 01:47:17.500]   Like you're 360 on it. Yeah, exactly and what's nice about it is a tripod
[01:47:17.500 --> 01:47:19.500]   Of course shows up a lot in your 360
[01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:24.780]   So having the base be all the way down at the bottom means it's very small and easy to paint out later
[01:47:24.940 --> 01:47:29.820]   Which is something that's super to me. So, um, you know, you can if you use something like affinity
[01:47:29.820 --> 01:47:33.340]   Uh image or photo image affinity photo. Yeah
[01:47:33.340 --> 01:47:38.860]   They have a they have a little thing built into it that lets you go into a 360 mode and paint things out
[01:47:38.860 --> 01:47:41.740]   um in a more intelligent way, um, and so
[01:47:41.740 --> 01:47:46.540]   Uh, so affinity photo is you know, that's a good recommendation for affinity photo
[01:47:46.540 --> 01:47:50.140]   Wow. Yeah, it's it's the secret to the operation
[01:47:50.140 --> 01:47:54.860]   So I think I might have talked about it earlier, but maybe not I maybe have forgotten about it, but I use that probably every day
[01:47:55.340 --> 01:48:01.420]   But but this combined with that the what's nice about it is is that you have this tripod with a long neck or you know, long
[01:48:01.420 --> 01:48:04.220]   Uh, yeah long neck down to a little piece
[01:48:04.220 --> 01:48:08.220]   And so now you have this little thing that you sit down and if you think about it when you're setting it down
[01:48:08.220 --> 01:48:12.380]   You set it on something that doesn't have a lot of detail as best you can with wherever you want to shoot
[01:48:12.380 --> 01:48:16.220]   And then what happens is you take your photo or you take your video if you take your video
[01:48:16.220 --> 01:48:21.820]   It's a little bit more complicated because you basically paint out that little section and then comp it back in final coat or after effects
[01:48:21.820 --> 01:48:24.380]   Um, but the but if it's a still
[01:48:25.020 --> 01:48:32.380]   You literally in an affinity photo can just say, you know, project in you know, I think it's project 360 or whatever a live view of 360
[01:48:32.380 --> 01:48:39.180]   And now you're in a 360 environment you can rotate and look straight down at it because usually the bottom of your of your of your
[01:48:39.180 --> 01:48:41.580]   spherical looks like a big, you know, it's
[01:48:41.580 --> 01:48:43.500]   Shmoosable, right? It's this much
[01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:48.220]   Hand is a tripod. You can now you can now see your tripod and you can see what it's covering
[01:48:48.220 --> 01:48:52.060]   And you can just sit there with your little clone tool in that live view and paint it all out
[01:48:52.460 --> 01:48:55.340]   And then unwrap it and the key is that you're not losing
[01:48:55.340 --> 01:48:59.100]   Con you're not losing data because if you use like a polar coordinate
[01:48:59.100 --> 01:49:03.820]   Conversion you're actually doing something that destroys the the sharpness of the image
[01:49:03.820 --> 01:49:10.620]   This is a lossless way to to knock that get rid of that tripod. So for, you know, little videos and you know
[01:49:10.620 --> 01:49:16.220]   You know for a little projects and stills and so on so forth where you really want to get rid of that that base
[01:49:16.220 --> 01:49:19.020]   Um, this is this combined with that
[01:49:19.500 --> 01:49:23.100]   Um is a is a great tool. That's two two two tips in one
[01:49:23.100 --> 01:49:26.780]   The smotry sma pole ds one
[01:49:26.780 --> 01:49:32.060]   Which is about uh 40 bucks 45 bucks on amazon 43 bucks on amazon
[01:49:32.060 --> 01:49:38.540]   And the same price for ios affinity photo which is a great photo editor for a lot and i use
[01:49:38.540 --> 01:49:42.140]   I use affinity photo on the uh on the mac too
[01:49:42.140 --> 01:49:46.620]   That's the one that i'm using and it's and it's about the same price of the tripod
[01:49:46.620 --> 01:49:48.060]   4999
[01:49:48.060 --> 01:49:53.020]   Um, so they have one they have a great one on the ipad that i have but the one that i use on a day-to-day basis
[01:49:53.020 --> 01:49:55.420]   Is the ipad version do the same thing with the 360s?
[01:49:55.420 --> 01:49:56.700]   I don't know
[01:49:56.700 --> 01:50:00.060]   I haven't tried that I do go color corrections and stuff like that but i'm using
[01:50:00.060 --> 01:50:04.460]   Uh, it may so i'll i'll check it out and maybe come back and report back. Yeah
[01:50:04.460 --> 01:50:07.900]   Yeah, I I didn't real and they have a windows version too
[01:50:07.900 --> 01:50:12.060]   mr. Alex lindsay you are the greatest thanks for being here
[01:50:12.060 --> 01:50:16.380]   We love it when you're here at Alex lindsay on the twitter if you want to follow him and find out what's going on with
[01:50:16.380 --> 01:50:19.580]   the pixel core and all i know you have you opened it up now
[01:50:19.580 --> 01:50:23.420]   We have we're gonna we're still structuring we're still getting off the ground
[01:50:23.420 --> 01:50:26.700]   But you can definitely get more information about it at the website. We have opened it up
[01:50:26.700 --> 01:50:30.460]   Uh also, um, i've started to play with flip board as far as like
[01:50:30.460 --> 01:50:34.700]   I spent a lot of time in flip board in the morning and i started to build little magazines
[01:50:34.700 --> 01:50:39.980]   So if you search for like pixel core or or other things like that you might be able to uh find me up there
[01:50:39.980 --> 01:50:43.020]   Um, if you want to follow what i'm following that's so 2010
[01:50:43.340 --> 01:50:46.940]   That's great. I know but it but I use flip board all the time
[01:50:46.940 --> 01:50:51.340]   And so I I was like, I might as well keep it someone was asking me like where do you put your magazines?
[01:50:51.340 --> 01:50:55.900]   I'm like, well, it's where I keep them all to remember where they all are. I still like flip board
[01:50:55.900 --> 01:51:03.980]   I don't know of anything else that is so easy to use. Um, I think a lot of us are still stuck in that thing. I miss flip board
[01:51:03.980 --> 01:51:06.620]   Thank you. Alex
[01:51:06.620 --> 01:51:11.100]   Great to see you. Thank you. Andy and aco chicago sun times go to cwob.com
