[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   This is Mac Break Weekly, Episode 87,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   and in a very different setting for me,
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   we are in the new studio.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   This is a first show in the new studio.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   So expect things to go wrong.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   And who knows what's going to go wrong.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   It could be anything.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   I've got buttons and dials and arrays and knobs I never had before.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, from his mother's home,
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   where Matlock is playing in the background,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   if you hear Andy Griffith's Dorset tones, now you know,
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   you're listening to Andy and Naka.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Hi, Andy.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Hello.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   This goes to show the production values that are on the show.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   If owner Brian goes to Chicago, he goes to London,
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   I get to broadcast my mom's house.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   So enjoy the special week of shows from my mom.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   This actually looks like I'm broadcasting from mom's house.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   We're streaming video right now in Stikam.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   I don't know.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   It looks like I snuck in here.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   I don't know.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   What's going on?
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   I just got to say, I'm feeling really good today
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   because I've seen the Stikam when you're in the old place.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   And for the first time, it feels as though you're in a place
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   as disorganized as my office normally.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Exactly.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Well, you know, we have some things to do.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   We've got some glare here and there's a lot of --
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   but we had our lighting guy in.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   That was great.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   I'll actually talk about that in a second with Alex Lindsay,
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   who's also here from the Pixel Core.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Hey, Alex.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Alex came up to shoot the lighting guy talking about lighting,
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   which was really great.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   It was great.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   I think we got almost an hour of footage,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   so we're going to cut that up into a couple gear media tech shows.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   I mean, that was like a graduate course in film lighting.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   I mean, you know, the lighting he did --
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   oh, we lost our steampunk astrolabe, darn it.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   The lighting he -- sorry, my auction bid just popped up.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   The lighting he did really looked noir.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   It was really -- I don't know if we're going to go that dramatic.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   You know, I may not go that dramatic, but I think that it'll be
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   nice to not be limited to just -- let's make everybody look well.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   I don't -- yeah.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   I mean, most television, let alone most Internet TV is very flat.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Very harsh.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   I don't want to do that.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   And people who are watching right now say, well, that's not very good lighting.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Well, no, because there is no lighting in here yet, but -- we will have lighting.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Merlin Mann, who is always well lit and always looking good, and by the way,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   is probably beating the pants off me at TVweek.com.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Hello, Merlin Mann.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Hi.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   How's it going, Leo?
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   What's TV week?
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   You didn't see that?
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   What is it?
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   You and Leo are going head to head, and you don't even know it.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Whitney has faced us off.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Yeah, I saw that.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   I would like to go ahead and just see victory to you.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   No, no.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   I would like to go ahead and see victory.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.400]   Can we ask her not to do that?
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.000]   I don't like competing.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   No, I know.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Guys, guys, this passive aggressive stuff is really ugly, okay?
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Let's hit each other, get it over with.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   I take it back.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   I'm hot.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Hotmail web hosts gone wild.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   I guess what she has is like, who's the sexiest?
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   It's like Jeff McPherson versus Tom Merritt.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Dr. Teakey wins hands down versus Tom Merritt.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   I love Tom Merritt, but Dr. Teakey is Dr. Teakey.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Then Gary Vaynerchuk versus the amateur gourmet, Adam Roberts.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   It's all these hosts from various...
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   He's got the Ignatian guys, Alex Albrecht and Kevin Rose faced off against each other,
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   poor Alex.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   But then you and me, it's like, come on.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   That's a race to the bottom.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Unfortunately, we can't tell who's winning.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Look, I'm going to vote for you.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Hey, you can.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   If you vote, if you vote, it'll show you.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   No, there's no one can win this.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   It's like...
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Oh, it's close.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   I'm winning 57 to 42.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   I'm like Barack Obama in North Carolina right now.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Excellent.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Well, I look to congratulate you in advance, Leo.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   You're a handsome man.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   I'm not going to use so much better looking.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   And by the way...
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   You're oddly lit right now, but you're a very good person.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   She picked a picture from my fat period, which is anything in the last 10 years.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   So I was hoping she might go back farther.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Actually, that wouldn't be fair, though, because you, you, my friend, I'm looking at your geek pictures.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   You're good.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   You're a good-looking fella.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   You think so?
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   I have a lot of work done.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   That's very costly, but I've had done.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   To reverse it, to reverse the effects of good looks?
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   As you know, I have a home that I have to have treated on a regular basis.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Because it keeps coming back.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   On my original nose, this is, I mean, actually it's a nose that I had to, I'm leasing.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   So I can't even like really kind of good nuts with it.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   You can't do anything because you have to give it back.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Oh, I mean, I've got to keep it clean.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   You never know.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   I've got to keep resale value.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   So yeah, now it's an uphill battle, Leo, and it's not getting easier.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Gravity and entropy are putting their heart on you.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Let's talk about Mac News.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Enough of this.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   After Scott Bourne cannot join us today, he is doing something fancy.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Oh, he's meeting with Apple about aperture, right?
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   He is crossing the Atlantic and self-powered auto-dermeable.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Oh, my goodness, Andy.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   It's one of those Brian Frosting sort of things.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   You've gone bad on us again.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Oh, damn it.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   I just do it.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   I've always been badly.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   I've always been bad, Leo.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   I've tried to clean myself up for public broadcast.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   He's gone bad.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Got a kind of old school silence sound to it.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   This sort of cool.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   He does.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   You sound like a silent.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Do you have red lights going up and down your back?
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   No, if I were anything, it would not be a sucky TV show.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   Thank you very much.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Oh!
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   There are some people who actually like B.S.G.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   But they don't think really quickly does something say not the Lord Green version.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Oh, not the Lord Green version.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   No, you're not the version with the hot women on it.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Yeah, the cool silent chick.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   You don't even know how to really get like a Battlestar to the latter kind of fan like really, really angry.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Start doing quick impersonations.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Doesn't he sound like a silent?
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   You can deliberately confuse the show with Buck Rogers.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Is that the idea?
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   Exactly.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   They all flustered.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   They don't realize that you're just trying to get them flustered.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Yeah, you just go, "I love Battlestar Galactica."
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be a starbuck.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   There is a starbuck in B.A. Battlestar Galactica.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Is there a starbuck also in the Flash Gordon?
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   No, no, it's a very valid palic little robot.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   It's a very disturbing robot.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   Yeah, you got me.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   I remember him.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   That's an air sprayer.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   There's starbucks everywhere, Merlin.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   I don't know.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Same thing around.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   I learned there's seven starbucks in Petaluma.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   I just learned.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   We got to do something about you, Andy, before we go forward.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   I'm doing this thing again.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   I'm getting swapped.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Let's listen to Matlock for a little bit though.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   I'm just a simple country, Lord.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   Jay, Andy.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   The guy who was in here doing our lighting yesterday, I was really thrilled to hear, did Angela
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Lansbury's lighting for murder, she wrote.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Since Angela and I have the same neck, he was really good to hear how he handled Angela's
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   neck.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Basically, all the light comes from above.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   I love you in Sweeney Todd, too, Leo.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   [laughter]
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Is that better?
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   That's so much better.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   You know what?
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   This is going to happen periodically.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   I'll just tell you, the keyword will be "silon."
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Believe it or not, I've now taken my Nikon camera and basically anchored it in front of the
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   cable just in case I'm wiggling it or dislodging it or something like that.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Yeah, it might be something like that.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   It sounds like a USB garbage.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   Okay.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.400]   Good news for our friends in Canada, Ted Rogers, who is about 100 years old and runs Rogers
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:28.600]   communications, which pretty much owns everything in Canada, including all the cell phones,
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:34.400]   has announced in a weird announcement that iPhones come into Canada.
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:38.320]   We're thrilled to announce that we have a deal with Apple to bring the iPhone.
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:41.320]   I can say that now that I no longer work for him.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:47.600]   No longer to bring the iPhone to Canada later this year.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:52.440]   Unaccountably, the unofficial Apple web blog has a picture of Mr. Rogers next to this.
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.800]   It's not Mr. Rogers.
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.360]   It's Ted Rogers.
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:00.480]   We can't tell you any more about it now, but stay tuned.
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.880]   They mistook Fred for Ted.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.800]   That's easy, Mr. Steve.
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:10.480]   Now it says that the plan, I guess, that suggested, I guess, that people are expecting
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:20.400]   is 25 megabytes of data, additional fee for texts and $97 a month, Canadian.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.800]   That comes from the National Post.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.040]   The problem really in Canada, I think the thing that held it up is they didn't have any flat
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.360]   rate data plans.
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:31.640]   The iPhone eats data like I'm eating a chocolate cookie right now.
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:34.200]   So they need to do something.
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.200]   Is that a good deal?
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.200]   25 megabytes?
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.400]   How long would it take you to go through 25 megabytes?
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.200]   A couple of days.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.840]   I just don't understand it.
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:48.880]   Yeah I don't understand why they can't get over it and just flat rate.
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:49.880]   Move to the future.
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.560]   You're going to make a lot of money on this thing.
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:56.920]   Might as well accept that and not try to be extra greedy.
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:57.920]   Right.
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.520]   Do they say how much after you go past 25 megabytes?
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:01.520]   Well, I mean, they don't know.
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.520]   I mean, it's not.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:03.520]   Rogers hasn't said a word.
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:04.760]   Rogers may well do a flat rate plan.
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.120]   They have to.
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.880]   I think that that isn't what happened in the UK is really they just realized they had
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:10.880]   to move that direction.
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:11.880]   Yeah.
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:12.880]   Yeah.
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:16.000]   So really, Rogers has said merely we'll have it before the end of the year and we don't
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   know anything else.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Right.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.840]   I hear Matt Locke.
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.680]   So, please you hear that people.
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.320]   Here's Sylons and Matt.
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:31.520]   Now do we think that AT&T is really going to drop the price of the iPhone?
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:32.760]   That's the other rumor, right?
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:33.760]   Right.
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:34.760]   Yeah.
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:35.760]   So tell us about that.
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:36.760]   What is the deal?
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:40.080]   Well, the rumor is that of course the rumor is now building that we're going to have in
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.440]   June, we're going to see a 3G iPhone.
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.880]   I mean, that seems to be what a lot of people think is coming.
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:49.760]   And the rumor is that AT&T is going to cut by as much as $200.
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.400]   So basically they're doing what they're doing with all the other phones.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.400]   Subsidize it.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.400]   Which is sub-sidizing.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.000]   So you'd be able to buy a phone.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.720]   If that was true, you'd be able to buy a phone theoretically for $199 for the 8G and a 16G
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:02.960]   for $299.
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:06.000]   But maybe that's for the non-3G version, right?
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.640]   And then they go back to the price for the 3G version.
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:14.200]   I think they're going to want the non-3G version once it comes out.
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:19.520]   I think that what they're trying to do is just go for the...
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:22.040]   They realized to expand that market to the next level.
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.560]   I think that they have to lower that price.
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.560]   And AT&T has a vested interest in expanding that market.
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:28.560]   You bet.
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:29.560]   So it looks like...
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:30.560]   Now the question...
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.800]   Now they have to get around Apple's...
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.400]   Whatever the Apple's covenants with them are though, right?
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.400]   Right.
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:36.960]   I think that...
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.000]   But I think it's an Apple's best interest too.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.200]   So you think Apple maybe said we'll take a smaller cut as well as you?
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.560]   Or do you think AT&T says, "Look, we've got to sell this phone.
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:45.720]   We're just going to cut our half."
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.880]   I mean, they're making $100 a month from you.
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:52.440]   So giving you $200 off is not that big of a...
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.480]   How much does Apple get at the iPhone?
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.480]   How much of Apple...
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.880]   They say 9 to 25 percent.
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:11:59.880]   Of the monthly...
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:00.880]   Of the AT&T's.
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:04.120]   But I thought they were getting 100 percent of the iPhone profit.
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.120]   Is that not the case?
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.080]   No, I believe they are.
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.840]   So that's my question is...
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:09.840]   But AT&T's...
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:12.000]   So Apple wants to be involved in this.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.480]   But AT&T could take the loss.
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:16.240]   I mean, Apple's probably going to have to be involved as far as agreeing to it.
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.000]   But AT&T could take the loss.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.480]   They could just say, "We're going to pay Apple the same amount we were paying for the phone."
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.480]   But if they were...
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:25.480]   Well, that's the thing I'm saying.
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:29.680]   If Apple was making $500 a phone, and AT&T cuts at $200...
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:30.680]   Cost of $200?
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:31.680]   Cost of $200?
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:32.680]   But that's...
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:33.680]   Cost Apple $300.
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:35.680]   But it costs Apple the money though, not AT&T.
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.320]   Because Apple gets the same...
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:41.000]   AT&T could make an agreement that just said, "We're going to pay Apple the same amount per
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   phone.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   We're going to sell the phones at a loss."
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.200]   But that's my question is, if they were paying them 100% before...
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.200]   Right.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.560]   And then they can still pay...
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.240]   The thing is, is if they're paying them 500 bucks...
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.400]   Let's say they're paying them 500 bucks a phone right now.
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:54.720]   They could pay them 500 bucks a phone...
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:55.720]   Oh, just pay...
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:56.720]   Oh, out of pocket.
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:57.720]   Oh, I seriously...
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:58.720]   And just take it out of pocket.
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.720]   Because they're going to get it right back.
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:00.720]   I mean, you know, it's...
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.560]   You know, in a couple months, it's even itself out.
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:03.560]   So they can do it...
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:04.560]   They could do it at a loss.
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.040]   I mean, that's what they're doing when you buy a phone.
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:09.080]   When you get a phone for free, they're giving it to you at $100 loss.
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.960]   Or $50 loss or $200 loss or whatever it is knowing that they're going to get it right
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.960]   back within the first quarter.
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:16.960]   Flimsy rumor time.
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.320]   This is a flimsy rumor portion of the show.
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.320]   Yes.
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.320]   Yes.
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.320]   But it would be exciting.
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.320]   I'm waiting.
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:26.080]   Other flimsy rumor from the Apple Insider that Foxconn Electronics, which builds the
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.640]   phones, has been selected...
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:32.000]   Or builds actually, I think they build iPods, has been selected to assemble the company's
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.720]   upcoming 3G handset volume shipments beginning this June.
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:43.360]   They're the Apple Insider, 24 to 25 million phones.
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.360]   I think that's pretty flimsy.
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:47.040]   Well, you know, this is that same source.
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.800]   This is that commercial times report.
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.520]   That's a lot of phones, 24 to 25 million.
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.520]   I can't believe that.
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.520]   Yeah, 3 million, yes.
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.640]   I mean, the 3 million for June, there was another rumor.
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:00.880]   I don't know where that showed up, but 3 million for June, I believe, 24 to 25 million,
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:01.880]   I guess maybe over a year...
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:02.880]   Oh, but that's the life cycle.
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.720]   Yeah, it doesn't mean we want them all now.
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.720]   Right.
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.040]   I guarantee you will this many.
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.040]   Right.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.040]   That's believable.
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.640]   I think they missed their 10 million...
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:16.600]   Did they miss their 10 million goal?
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.840]   They still have months left because the thing is they have to...
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.480]   They said by the end of 2008.
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.480]   Okay.
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.480]   Are they on track?
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.200]   Yeah, I think they're on track, especially if they're going to release a 3G phone in
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.120]   June, they'll be way on track.
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:29.920]   They'll be, you know, they'll surpass it.
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:30.920]   Merlin's not saying anything.
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:31.920]   I mean, because they're bitter about our...
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:32.920]   Half a...
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:34.520]   Our rivalry, Marilyn, is that his relief?
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:35.520]   Is that...
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.040]   I don't know anything Leo, but yeah, I'm carrying around a little bit of a...
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.040]   Yeah.
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.480]   I mean, it felt like you've got the money to really get fixed up, but I'm sitting here,
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.480]   you know.
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.480]   You can come here.
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:45.960]   You can come here and sit and drink with us.
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.160]   Think of this your home away from home.
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.240]   You got the wife, you got the kid.
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.520]   This is what people with kids do.
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.320]   They create a little playhouse.
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.320]   I just...
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:56.080]   I don't know anything about these things, but I'll ask a question for the other dumb people.
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:01.040]   So 3G's good because it doesn't have to be with AT&T or because it's faster or...
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.040]   Why do we like 3G?
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.040]   Faster.
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:06.200]   Okay, so 3G is what Sprint has or had, right?
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.440]   So when I had a Sprint phone, there was blue and 4G.
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:09.440]   Yes, and Verizon.
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.440]   Although some say 2.5G.
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.600]   3G is HSDPA.
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:15.440]   That's AT&T's high speed network and...
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:18.880]   3G seems to me a smart decision for AT&T because...
[00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:19.880]   It's a loss.
[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:22.360]   Well, because people will blow through more data.
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:23.360]   I mean, that's...
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.360]   I don't know.
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.360]   It's just you can charge higher usage.
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.360]   But wait, isn't it flat rate data?
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.360]   I mean, do we care?
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.360]   Oh, that's true.
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.360]   That's true.
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.360]   That's true.
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.360]   I'd rate data now, but they may charge more.
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:36.840]   If they said my bill went from $100 to $120 and I could have 3G, I'd be like, "Thank you."
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:41.000]   Yeah, having something to get people to upgrade to, I guess.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.480]   So this doesn't change anything about locking.
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.400]   This is still just an AT&T deal.
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:47.400]   It's just a question of it's a faster way to get around.
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.400]   Yup.
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:53.200]   Although more and more of the countries they're summing into demand unlocked, Australia is
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:57.280]   going to be unlocked according to, again, flimsy rumors.
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:00.280]   Which means that if you buy one there, you could theoretically bring it back here.
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:01.280]   Yeah, theoretically.
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.440]   I mean, it seems like you basically would just carry it here.
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.800]   Fly to Australia to get a phone doesn't seem like it.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:06.800]   It is not.
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.440]   Well, theoretically, as in, I haven't done it yet.
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:13.680]   Now, this rumor about cutting the price of the iPhone does at least come from fortune.
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:16.040]   I mean, it's somewhat of a credible source.
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.640]   Yeah, this isn't...
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:22.440]   They say the new iPhone will be 2.5 millimeters thinner.
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.280]   I had thought a little thicker.
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.280]   And battery life is what...
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.280]   Yeah, battery life.
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:28.280]   Let's see.
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:29.280]   Yeah.
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.280]   Go ahead.
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.280]   And GPS.
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.280]   Well, that's...
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.280]   That'd be huge.
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:37.280]   You want to really kill your battery.
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:38.280]   Yeah.
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:39.280]   Turn on a...
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.400]   But a CPA Wi-Fi and GPS.
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.800]   And don't make any calls because you won't be able to.
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:46.560]   I guess that's not a flimsy rumor, though, right?
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.600]   Well, it's flimsy fortune, I don't know.
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.400]   Fortune I think is credible, isn't it?
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.800]   Well, that seems like a lot of stuff to be draining your battery.
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.000]   Well, that's what the Nokia N95 did.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.400]   And that was really a problem, although the Nokia N95's battery was...
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:00.880]   I don't know, it was small.
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:04.120]   And they came out with a later model that supposedly had better battery life.
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:05.120]   They fixed the firmware.
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:07.280]   I think there's tricks you can play.
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:11.480]   Boy, I'll tell you, if they do GPS...
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:12.680]   And this is June, right?
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.120]   Exactly when the SDAK comes out.
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:16.120]   So this kind of does make sense.
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:18.160]   If in June they announce their...
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:22.280]   I mean, that comes out, but when the games come out or whatever it is, if June they announce
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:24.800]   a slate of really good games.
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:32.160]   GPS, HSDPA, and 200 bucks less, that jump starts sales.
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:49.600]   That becomes the Jesus F
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.000]   But half of us will just say, "Oh, yeah."
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.040]   And I would also apply a little bit of the famous Alex Lindsey anecdotal evidence here
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:01.640]   and say that my sense is that there's a lot of kind of pass around within families with
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:02.640]   Apple stuff.
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.720]   And I'd love for my wife to have an iPhone.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:08.760]   I mean, if I get a fancy new one, I mean, I'd love to give her my old one.
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:09.840]   She doesn't want an iPhone.
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:13.160]   She doesn't need an iPhone, but I'd love her to have one.
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.000]   So I mean, it's not like you're going to get rid of your old one.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.640]   You're probably just going to find a different person in your home.
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:20.040]   That's the same account.
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:22.560]   I'm trying to pry my wife away from her razor.
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:23.560]   That phone is...
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.680]   You don't want her to shave anymore?
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:31.080]   No, the freaking Motorola phone, I think is the phone pretty crappy.
[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:32.960]   And so I keep on trying...
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:38.680]   So when this comes out, having an extra iPhone floating about, I'm hoping that she'll be
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:39.680]   tempted.
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:42.520]   Well, I'll be tempted.
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:46.280]   And I gave my iPhone today and I haven't used it in a while.
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.040]   I'd be tempted, especially GPS.
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:51.240]   Think of all the things you could do, all the applications.
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:56.200]   Have we heard any rumors about cool apps that are going to come out on the iPhone in June?
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.200]   All of them.
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:01.480]   Well, I can tell you, there'll be flash.
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:04.240]   There's 200,000 people developing stuff.
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:06.720]   I mean, it's going to be big.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:07.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:09.120]   People are pretty excited because I've had...
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:13.120]   I can't tell you how many conversations I've had that start with, "Okay, but I can't talk
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:16.760]   about anything I'm doing on the iPhone because I'm under NDA."
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:20.120]   Let me tell you everything I'm doing about for the iPhone.
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:21.120]   Right.
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.400]   Yeah, I mean, there's a great amount of excitement.
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.760]   But the biggest amount of griping is that there isn't enough exposure to the internal
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:27.760]   hardware.
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.840]   I know at least two or three people who want to write a really good camera phone app for
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:34.720]   the iPhone and they're complaining that they just don't have that level of access to be
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:39.720]   able to tell the iPhone camera, "Please, damp down the exposure by a stop or two and do
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:40.720]   that kind of stuff."
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:45.360]   That's why I'm openly skeptical of GPS being in the next iPhone.
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.880]   I think it's going to be more like...
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:53.240]   I find it easier to imagine GPS connectivity and an Apple branded little stick GPS that
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:55.680]   you could buy for $70 or $80 externally.
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:59.640]   But that'd be exactly the sort of thing where developers would need to have more information
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:04.240]   than simply where am I to build the best applications.
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.240]   Don't you think...
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:09.240]   I'd love to see things like SPORE on this.
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:15.480]   Don't you think this is going to be the greatest gaming platform ever?
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.360]   Let me tell you.
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:19.280]   I have lots of respect for my grandfather.
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:23.000]   He was proud, hardworking, kind-hearted immigrant.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.200]   I loved him dearly, respected him dearly.
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:30.400]   But every time he operated the TV remote control, he would be pointing it and jimbling it and
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.840]   up and down, left and right, because he felt that that would somehow affect the TV.
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:39.080]   That's the only time that ever thought, "My God, I'm embarrassed to be related to this."
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.480]   That's what's going to happen to the iPhone community.
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:46.000]   Once developers start like wetting their underpants, or trying to figure out a way to avoid having
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.560]   people actually tap a button.
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:49.480]   I want to move my...
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.240]   Yeah, I love it.
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.240]   This will be great.
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.560]   Here's iPhone bowling.
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:57.720]   Now, it's going to be hard for you to keep an eye on the screen while you're swinging it.
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:03.120]   But you'll agree that the gravitomeric accelerantic paradigm for the bowling skyroom makes it almost
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:08.880]   like bowling, except for the fact you've just tossed your iPhone into a...
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:11.480]   Look how popular the Wii is.
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:12.480]   Yeah.
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:16.440]   Yeah, but you can keep your eyes on this thing that's mounted on the wall of your living
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.240]   or that's a good point.
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.480]   I've been holding...
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:23.760]   I've held the iPhone in my hands trying to figure out how to do gaming on it.
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:28.040]   And I'm really, really happy with the idea of control buttons on the top corners of the
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.800]   screen where my thumbs would naturally sort of hit.
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.360]   I'm just not sure that...
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:37.280]   I'm absolutely certain that the first games are going to really overuse the motion sensor.
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:41.000]   And then the next generation of games are going to be the ones that use it only when
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.440]   appropriate and there'll be some sort of informal standard of what you can expect for
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:48.560]   a gamepad for the iPhone.
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:53.640]   I have a crazy iPhone related wonder allowed thing.
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.640]   My family and I were just traveling for the last week or so.
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:03.120]   And I found myself frequently using my iPhone and my German newbie a lot because we've
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.960]   rented a car and we were driving around and going places we were kind of semi familiar
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:06.960]   with.
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:10.560]   And I still have using this combination of the iPhone and the GPS a lot.
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:15.160]   And I mean just kind of outpropos of the rumors you're talking about.
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:18.160]   Whereas I used to be very obsessed with things like to-do lists and how that would work on
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:19.160]   a Mac.
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:24.800]   Right now I'm thinking a lot about from a user standpoint what you could do with local
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:26.440]   stuff.
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.640]   And sort of like I really liked it on mine.
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:29.640]   It's not perfect.
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:36.680]   But on my newbie, the GPS I can say okay based on where I'm going find a nearby gas station.
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:37.680]   And it saved that.
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:41.840]   I can do stuff like I can say okay based on where I'm driving right now show me the next
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:44.520]   Popeyes fried chicken that I'm going to pass and stuff like that.
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:46.720]   It really gets you excited about GPS when you do stuff like that.
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:47.720]   Well there's two things.
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.200]   There's two parts to this that I think are interesting.
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:53.520]   The first part is like as a user I had at least half a dozen things where I was like okay
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:55.000]   I got to return the rental car.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.960]   I'm sick of doing that you know fill the tank for $76 thing I want to do it myself.
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:04.600]   So you know I made sure early on to on GPS add a gas station and stuff like that.
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:08.360]   What I'm thinking is like from a business standpoint I don't know I don't really keep
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:12.720]   up with business stuff too much but it seems to me that that local is still hot and it is
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:17.240]   still huge and you look at something like Yelp and you look at the success people are
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:21.240]   having and the use of people have that and I just wonder I'm just going to toss out my
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:25.240]   crazy Merlin's crazy Google thing he always talks about like but what does it look like
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:32.320]   at some point when you get figure out how to do an iPhone like approach to local stuff
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.800]   and getting further integration with Google to find local businesses and then be able
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:41.240]   to serve ads like they are so contextual that they don't seem like ads on an iPhone.
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:44.200]   So I don't know I'm just tossing that out I'm just really interested in like a from a
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:49.560]   user standpoint with or without GPS what could the iPhone do to be my complete on the go
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:56.440]   vacation device and then second is there any untapped business opportunity given given
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:01.320]   like how huge search how huge local is and how badly most people are doing it right.
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:05.520]   That's the key to Google's Android it's all about local search.
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:10.200]   Yeah I'm pretty sure that go ahead and go ahead and I'm about to say I'm pretty confident
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.160]   that the humans would ruin it.
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:16.800]   As always either either the the the company is trying to make money off of pushing these
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:21.960]   ads would either screw up but it would be too tempting to say yeah there's this really
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:26.400]   great family style inter-pently owned diner with two blocks away but you know those folks
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.640]   at Applebee's their money is so delicious.
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:31.560]   I'm sorry there's a there's a few there's a few there's a few there's a few things
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:32.560]   good too.
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:36.760]   As humans would be Google and what they would be doing is is pulling out completely textual
[00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.600]   information based on what they could gather about your location.
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:43.400]   So if so what I'm getting at is that the last mile where people are you look at something
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:48.360]   like city search which is like oh my gosh it's like you know 1998 called and they want
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:51.000]   their sign-filling episode back you know it's like city search.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.920]   Wow that the best you can do with local.
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:56.920]   It's like what happens though if that last mile becomes okay well I will I will buy the
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:01.320]   equivalent of AdWords but I wanted to appear on people's mobile phones when they're within
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:02.320]   five miles of my.
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:06.160]   Oh get ready I mean get ready this is this is the next big thing and you see things like
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:11.400]   places and bright kite these new web 2.0 sites that are all about your location the minute
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.960]   your phone knows where you are.
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:18.280]   And I think when you the thing that that I think I've talked about on this show or one
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:23.000]   of the other shows is that is that once you start having that GPS really active and everybody's
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.640]   got one I mean what I'm interested in is building tours you know I go up to some site
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:32.600]   and I say you know I want to do a civil war battlefield tour and it is giving it's it's
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:37.080]   literally giving me a voiceover while I'm traveling you know and building me up towards
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:40.320]   you know the movie can you do that right now you can get those for the newbie it's kind
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.320]   of cool.
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:45.480]   Do you have any of your Tom what do you have I have Tom Tom the movie has this thing you
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:49.480]   can load these up and buy these and load these up and it uses waypoints to go like okay you're
[00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:51.320]   passing Andersonville it's very sad.
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:54.280]   Does it talk to you really and it'll give you a little travel on.
[00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:56.060]   Yeah yeah wow.
[00:25:56.060 --> 00:26:01.120]   Between video store and the mini mall that's where eight thousand union soldiers died.
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:06.240]   Well I've got the I've got the I'm sorry I'm a dinner for you go go go go go go go go.
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.000]   Go go go that's fine go go go go go Andy.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.520]   Well I was I was going to change the subject to a different application for GPS so that
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:14.720]   would totally sell me on the idea of GPS for the iPhone but.
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:20.080]   Well I mean and this is the thing is they've got to sell people on GPS for the iPhone and
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:23.960]   then it has they can sell you like crazy on local location based ads.
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:28.120]   Not necessarily that I mean what I would really sell me on GPS for the iPhone would
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:33.160]   be if there were a mesh based iPhone travel network where by virtue of the fact that I've
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:37.680]   got an iPhone in my car and some guy that's eight miles ahead on route 128 has an iPhone
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:41.200]   in his car both of them are reporting back on how fast we're going that I can get real
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:44.640]   time traffic data everywhere there's some.
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:47.400]   I look ahead 10 miles and find out oh there's that's right.
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:50.120]   Well then the special network thing to you where you could.
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:54.040]   It's automatic you don't even have to know these guys it just senses this.
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:58.800]   Maybe I'm cynical and it's not just a case of like an advertiser trying to steer people
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:02.200]   towards the person who give them the better the better ad money.
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:05.760]   But I'm talking about again companies that would try to game the system that's what we
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:09.760]   see with Google ads that's we're seeing and it's seen so many different Google searches
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:14.920]   where if you try to look for restaurants using Google it's a better example try to find
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:20.640]   like a hotel room or try to find like a tourist attraction you will not get until you turn
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:27.160]   to page 8 9 10 or 11 of the search results you will find yourself that wasn't game.
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:29.840]   I just think we're at I think we're at an inflection point I think we're at that point
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:33.560]   of that hockey stick and we've seen it before with the internet and various things where
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:38.200]   you've got a confluence of technologies we got GPS in a phone you know these kind of
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:42.760]   location based technologies you're seeing a bunch of web 2.0 applications for it you're
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:47.080]   seeing a bunch of applications all around for it and I think that the economic engine
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:51.480]   is very clear I mean Google's already said we think this is a richer business for us
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:56.840]   than just standard search you know because exactly what you said Merlin we're you know
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:02.200]   Applebee's will say hey you know there's an app I we know you like Applebee's fajitas
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:06.040]   there's one right around the corner wouldn't you like to go now I mean I think that's
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:09.320]   very valuable will consumers tolerate it.
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:13.360]   Well and I mean I think I put that a little bit of a red herring I'm not obsessed with
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:17.000]   the ad part of this but I'm obsessed with no but that will power it is my point I'm
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.560]   not obsessed with it either.
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:21.640]   Like I okay so like I've had this iPhone now for a few months and I use it a lot and I
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:25.400]   like it a lot and I'm getting more comfortable with it I still prefer to use you know a real
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:30.120]   computer like with a keyboard and stuff but I'm getting used to that but on the road I
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:34.040]   really found myself kind of depending on it at one point actually I lent my newbie to
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:38.720]   some to another family member who needed to go pick somebody up someplace and so as we're
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:44.600]   relying more heavily on using the Google map stuff which is like it's pretty good it's
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:49.520]   not a movie but it's pretty good so the problem is though if I go and I do a search for like
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:52.960]   oh what was it we were looking for some kind of a thing that's a chain okay like for example
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:57.120]   let's say I want to find a Starbucks if I do a search on Starbucks on Google it is
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:01.400]   awesome I get a bunch of returns on a map at the top but what it says is like 15 returns
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:05.560]   for Starbucks and I can't tell which is which I don't know which one is near me and I just
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:09.800]   think taking that that little extra mile and I don't know if I mentioned on this show before
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:13.720]   but I keep thinking with the SDK like if I were Disney for example I would want to put
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:18.560]   out with the SDK make the ultimate like Disneyland application so I could find stuff like the
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:22.560]   nearest vegan restaurant and things like that and I guess I just feel like this is such
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:31.560]   an exciting way to take the core competencies of Apple's iPhone team and Google's contextuality
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:38.400]   and local teams and make something that would be really hard to beat on any other device
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:40.400]   from any other company.
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:43.480]   I think that's why I think it's integrated the way the maps are now imagine that map stuff
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:48.000]   being like to the tenth you know power where you go okay and near where I am like show
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.960]   me the directions that would be easiest for me to do dry cleaning by a big gulp and drop
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.960]   my kids off you know that's awesome.
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:58.720]   But would you give up so much control over your minute to minute decisions too I'm not
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:03.480]   even terribly convinced I'm not even terribly happy letting GPS steer me towards a diner
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:10.480]   that I have picked up if I'm going to say if I'm going to say you know tell Sandy tell
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:14.240]   Sandy to return please my set of waypoints that will let me do everything in my to do
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:17.840]   list in the shortest time I'm not convinced it will steer me to the points that are going
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:22.000]   to help me do that or that's going to give me the best path or giving me the most useful
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   solution to that.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.560]   I guess my point is all of that stuff will be solved and the fact that this is so powerful
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:32.720]   and such a there's such great economic incentive means it will be solved.
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:36.040]   I think it's very useful I think Merlin had that kind of moment that we that at some
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:38.520]   point everybody has with GPS where you go.
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:40.520]   This is fantastically useful.
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:47.080]   Yeah but we we we I call myself among this group we so often fall into that trap of extrapolating
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:51.440]   and thinking oh well here's the ultimate expression of this technology and it would be great but
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:56.240]   in reality in reality it doesn't really work and be it's not a solution that people are
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.520]   willing to really accept.
[00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:00.160]   What doesn't what doesn't work about GPS for you?
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:05.800]   GPS works great I'm just talking about letting some random anonymous server tell me that
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:08.880]   oh I want you to go to this place instead of that place.
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:12.600]   But it goes by no time on a server it's a really smart server that knows like what.
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:14.520]   So you don't use GPS to navigate Andy?
[00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:15.520]   Of course I do.
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:17.240]   Well that's how is that different?
[00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:21.680]   No I'm saying I'm saying that if we were in a situation where I would plug in hey I want
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:24.240]   to I want to see it I want to go to a diner.
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:28.880]   I sort of trust the database inside but I also have a new V and I think it's the best GPS
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:29.880]   you can get.
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:30.880]   Yeah but.
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:34.400]   Except for how disappointed except for how disappointed she sounds when you do it wrong.
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:36.480]   Oh you're going the wrong way.
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:37.480]   Recalculating.
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:38.480]   Recalculating.
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:43.600]   But oftentimes like if I'm just in an odd part of New England I'll just punch in find
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:46.000]   me find me a diner and I'll go to the diner.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.200]   I trust it because it's just going by the fact that it has a database of businesses with
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:54.960]   a word diner in it and is making a mathematical calculation on which one is closest.
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:59.400]   When you talk when you talk about monetizing where people are going where people are being
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:06.600]   recommended to it has to be an absolutely pure as ivory soap decision based solely on
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:11.080]   math I do not want to be steered towards the person who bought an ad as opposed to the
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:14.560]   person doesn't even realize that this GPS direction service exists.
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:18.560]   Well that's the same thing people say about searches I don't want to have paid results
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:20.000]   intermingled with my search results.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   I want my search results to be pure.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.480]   What I'm saying is that there is paid results and that tends to ruin things but there's
[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:30.760]   also again people who try to game the system by setting up link farms by making sure that
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:32.480]   you're worried about people gaming this.
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:34.640]   He's talking about SEO not ads.
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:39.200]   I've never heard that acronym before what is it SEO search engine optimization.
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:42.920]   Oh okay but that's but that's gaming essentially gaming Google.
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:47.800]   Well it's that's a huge industry where basically you get your hotel to the top of the list by
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:51.800]   applying a combination of black white and gray hat.
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:56.440]   The problem that I find and I find it myself and I also find it with actual human civilians
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:33:01.280]   is that people will give a certain service X number of tries before they absolutely give
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:02.280]   up on it.
[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:06.360]   So the second or the third time that they're looking for I want a down homey diner and
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:10.880]   it sent me to someplace that's kind of okay but you know it's actually one of four businesses
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:15.120]   that are owned in this area that have the word diner in them they're going to never use
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:17.320]   that feature again and that's going to be the failure point.
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:24.040]   Yeah but I think that when we look at Apple I mean one of the issues with GPS right now
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:29.920]   and I think we see it in such an infant it's kind of this infant zone where you don't have
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:35.520]   any one company having tens of millions of people using it and I think that when we start
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:42.040]   having that and when you start people have coming in with already the aesthetic of expecting
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:44.920]   something out of their iPhone I think the kind of GPS stuff we're going to get is going
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:49.120]   to be much higher quality and I also think that I don't feel like I need to think pie
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:52.200]   in the sky about what's possible what I know is that there's just going to be a lot of
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:56.720]   competition you know there's just going to be you know you can't if Google always put
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:59.040]   up only paid ads no one would use it anymore.
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:03.120]   Well I'm going to the reason of the scenario for you what if Google or somebody says hey
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:07.400]   your phone's free and we'll subsidize your phone service all you have to do is allow
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:10.880]   us to put a few ads in there.
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:13.160]   I would probably pay for it.
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:16.080]   Well there you might but some people but a lot of people I think would say hey free
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:17.720]   phone service.
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:20.200]   Yeah don't you think?
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:24.240]   I think most people would until again until it reaches that failure point.
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:25.880]   What's the failure point?
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:30.600]   Again the point at which I feel as though I'd be I feel as though the phone is there
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:34.480]   to serve the needs of its advertisers and to serve my needs as its owner.
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:39.360]   Yeah and I admit that it hasn't been done perfectly up to this point but at some point
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:42.680]   I think it's possible to figure that out and do it right.
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:47.280]   Yeah again the humans are weak point in any system if we just trust the machines do their
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:51.040]   do our to do what's best this would be a paradise onto earth a lot of people would
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:52.680]   die but it would be a paradise under earth.
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:54.960]   Damn humans screw the thing up.
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:57.560]   This is the silence speaking I want you to know.
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:02.160]   And you do that silent voice when you say things like that.
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:04.960]   So do you what you're saying is you trust a machine to do it you just don't trust a
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:05.960]   human to do it.
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:11.640]   Again I trust a mathematical algorithm to say businesses with the word with the word
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:15.840]   diner that are the closest in miles to the position the people are right now.
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:19.360]   When we add things like well this person is paid for it for an ad placement for that
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:20.920]   to be bubble to the top.
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:27.000]   That's a big problem it's an even bigger problem when there is it's possible to again
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   game the system.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.560]   I'm sorry I seem I seem to be saying the same thing over and over again.
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:33.640]   I know because Leo slow and he's trying to get.
[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:37.840]   But I'm saying that I guess what I should do is backtrack and simply say that if it works
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:38.840]   great because that's.
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:40.440]   Yeah but that's true of every.
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:45.000]   It's just a simple just a simple fact that the iPhone as it is right now can give me
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.480]   within a certain degree of precision where the hell am I just if I'm walking down the
[00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:53.080]   street I know that G I need to turn left on Vassar Street right here is I'm on the on
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:57.240]   the MIT campus have I passed it or am I have I crossed AIM street yet it'll give me that
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:00.280]   answer and that in itself is really really valuable.
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:04.680]   I will use the features any navigation features that appear inside the iPhone the question
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:09.640]   is will use it for five times will I rely on it the same way that I rely on my new V which
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:14.320]   over the past three three or four years has always given me just absolutely perfectly
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:18.360]   the answer that I want is it again a device that serves my needs and not the needs of
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:23.200]   Garmin not the needs of whatever advertiser might have been contacted by the marketing
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:24.200]   department.
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:26.320]   Yeah no I think that's absolutely true.
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:33.320]   I just I can see all these great scenarios where you know this all kind of comes together
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:38.960]   you know once you once you really get how great GPS is I don't know you start dreaming
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:41.440]   about what I love your mesh idea and I think that's great.
[00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:45.240]   I think I think I think about the yellow page it's like the yellow pages is nothing
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:51.240]   but it's also a listing of businesses alphabetically by some taxonomical thing that makes sense
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:55.360]   so it's like yeah you can see the big ad for this undertaker but you can also look at
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:59.360]   the alphabetical list alongside of it and I mean as long as Google doesn't make repeat
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:03.440]   the same mistakes that other companies have made with trying to or Google or whomever
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:06.440]   would try to overly blend that stuff in a way that's confusing.
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:09.680]   I mean an average ever time doesn't feel like an ad if it's what you're looking for and
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:15.680]   that's much easier to do at a block level than it is at an IP range level.
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:16.680]   Okay.
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:22.120]   Again it's possible I'm just being cynical but I'm just hoping that you all hope that
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:26.720]   I always I always so one of the most heartbreaking things is when you see a technology or a piece
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:30.640]   of software or a piece of hardware where you know they worked really hard on this and at
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:35.560]   some point on the whiteboard this was a brilliant idea and then at some point marketing got
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:39.360]   a hold of it and so well look why don't we monetize how these these search results are
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:43.760]   delivered and just for that one reason this great thing is now useless.
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:47.760]   You're describing you're describing a very common thing and I totally agree with the
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:50.360]   spirit of what you're saying which is that nobody likes to feel like they're being played
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:54.920]   for a punk and to feel like their participation in something is solely described by their ability
[00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:59.160]   to be monetized and so that's why I think there's like always this balance that you're
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:03.920]   trying to strike you know I'm trying to find the right mix of what I give away for free
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:08.280]   which in Google's cases I guess you know useful search results versus what I I think
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:12.160]   it's I think what you one thing and I think it's I think it's when people like you say
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:15.040]   either take it too far and I like your thing about the machines and the people because the
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:19.480]   other thing is that machines can really be stupid too because if they try it almost like
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:24.000]   a spam filter that's a little too you know aggressive that but I think people don't
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.320]   like feeling pumped and whether you know regardless of what it is that's doing that you're right
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:31.800]   you've got a few chances to get that right and then somebody's not going to waste their
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:36.360]   time on it anymore if they feel like you know you're not even taking their needs into account.
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:41.760]   And just in case one extra people know that I'm so totally pro GPS I had GPS in my car
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:46.640]   so early that I managed to get out of a speeding ticket because the cop who pulled me over
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:50.800]   like was so fascinated by this mysterious box I had on my dashboard he thought he thought
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:55.480]   it was a fuzz buster and it was it was an old beater car like that easily the GPS was
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:39:00.040]   worth way more than the car and I said I'm sorry officer if you say I was speeding that
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:02.920]   was speeding unfortunately my speedometer doesn't really work in this car so I have to
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:08.280]   go buy the GPS and then I spent 20 what's a GPS and I spent minutes explaining how the
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:12.760]   satellites work and how it does try it gets three that time he forgot you even did anything
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:18.680]   exactly it was like these are the droids were looking on now I love GPS I really do and
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:24.080]   I think every time I use like something new like the new and I see how much better it's
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:27.920]   gotten I'm more and more impressed and I just I really think we're about to make a breakthrough
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:32.120]   when it's in your pocket all the time it maybe it's just something as simple as what you
[00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:36.680]   talked about with this mesh kind of traffic regulation or whatever but I just I see this
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:40.280]   so many applications for this and yeah you're right what if we take out what if we take
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:45.440]   out the search the paid search although I think that that's going to be critical to
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:49.320]   making this economically all happen but if we take all that out and think of all the
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:54.600]   possibilities I mean just it's amazing you know every picture you take is geotagged automatically
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:58.720]   you know people know that you're within proximity that's what these places and the bright kites
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:03.640]   all about is you know is finding you nearby you know and it's amazing it's really quite
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:07.920]   amazing really is the subtle things I'm looking forward to it I don't care about the iPhone
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:12.780]   camera geotagging applications so long as it's sort of maintaining a 10 minute 10 minute
[00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:19.840]   snapshots as I go of where I am and then as I when I plug my camera into iPhoto I've also
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:24.320]   plugged my iPhone into iPhoto and an iPhone excuse me an iPhoto is now smart I realize
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:28.920]   that oh well look we have all this track location information from the iPhone that we can then
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:32.320]   match to these photos I'm just slurping in why don't I tag them automatically that's
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:36.600]   going to be awesome yeah well I mean it's it's good it's maybe just as simple as that the
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:40.520]   only reason I bring in the economic stuff in the search stuff is I think that that's what
[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:44.240]   you know frankly whatever you know these people are in it to make money and so if there's
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:48.440]   a really good model for making money out of it I mean Google is just drooling over this
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:52.440]   that's why they designed Android that's why they're giving it away to HTC to make handsets
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:58.960]   it's why T-Mobile says by the end of the year we're going to offer a G you know a HTC handset
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:03.840]   to our customers running Android and and I think the iPhone that's going to be the competitor
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:07.200]   for the iPhone and if Android has you know all of this features built into it and the
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:11.120]   iPhone doesn't tromble but maybe that's the opportunity maybe Apple's opportunity is
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:22.880]   to be the kind of the ad-free version of this moving along I hear buzzing hello is that
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:27.440]   you guys is it me I think it was you you were you moving something around over there oh
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:33.240]   yeah constantly every if you're watching the video I'm like rewiring as I'm talking if
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:37.160]   I seem a little if I seem a little distant that's what's going on we're going to get
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:42.640]   to picks because I don't see a lot of other stuff to talk about any other big stories
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:48.280]   you guys are following oh wait a minute let's see yes let's see Monday's new I'm
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:53.400]   did something on Monday I know they'd I'm back they revved it now I thought it was interesting
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:42:01.600]   that they made such a the top of the line I'm at is a three plus gigahertz this new Nvidia
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:05.200]   fix card I mean it's it's a hot machine if it weren't a laptop it'd be a great machine
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:10.440]   but it's essentially a laptop I think that though I have to admit though I think it's
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:15.440]   officially four times faster than the G5 production that we had you know production computers we
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:21.280]   have here I mean it's we're looking at actually for we're getting ready to get rid of all
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:24.960]   the G5's that we have in the office or putting them off to being render stations or whatever
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:30.200]   and and we're looking at literally we need a handful of of Mac Pros but we're looking
[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:34.600]   for a lot of the day-to-day stuff just moving to 24 inch iMacs because we just they're fast
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:40.840]   enough to do an enormous amount of work I mean it's they're they're pretty amazing I
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:44.120]   like these new iMacs I'm not sure I'd run out and buy them are you thinking of replacing
[00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:48.960]   the G5's with that some of them really we have we have a whole but we have five or
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:54.400]   sixty five's and we don't need all of them you know I mean to we we need to that they
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:58.160]   can handle lots of cards you know so we have these black magic cards that we use for
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:04.200]   capture we need out of the two or three that need a bunch of the slots yeah this the slots
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:09.400]   but for after after a certain amount of the work has been done I mean we do some of the
[00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:14.760]   production on our laptops you know but but the the iMac is considerably faster actually
[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:18.520]   than than our laptop for most amazing so but it's a laptop it is kind of essentially
[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:22.360]   a laptop right is a laptop drive it is but it's got I know I don't think I think it's
[00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:27.320]   a regular just like I think it's a regular drive in there and it's a little bit more it
[00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:30.120]   might not be a regular drive it might be something in between but it's it's you could
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:34.120]   always boot from a firewire drive if you wanted more speed it has fireware 800 or you
[00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:37.520]   could be writing to an external drive yeah you don't need to boot to it you could boot
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:42.520]   to your internal drive right most the time when we're doing most of our work is being
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:48.360]   done on external external right external raids you know so so these are all so you just need
[00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:52.040]   something that can power that stuff and I bought the extreme you know when the 2.8 extreme
[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:55.840]   came out last year I bought that and I'm I'm very happy with it's a nice machine although
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:44:01.320]   I can tie it up I running visual hub to do a lot of conversions or you know it really
[00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:06.440]   ties it up lightroom when it's doing a lot of rendering huh it becomes almost unresponsive
[00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:12.680]   I do one-to-one renders one-to-one previews when I import from my camera right it's doing
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:17.040]   so much stuff that'll tie it up for a little while yeah and it's a beta so that's what
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:25.760]   you do overnight yeah I'm kidding but those are big yeah yeah so the the but I I'm not
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:29.520]   we've been super happy you know with my I got my son and I Mac and that's what really
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:33.680]   started putting me over the on the pre note the edge and and there well that and then
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:37.140]   they don't take up a lot of room we're trying to move to all Intel because you know the
[00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:42.800]   Intel chips are so much faster yeah you know and and it just gets painful when my laptop
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:48.000]   renders renders out faster than the G5's do now you know so so we know we know we have
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.080]   to upgrade we've been trying to hang out until everything's been revved a little bit we're
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:56.200]   hoping that we're gonna see a rev in June for the towers you know at WWDC you don't
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:59.920]   want to buy something before WWDC if you can afford it you know you know it's cool about
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:05.560]   this is the the corduro extreme that is in the new iMacs you can't get in the PC the
[00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:11.920]   iMac right now is the only way to get it the 9100 and and you know if you're a PC user
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:16.280]   you can get a really fast PC that right just get exactly and the other thing to notice
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:20.560]   by the way is that is that you can you know a lot of people look at the price of of windows
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:24.360]   oh I have to buy three spend three hundred and thirty dollars but some of the third party
[00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:29.200]   resellers the Mac malls and so on so forth they're bundling you know they're bundling
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:37.440]   XP or Vista or whatever with a Mac installed the way you would do it with an OEM you know
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:42.320]   from Dell or whatever so you can save money if you really want that PC side of things they'll
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:46.120]   build the dual boot for you or they'll bundle in parallels or they'll you know all that
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:50.680]   stuff you know they have all those deals right that are available I should correct myself
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:57.320]   it isn't I thought it was a 9100 it isn't in fact it's a special chip that Intel I guessed
[00:45:57.320 --> 00:46:03.240]   it for Apple they've they've announced it as part of the mata Vena system but it's not
[00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:08.400]   out yet they announced it at the developer form in April last year but so it's kind of
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:12.320]   a special special chip in apples got a deal this is where you starting to see the benefit
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:17.560]   of Apple moving to Intel and I imagine it was part of the deal was Intel said and by the
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:22.600]   way we'll give you access to our new stuff you know faster than Dell and HP well and because
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:26.280]   Apple probably can pay a premium for it too because they have to have the premium because
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:31.720]   they have a premium margin to get ahead point yeah absolutely yeah all right well let's
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:36.880]   we're gonna get to our picks in just a second but it is time for an audible pick we thank
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:40.360]   audible by the way for their support of the show and I want to correct a misapprehension
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:45.640]   that I created myself I was joking around at the end of Twitter a couple of weeks ago
[00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:49.360]   and I said well I guess that's it for audible and then they'll never sponsor a show again
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:52.920]   and it was a joke and I've actually started receiving emails for people said well I'm
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:47:00.240]   canceling my audible account no no please don't that was just a joke there's still a sponsor
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:07.920]   they love us they're very happy with us they even put up with stuff like that so audible.com/macbreak
[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:12.600]   you can get a free book a good way to get a free book if you've not done the audiobooks
[00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:18.080]   we're all audiobook fanatics here every I think all of us are and and and the great
[00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:22.000]   I don't read anymore no it's so much easier you know you there's time when you're in the
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.720]   car or you don't have you don't even have a car Alex and no I do it it's it's it's my
[00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:32.400]   cable car it's my cable car do you ride the cable car to work I do and that's how I commute
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:40.080]   I'm so jealous I'll take pictures for you actually ride the cable car yeah a little bit
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:43.880]   and what's funny is you build a subconscious little thing where you I can hear the cable
[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:46.680]   car grows right by our house ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding
[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:49.960]   so yeah I hear it and I know okay I've got eight to ten minutes before the next one and
[00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:53.240]   so that kind of is but you don't even think about it while you're doing it suddenly you
[00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:56.360]   just have this feeling like I got eight to ten minutes before the next one comes out and
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:59.640]   so then you just kind of put all your stuff together and you end up waiting on the corner
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:06.360]   for a minute and and then you hop on a cable car and it's about a 12 minute ride into the
[00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:16.000]   it drops them off about that was exciting I know attention to that so when you're in
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:21.880]   the cable car and you're strapped in I am I'm always outside and I am do you hang on
[00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:29.620]   the outside I don't hang on I hang on the outside if there's a lot of tourists tourists
[00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:34.400]   to ever put it but usually I come in I come into the office pretty early like just when
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:38.600]   the cable car is actually starting so usually there's nobody else on the car right and I
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:40.800]   don't know what you're sitting on the you sit down so they have a little area on the
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:45.400]   outside so you like to sit there yeah I just want to visualize it's by the way if you're
[00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:49.420]   visiting San Francisco there is absolutely no reason to go on the inside part of the cable
[00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:53.040]   car and the grip and it's in there and it's sweating and it's not well it's not only that
[00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:57.160]   it did they they pack people in like sardines in that area and I don't understand why someone
[00:48:57.160 --> 00:49:02.380]   pay five dollars and then get jammed into that into the closed area because it's cold
[00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:07.460]   because tourists come to San Francisco thinking it's a ke thinking it's in California and
[00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:11.420]   it's going to be warm and you walk across the street to Walgreens and you buy the little
[00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:15.820]   sweatshirt that says San Francisco on it because like half the tourists have one you
[00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:21.020]   know you just fit right in oh yeah I know I love I love driving up up a Powell Street
[00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:24.580]   and seeing the tourists standing on the corner shivering in their shorts thinking but what
[00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:28.200]   eventually happens is you every every time you see that little sweatshirt there's there's
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:32.160]   one sweatshirt that has a little San Francisco you know you print it on it right and you're
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:38.040]   like and like you got caught forty five dollars but at least you're warm exactly and then that's
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:42.400]   what pays for Walgreens to be right there I actually have a I actually have an Alaska
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:48.100]   sweatshirt for exactly the same reason did you think I'd be smarter you know Alaska cold
[00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:52.740]   yes it was exactly so anyway so when you're on the cable car and you've got the little
[00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:58.020]   white headphones in your ears what is it you're listening to well I just I just downloaded
[00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:03.280]   something it was actually the first audiobook that I ever bought and this is I mean back
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:09.940]   when it was tape so I got this I originally got this about almost 15 years ago on tape
[00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:15.780]   yeah and then I just got it from my iPod and it is it's really great it is called the
[00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:21.660]   Doudaging a new English version and now I'm an Eastern philosophy major so that so my
[00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:26.100]   background was kind of in that in that area but it's specifically you don't want to get
[00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:29.580]   any doubt a jing you don't want to get any doubt a jing booked in my opinion you want
[00:50:29.580 --> 00:50:35.500]   to get the one written and narrated by Stephen Mitchell and it's available for 995 on audible
[00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:39.900]   or free that's that's kind of the classic translation yeah it's it's it's it's a well
[00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:44.500]   he actually takes some liberties you know he takes some liberties of swapping the dow
[00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:51.580]   from being male the you know masculine feminine and and he he softens it it's a very soft
[00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:59.420]   warm translation of the Doudaging and so so the I have like six Doudageings so this specific
[00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:03.820]   one I think is the best translation and he and he reads it and he's very soothing I
[00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:08.420]   guaranteed just try putting it in the car it's really hard to listen to the Doudaging
[00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:13.100]   and be angry and traffic it's I mean it's almost impossible you know you just you get
[00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:18.020]   caught up it you you it's you just you just I used to play it while I drive drove in Denver
[00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:22.660]   because it made because it made me not want to kill everybody so I see if I can play I
[00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:26.740]   might try to play a little excerpt of this without having what happened a moment ago
[00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:34.980]   happened let me see if we get do this without feedback but of becoming it in surrendering
[00:51:34.980 --> 00:51:41.460]   to the Dow in giving up all concepts judgments and desires okay now imagine a cars coming
[00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:45.700]   at you you're in the house you're surrendering to the Dow and you're surrendering to the
[00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:51.620]   naturally compassionate she finds deep in her own experience oh I see the central truths
[00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:57.340]   of the art of living so this is the this is the by Laoza who was the means which means
[00:51:57.340 --> 00:52:02.820]   the old one it is it is one of the oldest isn't it what is it the oldest religious text
[00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:10.500]   of all I don't think it's the it's not the oldest it's it gets back into if I'm correct
[00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:15.140]   I think it's you know 500 BC oh it's not that old okay so it's not it's not that old it
[00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:22.260]   but it it is a as I said it's it's just a fantastic translation of one I you know what
[00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:26.340]   it doesn't matter what your religious background is this isn't really that it isn't something
[00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:32.820]   that you have to be Buddhist or whatever to to or Zen or whatever to to enjoy there's a
[00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:37.460]   lot of things that apply to everything and it's just a very very great book and it's very short
[00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:40.980]   and it's a short little chapters so you don't feel like you get in the middle of something
[00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:44.820]   and you have to leave it because every two or three minutes the new one I think it is I can't
[00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:48.820]   remember exactly number but it's you know it's 50 some so and he's and he the the translator's
[00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:54.420]   reading it yeah and he and he does a he he really does a great job at it and so it's a
[00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:58.740]   and I really I like having it on my iPod you know anytime you feel a little stressed you just play
[00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:04.100]   a little data jing and you're like okay I was listening to an ad on the radio the other day
[00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:10.020]   for Wayne Dyer who's coming to town and the announcer said and he will talk about the tao
[00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:19.060]   to change to jing and more like that's out to change but that's apt no I thought so I want to
[00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:25.540]   tell everybody it's spelled T-A-O-T-E-C-H-I-N-G that's the oh right that's the anglicization of the
[00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:32.580]   Chinese and it's but the Chinese pronunciation is dao de jing right because you know here's this
[00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:37.860]   is a boy talking about a rat hole but you got me I really enjoyed that book a lot in college
[00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:44.660]   and had a took a class that was called the nature of modern physics and it was a class
[00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:49.060]   who was oh yeah they call it basically physics for English majors right but it's the idea is
[00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:54.740]   it's a non-math physics class that like just kind of introduces you to some of the concepts
[00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:58.820]   of the modern physics and one of the books that we read it's called the dao of physics did you ever
[00:53:58.820 --> 00:54:03.300]   read that yeah that's classic yeah so it's a notice here that's available in audible so we
[00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:08.740]   might mention that one as well a double-dowed double-dow I always doubled down on 11 yeah
[00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:11.780]   blackjack joke it's funny um
[00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:17.940]   21 was last week okay no but um it's a really great book and it's just kind of like how these
[00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:21.940]   ideas like the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and stuff are sort of analogous to some of the
[00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:27.620]   concepts in eastern mysticism but especially of the dao I only mention it's a bit of a rat hole but
[00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:32.660]   no no no that's another good book and by the way they also have the dao de willy which is willy
[00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:38.340]   nelson's version of the dao I have to say I've read this not quite as profound as the dao de jing
[00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:43.780]   or the dao of physics it's you know you want to hear a little of the dao the dao of willy
[00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:51.700]   would I i'm fucked up all right let me see if I can uh I can play that we have the technology
[00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:55.860]   this is willy willy nelson reading this perhaps that's why it's been suggested we add his face to
[00:54:55.860 --> 00:55:00.420]   the cliff sub mount rushmore and be done this is the introduction praising willy you have to
[00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:04.660]   know who was that that sounds like it doesn't it for half a century he's played countless
[00:55:04.660 --> 00:55:08.980]   concerts across america and around the world it does sound like his appeal crosses nearly all
[00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:13.220]   socials and he had intercourse with him but he always seemed like a couple of his that that guy's
[00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:18.420]   name are you kidding are you ready for this is perhaps the best name in all of broadcasting
[00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:25.060]   turk pipkin oh that's good that's got pop i'm turk pipkin you're who turk pipkin
[00:55:25.940 --> 00:55:31.540]   okay closest turk pipkin turk pipkin anyway willy is does read part of that and i have to say i
[00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:37.940]   heard it and it's it's uh relaxing the anyway so there's three dao's there depending on your
[00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:42.980]   point of view the dao of willy the dao of physics or the dao de jing the original three good things
[00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:48.260]   i'd start the dao de jing would you please yes just to get to figure out what what the context is
[00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:52.260]   get your foundation willy nelson that can be named is not the true willy if memory serves
[00:55:53.460 --> 00:56:00.340]   exactly i'm sure that was some esoteric doubt a jing joke which i don't get but anyway uh was it
[00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:04.980]   that's the great thing you smoke a lot of pot in college and you just start thinking about everything
[00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:10.100]   it's the easy simple uh you know you can understand uh eastern philosophy if you just start you know
[00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:15.940]   well it must explain why there's so many books the dao of because there's like a dozen of these
[00:56:15.940 --> 00:56:20.980]   yeah i think you think the idea is if if if you don't know what it means it sounds a little bit
[00:56:20.980 --> 00:56:28.020]   fancy and spiritual t-a-o-t-e-ching that could be your free book or the dao of willy or you could you
[00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:31.620]   know this is the neat thing about audible there's something for everybody and the end and you just

[00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:53.860]   i tried that approach last week and it did not work i think i think i think i think i think i felt
[00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:58.980]   that with alcohol and now i very much feel like a silent but weren't you glad you had the gps
[00:57:58.980 --> 00:58:02.420]   i was about to say after after the past 20 minutes i think i was pouring the alcohol in the wrong
[00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:11.300]   opening so Andy we're doing our picks you want to do one yes i can do a pick as matter of fact i
[00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:15.540]   was going to do it all back to a pick that i believe i had several months ago which was the
[00:58:15.540 --> 00:58:22.500]   amazon kindle ebook reader it's in stock now you can actually buy it yes wow it's a very apple
[00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:26.500]   like sort of thing where hi it's great it's being wonderful reviewed we can get you one in just
[00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:33.940]   three to eight months um but i've had one since october or november and i i had one of those little
[00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:38.740]   moments a couple weeks ago when i realized that my opinions of the thing had changed for the better
[00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:43.780]   i'd always thought that was a really really great device i always liked it but i've always seen it
[00:58:43.780 --> 00:58:50.100]   as a mismarketed thing that app that amazon should really start selling it as uh the ultimate
[00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:56.100]   google reader device the ultimate blog reader where it's lightweight it's a big screen it has a big
[00:58:56.100 --> 00:59:00.660]   uh next and previous buttons on the side of it and the internet is wherever you are anywhere in
[00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:04.900]   the country and it's free for life because you buy the kindle you get free access to the sprint
[00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:10.820]   evdo network and you never have to pay for it but i found that by virtue of the fact that i just
[00:59:10.820 --> 00:59:17.060]   have it and i have it with me and i travel with it i have as to my surprise i have been buying ebooks
[00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:24.100]   via amazon a lot more often than i thought i would uh i i seem to now be in the mode where
[00:59:24.100 --> 00:59:28.740]   if there is a book that i'm interested in it's it's almost become like itunes where i will look for
[00:59:28.740 --> 00:59:34.180]   it on the amazon kindle store first only because i don't want to be carrying around this big massive
[00:59:34.180 --> 00:59:38.900]   hardcover with me everywhere i go and everywhere i fly for the next like two or three weeks if i
[00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:43.140]   have this kindle that i'm always going to have with me anyway that has whatever two or three books
[00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:47.700]   i'm working on that's a device that i can really work with and that can really have everything with
[00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:52.900]   me uh and then later on after i finish a book like uh when i finished the hudini book i went out and
[00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:56.580]   bought the i actually bought the paper back because this is good nothing i knew that i wanted to have
[00:59:56.580 --> 01:00:01.300]   it on the shelf i want to be able to reread it and reread it but so i mean if so you to ultimately
[01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:06.340]   you might go to paper if you really like a book uh so that's not so much i might go to paper i still
[01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:11.620]   think that's the default format but i'm actually it's it's maybe it's been hiding the fact that i'm
[01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:16.580]   probably going to be moving sometime this year i'm sort of contemplating sort of i'm sort of
[01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:22.100]   witnessing the big stonehenge like yeah arrangement of bookcases and thinking wouldn't it be great if i
[01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:26.100]   could read all the books that i have and i enjoy but i would only have to like carry this like three
[01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:30.580]   memory cards and instead of having to call in every favor i've ever been owed in the past 10 years
[01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:34.100]   exactly yeah it starts to happen when you when you start accumulating a lot of stuff as you get
[01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:38.500]   older it really does become more appealing to get stuff electronically i think i need i need to
[01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:42.340]   i need to make more money so i can finally build that library wing onto the house
[01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:47.940]   so the kindle yes so now you had one for review so you only had it for say a month
[01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:52.660]   i actually had it for two months and then i wound up my actually i had it for two months and then it was
[01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:57.780]   one of those things where i said why don't i just buy it from you okay so you kept it and yeah so i
[01:00:57.780 --> 01:01:04.500]   so i kept it i i voted with my pocketbook on it and it really is it really is a very very useful
[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:11.060]   device i still i still think that this my central reaction still goes either you have a kindle shaped
[01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:16.260]   hole in your life that this can spackle really really nicely or you don't because if you don't
[01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:20.580]   leave this sort of lifestyle where you're reading electronic documents and you're reading blogs like
[01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:26.020]   a good proportion of the day you might find it difficult to earn back that three hundred ninety
[01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:32.260]   nine dollars so to speak but for my lifestyle especially considering that uh i have to travel
[01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:38.020]   so often and i'm a i i need to be reading while i'm traveling uh i i had to really elevate my
[01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:42.180]   opinion of this i thought that it was again you know ten out of ten and some things eight out of
[01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:47.540]   ten maybe seven out of ten as a book uh so the kindle is your pick and if at four hundred
[01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:51.460]   dollars is about a half an alix but i think i agree with you know and i still use my kindle all the
[01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:56.740]   time i mean i've been reading a very very long science fiction trilogy on it and the fact that i
[01:01:56.740 --> 01:02:01.620]   don't have to carry around these big heavy books is just great yeah on top of it i just love the
[01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:07.620]   random another selling point was the random access of it um about a week ago it was all over uh like
[01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:14.020]   the usual news aggregator sites that someone had uh come across a backup archive network volume
[01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:19.780]   from info comm and it had all this email correspondence behind the moment of the second hitch i
[01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:23.220]   the sequels to the hitchhires guide to the galaxy game and that made me think about
[01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:27.620]   douglas adam's again and made me think about oh i'd like to read it like i read the neil game
[01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:32.660]   in spiography but i haven't i've never read one that was written posthumously and picked without
[01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:36.420]   even thinking about just picked up the kindle did a browse bought a book and was reading starting
[01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:42.420]   to read a biography just a minute later which is exactly the way that uh the i-tune store is so
[01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:47.300]   powerful you can just basically have this idea shop browse and be in it just five minutes later
[01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:51.620]   and also be you know seven and a half dollars poor but what the heck no i think more and more we're
[01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:55.460]   gonna get demand that experience nobody wants to get in the car and drive over somewhere to get
[01:02:55.460 --> 01:03:01.300]   to get a book or anything you know record anything there you go yeah you risk exposure to the giant
[01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:09.140]   day ball i hate that thing it burns all right let us uh let's see here um
[01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:14.900]   Alex Lindsay do you have a pick for us i do i have a pick for the iphone okay it's actually a website
[01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:21.060]   for the iphone um so uh and i'm not gonna belabor the point but as many people not many people know
[01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:26.420]   that i've gotten kind of addicted to twitter and um and one of my big complaints about twitter is
[01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:30.260]   that when you actually use their application on the iphone it doesn't tell you how many letters
[01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:36.500]   because my little haiku is that i actually just post 140 character posts you try to get 140
[01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:42.340]   characters every time exactly i think like 95 of mine are exactly 140 characters that's called
[01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:50.580]   a tootch yeah so so uh so uh it's called a what a tootch in fact there's a there's a site that you
[01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:57.940]   can sign up for and follow them and they'll keep track of your tootches so so i'm i'm a i was gonna
[01:03:57.940 --> 01:04:02.500]   say go ahead Andy what is it no i was gonna say it'll send you i had to turn it off because it
[01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:07.380]   kept so annoying it's a knowing message is a you tweet like a swad yeah 112 tweeters like okay
[01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:12.900]   thank you i'm not a i'm not a thank you thank you it's completely annoying
[01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:20.340]   however if you if you're one of those people who writes in 140 characters sentences and i think
[01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:25.380]   you might want to keep track of that it is it is sort of in our nature though it's like or at least
[01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:29.380]   it's in my nature as a writer if an editor says you have a thousand two hundred words i'm not gonna
[01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:33.860]   give him less than a thousand two hundred words because i'm just that like i'm just that that
[01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:38.420]   run of the mouthy it's kind of fun too because it's like there must be a way to change if i
[01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:42.340]   if i had a comma here right i'll have a hundred forty and a hundred thirty it's a real challenge
[01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:47.620]   to get everything exactly 140 so no it's a loop thing and go go yeah i know i've definitely i
[01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:51.940]   definitely enjoy it because it it requires me you know if i change this word from this to this and
[01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:55.620]   if i change this to this and and i you know it's it's one of those things that it was hard at the
[01:04:55.620 --> 01:05:00.820]   beginning and now it's just kind of all right automatic so you need to sign it's tweet 140.com by
[01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:05.620]   the way tweet 140.com you should sign up so so the the problem is is that the twitter one doesn't
[01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:10.340]   really if you text message it you can over you can run over 140 and if you use the twitter
[01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:20.180]   one it's you know it's a fubar so there's another one a website called twitter for iphone.com
[01:05:20.180 --> 01:05:24.260]   and if you go to twitter for iphone.com when you start typing it in it's actually a nicer interface
[01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:28.260]   and when you actually start typing it in it actually tells you how many characters you have left
[01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:34.660]   i know that seems like a little thing to you but to me it's very important so um so anyway so that
[01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:42.980]   sorry i'm sorry if you use halo hahlo no because that'll also give you a count as you go it has a
[01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:47.380]   really nice iphone interface and they're beta testing a new version of the interface it's even
[01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:59.620]   slicker yeah a lot of people like that one yeah h a halo.
[01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:01.540]   halo.
[01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:10.980]   ruin your i can get it check it out i love twitter.
[01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:15.060]   people are so sick of us talking about twitter well that's all that's all that's all that's
[01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:19.380]   what i had new this week no i have something else i'm working but i have it's nice no it's good no
[01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:24.500]   that's good that's great oh you yeah you did you actually showed a little restraint not talking
[01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:29.140]   about your own product but we talked about it did we talk about it last week okay yeah we talked
[01:06:29.140 --> 01:06:32.420]   about at the beginning of the of the show so i didn't feel like i should talk about it i can end up
[01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:39.620]   the show so but we have new products coming to dp dp matt dv matt dv matt d it's called dp matt
[01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:45.300]   dp's for aperture okay yeah and it's it's been going like hotcakes as we're very excited good
[01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:49.940]   yeah well you got a lot of tension because you're the first company to write a plug-in for aperture
[01:06:49.940 --> 01:06:55.140]   using that new plug-in architecture so everybody's looking at it saying wow you can do that i think
[01:06:55.140 --> 01:07:00.020]   by june will be the first one the right three wow now that now that we figured it out it's uh we're
[01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:05.620]   we're trying to we want to get conduit in into it we're working on a hdr toner uh so do hdr stuff
[01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:09.220]   and so we're uh we're off to the races so we're having a lot of fun that's great
[01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:15.380]   merlin man you got to pick for us i do uh as i said i was visiting with family uh down in florida
[01:07:15.380 --> 01:07:20.980]   and uh you know for a long time i knew i had stopped recommending the mac to people really
[01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:26.340]   mostly you know through the 90s because it was i don't know it wasn't fun uh to be a mac user in
[01:07:26.340 --> 01:07:34.500]   the 90s but you know after west 10 got more sure i felt more comfortable um and uh i don't know
[01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:38.180]   there's all kinds of ways you can sell a mac i think when we sell a mac is by showing people how
[01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:46.260]   fun is to do stuff so i i pulled up uh photobooth and my family had a rariest like old timey fun
[01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:50.420]   isn't great if i just play with photobooth yeah so uh first of all i wanted to mention that i
[01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:56.900]   may be about to sell uh two macbooks just on the basis of photobooth but um i'm really related to
[01:07:56.900 --> 01:08:01.700]   that by the way you can't make a macintosh your pick on mac break quickly really oh this is
[01:08:01.700 --> 01:08:09.780]   awkward um okay i guess i'll pick alex's app there's uh uh you can get e-cam network is a company that
[01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:15.700]   makes uh different little wacky they're the greatest but they uh call recorder yep this is for
[01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:20.900]   skype but it's the first thing that really allows you to record skype all the time it's just great
[01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:28.900]   it's a huge guy um but have you seen eyeglasses no it's um it's kind of a weird little funny one-off
[01:08:28.900 --> 01:08:35.060]   thing uh it's 995 which is i think 170th of an alex and eyeglasses is a little plug-in you
[01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:42.260]   installing any um application that uses the the like a camera basically you get extra control over
[01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:46.900]   the settings on how it's capturing um and the way that they they way that they sell it which is
[01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:51.060]   really smart is to let's say you're in an environment where you don't have a lot of control over the
[01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:56.100]   lighting like your studio you can um make as a joke you can um make it brighter so like there's
[01:08:56.100 --> 01:09:01.460]   all these built-in sort of combinations of almost like filters in photoshop and so you can do
[01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:08.100]   separate filters or you can do kind of their uh presets and uh so the the business use for it is
[01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:13.620]   like okay instead of having that sort of dreary uh low contrast darkish look that most of us get
[01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:18.740]   out of our mac books uh this this can make it really pop but there's all kinds of like little wacky
[01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:23.620]   effects you can have it kind of swirl through different colors all trippy but um if you do a
[01:09:23.620 --> 01:09:26.900]   lot with your camera and don't want to have to mess around with a higher end one you just kind of
[01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:31.220]   need slightly better performance uh for ten bucks you can get some uh it's a pretty nice way to
[01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:39.300]   act on it very cool that uh cam ecamm.com is the company and it's called eyeglasses and it's 995
[01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:45.780]   very good all right yeah it is yeah and and come to think of it i think it's been around for a
[01:09:45.780 --> 01:09:52.180]   while hasn't it i read about it my friend gord uh gordazm uh was who i learned about it from um
[01:09:52.180 --> 01:09:55.620]   and i just got it for fun he says he likes to play with you know when he's his daughter and
[01:09:55.620 --> 01:10:00.740]   hammer playing with uh the camera he likes to use it and so i got it just for fun because i've
[01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:04.820]   been doing more stuff with the built-in camera is it using i wonder if it's using the the quartz
[01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:10.420]   effects oh you know that's a good question if you go to the page uh you'll see the little kind of
[01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:13.700]   screenshots they'll show you in a drop down there's all kinds of little things you can do i mean
[01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:19.620]   i think the real the reason most people probably buy this is to you know improve the the image but
[01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:22.820]   whatever you want to compensate you can do night vision i haven't gotten that to work you can
[01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:26.660]   change the white balance there's all kinds of stuff you can do so if you're like a hacker i'm sure
[01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:29.700]   you could probably do all this stuff on your own but it's nice little for ten bucks it's a nice little
[01:10:29.700 --> 01:10:36.980]   package yeah i wanted to mention that because last week i mentioned uh ovoto ovovovovlabs
[01:10:36.980 --> 01:10:44.420]   uh geofoto as a tagging solution and i got a hurt a very hurt email from the author of huda geo huda
[01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:51.380]   geo uh he said well you know it's widely considered that huda geo is the best photo tagging software
[01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:56.260]   and i had a sentiment on saying you know i i'd ever heard of it so i tried it and you know it's it's
[01:10:56.260 --> 01:11:04.580]   not as feature rich as uh as as a geofoto from ovovolab but if what you're trying to do is is get your
[01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:11.140]   gps tracking into your pictures it's it's the bomb i mean it really is a great tool 25 euros
[01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:17.700]   supports i photo and aperture uh and i think i saw it had a lightroom as well although it doesn't say
[01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:23.380]   it on their website um another good choice something to look at if you're a geofoto user you should
[01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:31.780]   probably look at huda geo as well h-o-u-d-a-h dot com that's not my pick i just wanted to give him
[01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:36.260]   credit because he's been around doing it for a while and i felt bad i i didn't know about it so now
[01:11:36.260 --> 01:11:41.380]   you know and then i have to give a little credit to uh somebody who's on the mac break weekly
[01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:48.820]   team i guess in a sense uh somebody who uh tagged something we get you know all the time on our mac
[01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:55.300]   break weekly ideas site we get picks and suggestions and uh this one is kind of fun i downloaded it
[01:11:55.300 --> 01:12:04.500]   uh credit to cephalopodcast that's his that's his name and it's called chill from bitnotic
[01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:09.780]   have you guys ever seen this yeah you've seen it don't know i have it
[01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:14.180]   it's not but i i went and googled it after you mentioned it yeah it was like in the wacky uh ambient
[01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:18.900]   keyboard noise kind of yeah it's um it's a little application so i have all these settings on it
[01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:26.420]   i have mood i could go mellow more or less beats more or less swell more or less uh let me select
[01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:30.260]   click swell i'm gonna make it should be like make less mellow because you kind of like you thought
[01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:36.580]   it was too trancy huh to to relax and then in the mix i can say uh let's bring the melody up
[01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:43.060]   the ambience down i don't know what pat is and i can have a heartbeat or i can have effects let's
[01:12:43.060 --> 01:12:50.020]   turn on the um let's turn on both heartbeat and effects i could choose my uh my key i'm gonna do
[01:12:50.020 --> 01:12:56.340]   g major 75 bits a minute you're ready to hear my auto-generated music this is chill
[01:12:57.700 --> 01:13:02.420]   and you can have chill radio you could choose the song length i could make it five ten
[01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:07.620]   twice kind of like piziz without the talking and you could save it out to a wave or an aipf
[01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:11.540]   file or midi here we go this is every time something something different
[01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:16.420]   what are you laughing at
[01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:25.300]   limit is that in there no let's oh that's good that would be good can we add the
[01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:33.380]   lat i need a button for laughter you don't like it come on okay i'm just i'm always i'm gonna say
[01:13:33.380 --> 01:13:37.860]   this i don't i don't like movies at which philip glass is doing this not correct what if i were
[01:13:37.860 --> 01:13:43.780]   my life this can this give me this soundtrack for your life should press this well and then it's
[01:13:43.780 --> 01:13:48.660]   kind of live so you can have it do stuff change stuff while you're oh there was a little swell
[01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:58.340]   it's like every computer graphics demo okay it's a crappy pick i admit it but it's free
[01:13:58.340 --> 01:14:03.860]   i think it's kind of fun i'm sorry i'm being read to you very rude that
[01:14:03.860 --> 01:14:07.540]   no no that's this one first one this one person's opinion
[01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:14.260]   you know i just i think it's i you know if you wanted to relax i'm seeing chrome spheres
[01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:18.340]   more figures with tucker board okay different one this is going to be f major
[01:14:19.140 --> 01:14:23.620]   see now it's really different oh that's better you like that better yeah yeah bring up the heartbeat
[01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:27.860]   that's sweet you like the heartbeat i love the heartbeat okay how about the effects i'll put
[01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:37.300]   them effects in as well i you know it is 80 years after world war four exactly alone warrior
[01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:44.420]   strides the wasteland that once was downtown chicago where's the pizzas so uh anyway there's
[01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:49.060]   it just a silly little little gadget that you can have in the background but i think from now on
[01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:52.100]   i'm gonna have this running in back of all my podcasts
[01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:57.700]   maybe i wouldn't be funny if i just kind of went off like that just started doing that
[01:14:57.700 --> 01:15:04.020]   would you guys desert me i think you could probably compose a kind of nad hoc soundtrack for the
[01:15:04.020 --> 01:15:10.340]   show that would be like things are going bad yes like something's really about to go down okay this
[01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:15.140]   could be something more upbeat this is happier
[01:15:15.140 --> 01:15:20.020]   that heartbeat's not good i think i think the army now it sounds like something's
[01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:25.860]   losing them get the cross-code step it's 20 milligrams of envy get the board
[01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:33.060]   see i think of all the people who hate this the most at least any you're inspired by it it moves you
