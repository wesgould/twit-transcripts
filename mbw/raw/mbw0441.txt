[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.600]   talk about the latest news from Cupertino. That's where Renee Richie is
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.040]   getting his secret briefing right now so. What are you laughing at Andy
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:01.760]   and I go. Oh you always got everybody else's back. He didn't say so he didn't
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.320]   say so but I'm assuming so but we have brought in two people to replace him so
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.960]   starting for my left with Mr. Andy and I go the Chicago Sun times of course can't
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.240]   do a show without him. So Renee called well from i'm more dot com great to have
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.440]   you. Great to be here. Both of them from Boston area where the snow has reached
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.200]   Gronkowski plus reach. I'm told that's that's like eight feet high isn't he
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.760]   huge. It's like six six something feet and then they have they have him reaching
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.040]   with the football too. So it's like measuring up there too. Wow. It's ridiculous. Wow.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.640]   I I have to say I am a fan of any team that has a guy named Gronkowski on the
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.240]   team and the fact that he's a great player makes it just even better. It's
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.280]   a bonus. If you've got it if you've got a name that naturally collapses with a
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.640]   nickname Gronk you're definitely going to be either rugby or football there's just
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.920]   no way to get it rounded. That's your your that's a combined ordinance right
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:05.200]   there Gronk. And if your name were spelled M Y K E you'd probably be the other kind
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.600]   of footballer. Mike Hurley is here co-founder of relay dot FM. Great to have
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.360]   you here they are. First time. And I see you're well equipped with your Bob
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.440]   Heil arm and microphone. Of course. Yes. I'm pretending to be a pro. So I had to
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.760]   get one of them. Tell us about relay FM. We're a relatively new podcast network
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.080]   I've been doing this for a while. We have a bunch of shows. We have good friend
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.280]   Mr. Jason Snell has a couple of shows on relay. Yeah. We're we're already
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.880]   hating off. I hate you. I hate you. And they have a working website. Damn you. So
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.480]   actually I'm really interested in the pan addict frankly I'm gonna start
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.920]   listening to that because I also am a pan addict. Oh you love it. I love it. It's
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.240]   a we have it we have a very specific but very devoted audience for that show. I
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.320]   just I always wanted to do a pen show. I just it's exactly what I why I didn't
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.320]   because I felt like it'd be very specific. You know they're just all audience was
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.640]   wasn't like episode 80 something where you had that big round table debate about
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.720]   blue versus midnight blue ink. That was a driveway moment because I really thought
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.880]   they're gonna. What do you think you haven't done it. What kind of yeah I'm
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.640]   sure they have. What kind of pen are you rocking these days. I have it right here.
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.080]   My favorite at the moment is called a Twisby 540. Oh I I am a fountain
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.680]   pen guy. Me too. Well of course you are. You can't be a
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.040]   pan addict to be like a felt in pan addict. That's silly. You have to be a fountain
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:39.440]   pen guy. That's given. What's it called again. It's called Twisby's. It's P W S B I.
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.360]   So it's like I think they're from Korea or Japan. They're inspired by writing.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.680]   Oh they're beautiful. They are stunning. You see everybody is I'm a pan addict too.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.080]   Wow look at these. Are they all demonstrators. Most of them are yeah.
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.240]   What's a demonstration. It's when you can see the inside.
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.200]   Demonstrates the ink. Yeah. They have different sizes. Well I've taken over a
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:14.760]   bit if a fly for this. Welcome to Mac. Hands and watches. That's it. There's
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:21.000]   there's there's those are the things that matter. I have actually picked up the
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.040]   iPhone again because I want to prepare for the Apple watch. So I figured by the
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.720]   April I should be ready to actually have a because I know I'm gonna have to
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:34.520]   carry an iPhone again. No this isn't a half bad. This is not half bad. It's funny
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.520]   when you don't carry an iPhone day to day and you and not this is the six not
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.440]   the six plus and you and you hold it. It's just really a remarkably well
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.640]   designed device down to the glass that's kind of flowing over the sides like
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.880]   that. I just love this. Nice. I'm doing a I'm doing a follow-up to my my iPad
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.880]   Air 2 review. They'll probably hit you this week or next and I just really had
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.560]   to sometimes you find yourself facing a lead paragraph that you instinctively
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.320]   wanted to leave because oh that looks like a bus ad but I really do have to
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.440]   stick to that. I really do have to be honest to say that I think the iPad Air
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.640]   2 is the most beautiful tech. It's the most perfect Apple product and it's
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:16.400]   one of the is the most beautiful tech item you can buy today and the design
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.280]   that that flows onto the iPhone 6 is a bit of a little bit of a step down for
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.960]   a couple of reasons but it's Apple Trust is so good at making these beautiful
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.400]   beautiful objects. Well I think we can all agree it's the Twisbee of tablets.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.560]   If it's transparent aluminum body then it's definitely the Twisbee. Oh I want a
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.960]   demonstrator iPad. That would be cool. See I use the words right away. I just
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:45.120]   incorporate them into my language. Actually germane to that point the the
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.800]   issue of course for a lot of us still is that iOS 8's a little flaky and buggy
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:57.640]   we're now up to 8.0. What is it 1.3? I can't even keep track of the updates.
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.640]   8.3 or what's been just something just something just something just came out.
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:08.440]   The current version on my 6 is 8.1.3 and then I guess they're
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.440]   seating 8.1.4 probably but word comes out from Mark Gurman and I
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:17.120]   find back that iOS 9 will be what we have been saying for some time. The snow
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:22.240]   leopard of iOS. Let's get everything. Let's fix this all now and before we add a
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:29.480]   lot of new features. Good idea Serenity. You know I think that there's actually
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:34.560]   a fair amount of improvement done in the eight point variations. I think it's
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:38.680]   definitely a good idea to continue that improvement. Especially with iOS 9.
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:44.480]   But I think the rumors of iOS 9 being exactly identical to a snow leopard
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:50.040]   type release where you have no new features. I think that might be a little
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:55.680]   hard to sell in this current current Apple economy where everybody really
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:00.480]   like can you imagine I mean especially with again Apple's biggest quarter ever
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:04.080]   and that having them come out and be like yeah we're not going to release
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:08.280]   any features for a year. That's kind of an unfortunate cage isn't it where you
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:12.600]   have you're expected to be innovating constantly. It absolutely is and it's
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.920]   so frustrating because you know of course when you're moving this at this
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:20.640]   faster pace and really Apple did kind of dig themselves into a hole here by
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:25.560]   saying we're going to release iOS updates every year and they're going to be
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:29.960]   exciting rather than maybe we should do this every other year and give ourselves
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:36.040]   some you know space. Yeah exactly but now Wall Street and you know its
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:40.920]   component parts expect that Apple has to release X Y and Z every so often and
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:45.840]   if they don't God forbids you know it's it's unfortunate and they have kind of
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:51.280]   dug themselves into a hole but you know I do think there's a there's a good way
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:55.960]   to balance here where they can sell something that's a more stable update
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:00.760]   while at the same time saying okay you know we have some new features too and
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:06.280]   maybe those will implicitly play into the stability so maybe it's extensions
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:11.000]   but a couple new extensions so we can solidify our extensibility framework
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.480]   that we started with iOS 8 and build out some new things so that people aren't
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:24.280]   immediately like oh why isn't there new stuff? Apple is doomed exactly. That's too
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:28.720]   bad you know and there's got to be some way out of that because that really I
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:34.200]   think that really hurts you although I agree with you surrounding that they
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:39.840]   have they have with the notches the 812 and 813 it's kind of gotten rid of
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:45.080]   most of the bugs I do wish they'd open NFC one of the first things I want you
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:48.680]   know I do on my Android phone is I have a Sony phone that has an NFC on it and I
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:53.960]   can tap the phone to the camera they'll pair and copy the images off the camera
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.560]   to the phone which is really handy for you know quick Instagram and stuff. Oh
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:01.280]   that's neat. Yeah but and and I thought oh well this is no problem because the
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:06.240]   new iPhones have NFC but it's locked down only Apple can use it so it's a little
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:10.800]   frustrating is that the that's the kind of mini thing that an iOS well I'd hope
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:16.200]   they do it before nine but that an iOS update could fix without it wouldn't
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:21.920]   seem like yeah I'm pretty sure it's software it's soft it's definitely
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:27.080]   software yeah yeah I mean the real problem in that arena is security and
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:31.120]   Apple I mean we've seen in the past is very very serious about making sure that
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:35.000]   users devices are appropriately locked down so that information just can't
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:42.360]   fly out but that's paranoia I mean we've had pairing via Bluetooth for years and
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:46.880]   of course and why not make it easier with NFC just that you tap it and it says
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:51.360]   hello oh you're here okay I'm there yeah well and I think that it's definitely
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:55.640]   you know it's definitely an option down the line but current technology just
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:59.440]   may not be secure enough or it may not be implemented currently in a way that
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:04.360]   Apple feels is secure enough to allow random NFC pairing because it because
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:09.280]   if you think about it like if they open that up that that opens the doors to all
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:13.720]   kinds of uses with third-party apps it's not just oh tapping your camera to
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:18.680]   offload your pictures it could be exchanging all kinds of secure information
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.440]   or potentially you know information that needs to be secure and if they don't
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:27.720]   have a good system for ensuring customer security especially again going back
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:34.040]   to the Apple's biggest quarter of our apples you know big target we don't the
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:38.120]   last thing Apple wants is a big news story that's like NFC system
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:43.480]   compromise NFC is also the thing that Apple Pay uses and even though Apple Pay
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:47.200]   may not be compromised you could see how that could very easily spin out of
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:52.200]   control into a like oh you know if NFC is compromised Apple Pay is compromised
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:57.440]   this thing is a failure yeah I think there's also the question of of style
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:01.440]   like what features really float Apple's boat when they're putting stuff again and
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.760]   I don't think that they I don't think NFC is as interesting to them as the idea
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:07.760]   of well why do you have to tap to begin with why can't this device to simply
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:12.240]   sense the the real close presence of this device and then move you forward
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:16.920]   that way and I mean Bluetooth LE I guess right yeah exactly and that and that
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:20.960]   works great too I mean it is there are different I've used contactless payments
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:26.880]   with with my Android phone and with my and with an iPhone and it really is that
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:31.120]   difference between I actually have to take my Android phone and lay it on top of
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:34.800]   you know the the the transponder that's at McDonald's or at Walgreens or
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:39.880]   whatever whereas my phone just simply says oh I see that you're within like
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.320]   half a foot of this pay terminal do you want to pay with using my wonderful
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:47.080]   love contactless space system so there's a case to be made for both ways I
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:50.920]   really wish I it is a philosophy it's also philosophical thing where do you
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:56.000]   want to create NFC and then say everybody whatever you want to do with NFC do
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.960]   that thing with NFC or do you want to have an ecosystem where there's some
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:03.960]   measure of control where there is a plan for how this is supposed to be
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:09.480]   used and how a customer is going to expect NFC to improve their lives and
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:13.280]   I don't think that's not something that Apple Apple would much rather have a
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:18.320]   story behind NFC than simply saying it we put that in there we put in we put
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:21.480]   in wireless charging we put in all these other things whatever you want guys
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:24.600]   want to do it that surprise us and please us with your inventiveness I don't
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:29.280]   think that's that's Apple's way of going it does kind of underscore why it
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.920]   reminds me why I moved to Android because I you know I'm an
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:37.600]   authoritarian by nature you're a rebel dad I'm a rebel and I and I just you know
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:42.040]   it's like oh hey great Apple finally put NFC in their phone oh too bad only
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:47.440]   Apple can use it it's like you know it's that's it's interestingly oh that you
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.960]   you went to that place like you thought oh I'll just tap my camera to and it
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:55.200]   all worked like it shows that you've kind of been away from the iPhone for a
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:14:01.960]   while my false expectations is scooter in our chat room is saying I love it I
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:05.840]   could tap my Android phone and my headphones my Bluetooth headphones pairs
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:11.440]   turns them on I'm done yeah and it's it you get you get used to features like
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:15.120]   that and now remember NFC has been around for a long time we for a while we
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:20.600]   had an NFC tag Samsung started this NFC tag in the in the hallway when people
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:24.280]   visited the studio they could tap it with their phone their non-iPhone tap it
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:28.680]   with their phone and would launch four square and check them in nobody ever
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:32.800]   did that so there have been a lot of NFC features that you know nobody
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:36.960]   misses but you get you get attached to some simple things like pairing to
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:41.240]   devices very quickly and I mean there's even I think there's cars now where you
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:45.120]   tap the dashboard with your NFC yeah you should you do things like that I have
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:48.240]   as matter of fact I have an NFC tag in my car in my phone
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:52.640]   - holder yeah so that as soon as I don't have to do anything there's also a
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.280]   lot of the piece of software put in there that says oh if you see this NFC
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:59.440]   tag that means I'm in the car so therefore disconnect from Wi-Fi set
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:03.520]   the set the launcher to this do this that the other all stuff that you I wouldn't
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:07.200]   bother to do if I had to do it all manually but that's not that's also not
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:11.600]   the sort of thing that I can we again it's I'm I'm over the years I'm so amazed
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:16.560]   by how much technology is controlled by the personality of that device yeah
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:21.480]   where the correct the correct response to that if you were going from an Apple
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:25.800]   perspective is well but Andy had to set up that put that tag there and Andy had
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:29.800]   to find out the software existed and Andy had to configure that software we
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.160]   much rather build something so that things just work by magic even if that
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:38.360]   means that Andy can't do that with an iPhone until you know 2015 2016 2017
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:43.760]   it's just not our personality we just don't do those things they have IB
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:47.560]   eacons right the Bluetooth low energy receivers I mean I know it's not the same
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:56.080]   thing that's been implemented or used maybe it's all it's also kind of I keep
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:59.800]   going back and forth but which one I prefer I like NFC because it is so I
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:03.880]   like met as far as a physical a physical user interface I like the idea
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:08.400]   that if I make if I bring this in contact with this I've definitely registered
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:12.160]   here here's where I am whereas there are times when maybe something doesn't
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.920]   really it's not identifying that the presence of a device I don't know is it
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:21.160]   because a radio is turned off is it's because I'm not close enough it's it
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.760]   really is a technology that has to be everywhere before it's going to be
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:31.760]   anywhere so to speak it's kind of a situation where you decide that there are
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:35.800]   there are standards that everybody else is adopting and then in order to prove
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:39.960]   this is a weird mindset but I think it's Apple's mindset in order to provide value
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:44.080]   we have to create it we have to do it our way because we don't and it is it
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.800]   competitive we don't want to do what everybody else is doing because there's
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:53.440]   no differentiation it's partly that you can use the security excuse but I think
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:57.360]   that's kind of a red herring I don't think NFC is inherently insecure I think
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:02.080]   they could make it more but I think it really is more it's like well we want to
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:08.120]   differentiate and then it's just about competition it's not NFC works it's
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:11.600]   fine it works very well there's no reason not to implement it except that it
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:16.960]   everybody else has implemented it well I mean there's also I there's a reason why
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:21.160]   a phone doesn't have like an SD card slot it's not that this isn't a good
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.640]   feature it's not that there isn't a subset of people who are really going to
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:27.800]   use that but before you decide to make that it's not it's it's not just
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:32.720]   deciding to it's to build it it's also deciding to support it and debug it and
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:36.080]   make sure that every subsequent release supports it and you before you
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:40.440]   undertake that kind of effort even if you're a big company like Apple or Google
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:46.360]   or whoever you ask yourself are we giving a feature for people that should we put
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:49.720]   that kind of effort into a feature that we think is going to work better that we
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.480]   think is going to be more harmonious with all kinds of other things that we've
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:56.320]   got planned or do we put in this feature that 10% of the people will
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:02.080]   absolutely love but another 80% will be completely indifferent to and 10% could
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:06.600]   maybe be sort of talked into it so I mean oh we've talked about this before Apple
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:10.160]   also has a follow-through issue so so okay so they said well we're gonna be
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:14.960]   kids we're gonna do but you tell me not NFC that in order for that to be a
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:19.600]   competitive you need to then push it and I beacons is just sat there and this I
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:23.880]   you know it's happened again and again with Apple technologies it's you could
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:27.000]   well you could say that Apple TV has just sort of sat there you could also say
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.600]   that health kit is just sort of sat there and home kid has just sort of sat
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.960]   there those that's less in case with those last two technologies it's kind of
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:36.520]   it's kind of okay if you put these things out there so that whatever
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:40.920]   whatever your next step is you know that you fix this first step yeah so it's
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:45.080]   I'm I'm a 74 and a half million iPhones obviously they're doing something
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.640]   right exactly an Apple TV everything that everything that everything that was
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:50.880]   I was by the way last quarter that wasn't ever that was yeah I mean that it's
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.960]   just amazing almost everything you can point to an Apple that you could term a
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:57.520]   quote failure unquote is only a failure compared to the iPhone for anybody
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:00.040]   else that would be huge right they're selling ten phones a second so
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:05.440]   obviously whatever I care about is not mainstream enough to for Apple to worry
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:09.100]   at all go ahead serenity I'm sorry oh no I was just gonna say regarding I
[00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:12.880]   beacons there's actually there's a lot of a lot of tech that's been implemented
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:17.600]   especially on the retail side it's just it's not sexy so you don't hear a lot
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:21.520]   about it you know you don't you don't hear about oh Nordstrom's is implementing
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:25.720]   I beacons to help its shoppers more easily like no one those stories have been
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:29.400]   posted and they were just no one uses it well no one's no one's just all right
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:33.000]   so the thing about I beacons though is that they're not designed to be active
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.480]   things for going back to this whole idea of Apple wants things to just work
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:40.720]   they don't want you to actually have to actively think about tapping your phone
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:44.200]   to something I beacons aren't really designed so that you have to go in and
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.640]   like tap your phone to something I'm happy Apple pay you tap your phone is
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:52.000]   something you can't say that that's a bad thing no I'm not I mean that's come
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.920]   on that that can't have it both ways we change the world by making it so easy
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:58.800]   to pay with Apple pay by tapping something but we don't want to do tapping
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:05.200]   if there's something else yeah I mean it's go ahead you're right yeah spending
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:09.240]   your money and and you know actually physically having digital goods leave
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:14.400]   your wallet versus walking into a store and getting a pop up for instance you
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:18.200]   know those little tiny have you been tiny icons have you this has happened to
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.680]   you you've gone into Nordstrom and it's pop and things have popped up in your
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:24.880]   phone? Nordstrom's per se but like Starbucks is a great example of yes
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:28.680]   has the Bluetooth LA technology if you ever see the icon in the in the lower
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:32.680]   left-hand corner that allows that's like when you walk near an Apple store
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:36.000]   you walk near yeah the lock screen when you walk near an Apple store when you
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.680]   walk near Starbucks when you walk near any other retailer that has this
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:42.840]   technology implemented it allows you to quickly launch the app it allows you
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:48.120]   to see coupons relative to that specific store it allows you to book a
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:51.800]   genius appointment if you're at the Apple store so like there there are a lot of
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:56.600]   ways for the the I-beacons aren't even necessarily like active features they're
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:01.920]   basically just little locators forgive me but UGG so my choice is between having
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:05.360]   functional NFC that I could tap on things in Bluetooth pair I can have my
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:10.600]   camera copy phone pictures to my phone or I can have MacGalk by a store and
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:15.120]   something pops up saying buy some coffee thank you Apple for really choosing the
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:21.640]   better of the two come on really my to my way in on this I know they are but
[00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:26.360]   that's my point is exactly that Apple shows Apple chose a technology that's
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:29.720]   implemented in the to do something for retailers but doesn't do anything for me
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:32.400]   versus something that could really do something for me and they put it in
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:36.120]   finally and what do they do with it they disable it for everybody but but
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:42.160]   Apple pay it doesn't your and if we feel fun Leo does it just work within the
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:47.200]   same manufacturer so does Sony phones so any Android phone any Android phone with
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:51.280]   NFC and you have to have the Sony app installed but when you tap it against
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:56.280]   the camera the NFC chips as oh launch play memories play memories launches the
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:22:01.760]   tube pair and I copy images from my phone my Sony phone to my Nexus 6 or
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:07.360]   whatever I'm using it is open it is a standard it is used widely by a lot of
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:11.360]   manufacturers for Bluetooth pairing if nothing else this isn't Bluetooth what
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:16.280]   this does is actually a little different establishes a white a transient Wi-Fi
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:19.840]   connection ad hoc Wi-Fi connection copies of pictures over very rapidly
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:23.560]   which is nice and then disables the Wi-Fi connection goes back so I haven't
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:28.080]   lost my internet it's actually very elegant but rent
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.880]   this run it is absolutely right though I mean there's there are two different
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:34.320]   technologies for due to two different purposes I think that NFC is great when
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:38.480]   you really do need to have that mental process of I want to this to talk to
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:41.680]   this so I'm gonna tap them together and they'll talk to each other but then you
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:46.160]   know I would I also when I first started playing with NFC I put NFC
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:50.000]   stickers in lots of places I put them like in the pot mets the spot my desk
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.520]   where I usually drop my phone I put them in the doorway of my house so that if I
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:58.640]   wanted to do a hey look hey network hey phone I'm home right now that I but I
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:04.160]   almost never use them whereas if I if my Apple TV were an iBeacon and it could
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:06.560]   just simply tell that oh Andy's home right now so I'll make sure that the
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:10.080]   Nest thermostat knows that I'll make sure the lights are on upstairs I'll make
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.880]   sure that all these other things happens that would that would then be
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:16.720]   software features I would use all the time because I'm just not in the habit of
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:20.720]   got to tap the got to tap the doorway I got a call for an arch before I can
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:25.360]   actually use all these great features maybe they'll build it in someday
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:29.840]   yeah there's definitely maybe a theory that it couldn't happen maybe they'll
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:33.760]   do that someday I mean I have to say there is an example which is the apple
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:39.200]   wallet which for several iterations of iPhones was completely silly right it
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:45.200]   was it was boarding passes and passbook loyalty cards passbook but with the
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:49.120]   advent of apple wallet suddenly boom boom it's great and we complain for
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:51.840]   years that well I can't put credit why can't I put credit cards in here so
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:57.200]   finally Apple did it so maybe iBeacon I'll get around to it yeah maybe a home
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:01.520]   kit you know maybe home kit the home kit stuff might be something because
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:04.400]   saying like going into your home and having a light term on and stuff like
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:08.880]   that you could just say hey Terry I'm home and it does a bunch of things
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:14.080]   yeah we are going to see an 8.3 with the advent of the apple watch
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:18.240]   not only will that support apple watch but there's a lot more
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:22.480]   a coming 9 to 5 Mac again damn that Mark Gurman
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:27.120]   I hope Renee's getting some big briefings here
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:31.920]   shaking his fist being like where where are your leaks he's got some good
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:37.040]   he's got some good sources I can tell you just get some coffee shops you know
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:39.680]   I think Renee's just like I just spent a whole week at coffee shops with
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.320]   binoculars to just look at people to see what's on their
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:45.760]   wrist to see if they've got special shoes on follow Mark Gurman around that
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:51.600]   song so I always ate three wireless carplay I like it
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:55.120]   you think that'll be maybe that's maybe that's Ellie maybe that's uh
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:25:02.160]   improved Google login new emojis and apple pay for China
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:05.760]   so this has been seeded along with the 6.3 beta for Xcode
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:09.440]   and a new version of Swift which we'll talk about in just a second
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:14.160]   um how would the I wonder how wirelessly connecting the iPhone to the carplay
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:18.880]   maybe that is maybe that is Ibikin well it's um that's I believe uh
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:23.120]   bluetooth connectivity previous to this any manufacturer who had carplay
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:26.880]   enabled you had to plug it in oh this is just bluetooth oh
[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:30.560]   so this is the wireless version of carplay so now when you get in your car
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:34.560]   in theory you can connect to carplay automatically you don't have to plug
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:38.000]   your phone into USB or anything is there enough bandwidth to
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.520]   do I think they must be doing an ad hoc Wi-Fi network or something because
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:44.320]   you're gonna put the screen up you're gonna have Siri
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:47.440]   you're gonna have maps I don't think bluetooth's gonna be able to do that maybe
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:50.320]   it is yeah it might be I had a Wi-Fi I don't I'm not really sure about the
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:53.920]   technology behind wireless carplay but either way it'll allow it's just
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:57.840]   easier for the for the customer and the user and of course all the car
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:01.680]   manufacturers are going oh crap
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:05.840]   it's gonna we'll have that in four years when we get the new models out
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:10.240]   uh you know this is one of the one of the central things about carplay is so
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:14.560]   that you don't necessarily have to have a pro pro proprietary uh apple hardware
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:16.640]   you know you don't you know you don't you don't have a special radio inside
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:19.280]   this car deck you don't necessarily have to have a special connector
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:22.480]   so I wouldn't be surprised if it were at least they're using I wouldn't be
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:25.200]   surprised if they were using bluetooth at least to initiate the connection
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:28.240]   and at that after that there is some other kind of other technology they're
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:31.760]   using to maintain the stream yeah because I don't think I don't know how fast
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:35.440]   bluetooth could go I must go maybe fast enough I don't know oh bluetooth 4 is
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:40.880]   not bad it's pretty swift yeah yeah um let's see what else the
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:43.760]   logins for this is for me I use two-factor with
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:48.720]   google and uh it is a kind of a pain and this has been a while for other
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:52.640]   apps and other other os is to kind of adjust the idea that you don't just
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:56.560]   do your your email and your password you also have to add a second factor
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:00.720]   um a lot of times with apple I have to create a
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:04.960]   attempt an app specific password this will eliminate that I think
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:11.360]   the new emoji picker hallelujah hallelujah you see do you use a lot of
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:15.040]   emojis serenity you know if two years ago someone it said to me
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:18.000]   you're gonna really be excited about a new emoji picture
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.720]   picker I would be like uh what but I actually I have been using them a lot
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:26.560]   yeah I can fess my friend got me into them they're fun they're really fun
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:30.560]   by the way I saw a study that people who use emojis have
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:33.520]   more sex than people who don't so that's good
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:38.000]   that's a serious study yeah but they have emojis you don't you don't
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.120]   want to invite that person your friend trust me
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:46.000]   it is interesting to see how you can pervert what would normally be just
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.840]   regular emojis to uh to indicate um uh more romantic
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:55.920]   things things thank you mike thank you you know where I'm
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:59.360]   going with this so i like the new emoji picker alternatives
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:03.040]   yeah life style it's um it's actually really interesting to me
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:08.240]   because this is not exactly based off of uh third party app or third party
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:12.160]   keyboard we saw namely david smith's emoji plus plus love that but it's
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:15.840]   it's a great third party keyboard but it again it shows that apples
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:18.640]   kind of paying attention to how people are using
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:21.520]   ios 8 and the software within ios 8 and they're like
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:25.200]   yeah you know what actually our emoji picker is kind of horrible because you
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:29.440]   have to go through random tabs and it's not really clear which
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:33.200]   which icons belong to which obscurely labeled feature
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:36.560]   so to open that all up and make it scrollable i think is a really awesome
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:40.400]   improvement i mean sex for david but
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:45.520]   i've also they're adding like more diversity to the emoji as well so
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:49.200]   i think if you hold down on them you can choose different like skin tones
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:54.480]   oh really people awesome yeah that's great that's something that apple
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:59.040]   have been had been lobbying for actually with like the the emoji board i'll
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:02.320]   call them i don't know who controls that but as well as this seems like
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:06.000]   there's going to be more i think it's actually believe it or not
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   part of the unicode specific i think that it's the people i think you're right
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.600]   yeah so they're the worst but they but they only specify this is going to be
[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:18.000]   you know a construction guy in a helmet they don't specify how that actually
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.600]   looks and so every company gets to design its own
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:24.640]   emojis you want to be you know familiar
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:28.800]   um but yeah i think that that's that's nice that you can
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:33.280]   you can choose your race instead of that all being white folks
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:37.280]   um what else the health app in 8.3 has been updated with links to the Mayo
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:41.520]   clinic website all right health no that's
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:45.600]   congratulations every every little piece of news on health app is such great
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:48.640]   news for people who use iPhones and for apple
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:52.080]   hell i i think that if health kit there's i don't think there's any technology
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:55.120]   that apple's working on right now and i include the apple watch that could be
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:58.400]   as transformative as health kit if it really pays off the way that they're
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:02.560]   planning it to if five years from now this becomes like the central conduit
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:06.320]   for monitoring devices you have inside your house data that the phone can
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:09.760]   collect simply by being inside someone's pocket and seeing that oh this person
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:13.360]   really hasn't moved much in the past three days and they're usually very very
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:17.120]   active i wonder what's going on this could the apple always talks about
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:20.560]   to some to just one degree or another about how we're not just trying to build
[00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:24.240]   really successful consumer devices we really want to improve people's lives
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:27.840]   this will improve people's lives and extend people's lives so that's not that's
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:30.480]   not it's so it's today's news isn't that big but
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:34.000]   every brick in that wall is just making this stronger and stronger and stronger
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.960]   i'm so excited about what apple's doing with health kit and there's a big spotlight
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:40.480]   on how the apple watch will support this kind of stuff as well right
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:43.840]   yeah that's that's another really big deal i mean as
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:46.800]   i've fortunately i've not had health problems myself but i've been the care
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:50.480]   taker for people with health problems and just the one feature that they're
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:54.320]   talking about is this this ongoing blood glucose monitor that
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:57.040]   require it will require some sort of transdermal
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:00.480]   interface because you can't do it just by sweat or just by heartbeat really you
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:04.400]   really need contact to even micro blood but the ability to not just simply i'm
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:07.280]   going to take a reading in the morning i'm going to take a glucose reading in the
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:10.080]   afternoon i'm going to take a glucose reading in the evening
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:13.440]   that's useful but not as useful as a diabetic being able to just check the
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:16.800]   watch and saying wow i'd that usually i don't see a
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:20.640]   spike like that at 2 p.m what did i do at 1 30 or at one o'clock that will
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:24.800]   cause that to do that's how because diabetes management is all about
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:29.120]   your behavior and doing all that sort of stuff you need to do to avoid
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:32.480]   becoming you know an insulin dependent diabetic and so this is the sort of
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.840]   data being able to say i'm going to get every single number over the course of
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:38.480]   the day and be able to present that in a way that you will just
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:42.880]   casually see these things these outliers that will alert you to a problem you
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:46.000]   can solve really quickly that's the sort of stuff that really
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.840]   enhances and extends people's lives hey just to get back to the really
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:52.720]   important stuff here's an emoji table
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:56.720]   emoji screw hell
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:01.120]   guy named Tim nog crap emoji then a full crap emoji
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:06.720]   uh another brit Tim Whitlock from uh london has a page apps that Tim
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:12.240]   Whitlock.info that shows all the Unicode emojis and then the different
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:15.920]   drawings depending on native apple androids
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:20.320]   symbolic twitter and fandom and i of course there are many others because
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:24.800]   the specification is simply for instance face with tears of joy
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:27.120]   and there are different ways to implement it and you can see how that's
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:29.840]   been implemented differently by uh different yeah the
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:32.800]   the android emojis are kind of obnoxious
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:35.440]   well the ones you mean the robot ones are i have to agree with you
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:37.600]   the android robot i've never seen that i don't know
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:41.200]   i don't know which versions of android implement that i've seen the
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:44.080]   second android table which are the mark colorful
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:47.840]   colorful but you can see apples added a little whimsy to the fire engine
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.400]   and the ambulance you know there's definitely uh
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.800]   it's interesting it's fun to see apples closer i think
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:59.760]   to the canonical emojis the uh the native as Tim calls them emojis
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:03.040]   but here's you know for instance android when you do a um
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:07.520]   uh flag android just gives you the country code for the flag us
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:12.320]   but apple gives you a lovely waving uf us flag
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:16.800]   so there's things like that anyway back to the health kit i'm sorry
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:18.880]   some of the chat room just gave me this link and i thought
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:23.360]   oh this is cool apps dot tim Whitlock it is cool i mean emojis are so
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:26.560]   interesting because there i do think that like serenity came around
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:30.000]   says she came around to emojis i'm still one generation behind
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.680]   because i just i'm still in like low askey emoji mode mentally like
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:36.320]   every time every time i want to use that i'm just thinking
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:39.280]   colon closed parenthesis i'm not thinking emoji
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:42.480]   and to a certain degree i'm kind of resentful of the fact that
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:46.720]   like i never use emojis ever and yet there's a button on the keyboard
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:49.920]   direct to get me direct access to that and i would i would pay
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:53.920]   eighteen dollars okay forty dollars to be able to switch that out with a
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:57.440]   button for a keyboard feature that i actually use
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:01.520]   what would you what would it be i don't know i like to make
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:06.240]   a switch in between keyboards easier i would like to have like a pop up
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:09.680]   out of pop up menu of like four five phrases that i use all the time
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:13.280]   yeah that'd be cool yeah but it's just between i never ever ever ever
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:16.400]   ever use emojis that's not a judgment i was your love life
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:27.840]   you guys i'm just curious um you know has have they now i've i just got
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:33.200]   the new update one it's it's you know it's it's it's uh it's uh
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:38.880]   left bracket number three okay and has been for quite some time
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:42.160]   sometimes it's multiple left bracket number three i'm
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:45.760]   mistaken by the way eight three is not the next one obviously
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:48.720]   we're at eight one three eight two is the next one eight two is going to come
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:52.320]   out with app around apple watch time which is in april
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:55.200]   and then eight three i don't know but they've seeded the eight three uh
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:58.080]   for maybe to come out quickly i don't know why would they see
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:01.280]   why are they seating eight three now to developers when eight two is the next
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:04.480]   generation it's very odd i'm it's i can't think of
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:09.600]   another time when they've concurrently seated two different ios
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:14.000]   beta builds like they they usually have the default build and then one beta
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.800]   ahead but seeing two different betas is interesting
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:19.760]   it might have to do has something to do with watch kit it might have something
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.560]   to do if i'm kelph kit right not having
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:27.360]   dug around nor and also being under an nd a i can't say for sure but uh
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:32.080]   next next thing hey uh does eight point one point three uh help with the third
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:35.680]   party keyboards because i have to say i've disabled now third party keyboards
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:39.120]   and ios because it just doesn't this implementation still seems kind of
[00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:43.520]   wonky yeah unfortunately we're still we're still the
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:47.120]   tap tap tap i was kind of hoping when i saw a new emoji keyboard i'm like
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:51.120]   maybe you can hold down and it shows you the little menu on all of the keyboards
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:56.160]   but no no soon i filed a radar everybody who's
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:00.320]   mad at it should file radars yeah really tell us about that
[00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:04.000]   you have to be developer to do a radar you do not bug report dot apple dot
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:10.400]   com anybody oh that's good yeah you want to talk about an efcelya you've
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:15.520]   given me a tool now i'm sorry yeah okay they do keep track of your apple id so
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:19.440]   i guess i can't just do whatever i will email a yay you can't roll apple
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:23.360]   support let them let them work on their actual uh
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:28.320]   updates leo okay and by the way they're also working on ios 8.4 according to
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:32.000]   mark german maybe he's gone a little too far now
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.720]   uh i think mark just wants to super scoop everything
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:40.240]   look just in case you already know about 8.2 i know about 8.4
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:46.000]   but this is the one that would include me perhaps i would a refound seven
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.640]   this time next year old and was going to talk about
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:52.960]   all phone seven i wish i could say more but i can't
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:37:00.160]   all five seven uh our google analytics indicate that 8.4 is well into testing
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:02.720]   the the reason is because you could see it it
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:06.160]   identifies itself when you visited with a website but apparently this would be
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:10.640]   the emergence of the beats the new version of beats
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:14.800]   although i have to say apple radio i wish more people to use that new about
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:18.160]   iTunes radio it's such a good they do such a good job
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:21.520]   and it's free it's free right you don't have to have match
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:24.880]   free with ads uh no ads with match i believe okay
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:28.640]   i bought unless you're in the uk oh then what do you get in the uk
[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:31.200]   we just don't have it you don't get anything huh
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:35.840]   uh no i think you're here yep that's that's it just a little
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:39.360]   violin icon they should be an emoji for that
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:41.760]   that would be a good there might be a violin
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:44.480]   this is a violin for any violin yeah it's a
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:48.400]   piece of for a layout to be fair you get to you do get to watch qi without having
[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:51.360]   to go through a proxy server hey wait a minute good news qi's
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:56.080]   coming to bbc america but they're not starting with season one
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:38:00.480]   bummed about that yeah that's right well i'll trade you
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:06.960]   i'll trade you beats music for qi i actually have beats music i i did a little
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:09.760]   trick and took the term the location last and signed up
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:11.920]   this was before and then when apple took over they
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:15.120]   they killed that actually that's going too cheap i'll trade you
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:18.160]   iTunes radio beats me the whole kit and kaboodle
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:22.720]   for steven fry i just want i want all of steven fry
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:27.760]   i do have the ability to do that so you know i was really bummed
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:31.840]   because uh the harry potter books in the uk are read by steven fry
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:35.040]   that's the best and they're so good now not that jim dale who does them on
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:38.320]   audible in the u_s is bad he's great in fact
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:41.120]   he's often considered legend he does all the voices steven
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:44.720]   does not quite you know do all the voices and stuff but i just love steven fry so
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:48.640]   much i actually i i bit tormented
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:52.480]   the uk version after buying the american leo
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:55.760]   because i like steven fry
[00:38:55.760 --> 00:39:00.960]   experience they're they're when um they're british
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:05.360]   they are when steven fry showed up at what would be the ipad announcement i
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:08.720]   definitely had a little bit of a like it's hitchhiker's guide they're
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:11.680]   watching hitchhiker's guide he was there he was there wasn't yeah
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:14.960]   he said the apple watch and i spent two yeah
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:19.040]   okay he got he got um he was there an announcement
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:23.200]   like they there's he wrote a great article uh after the ipad original ipad came
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:27.200]   out where steven had taken him into a room and showed him the ipad before
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:30.800]   they released before they announced it yeah so he got to see it in advance
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:35.760]   which is pretty sweet i thought i thought that was such a fun article because
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:40.080]   you're you're you're steve jobs is the steve jobs of technology but
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:43.680]   steven fry is definitely the steven fry of his industry too
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:50.000]   and he was he was so intimidated and so you know i got like i would do the voice
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.480]   of course because only he could see what fries this even fry of that voice
[00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:56.320]   but i couldn't believe i was just so i was i was in this i was shown into this
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:40:00.320]   room that was like an altar and then i was like the air seemed different the
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:04.800]   gravity seemed different steve jobs made i contact with me and just my vision blurred
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:09.760]   a little bit it's like it was something it was amazing to see someone that is
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:13.680]   like could induce that kind of reaction in so many
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:17.920]   fans is also that big a fan of apple that they can
[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:21.920]   feel that sort of way too he isn't apparently a little bit
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:26.800]   a little bit of uh hot water isn't he mike uh in the uk because he was he swore
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:32.960]   at the bathtub wars yeah yeah he also he had this uh
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:36.240]   this video that went out on irish tv i think recently
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:41.760]   where somebody asked him what he thought of god and uh yeah yeah that's that's
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:45.920]   interesting google that it's the question was like if you met god what would you
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:51.440]   say to him and his answer was long it was it was so it was such a cool like
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:55.280]   intellectual response of i would say how dare you give kids bone cancer how dare
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:41:00.160]   you do this how dare you do that yeah always a challenge he really really went
[00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:05.680]   wow yeah uh all right there's i mean i somehow we've
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:09.360]   emojis always derailed this show by the way i just want to say
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:12.720]   in fact twit has been derailed many times by emojis in general
[00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:16.960]   os 10 uh have now see this is another issue because
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:20.560]   those of you who are using the new os 10
[00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:25.120]   uh cannot speak about it's like fight club you cannot speak about the new os
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:29.200]   10 but but i think that you serenity and uh and rene did a
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:34.320]   article about the new photos app in os 10 right we did yeah you could talk about
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:38.240]   that we can definitely talk about that let's take a break it come back i want to
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:41.040]   talk about that because this apple as you know
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:46.160]   uh is apertures dead i photo is now dead and photos is the new thing if you're on
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:50.480]   ios you see photos on ios but this is a this is the new desktop photos
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:54.320]   and we'll have some implications for ios as well we'll talk about that
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:42:01.040]   uh in just a bit this is a os 10.10.3 i think
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:04.560]   but first a word from square space square space

[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:16.000]   serenity uh that photos is it's kind of midway between i photo and aperture
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:20.640]   that yeah and um yeah so we did a first look and then also a pretty in-depth
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:26.080]   FAQ um on the beta which i should stress is a is very much a beta
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:29.840]   yeah it's not um it's not in final form yet um although there might be a public
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:33.120]   beta coming out uh later this year before they release
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:38.320]   officially in spring um it's very much it reminds me of
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:43.120]   apple's other uh redesigns of its consumer level apps which is
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:48.400]   at its very basic it's very simplified it has all the things you come to
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:52.720]   expect from ios you know you've got your moments you've got your collections
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:56.000]   you've got albums um but it also has some traditional
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.800]   long-standing i photo features like faces um it can import your i your
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:05.520]   aperture and i photo libraries and it has these incredible editing tools
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:10.480]   which on their on their head on their on their face are very simplified but
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:14.480]   you can add uh you can basically drop down you know the light the color of
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:18.880]   the black and white uh sliders to get much more detailed sliders
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:22.400]   and much more detailed information uh you can add
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:27.440]   previously what we would consider high level pro pro sumer to professional
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:31.520]   tools um like histograms and levels and white
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:35.600]   balance things like that that um most people would never play with
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:38.800]   but are available to the people who need them and then of course you still
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:42.160]   have the the great uh the photo the projects and
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:45.600]   prints and all that stuff that you've you've come to expect for my photo
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:50.320]   it's an interesting balance between what we consider from what we you know what
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:54.320]   we've gotten used to with i photo and the high level stuff that aperture
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:58.240]   provided it definitely doesn't have everything that aperture provided
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:01.520]   it's um it's missing a lot of stuff including like the loop it's it doesn't
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:05.680]   have brushes doesn't have a loop so there's no close-up view uh
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:11.360]   well there's no superimposed but uh the photos app you can't zoom in
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:15.280]   well yeah you can then the photos app includes all the same gestures that you
[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:18.800]   have kind of gotten used to doing on o s or on ios and so you could kind of
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:23.200]   pinch and exactly you can pinch to zoom you can scroll really simply
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:27.120]   that's better than the loop frankly that's fine yeah exactly it's not um you
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:30.400]   know the loop is a fun tool and everything and i understand why people use it for
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:34.000]   color correction and the like but there's there's a lot of stuff built in here
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.120]   even though it looks simple on its on its front side
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:40.960]   there's a lot in here to empower users and to really allow them to kind of
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:43.600]   dig in and play with their photos and make
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:48.240]   beautiful stuff in a way that i feel like i photo was kind of limited
[00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:52.320]   where you were either a bare bones user who didn't know anything about photos
[00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:57.280]   and you're just like uh enhanced tool uh a red eye tool
[00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:00.800]   and then and then you were done uh whereas i think the photos app actually
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:04.080]   gives you more control of what your photos look like because it has
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:07.760]   filters which everybody you know who uses instagram is comfortable with it
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:11.520]   also has these really simple color correction tools which is just like
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:15.520]   dragging a slider one way or the other and if you want to learn to play more
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:18.080]   with that you can or if you already know how to play
[00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:22.080]   play with that kind of stuff you can hit the drop down menu and have access to
[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:26.000]   all of these sliders or you can turn on your histogram or you can add a vignette
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:31.280]   to your photos in a really really simple really easy manner and i appreciate
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:34.320]   i appreciate the sort of stacked way that they've built this the same thing
[00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:37.840]   with organization too people look at the photos
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:40.720]   app and the screenshots of the photos app and they panic because they're like oh
[00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:44.320]   well you know i had an i photos an i photo library that was
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:48.640]   organized and uh my aperture for library i had folders
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:52.640]   and all of like the folders folders still exist folders actually existed a much
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:57.040]   better way than i think they used to um but it's all it's kind of hidden in
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:59.920]   the menus so you don't have to worry about folders unless it's
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:03.360]   something that matters to you you don't have to worry about having
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:08.080]   sidebar clutter unless it's something that appeals to you say like if if you
[00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:12.720]   want a sidebar of all of your recent events and photos and moments etc
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:17.360]   you can have that if you don't you can just use the top bar navigation that
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:20.080]   apple has default in the photos app it's really
[00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:25.440]   it's more flexible to fit to individual users but pro users
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:28.400]   it's definitely not it's kind of it reminds me a lot of
[00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:33.600]   final cut pro 10 in that way where it's it's very bare bones for pro users the
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:38.320]   the basic management organization is there and the basic um sort of
[00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:42.800]   prosumer editing tools are there but you're missing a lot of the things that
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:46.640]   kind of are like pseudo photoshop tools that were hidden in aperture and you're
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:49.600]   missing kind of the super high level management and i don't think that will
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:55.600]   never reappear in fact i really like photos has been built in a really strong
[00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:59.280]   code like the the the core code base feels solid and feels
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:03.280]   fast which is such a dramatic difference from i photo
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:06.800]   that it makes me really happy with all the memory leaks but um
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:10.880]   but i don't think that stuff will never just like never reappear i think we're
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:15.120]   we are looking at um updates you know when aperture was discontinued apple did
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:18.480]   say that they would be allowing third party plugins so we will hopefully see
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:22.240]   that down the line that'd be nice um yeah exactly it's like we could
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:25.440]   everybody's panic well like the aperture users are packing because they're
[00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:29.840]   like apple you know they've all moved to lightroom yeah if they have some
[00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:33.680]   some we got plenty of complaints on i'm more being like apples abandoned me and
[00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:36.400]   i hate lightroom and what am i supposed to do
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:40.480]   well i mean i'm sorry exactly like you either move to lightroom if you're a
[00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:44.800]   true professional and you need those tools lightroom is kind of one of your
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:48.880]   main options but aperture still works if you if you really are committed to this
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:53.040]   um and in fact when you when you look at your compatible with photos
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:56.480]   uh in a way you because i remember they moved the i photo library to be the
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:59.920]   same as the aperture library so that you you could you had this nice back and
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:03.680]   forth it's the same thing apple photos is or is it a new library format
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:08.000]   it is a new library format but it doesn't convert your old library so you can
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.120]   have two basically side-by-side libraries
[00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:15.200]   which is not a perfect implementation they basically they had to rewrite the
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:18.960]   entire library code because of the way that the photos app was because they
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:21.200]   had to rebuild the photos app and they had to
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:25.200]   re-engineer it for cloud-based uh photo this is not the first time we've been to
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:28.160]   this rodeo right i mean this is what they were doing all along they've
[00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:33.280]   they've done it with every pro app um uh you talk a little bit about in the i'm
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:37.520]   more show about um this this issue that apple has where they had two tracks they
[00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:44.000]   had pro and consumer versions and uh and it sounds like at least with photos
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.960]   they're they're kind of moving to this middle ground this you prosumer
[00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:51.440]   yeah well i feel like they've been doing that actually with all of their
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:55.760]   previously consumer-faced applications as well the iMovie redesign is a great
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:59.440]   example of something that started in a completely
[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:03.920]   consumer like bare bones thing and got a lot of people who were using iMovie as
[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:08.000]   a pro-sumer tool really mad right because they're like well i was able to
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.920]   create all these little fiddly bits and make iMovie work the way i wanted it to
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:16.080]   now i have to upgrade a final cut on throwing this table over
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:21.040]   um but as iMovie progressed throughout the years they really tried to make it
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:25.840]   this kind of this wonderful scaling middle ground where if you you could come in as
[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:31.520]   a complete bare bones brand new user and make a movie an iMovie in a couple hours
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:35.840]   or you could come in as somebody who's had some familiarity with iMovie or some
[00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:41.120]   familiarity with video editing and get quite a lot out of an iMovie project it
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:46.240]   just it's a it's a little bit re-jiggering of the brain and and in a way um especially
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:51.680]   with you take iMovie and final cut they both use and implement very similar
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:54.960]   nonlinear editing tools so once you kind of
[00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:59.200]   capped out where iMovie stops you can jump over to final cut
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:04.240]   very little abrasion you know it's whereas before the old version of iMovie
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:08.000]   once you stop to be understanding iMovie when you jumped into final cut it was
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.920]   like going from a kitty pool to going to the middle of the Atlantic Ocean where
[00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:14.560]   you're like well i think i know how to swim
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:18.880]   but all like all of my limbs are different and the water temperature is
[00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:23.040]   different and it's salty like it's it was a completely different experience
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:27.840]   speaking as somebody who did that um back in the in the late 90s early 2000s
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:31.680]   um it was it was very difficult and i think what they've been doing with iMovie
[00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:34.960]   what they've been doing with the pages the iWork Suite and now what they're
[00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:39.200]   doing with photos is creating this this application that can serve the needs
[00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:42.640]   of multiple users however there's going to be an end cap there
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:46.240]   because when you talk about serving multiple masters like
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:51.280]   for one thing apple you know apple is going to serve the majority of its
[00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:54.640]   consumer base like if the majority of people buying
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:59.120]   max and using their software are slightly newer to prosumer users
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:02.160]   they're going to have to serve that base because that is the base that is
[00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:06.400]   giving them money conversely you know they have their
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:10.720]   they have their um their pro markets but the pro markets are
[00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:15.600]   unfortunately small potatoes in respect which is not to say that i think apple
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:18.400]   disrespects professionals or that apple doesn't care about its
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:21.600]   professional market it doesn't want their professional market to
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:27.040]   come back in the future um but i don't think like when it's
[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:31.360]   when you lay out a timeline of we have these 20 projects currently in
[00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:35.440]   development which things are top priority i unfortunately think that you
[00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:40.000]   know i movie was developed before final cut um and final cut had kind of the
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:43.920]   space to be reinvented i don't think aperture had
[00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:47.840]   the same kind of space whereas basically they made they kind of made the decision
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:51.200]   to transfer everything over to cloud based photography
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:56.000]   around the same time so it was basically well we can't really keep supporting
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.800]   aperture because then we need to tear out a whole
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:02.400]   hunk of aperture and try and sort of cram in the
[00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:05.600]   foot the cloud photography aspect and it wouldn't really work for what we're
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:09.520]   trying to do with reinventing photos so we might as well tear the entire
[00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:12.400]   building down at once put out this product and then
[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:16.640]   see what happens and again i'm not that's speculation on my part
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:19.920]   um i mean it's it may it's to be determined whether
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:23.760]   whether apple will ever resuscitate or reinvent aperture
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:27.280]   um or whether they just want to keep photos around as kind of the
[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:30.480]   their core product and then have third parties augment
[00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:33.520]   the things that you would previously find in sort of a higher class
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:38.400]   professional editing and management app uh one of the issues that comes up and
[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:42.160]   uh this is really what pro i think prose care a lot about is a
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:46.080]   support for the raw formats especially as new camera
[00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:51.120]   cameras come out um adobe keeps us up to date with adobe camera raw which
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:54.720]   updates whenever light rooms updated in many times in between
[00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:58.320]   apple has i've always i always see these camera raw updates being pushed out in
[00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:01.840]   apple uh updates but if they are no longer
[00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:05.120]   are supporting prose they i wonder if they will continue have they said
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:09.360]   anything about supporting camera raw yeah absolutely ros ros supported both
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:12.560]   locally and in icos and they will continue to update it
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:17.200]   yes absolutely so when i when i say that it's not a like that photos app is not a
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:19.840]   pro app i don't necessarily mean that it's just a
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:23.920]   newbie app either it's very much a pro-summer app it's a lot of people even
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:27.120]   pro's would use this for the quick and dirty stuff
[00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:30.880]   uh yeah absolutely yeah i mean i i watch lisa who is really an
[00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:34.640]   accomplished photographer but not a pro but very serious about her photography
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:38.400]   and while you know we keep working at lightroom and she's taking
[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:41.920]   linda classes on lightroom and stuff she still does i photos almost all the time
[00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:45.840]   and i think something like photos would actually suit her and the broad mass of
[00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:48.800]   users who have become more serious about photography
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:51.920]   but don't yet really want to spend the time and energy to learn something like
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:55.280]   lightroom it might actually suit them quite well it does
[00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:58.480]   it probably would do almost everything they need to do you agree Andy
[00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:02.400]   you're you're you're in that group Andy you're absolutely that you're
[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:05.200]   you're speaking of somebody who absolutely loves aperture who's now
[00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:08.400]   trying to figure out do i am i gonna have to stick with aperture because i love
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:12.160]   it i know how to use it so i'm not i'm not happy by apple dropping support by
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:15.920]   aperture but nonetheless you look at photos and you realize that this is
[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:20.160]   rebuilding photos for the way that people actually use photos these days
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:23.360]   they're not doing stuff for print they're not you doing stuff for even a make a
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:27.280]   print in hagon on the wall they're really all about taking a picture on
[00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:30.720]   their phone making it look more interesting
[00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:33.600]   however you wanted to find that and then putting it in a place where they can
[00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:36.800]   then show it off to other people's usually in some sort of a digital
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:39.520]   format and this is brilliant at that for in terms of
[00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:42.560]   management in terms of making sure that wherever you shoot it
[00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:46.240]   you you edit it on your desktop and you don't have to rethink anything it's
[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:48.560]   just simply the next time you look at it on your phone
[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:52.400]   it will have all of those edits to it also most people they really just want
[00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:55.440]   an answer to the problem of how do i make this picture look better
[00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:58.400]   and in aperture my instinct is oh well gee there's the
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:01.840]   uh i was looking at a shot of the Lincoln Memorial at dusk that i shot a couple
[00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:04.560]   months ago and the white balance is pretty good
[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:08.320]   except for there's one light that's kind of up lighting it that's
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:12.000]   that's like a like a mercury light or something a little bit of a green tint
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:15.200]   i know how to dig deep into the aperture's control so that
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:19.200]   i can just simply say whatever is that shade of green please make it a shade
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:22.480]   of this instead most people aren't looking for that sort of stuff they just
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:26.560]   want how do i make this better and when you look at the way that apple has
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:32.240]   changed uh the interface it's deceptive kind of like
[00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:36.160]   what srinney was talking about you think that they've just made a brightness
[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:38.720]   slider which we've seen for the past 15 or 20 years
[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:42.080]   but it's kind of like how a car has active suspension where
[00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:45.680]   you tell the car high car i would now like to turn sharply to the right right
[00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:48.640]   now but there's a computer somewhere inside the car that says
[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:52.080]   i bet he didn't mean i'd like to spin around three times then crash to that
[00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:55.040]   guardrail it automatically decides how do i
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:57.920]   execute that in a way that that that's going to please the user
[00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:01.120]   so now if you decide i want to make this brighter you slide it all the way up to
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:03.760]   the left but the but photos understand that i
[00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:07.840]   bet he didn't mean i want you to make it so bright that the entire sky is bleached
[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:10.000]   out white and we can't see any of the clouds
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.720]   so it makes all these really intelligent adjustments that are going to make
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:16.080]   people really really happy and it's also important to
[00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:20.800]   note that uh this is not just a new version uh this is not just an
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:24.320]   upgrade of iPhoto apple really is completely
[00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:27.680]   creating a brand new architecture for how all of apple products deal with
[00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:31.120]   photos and this is just the first articulation of that
[00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:35.040]   entire system uh and just like with the final cut
[00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:39.040]   there are a lot of things that final cut x uh final cut pro then
[00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:42.720]   whatever i can't remember whether they're calling it final cut 10 or final cut
[00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:46.960]   x so they thank you very much because i remember having a conversation with
[00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:51.040]   somebody fairly high up of correcting me about you're saying macOS x it should
[00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:55.200]   be macos too uh anyway but uh just like when the when apple
[00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:59.040]   reinvented that it didn't do half of what it does right now and it wasn't
[00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:03.520]   because the pro users complained so long and so hard they were forced to
[00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:06.800]   reverse decisions because the vert the one point where they released was what
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:10.400]   they were able to release at that time and there was always a desire to
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:13.760]   extend it and expand it and fill in some of these gaps so i'm sure that a year
[00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:16.800]   from now and two years from now this is going to be a lot more capable than it
[00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:20.080]   is when it will be when it uh when it ships to consumers
[00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:24.400]   do you think apple's thinking maybe we uh should do middle you know of course i
[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:27.520]   look at garage band logic pro and logic pro is pro
[00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:31.600]   and and final cut is pro but do you think apples may be thinking we should
[00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:36.320]   leave the high end to third parties and make good solid
[00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:39.440]   consumer products that can get take you all the way up to pro sumer and then
[00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:43.120]   just assume that if that's smaller market that pro or does apple really still
[00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:46.880]   want to that own that pro market i don't think they necessarily
[00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:50.320]   need to control that market whereas the by virtue of the fact that i would
[00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:53.440]   think the creating an ecosystem where where many
[00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:57.200]   companies can contribute would be better than having apple be the sole source of
[00:59:57.200 --> 01:00:00.880]   pro and that was steve jobs who said screw you adobe
[01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:05.360]   we're gonna own the top high end right and that and again we're in the post
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:10.000]   jobs era and and and you know the the popularity of apples answer to photoshop
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:15.600]   is you know it's all around us but the only the only problem with that though
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:19.760]   is that um who well there whoever wants to whoever
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:23.520]   wants to make the next version of the thing that replaces aperture
[01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:28.800]   is now going to be competing with adobe uh and lightroom is a wonderful app but
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:31.600]   it has the limitation that it is multi-platform
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:35.760]   which means that it is never going to be one of those instinctive macOS apps
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:39.840]   that takes advantage of every one of these really wonderful apis across
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:44.800]   ios and macOS so the pro tool that is going to be available to the people who
[01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:47.840]   really do are who really are that serious about photos
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:53.680]   is always going to be such an easy way to switch from one platform to the other
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:57.360]   because if somebody comes up with a really good multi-purpose tablet
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:00.560]   for windows or if there's just a solution that they like more if there's a
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:03.520]   future of windows 10 or windows 11 they like
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:06.960]   the problem of well what the hell do i do with my photo library will not be an
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:10.640]   issue because this is multi-platform they just simply move it from one place
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:13.440]   to another because it's on the cloud maybe they don't have to bother at all
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:16.480]   so i i do think that apple's not quite as
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:21.040]   uh aggressive about saying hey we we make things that everybody can use i think
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:24.160]   they really are saying we know where our bread is buttered or maybe
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:27.920]   less uh snarky way of saying it is that we know what we do exceptionally well we
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:31.040]   know the products that we make the people really respond to very strongly
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:33.520]   we're going to pursue that very very aggressively we're not going to ignore
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:38.400]   pro users but if we can make our target audience happier
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:42.640]   and live in ourselves to just not shouting out
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:46.320]   not shutting down responses and opportunities for the pros
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:48.880]   that's what we're going to do the pros are the pros will figure things out
[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:52.240]   because that's why they're pros yeah absolutely and i think you nailed it
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:55.200]   serenity if they offer as long as they continue to support raw
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:59.360]   image in the operating system that's great that means i can import my pictures
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:02.880]   from my for months since my sony a7 and it reads it no problem
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:05.840]   uh and then they allow and i will watch we'll watch with interest to see what
[01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:09.840]   photos allows but they allow plugins that'll that it really gives you a lot
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:14.160]   of headroom for prosumers and then if some you know something wants to use
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:17.440]   lightroom or somebody else wants to come along and create a lightroom like
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:20.400]   program there's i mean i think almost all the professional
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:21.840]   photographers i know use max
[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:27.520]   yeah i mean i it's just it's a it's a good platform and also i mean
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:32.320]   it's for some reason there's been this i mean i personally prefer
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:36.880]   apple laptops to to pcs but there has been sort of a movement just among
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:40.240]   creative professionals for o s 10 and mac related
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:42.640]   uh i don't know for photography the screens are
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:48.240]   better i think the the 5k i mac is a photographers dream i would say
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:51.280]   uh yeah it just seems like that's that's where the market's going
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:55.120]   are you i don't know you well enough mic to know are you into photography
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:58.960]   no this is why i've been so quiet i'm very consumer when it comes to
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:02.000]   photography which is why the photos app is
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.360]   interesting to me because it's kind of like the main interface that i have with
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:09.920]   photos is my ios photo app right that's what i'm used to seeing
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:12.240]   the most because that's the camera that i use
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:16.400]   the thing that interests me the most about all of this is the photos in the
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:19.120]   cloud and how that's going to work because
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:22.240]   there's i think there's a lot of interesting parts of how something like
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:24.880]   that could work no company has really been able to do
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:28.960]   it sustainably at scale like all of the startups that open like
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:33.440]   everpix and there was one there was the one they just loved everpix
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:37.600]   i was so sad and there was picture life just got
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:41.200]   acquired like no company has been able to do it successfully
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:44.960]   and sustainably in theory apple could do it right because they can subsidize
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:48.640]   the cost with the with the hardware well you know who does it really well
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:53.520]   as well is google yeah they do do you use google plus for your
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:59.360]   iphone backups and stuff i know i actually i love it i i back up all my photos to
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:02.400]   drop box which is a drop box is a solution and they've got
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:06.800]   the carousel yep yeah so i'm interested
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:12.880]   no so let's talk about the ios integration with photos because
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:16.400]   you you touched on this to serenity in your i'm more review
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:20.480]   um we already have photos in ios 8 but uh
[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:25.120]   it's going to gain new superpowers yeah well i mean i think the the biggest
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:28.400]   draw to having a photos app on the mac is
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:32.960]   integration and wireless syncing between your mac and your ios devices
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:37.280]   if you take a lot of photos on your ios device and you're somebody who takes
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:40.800]   photos of the dslr like i am like i think a lot of people are
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:45.360]   uh still this allows you to kind of combine those libraries and have those
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:50.000]   libraries at your fingertips at a glance you don't have to worry anymore
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.920]   in theory about you know connecting your phone to your mac
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:57.520]   syncing the very specific albums that you want to showcase when you're on the
[01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:00.400]   road and then also having to deal with managing your
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:04.000]   camera roll and backing up your camera roll and making sure no pictures get
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.000]   lost in theory everything should work seamlessly so
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.080]   whether you take a photo on your ios device or on your mac whether you delete
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:16.160]   a photo on your ios or device of your mac whether you add an album on your mac
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:21.440]   or your ios device everything gets synced everything is working in tandem
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:25.120]   with each other now in the beta that's not 100%
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:28.160]   true there's definitely there's some quirks with albums right now
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:31.840]   um and everything's not syncing perfectly but again it's a developer beta
[01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:35.680]   i'm not i'm not surprised that things aren't working magically
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:38.960]   but they're they're pretty close they're about 85
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:43.680]   percent there i'd say um to the point where again we i mean we've seen apple
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:47.440]   do this with photo stream so we know that apple has the ability to at least
[01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:50.640]   sync the last thousand photos without too much trouble and they haven't had a
[01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:54.800]   lot of major bugs with that um so it's just a matter of them being
[01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:59.040]   able to intelligently manage your library between ios and mac
[01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:02.240]   and sync the photos together and make sure there aren't duplicates or
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:05.600]   or missed information lost information because i mean i think that's the
[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:09.360]   the big key and what mike was was talking about a little bit is like
[01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:13.760]   all the startups everything else my my big concern was always you know
[01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:16.880]   well i want to upload my photos to the cloud i want to back up
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:21.200]   but i also want to make sure that i don't lose them or that they don't
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:24.560]   accidentally disappear you know into the cloud or i don't accidentally
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:28.320]   duplicate three thousand photos and then i have to go through and clear
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:32.000]   them out automatically um it's so there's there's that and then
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.920]   there's also the fact that apples managing space intelligently on both
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:40.240]   your ios devices and your mac where it's pulling down a percentage of your
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:44.400]   photos uh both on your both on your mobile devices and your desktop
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:49.120]   devices but a percentage relative to how much free hard drive space you have
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:53.360]   so it's not like oh i have to store a hundred gigabytes of photos
[01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:56.080]   locally and then take up all of my hard drive space
[01:06:56.080 --> 01:07:01.280]   it's okay you have 60 gigabytes free on your hard drive we're going to use
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:04.640]   20 gigabytes for photos and if you use up more of your hard drive
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:07.360]   that space will shrink and will keep everything else on the
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:10.720]   in the cloud but with local previews so you can figure out oh
[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:15.200]   low you know tiny tiny little pics uh pictures that you can blow up and then
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:18.640]   if you want to edit it it seamlessly pulls it down from the cloud and says
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:23.040]   here you go here's this photo and as soon as you edit it it goes to your ios device
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:27.360]   yes you whilst that sounds like a good function right so you're not taking up
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:30.960]   your hard drive space that is what in turn terrifies me because stuff will be
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:34.240]   just disappearing yeah well it's the idea that even if it
[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:38.960]   doesn't look like it is there's like the the system is deciding what it
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:43.280]   thinks i should have and if there are problems with the backup
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:48.160]   then what like where did i go like yeah like if if i mean there's nothing to say
[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:52.720]   apple can't do this but if they can't do this and this is the system that they
[01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:58.640]   take us down that is a potential minefield yeah
[01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:03.280]   my difficulty there are a few difficulties with apple that as i perceive them
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:06.000]   one of them is that they're really really good if you're the kind of user that
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.680]   they imagine you to be if you're not the kind of user you imagine them to be
[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:12.560]   that's where you have the potential to have some bad experiences
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:15.840]   uh and i like the fact that you're getting a terabyte of stories that's
[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:19.600]   enough for hundreds of a couple hundred thousand uh photos at the very least
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:25.120]   um but the first time it lose the first time that there's a really
[01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:28.720]   important picture and we're not talking about oh a product shot of an apple
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:32.960]   rollout i'm talking about the last like christmas i had with a family member
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:36.160]   before they died yeah the first time i can't find that
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:41.600]   and that's the last time i ever use that service again and i think that a lot of
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:45.040]   people are going to be the same boat this is a really really high degree of
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:48.800]   difficulty for apple to execute it's yeah because every time you know is
[01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:53.680]   something lost like in your photo library the things that you notice that a lot
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:56.560]   are the important ones like the unimportant pictures you don't notice
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:09:00.480]   that they're gone and every single time this happens to someone it's a
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:05.840]   disaster for that person like it's a it's a thing that needs to be tackled to
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:09.440]   advance us further into the cloud but it's a really
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:14.080]   dangerous one to to try and get right it must be extremely difficult and i'm
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:17.680]   sure it's why they're spending billions of dollars on more data centers
[01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:22.000]   right to store with these photos most recently the converting that sapphire
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.640]   plant yeah to data center for two billion dollars

[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:55.280]   let's talk a little more about beats one of the questions everybody has been
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:12:00.080]   asking is if apple uh you know rebrands beats redesigns beats the
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:03.760]   music streaming music service do they put it on android or they just make it for
[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:08.640]   iphone and um uh lisa at a chico who is writing for
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:11.520]   business insider says apple is reportedly working on
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:14.720]   an android app actually she's quoting mark german
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:18.160]   i'm just trying to keep mark out of the conversation
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:21.440]   impossible it's impossible
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:25.440]   mark even has a new picture of dre and jimmy aveen wow and eddy q
[01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:28.720]   looking very much like a mobster in that picture
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:32.160]   uh if they rebrand this yes they will of course
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:35.440]   according to mark german do an android app they're not going to get out of that
[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:39.920]   market although if yeah i guess you have to right if you want to have a music
[01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:44.320]   service that reaches everybody you can't leave half of the world out
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:48.800]   yeah i mean especially especially because beats has the customer base already
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:51.600]   yeah it may be something that apple wants to
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:55.360]   you know just loot but we have iTunes for windows like it's not a
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:58.640]   remember that was a fight though jobs did not want to do a windows version
[01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:02.160]   of itunes he was it was a fight yeah but once it
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:04.720]   happened they were very grateful to do it because
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:08.000]   that's one of the main reasons the itunes music store grew so
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.760]   right fantastically like the mac market at that point was minuscule was tiny it
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:14.560]   wouldn't have sold all of those all of those
[01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:18.800]   uh songs but uh but with windows they managed to do that
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:23.200]   so i'm not i'm not surprised at all to hear that apple's developing potentially
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:27.360]   an android app i mean i feel like apple's probably developed a lot of android
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:31.520]   apps that have never seen the light of day being like hey let's see if this makes
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:34.480]   sense let's see if that makes sense at the end of the day there's probably
[01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:38.080]   some executive saying nope sorry we're not doing that throw it away
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:42.320]   that never see the light of day i'm very sorry to say you windows phones users
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:46.160]   apple has no plans according to german to do a windows phone version even though
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:50.000]   beats was available on windows phone they're not gonna have a thing that i find
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.360]   really interesting about this and the way that mark has reported it
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:57.120]   is that apple are not actually planning on really branding beats like they are
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:14:01.600]   going to create another set of applications that takes from beats and takes from i
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:05.520]   tunes and will become this new apple music streaming service
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:09.520]   because that they he talks about how you can import your playlists and and your
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:13.040]   library into this new app it's just very interesting to me that they're
[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:16.560]   creating another brand and they may potentially get rid of the beats music
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:21.440]   brand which i think is another issue um but it's it's very peculiar to me that
[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:24.320]   that i think that they're going down this route they're like we're gonna
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:27.920]   create something completely different and we're gonna create an ios app and a
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:31.200]   an android app according to german it's not going all that well he says one
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:35.040]   source told us that the quote beats integration is not going so well
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:39.040]   another source said development of a new service has been a mess
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:43.600]   um another source warned that significant employee departures from apples
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:48.800]   services divisions could be in sight lack of clarity from apple executives
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:51.760]   over the direction of the project has put the timeline
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:58.400]   in jeopardy um so we shall see it's not like the world is
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:04.240]   is clamoring for a new music service um there there plenty and they're more
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:09.600]   coming out all the time as apple uh pauses and and works on this
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:11.920]   but it's so clearly where everybody is going
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:14.480]   i mean there's there's there's so many different there's so many topics in
[01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:18.000]   tech where you realize that the people you're making money from now they're
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:22.080]   gonna get older they're gonna die and you're and you're and the service that
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:24.960]   you have is completely irrelevant to the people who are now
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:29.360]   10 11 12 13 years old who are now going to be in a few years they're gonna have
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:33.280]   like good paying jobs and no kids which means a lot of money to spend on
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:36.640]   discretionary items and so you got to have a service where
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:39.840]   that's going to speak to those people
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:44.320]   and of course someday it'll be available in the uk
[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:46.320]   mike
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:51.520]   see that that's how these things work you have Spotify right
[01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:55.280]   yeah but so do you now we did have for a long time
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:58.720]   so do you for a long time but i i would argue that Spotify
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:02.800]   rdo what what what what are the choices in the uk
[01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:08.480]   we have Spotify uh audio and then disa disa and then yeah
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:12.560]   disa does uh high quality as well i can't remember are they
[01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:16.320]   do they own title or is title a separate because title is the new CD based
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:21.040]   streaming service CD quality streaming service isn't that the one that jz just
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:27.120]   bought jz just bought it yeah dj i'm sure jz bought a music streaming
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:30.960]   service and i think it was titled it's been nice to have so much money
[01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:34.560]   uh title hi fi.com i've been i've been listening to title i don't i mean you
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:37.440]   could argue who knows the difference between uh
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:42.240]   between um CD quality and mp3 jz owns it is about weeks ago
[01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:46.080]   yeah people title wow i like title i really do
[01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:49.520]   um it's but you know these are all the same and for and by the way they use
[01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:54.560]   apple lossless ios uh flak on everywhere except ios
[01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:59.360]   um hmm interesting it's hard to differentiate
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:04.160]   these days it's catalog basically yeah and they're all but they're all roughly
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:05.360]   the same aren't they?
[01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:10.160]   that's what they're about. Yeah it's curation and discovery and that's what
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:14.080]   beats is all about right you make that sentence i want to
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:19.040]   listen to dubstep while jamming on the golf course
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:23.280]   with jz and then it will give you something yeah what i really like
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:26.800]   best thing about beats i bet we're probably about to say the same
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:30.880]   thing mike the the personal the personal playlists that um
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:35.040]   their staff are curating basically but ario does a great job with that
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:40.000]   spotify has curious as uh and not as good they're not as good
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.920]   no beats have like an entire editorial stuff that that look after this sort of
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:46.960]   stuff and and they create excellent playlists even like
[01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:51.920]   they they do some but they analyze what you're listening to and they suggest
[01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:56.080]   like starter playlist for certain bands like oh we can see you like alternative
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:58.880]   rock here's the start playlist for the white stripes which is a
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:02.160]   a band that we think that you'll like which and then they have like deep cuts
[01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:06.080]   so like the album best album tracks and stuff like that they have really really
[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:08.720]   great playlists they administer the local before the
[01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:14.000]   general anesthesia so jz bought title uh and wimp
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:18.880]   which are both run by a swedish company called as Spyro AB
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:25.440]   uh wimp is in Norway it's only available Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Germany and Poland
[01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:30.400]   and then in the u.s. and the uk is title i like title but it's 20 bucks a month it's
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:34.640]   twice as much but apple also rumored to say to be uh launching
[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:38.640]   the new service whatever they call it uh for less than the
[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:42.480]   ten dollars that everybody else is charging maybe seven right or seven
[01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:47.200]   on the other thing yeah they they they floated five but then you
[01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:50.800]   watch the grammys on sunday and it basically there was a you know
[01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:58.160]   ten minute segment devoted to screw you thieves stop stealing our music
[01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:01.600]   and we're going to Washington DC and we're going to make sure congress helps
[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:04.880]   and uh you got i thought the subtext there is
[01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:08.480]   yeah we're never going to let sergeant pepper get into the public domain so
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:11.920]   you may as well just stop even asking about that
[01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:16.640]   what are the well they what they well they tip the hat to two artists
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:20.320]   who have been in the forefront here the turtles and of course the turtles
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:23.840]   sued because these streaming music services were using loopholes and
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:27.280]   copyright law that let them have anything pre or they said let them have
[01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:30.960]   anything pre 1972 royalty free turtles sued
[01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:33.760]   uh and then they said and a tip of that to Taylor Swift well what is Taylor
[01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:37.280]   Swift famous for pulling her album off Spotify
[01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:41.120]   so it's pretty clear that they're at least from the point of view and by the
[01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:45.120]   way lots of shots of artists in the audience going yeah yeah yeah
[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:48.720]   it's the music industry is clear that they just basically say anybody
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:52.160]   who screws with us we're gonna screw with you
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:56.000]   and it's not just piracy it's streaming music it's
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.440]   it's Spotify and we're going to go to congress to make sure that that doesn't
[01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:02.320]   happen it's in whatever you do like don't let your
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:05.680]   customers choose yeah heaven just don't allow that
[01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:09.440]   heaven because they're such there's such weakness in the way they're running
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:13.840]   their businesses now because now if the it's still
[01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:16.960]   terribly unlikely you'll become a success as a musician that thing has
[01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:20.960]   never changed but now you can become a really big success as a musician not
[01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:24.480]   by getting a record deal but by simply having a youtube presence you can have
[01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:28.080]   there people that you've never heard of who are not even allowed to park cars
[01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:31.360]   at the Grammys who have tens of millions of youtube
[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:35.040]   channel subscribers who can sell things directly to these people where they
[01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:38.640]   you know and they can make and they can make almost as much money that way
[01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:42.480]   as a success that as you could like as by having actual record deal
[01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:47.040]   and so this is why a lot of these groups uh don't want their music on Spotify
[01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:50.880]   because why would i settle for getting a fraction of a penny for every one of my
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:55.120]   fans when i can just have them i can just tell talk them directly and they'll be
[01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:57.760]   happy to give me five bucks for a whole for a whole album
[01:20:57.760 --> 01:21:00.800]   or twenty to thirty dollars for concert ticket but
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:04.240]   you look at the way that Spotify is streaming revenue breaks down and it's
[01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:08.480]   like wow why would you want to how does how does this work out for you as a
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:10.400]   performer well it's a discovery thing you could say
[01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:13.600]   this you can make the same argument why would i want to ever be on radio
[01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:18.160]   um and by the way that's the whole issue is they want they they uh they uh they
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:22.480]   don't want another radio yeah we got radio we don't need another radio
[01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:26.400]   but that's how kids don't listen to radio come on
[01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:29.760]   they they like to they like to share their music with other people that's
[01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:33.440]   that's one that it's not i i i keep thinking that the reason why
[01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:38.240]   Spotify is such a hit isn't because a minimum amount of money and then you
[01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:41.840]   get all you can eat is that it's so easy to say this song is
[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:44.880]   awesome here you should listen to it here's the entire track
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:48.080]   and you can do that by sharing a spotify link if you have another system where
[01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:50.720]   you put you yourself are deciding to put this on
[01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:54.720]   on another music service or or bandcamp or soundcloud
[01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:58.800]   uh why do you need to sign a contract with Spotify why do you need to
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:03.040]   suffer with the new music terms that google is putting youtube
[01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:06.960]   musicians under it seems like it seems like a system that's
[01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:11.520]   close to the point where either each this big herd of musicians starts to
[01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:15.760]   break apart and scatter to every hill and dale where the music industry can't
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:19.680]   really make any money off of them or they figure out a way to make this herd
[01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:22.880]   happy and get them to stick together so they can get their 10 to 20 percent
[01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:25.840]   i mean i'm watching the grammys and i'm thinking it's just a bunch of guys
[01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:29.600]   trying to label people run labels trying to make sure that their profits are
[01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:34.960]   protected by congress yeah and and it's so there was a study
[01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:39.840]   Ernst and Young did a study uh on streaming systems they studied
[01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:45.920]   Deezer and Spotify get this because because by the way the the CEO of
[01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:49.360]   Pandora and uh and uh i think of Spotify both have said
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:55.920]   we pay a lot of money billions every year uh in royalties where's it go well
[01:22:55.920 --> 01:23:00.960]   45.6 percent goes to the artist's record label
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:04.480]   the streaming service gets about 21 percent only about a fifth of the
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:07.680]   revenue less than apple gets i might add 17
[01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:12.560]   percent taxes songwriters and publishers 10 percent
[01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:20.880]   the artist's 6.8 percent 6.8 percent so when uh Taylor Swift and this was why
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:24.400]   it really annoys me the record labels are co-opting Taylor Swift when Taylor
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:26.880]   Swift says well i'm not gonna be in Spotify get so little
[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:29.840]   it's not Spotify you need to complain to Taylor
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:34.640]   your label's stealing from you as they have ever since Scott invented record
[01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:39.040]   labels well those percentages might be a bit different for Taylor Swift i'm
[01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:41.040]   sure she has a different deal with her
[01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:45.280]   with her label surely but the point does remain that she's she will
[01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:48.640]   always be getting a fraction of a fraction of a percent yeah maybe she has
[01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:51.600]   a better contractual relationship but the point is we don't care about
[01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:55.360]   Taylor Swift per se we care about the music industry and musician actually we
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:58.080]   don't care about the music industry we care about musicians
[01:23:58.080 --> 01:24:02.160]   as listeners we want to make sure that they make a living and continue to create
[01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:06.080]   great music for us and it's pretty clear from day one the record labels have
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:08.720]   not been the best way to do it and thank goodness there's the internet
[01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:12.640]   you don't need your label anymore these guys are just trying to rip you off
[01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:18.000]   and it was it seems so appalling this this speech that they gave and got
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:21.760]   these artists going yeah yeah yeah we're going to go to Congress
[01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:25.680]   to make sure that our crap business model is protected
[01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:29.120]   so who are they saying that too like well that's annoying who's watching the
[01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:32.640]   Grammys yeah they're listeners the fans the
[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:36.560]   people love music it's like don't listen to our music
[01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:40.960]   you don't want to fly it well you come ridiculous
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:45.680]   we're gonna make sure Congress protects us from you you scum
[01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:49.120]   all right i'm sorry i got a little heated there
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:52.080]   well let's talk to speak you're speaking truth to power to them directly to the
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:56.080]   man that's right you got to fight the powers it be
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:25:01.760]   uh swift is doing all right is doing all right apparently uh it is
[01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:07.520]   being widely adopted uh and a number of big companies american airlines do
[01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:12.480]   o lingo gettie images have all taken to swift say their development
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:16.480]   productivity has gone up there are fewer bugs in apps
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:20.480]   uh big it's interesting a swift is still not done in fact they just gave
[01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:24.480]   us a new version of swift that adds additional features
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:30.000]   it's in beta but it looks like swift was perhaps the right thing
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.000]   uh to do you've seen we showed this graph from red monk before a swift moves up
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:39.120]   the the popularity the the x-axis on this is popularity on
[01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:44.160]   github the y-axis is stack overflow conversations
[01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:47.200]   and uh you see it's actually pretty linear it's interesting
[01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:50.480]   and swift is right up there still objective c is still still more popular
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:54.880]   but swift has been moving up very very rapidly
[01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:58.480]   we should have mentioned this last week uh i know i more wrote about it
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:01.760]   stanford has released they do every year they do an incredible
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:07.440]   uh iTunes u course on developing for iOS their newest version developing iOS
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:14.320]   8 apps with swift and it's free on iTunes u
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:19.200]   according to red monk adoption of swift has been essentially unprecedented
[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:23.920]   and if you are a swift developer you you probably already have the new x-code
[01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:28.640]   which delivers the newest version of uh swift to you so
[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:32.560]   this is this is uh it's i find this fascinating because
[01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:36.640]   it's a language that you could only use to develop for uh iOS
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:41.680]   yeah it's very narrow right now yeah uh but at the same time it's it's kind of
[01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:45.360]   incredible that apple basically put its foot down and said you know what
[01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:49.600]   we're going to create our own language for iOS we're that we are that certain
[01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:52.640]   that um that objective c is is over and done i mean
[01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:57.440]   objective c is really just built on top of c right so being able to tear that
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:27:00.080]   all down and say all right we're going to start from scratch and we're
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:04.960]   going to build a clean simple language and you know i've
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:10.720]   i am not a hardcore iowas developer i have one test product project in swift so i
[01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:14.000]   can't say much about whether it's an easier language to use
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:18.480]   than objective c but i mean from statistically it seems like people
[01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:22.240]   people seem to be digging it and the uh the documentation on the
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:26.000]   language uh both the free stuff available from apple and the stuff that stand for
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:29.200]   it's putting together is really fantastic for people who want to learn
[01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:33.280]   yeah compiler improvements and swift 1.2 more stable
[01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:37.040]   faster i didn't know this but you could you couldn't do incremental builds
[01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:40.560]   before which is kind of uh for most developers a must to
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:45.120]   swift to to speed up the the code compile run
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:48.400]   cycle uh you only in the past you've i guess had to
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:53.440]   recompile everything now you only recompile uh files that have changed
[01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:57.280]   executables are running faster in fact apple's claiming and i haven't seen
[01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:01.840]   anybody dispute this the swift runs much faster than objective c
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:05.680]   which is great considering it's kind of an interpreted
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:09.200]   language and there's some new features that they're adding and this is one of
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:12.720]   the things that uh some experts have said well we don't want to adopt a
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:15.280]   language that is that isn't set you know that
[01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:18.640]   there's yeah daniel jell could said that uh on
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:21.920]   twitter like i'm gonna stroll in when swift 2.0 is out say nice look at
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:25.040]   language you got there and then move along with my business yeah
[01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:29.360]   um it's you know it's oh developers they usually have like a really
[01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:32.880]   wide range of tools that they work with they don't just they not just master
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:35.680]   one language they master a whole bunch of languages
[01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:38.640]   and when you put something i've been talked to a lot of them about swift and
[01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:41.520]   they a lot of them are really really interested in it because they like the
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:43.680]   way they like its attitude towards development
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:47.360]   a lot of them are like i can either spend x hours of the week learning this
[01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:50.480]   brand new language or i could spend x hours writing
[01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:55.440]   software and i'd much rather be writing software than doing that
[01:28:55.440 --> 01:29:01.200]   silver is apparently uh a uh across platform compiler for swift
[01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:05.920]   that will allow you to write and read and the hotly demanded windows phone apps
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:10.880]   um so i don't i don't i don't i don't i don't think you're down quite enough
[01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:13.920]   i think you can still kick them a little bit more i'm sorry
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:19.600]   i'm sorry it's a lovely phone it's a love i love it i love my 15 20 i'm just
[01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:23.120]   frustrated because i i would love to see you know i can't use it because there's
[01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:26.400]   the google just has just decided to kill it
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:28.240]   personal you know just put it out of its end
[01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:32.320]   out of its end so um silver is a swift language front end
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:37.040]   for the elements compiler elements compiler.com
[01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:39.600]   so i don't know how well it works it's not out yet
[01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:45.600]   beta is coming does not support uh cocoa for touch which is a little odd
[01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:48.640]   um i think it's i think it's interesting to see how
[01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:52.480]   well this is going to progress will apple has a certain amount of
[01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:55.440]   a lot of control over the developers because they can
[01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:59.440]   they because the app store is the only vector for uh deploying software
[01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:02.480]   so they could at some point say that yeah we're not going to let you deploy
[01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:05.280]   your software unless it supports these apis
[01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:09.200]   and so there's always that possibility that after swift gets off the ground
[01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:11.440]   they could say two three four five years later that
[01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:14.640]   okay now we are not going to be accepting any app that it doesn't
[01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:17.920]   that it's not that is not written in swift i don't know how they would enforce
[01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:20.960]   that but it's it's just another note about how
[01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:23.840]   interesting the relationship between apple is developers are right now
[01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:26.880]   if you take a look you want to take a look at a swift app uh the geddy
[01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:29.360]   images is released something called stream
[01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:33.840]   an app for ios and os 10 written in swift let's you search uh the
[01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:37.040]   geddy images portfolio that's pretty cool
[01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:41.520]   um that's where i i think this is exciting american airlines is using it
[01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:46.240]   uh for their app which is part of a past book
[01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:51.440]   um and both of these shops did a lot of objective c coding linked in
[01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:55.600]   is using swift in its slide share app
[01:30:55.600 --> 01:31:00.160]   so that's that's uh i think the duo lingo i love duo lingo
[01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:05.920]   their test center which is a companion app uh is written uh in swift
[01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:09.680]   i'm surprised to see um this amount of adoption yes
[01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:13.840]   needs of this size yeah this quickly too yeah yeah
[01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:16.480]   yeah that's like if you're saying oh like uh
[01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:21.280]   bob the guy who makes the the app for checking your car location
[01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:24.400]   is using it like sure he is he's given it a go but
[01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:28.400]   for it to be used by large companies right now and in
[01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:31.920]   like especially you see american airlines like that's the american airlines app
[01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:34.880]   like all of the other companies like it's a companion app right no this is
[01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:37.920]   like the full on this is the app the only app we have
[01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:41.840]   like it's quite quite a big bet i mean i wonder if maybe
[01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:46.320]   apple's been in their ear a little bit um you know do us a favor maybe
[01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:49.840]   uh we'll let you look at the apple wash a little bit early or something but
[01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:52.480]   whatever the whatever the reasons for what they're doing it
[01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:56.240]   it's very interesting that they are
[01:31:56.240 --> 01:32:00.400]   finally danny boil steve jobs biopic we know it's uh we've talked last week
[01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:03.200]   it's been shooting in kupertino at the flint center
[01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:07.760]   now has been given a release date for fall of this year and sorkin
[01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:11.520]   wrote it michael fast bender plays steve job seth rogan
[01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:17.200]   steve wasniak it will uh open october ninth
[01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:25.200]   but be careful because uh the kidnap with hally berry is going to open
[01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:29.120]   bina vistas coast guard film the finest hours with chris pine
[01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:36.160]   and warner brothers hotly anticipated vacation reboot all on october ninth
[01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:43.120]   so i think it'll do all right uh so uh that's exciting i can't wait to see it
[01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:48.400]   and and i can't wait to pan it if it doesn't live up to our high standards
[01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:53.040]   i think that's interesting we'll have to put the comic book i filter on all of
[01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:58.560]   our microphones to see first of all steve wasniak in 1970s
[01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:01.520]   sifties wasniak was still part-time employee at hilly
[01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:06.320]   secretary he should not still have his vw microbust because it was sold in
[01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:12.240]   1875 but chevy chase no is not in the national
[01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:16.080]   lamproom vacation reboot i'm sorry actually maybe he'll have a he should
[01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:18.560]   have like a bit part like the gas station attendant
[01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:23.040]   so that you know you could go oh that's chevy he could be like the stumble
[01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:25.680]   bum john louis gossett glenn says he is
[01:33:25.680 --> 01:33:29.440]   glenny is huh he's not going to be the lead though
[01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:32.960]   he plays clark he plays clark oh yeah i'm sorry
[01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:35.040]   that's the gris wall grown up and taking his
[01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:39.920]   rusty gris wall takes his kids on a vacation so grandpa clark is still
[01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:43.520]   around and Beverly the angel is still in it

[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:51.360]   together because there was a little hair miss for a while there

[01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.720]   who can forget
[01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:04.160]   ps chop says the vacation reboot will definitely out earn the jobs movie
[01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:06.480]   yeah there's a lot all of a sudden the chatroom is going crazy about the
[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:09.520]   vacation movie maybe maybe they're right that's
[01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:14.000]   relevant it's not dividing the nerd vote is a very risky thing to do
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:17.520]   that that that'll be that'll be a great topic for discussion do we think that the
[01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:20.720]   steve that the steve jobs movies better because it got more market share or
[01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:24.480]   because it great it generated more revenue

[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:09.200]   oh andy you're muted hello andy
[01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:15.840]   sorry about that that's quite all right i had to leave the room to get my pick
[01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:18.400]   which was in my lap talk day because i use it so much
[01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:22.960]   uh it's the compass to ipad stand by 12 south
[01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:27.120]   which has been around for a while i it i came late to the church of the compass
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:31.200]   to the compass stand because it was a forty dollar thing and i'm i was so
[01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:34.480]   burned out on ipad stands because between stuff that i get sent and stuff
[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:37.680]   that i bought it's like i could i've got a stand for every
[01:37:37.680 --> 01:37:40.560]   dish that i've got in the entire you know kitchen
[01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:44.080]   but oh man is this just a beautifully put together object
[01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:49.520]   where when it's folded up it is this really heavy like steel sort of object
[01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:52.640]   but then when you unfold it it turns into this
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:57.360]   and then this and then this and it becomes this
[01:37:57.360 --> 01:38:03.040]   absolutely rock steady stand that is both beautiful and also won't wobble it
[01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:07.040]   won't tear anything like that it also has a really clever design where you can
[01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:12.240]   flip flip out this kickstand right here and actually use it
[01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:16.400]   flat like that so that it holds it holds it at a comfortable typing angle
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:20.720]   and then when you're done it just just folds down absolutely nothing it even
[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:24.800]   comes in with this nice little like padded case which you can also use to
[01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:28.720]   clean your ipad screen with it's not the cheapest stand by
[01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:33.600]   by any by any measure they knew you can buy the original compass
[01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:38.240]   for about 20 bucks now the new model is adjustable so it works with the ipad
[01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:42.320]   mini as well and that's 40 bucks but boy if i had had one of these my hands
[01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:45.440]   like two years ago or three years ago i definitely would have just bought it
[01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:48.960]   because it's just a huge you have such
[01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:52.480]   appreciation for a beautiful object i mean earlier in the show i said that i
[01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:56.080]   think that the ipad air two is like the prettiest
[01:38:56.080 --> 01:39:00.960]   and the most apple esque device that that apple has ever made one and
[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:04.480]   maybe with the most beautiful tech object on sale right now you kind of feel like
[01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:08.240]   you want to spend the extra 20 or 25 bucks for a stand that's just as
[01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:12.240]   beautiful and it is so small that you can just toss this into
[01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:15.680]   any case that you have and you'll never be without it so
[01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:19.120]   uh high recommendation i love it as a matter of fact i'm probably going to buy
[01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:22.800]   a second one so that it's there for me like the highest
[01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:26.720]   recommendation i can give something for some for an object like this is that
[01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:32.560]   do i not only do i use it all the time do i buy ones for both my ipad bag and for
[01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:36.480]   my laptop bag so that i want to make sure i never have to like be without it no
[01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:40.880]   matter what i'm leaving the house with and this definitely passes that test
[01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:44.880]   you know what else i like about it it uh it's kind of uh it doesn't
[01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:49.040]   it would work with almost any size ipad so you can use the current ipad air and
[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:52.720]   retina mini but if they came out with a 12 inch it
[01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:56.000]   probably work right yeah and it works with it works with everything i've got a
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:00.720]   bunch of tablets uh around the office like for testing at any given time and
[01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:05.360]   anything it will work for uh it will work for a cookbook it'll work for
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:08.640]   pretty much everything you've got going it'll work as it'll work as a picture
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:12.400]   frame uh maybe an expensive stand for picture frame but
[01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:18.080]   it's just so flexible for so about 40 bucks yeah i'm buying it again
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:20.960]   or you can get the again you can get the old one for 20 bucks and it's just not
[01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:24.880]   as useful for uh for an ipad mini as this as the uh
[01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:28.560]   as anyone is but either way high recommendation i'm looking only going to
[01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:32.000]   buy ipad accessories that will fit a 12.9 inch ipad i'm just
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:37.280]   i think i think you know again if you this this this could actually be like
[01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:42.000]   you can be an mgm 1935 movie like ice pick murderer with this
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:45.280]   i have the feeling that unless they if they can keep the weight of the new
[01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:49.520]   next ipad under 90 pounds this will be able to support the weight of the next
[01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:56.080]   whatever larger ipad near me not me i love it uh mike do you have a pick for us i
[01:40:56.080 --> 01:41:01.360]   want to pick relay.fm because uh yes you go there and you hear
[01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:05.920]   shows how many shows do you do oh me personally i think like six or
[01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:08.720]   seven yeah something like that i'll i'll say to that oh you're a
[01:41:08.720 --> 01:41:15.040]   hunter i do 12 a week get going get to work young i will
[01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:20.880]   today i tell you i just sleep in and and it's not just tech i mean like i
[01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:26.400]   said pens which is awesome yep yeah if gaming and and tech and
[01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:30.240]   we're trying to move into pop culture now as well so love it yeah we got a long
[01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:34.080]   road ahead but i do have a pick there yes there it is the latest um
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:42.000]   shiny happy people the pen addict indeed it's a twisbee
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:46.800]   go ahead your pick of the week my pick we we've spoken a few times about like
[01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:53.520]   services that i can't get access to how do you get access to those services
[01:41:53.520 --> 01:42:00.480]   i use a great well um it a completely different topic yes i use that i use
[01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:05.520]   an app called cloak for just for secure browsing secure browsing
[01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:09.360]   via using vpn so cloak is a great mac and ios app
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:12.880]   um and basically what it does is it allows you to secure your connection
[01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:16.000]   via vpn but it also allows you to spook your location
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:20.480]   so i i don't know why you do that but you could do if you wanted to
[01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:25.440]   um it has a really great app on the mac which is a menu bar app and there's a
[01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:29.440]   great app on the iphone which has to do some complicated things with
[01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:32.720]   installing some like profiles but it has a really good way of talking you through
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:35.760]   how you do that and like how you then activate the vpn
[01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:39.680]   in ios settings it has really good pricing so they have monthly plans
[01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:42.960]   that start at like two ninety nine a month but they also have what i really
[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:46.800]   like is passes so you can buy a week a month or a year so maybe you want
[01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:49.280]   need to watch a sporting event or something like that you can buy just
[01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:52.480]   like a week pass which is like i think like three or four dollars something
[01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:55.840]   like that um and they can be either bought on their
[01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:58.560]   site or bought in the app via an app purchase
[01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:02.640]   it's i've used a bunch of these types of app in the apps in the past and i think
[01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:06.800]   cloke is the easiest one to use um especially with its
[01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:11.120]   companion ios apps you set up an account and your pass goes between both devices
[01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:14.720]   and a big fan of it and considering netflix just added all of
[01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:17.920]   friends in the u.s it's very useful for me at the moment
[01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:23.280]   my daughter who is uh 23 never saw friends has actually i think now gone
[01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:26.960]   off how many eight nine seasons i think i was like 10
[01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:30.720]   10 isn't this something like that could be more she started watching number one i
[01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:38.720]   said my god they were young i am all right mike and uh thank you by the way

[01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:10.320]   to do i on youtube is there yeah oh i didn't know that it's not official but
[01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:13.520]   there are there's like a horde of people that put those those things on there
[01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:18.320]   every episode is on youtube oh so illegal that's so good
[01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:22.320]   zorini called well from imore.com what do you got for us today
[01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:26.880]   um today i don't have it in hand unfortunately um but but i'm still
[01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:30.160]   gonna espouse its its greatness regardless that's that
[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:34.560]   ten-one designs mountie uh it's which has a very strange name it's not
[01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:38.400]   canadian um this is a weird little gadget uh that
[01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:43.440]   attaches your phone or your ipad so weird
[01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:48.560]   so i laughed out loud when i saw this the first time i was like really this
[01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:52.080]   looks especially because they show it with hvo go and i'm like okay so
[01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:54.560]   you're gonna be watching television while you're working
[01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:57.760]   but you know what all right so but you can have a twitter stream in there or
[01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:01.600]   messages actually would be good exactly messages if you use something like
[01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:05.680]   duet display you can turn your ipad into a secondary display
[01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:09.040]   we love yeah exactly what i really love doing
[01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:13.760]   actually is using that with my macbook air and then sitting on like a couch
[01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:18.240]   or a chair it's so ridiculous looking but it works it could be a rear view mirror
[01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:22.160]   if you put the camera a selfie camera on your nose over your shoulder
[01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:25.040]   yeah watch for any characters i get really worried
[01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:28.480]   i i this looking at those images it really worries me that it's gonna like
[01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:31.520]   completely ruin the center of balance does it like
[01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:36.000]   does it do that does it affect like the way that the the laptop's balance like
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.400]   especially on air i imagine you poke it and the entire thing
[01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:43.440]   it's okay yeah on an on an 11 inch air with an ipad mini
[01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:48.400]   in in landscape and an ipad air and landscape if you tilt the
[01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:52.960]   air's hinge all the way like all the way back it tends to rock a little bit
[01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:56.720]   with an iPhone it's no problem and that's only an 11 inch air i tested it with
[01:45:56.720 --> 01:46:00.640]   a 13 inch macbook pro and it was rock solid you have to buy a different
[01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:04.080]   mountie depending it's one mountie fits all it looks like
[01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:07.760]   one mountie fits all they have actually i do have the little rubber pieces here
[01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:12.080]   i think so and i love 10 one design they they really are a cool company they've
[01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:14.800]   done so you can see yeah these little rubber pieces
[01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:19.200]   just snap in and then you just switch out whichever rubber piece you need for
[01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:24.320]   whichever iOS device you have it's cool especially if you're sitting on the
[01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:28.320]   couch i did not realize how many times i lost my
[01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:32.000]   iPhone or needed my iPhone and i was like sitting on it or somewhere
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:36.880]   elsewhere when i was working remotely until i attached it to my computer and
[01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:40.480]   i'm like oh this is actually really useful this is
[01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:44.000]   this is really functional and on airplanes too i used it on a flight back
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:48.160]   from from Las Vegas and i found that it was like
[01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:53.680]   it was perfect just hanging over the the tray table the person next to you
[01:46:53.680 --> 01:46:59.280]   don't mind that i didn't torture it so not not so much with the lengthy is the
[01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:04.000]   the long but yeah i'm really like this is the second thing i've bought now
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:07.040]   and he's uh and he's standing them buying his clip
[01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:10.720]   and uh what i like is they're all one size fits all
[01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:16.240]   so you just clip anything to my air i bet this would work we should have you
[01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:19.440]   tried it with a 5k i'mac that's thin enough maybe yeah
[01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:24.240]   um i not with a 5k but i have it i've used it on a 20 inch it does um
[01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:28.800]   well as well as it does with the with the mac it's a little bit weird with the
[01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:33.040]   rubber but it still holds it just fine i'm buying it right now
[01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:35.360]   flipping the air to the side of the
[01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:41.200]   you're insane you're like mad man
[01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:44.320]   it's probably it's probably wise for you to buy a second like
[01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:49.360]   iPad mini just to balance it out you know one on each side
[01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:52.720]   like giant i've had many years you have you have sort of like a dead mouse
[01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:57.200]   effect you know going on jeez just for the just for
[01:47:57.200 --> 01:48:00.640]   a set of security not because you just want to you have an older iPad mini and
[01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:05.440]   you want to buy new iPad mini it's just prudent we should just have you
[01:48:05.440 --> 01:48:09.520]   should do serenity a series of articles for i'm more in things you can clip
[01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:16.080]   two things using a moutie i just ordered one myself that sounds so cool
[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:19.600]   you know the idea of doing a face time i'm i the only person i face time with is
[01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:23.120]   my mom but uh but it's always a problem because really i want to do other things
[01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:26.640]   while i'm talking to mom so like i she says why aren't you looking at me
[01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:33.520]   oh sorry mom it's distracted look at me so now i can clip the phone or the
[01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:37.040]   iPad there and pretend to look at her while i'm
[01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:41.360]   surfing in that or watching my netflix movie there you go
[01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:45.840]   very good serenity call well is so wonderful at i'more.com

[01:49:57.280 --> 01:50:00.800]   i didn't do a pic today except for relay fm but i might mention that and number
[01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:04.320]   people in the chat room and jason howl too have pointed out that on key drive
[01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:07.520]   which is those cool little cars that i gave my son but he never took with him
[01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:11.440]   so i have them that you let you race around the track they're smart they
[01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:16.080]   control them with an ios device they have they are upgrading the tracks
[01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:19.680]   oh no there's an ad why would they put an ad on an ad
[01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:23.760]   you shouldn't have an ad on an ad there it is
[01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:27.520]   they now have you can now jump your anki drives
[01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:30.960]   your cars i have four cars i got the whole setup
[01:50:30.960 --> 01:50:33.600]   does it work well yeah yeah works great
[01:50:33.600 --> 01:50:38.160]   i'm just henry just doesn't you know i don't my son he's just not grateful for
[01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:41.520]   all the wonderful things i have laid in my
[01:50:41.520 --> 01:50:47.520]   so this looks really cool they have uh yeah the one the original works great
[01:50:47.520 --> 01:50:51.440]   um so what do you do you control like the speed
[01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:56.320]   like yeah but you also have power-ups and and uh things you could use shoot
[01:50:56.320 --> 01:51:00.560]   and uh virtual shooting and the cars know that you're shooting at them
[01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:05.520]   and uh each car has its own abilities it's kind of more like a video game
[01:51:05.520 --> 01:51:11.440]   made into uh real uh you know slot car set but there's no slots of course
[01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:14.800]   because it's all computer controlled it's pretty cool
[01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:17.440]   yeah look at this i can't wait to get this new track
[01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:20.640]   it's also the idea that you can race against other cars are being controlled
[01:51:20.640 --> 01:51:23.600]   by the computer that they have a sense of where all the other cars are on the
[01:51:23.600 --> 01:51:26.240]   track yeah just like you're seeing this formation
[01:51:26.240 --> 01:51:31.600]   right writing and it's kind of creepy in a good way
[01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:34.560]   to see that oh there's a ghost car that's is
[01:51:34.560 --> 01:51:37.760]   that's trying to steer around me even though oh dear that's interesting
[01:51:37.760 --> 01:51:41.360]   it's neat can you can you drive them off like on slot car races
[01:51:41.360 --> 01:51:44.480]   like if you power them up too much will they fly off the track yeah
[01:51:44.480 --> 01:51:47.840]   oh that's awesome that's pretty cool it's like slot cars without the slots
[01:51:47.840 --> 01:51:51.200]   basically yeah it's reliving my childhood so
[01:51:51.200 --> 01:51:53.360]   i'm keeping it Henry you're not getting it back
[01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:56.640]   and i'm getting this track that looks awesome
[01:51:56.640 --> 01:52:03.680]   awesome um apples stock at an all-time high went up two dollars and 30 cents
[01:52:03.680 --> 01:52:08.480]   today thanks chatroom for filling us in all time high of 122 dollars
[01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:12.480]   and two cents but apple is doomed because yeah
[01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:15.360]   because of the heat death of the universe yes that's right at some point
[01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:20.480]   entropy's gonna get you also investing 848
[01:52:20.480 --> 01:52:24.720]   million i think that's the number to build a solar farm
[01:52:24.720 --> 01:52:30.160]   in Monterey California so apple's busy busy busy and uh we will
[01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:34.160]   give you the results of uh i think some of this is coming from
[01:52:34.160 --> 01:52:38.800]   uh tim cooks a speech at the Goldman conference right now he's speaking
[01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:42.240]   right now apple will partner with first solar
[01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:45.680]   to build an 850 million dollar solar energy farm
[01:52:45.680 --> 01:52:49.600]   in Monterey county uh California to be enough to power 60
[01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:53.200]   thousand homes it's not their first they already have two in North Carolina
[01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:57.200]   and one in Nevada in fact all of apples data centers
[01:52:57.200 --> 01:53:00.640]   according to cook who's this is actually from his talk at the
[01:53:00.640 --> 01:53:05.360]   Goldman conference are running on renewable energy
[01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:11.600]   wow that not only spikes for solar shares it spiked apple shares
[01:53:11.600 --> 01:53:15.200]   all right thank you everybody for joining us for a Mac break weekly lot of fun as
