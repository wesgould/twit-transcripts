[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.960]   universe in studio with me, the Universal Alex Lindsey
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.160]   of the PixelcorePixacore.com, that great guild of 3D artists.
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.520]   It's nice.
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.360]   My phone decides to ring right at that moment.
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.280]   So it's for you.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.840]   Thank you very much.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.000]   I had a lot of fun yesterday.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.640]   I learned a lot about SpeedRail.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.400]   SpeedRail.
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.480]   That's what Kelly was putting in here.
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.480]   That's all this stuff here.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.720]   We'll talk about that in a second, yeah,
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.680]   because we've got a new studio lighting grid.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.720]   But first, let me say hello to Mr. Ray Maxwell.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.840]   Eileen, how are you doing?
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.440]   First wild host of Maxwell's House
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.200]   from Vancouver, British Columbia, color scientist,
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.120]   photographer, Photoshop, wizard.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.600]   And I hope a regular on Mac Break Weekly going forward,
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.080]   because Ray is so smart.
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.720]   Good to have you.
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.000]   Thank you, Ray.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.440]   And Alex Lindsey is also-- wait a minute.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.360]   Alex Lindsey is also here.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.080]   Hey, Alex.
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.880]   I mean, Andy Inaco is also here.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.800]   The sideburns, I should have known.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.400]   No, that's OK.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.600]   With all the heat waves here, it's
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.040]   causing distortion from the store.
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.680]   It's really hard to see, really hard to hear, really hard to think.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.600]   OK.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.320]   From the Chicago Sun Times and the Celestial Waste of Ban with--
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.600]   Is it really hot in New England right now?
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.000]   I have been keeping an eye on weatherunderground.com.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.320]   It has not been below 100 degrees in the past two hours.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.440]   The highest that I have made-- I have screenshot it was 104.5.
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.560]   Holy moly.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.960]   And the radio station--
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.720]   Yeah, 104.5.
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.360]   That's my favorite rock and roll station.
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.960]   I swear to God, up until 45 minutes ago, I'm like--
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.160]   unfortunately, I only have one room in my house
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.840]   that's air conditioned, because usually we only
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.520]   get a few days of really, really bad heat in the summer.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.080]   And I'm like, how difficult would it
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.480]   be to get the microphone or the camera right there
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.960]   into the bedroom and just do it in your style?
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.400]   Because I don't want to be in a non-air condition office
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.520]   for two or two hours.
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.800]   Oh, man.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.040]   Well, I'm sorry.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.000]   You are a soldier.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.480]   Except for without the courage and the ability
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.720]   to deal with the training and take orders from people.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.280]   That's close enough.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.560]   For Mac Break Weekly?
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.080]   Fine.
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.600]   So since the last time we gathered,
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.400]   Apple has put out a note about the antenna issue
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.120]   on the iPhone.
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.440]   We did a great tweet.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.120]   If you want to hear, we had Spencer Webb from antenna-sis.com.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.640]   He's a RF engineer and an expert in antenna design.
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.200]   Come on.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.960]   He's a guy I wrote the blog post that said, hey,
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.760]   all phones have this problem to a greater or lesser extent.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.360]   But everybody is observed, of course, by now you know
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.360]   that if you hold the iPhone in your left hand--
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.040]   now he said it's not bridging that piece of plastic.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.600]   It's merely the thickness of your hand attenuating the antenna.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.480]   He said, the farther you can get your hand away
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.200]   from that antenna, the better.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.200]   So Alex Lindsay is demonstrating the proper grip right now,
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.760]   the Vulcan three-fingered death grip.
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.040]   Or you see what I did.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.840]   I hate to do it because the iPhone 4 is such a beautiful design,
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.760]   but I put a case on it and that seems to have solved it.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.320]   But here's an interesting point that we'll get to Apple's
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.120]   letter.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.520]   When I went to the AT&T store, they said, yeah, yeah, we know.
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.040]   But are you dropping more calls?
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.040]   And I had to say, well, first of all,
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.080]   I don't use a phone that much.
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.680]   But no, I guess I'm not.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.400]   My-- first of all, my whole thing is
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.920]   there's 30 people get upset about it.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.120]   There's a 30-day return policy.
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.920]   If this is really a problem for you, you can take it back.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.600]   You don't need to throw a tantrum out at it.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.680]   I mean, you can take the camera.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.040]   They take the whole thing back.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.080]   I don't think many people will because I don't think they care.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.000]   I think that the primary thing about iPhone users
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.320]   and every person that I talk to that uses an iPhone that's
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.720]   still using an iPhone is that they want a computer that also
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.440]   makes phone calls.
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.800]   So they don't have to carry another phone or one.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.120]   You're saying the phone calls are secondary.
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.760]   A secondary.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.720]   And the other thing is I have all kinds of call problems
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.720]   with my 3G, which I haven't received my 4O yet.
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.360]   I'm playing with Leo's at the moment.
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.080]   If I put it in my house, if I put it in my pants pocket,
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.360]   I know that I'll drop calls.
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.440]   If I put it in my chest pocket, I know I won't.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.960]   You have to.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.280]   I don't think it's a public relations
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.360]   blow because of all the problems with AT&T all along.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.520]   It's just-- it's interesting because a Fourth of July weekend
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.160]   was talking to normal people.
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.480]   Everybody knows about this problem.
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.040]   They saw the iPhone 4 and they said, oh, how's the antenna?
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.400]   It's like everybody's become an RF engineer overnight.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.040]   The thing that I think is interesting
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.400]   is that you could take this the other way.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.080]   We were talking about this a little bit yesterday.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.080]   So when I want to make a case, Mophia
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.720]   to make some kind of case that actually adds to your antenna.
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.440]   Because because the antenna is exposed,
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.960]   you could actually have a case that pushed up against it
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.720]   and coiled up more antenna or gave you an extendable antenna.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.840]   It could fix all kinds of problems.
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.960]   Here's what Spencer Webb said, the antenna guy.
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.120]   He said, it's not bridging.
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.520]   It's not shorting it out or anything.
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.880]   It's just merely blocking it.
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.440]   And he says, the greater the distance between your hand
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.200]   and the left side there, the less attenuation they'll be.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.280]   And even this case, which is just a plastic case,
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.960]   which is maybe 10 millimeters difference,
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.080]   makes enough of a difference that I
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.240]   don't see as much attenuation on the antenna.
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.440]   And again, I don't drop calls.
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:32.440]   Apple says you'll drop calls in weak areas.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.520]   So in fact, this is-- and this is-- frankly, I--
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.880]   well, first of all, Ray, do you have anything to add to this?
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.040]   Because I think this is kind of something that you know
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.440]   a little bit about, I would imagine.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.400]   Yeah, I--
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.360]   here's the mobile data.
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.480]   And they were bought out by Motorola eventually.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.440]   But we pioneered data communications, RF data communications.
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.920]   So you know something about this?
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:54.520]   Yeah.
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.440]   And first of all, let me say that-- now, this
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.440]   is my best guess, because I haven't opened up an iPhone 4,
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.680]   because they're not available in Canada yet,
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.200]   coming soon on the website.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:12.640]   But the bars are probably an indication--
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.120]   or signal to noise ratio, rather than signal.
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:21.160]   And essentially, I'll try and put this in a nutshell.
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.320]   When you do digital communications over an RF channel,
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.760]   you have to encode with some kind of redundant code
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:32.120]   that you can do what's called forward error correcting.
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.160]   In other words, if you lose some of the bits
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.880]   through the RF channel, you can reconstruct
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.240]   the message at the other end, as long as you don't lose
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.480]   too many bits.
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.920]   And the measurement of that is bit error rate, they call it,
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.200]   V-E-R.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.400]   And anyway, what is happening here
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.600]   is when the bit error rate gets to a certain level, this code--
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:57.680]   which, by the way, is usually a Reed-Solomon code--
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.440]   allows forward error correcting.
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.280]   In other words, if some of the bits are dropped
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.920]   as they go through the channel, it
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:07.400]   can put them back together and extract the message.
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.560]   And if enough of them are dropped, suddenly it just quits.
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.520]   That's why with this kind of communication,
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.240]   if the bit error rate gets too high,
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.520]   and the Reed-Solomon code can't recover the data,
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.360]   then bang, you just lose the channel.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.120]   What you're saying is--
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.240]   and this is-- we've known this-- if it's digital,
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.840]   it either works or it doesn't work.
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.040]   There's redundancy built-in so that it can recover
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.720]   from some digital flaws.
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.560]   But at some point, it just dies.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:34.120]   That's right.
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.600]   And the question is, how much does this
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.520]   have to do with the number of bars?
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:37.880]   Right.
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:42.440]   Well, that just depends on what you do with measure.
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.480]   You measure the bit error rate by listening
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.800]   to the particular cell that has been chosen for you.
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.560]   And it's sending out packets all the time.
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.760]   And there's a CRC or some kind of error checking
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.760]   code at the end of every packet.
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.240]   And by the way, that's why it takes time for the bars
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.360]   to change.
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.560]   It's going to ask the listens to a number of packets
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.800]   before it can calculate an accurate bit error rate.
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:05.720]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.200]   So it's actually looking at the data.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.880]   Anantek had a great article on this effect.
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.520]   This is-- I think this is actually--
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.440]   I was looking at the diagram.
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.080]   And I think this is actually the proper way to hold it.
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:15.600]   Yeah.
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.480]   Of course, neither Steve Jobs nor any of the Apple ads
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.440]   they hold it properly.
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:19.800]   Is that right?
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.240]   No, wait, wait.
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:20.920]   Or is it like this?
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:21.640]   No, it's a case.
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:22.920]   Stop it.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.720]   You're supposed to do the three-fingered Vulcan death.
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.920]   But this would work actually really well.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:26.720]   It would work entirely.
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:27.240]   It would be exposed.
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.000]   No attenuation.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.720]   In fact, somebody has an eye hand.
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.040]   It's an accessory that goes to the eye
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.640]   if I was like a mannequin hand that holds your phone.
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.440]   You know what I think is interesting is I don't actually--
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.720]   I realize I was thinking about this.
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.840]   I have my headphone in all the time in California.
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.160]   You're not allowed to drive.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:40.640]   Right.
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.360]   And so I just have my headphone in all the time.
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.440]   It's always in my pocket.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.680]   Do you have most of the time when I'm on the iPhone?
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.680]   And the reason I don't drop as many calls, I guess,
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.120]   is because it's on the S-4 sync.
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.000]   And I don't-- you're right.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.120]   But this is the-- I thought Anantek did a brilliant job.
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.960]   And by the way, Spencer Webb agreed.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.520]   If you want to read probably the best discussion of this,
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.720]   they actually jail broke the iPhone
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.920]   so that they could see a percent--
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:06.280]   you know, they took out the maintenance mode
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:10.720]   that let you see the actual antenna reception
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:14.680]   appled in an iOS 4, which is even more suspicious.
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.200]   You know, not only do they kind of fudge the bars,
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.480]   but now they take out this maintenance mode
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.400]   that used to be able to dial in.
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:26.080]   So they're showing actual numbers instead of bars here.
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:33.680]   Essentially, they come to the same solution.
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:40.920]   If you cup it tightly, you're going to lose signal, but--
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.040]   but it's still better.
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:47.080]   And this is the important thing than any iPhone previously.
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.520]   So here's signal attenuation.
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.160]   The lower the number is better.
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.120]   And on the iPhone 4, if you cup it tightly,
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:11:00.440]   you get 24.6 dB signal attenuation compared to, say,
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.640]   17.7 on an Nexus 1 or 14.3 on a 3GS.
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:09.440]   This shows all the attenuation.
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:13.480]   However, they also point out the antenna is better.
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.360]   So yes, your signal goes down.
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:20.040]   You shouldn't drop as many calls according to an Anantek.
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:23.000]   But Apple has handled this so poorly
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.960]   that I think it's really a black mark against them.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.640]   It was this letter that they published saying,
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:33.320]   we were shocked to learn that we had been calculating
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.480]   the bars incorrectly and giving you more bars
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.200]   than you were really getting.
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.280]   Well, obviously, they did that on purpose for years
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.480]   on the first three iPhones.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.800]   So it would look like it was doing a better job than it does.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.400]   Right?
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.600]   Or they were just calculated in that way.
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.400]   You know, and they just--
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:47.880]   Oh, come on.
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.080]   No, man, I'm just saying, oh, come on.
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:49.760]   I was surprised.
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.120]   I have to admit, the first thing that I saw
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.840]   when people were complaining about their bars dropping,
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.040]   the first thing that I said, it was my company,
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.280]   I would just say, we've done an update that fixes this,
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.000]   you know, whatever.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:11:59.520]   Well, they did.
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:00.440]   And then it just what happened.
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.000]   They did.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.680]   And then they explained that the update merely
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:07.960]   makes the bars bigger and shows fewer bars than it used to show.
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.040]   So I guess the point being, you'll
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.080]   know you're in a bad signal area.
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.520]   And before they were hiding that.
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.960]   Andy, you had something to say about this?
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:19.680]   No, all I was going to say is that we really
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:20.920]   don't know what's going on here.
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.000]   I mean, Apple messed it up by speaking
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   when they didn't really--
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.880]   speaking when they didn't know what they would really--
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.600]   what they should really be telling people
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.680]   and not giving people a complete solution.
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.440]   All I was going to say is that it would be a very, very big deal
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.640]   if they intentionally said, I know that this is--
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.320]   I know that every iPhone we've done
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.880]   has had really bad signal reception.
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.400]   But we're going to kind up the number of barris
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.840]   as to make ourselves look good.
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:45.320]   That's significantly, you know, legally bad.
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:48.640]   Is that not kind of what they emitted, though?
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.840]   Well, there's there's a difference between that being
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.960]   like a legitimate mistake and saying, you know what?
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.120]   I think that we want-- we're aware of this.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.240]   We want to do it this way because it makes our phone look good.
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.120]   I think Apple really screwed this thing up.
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.400]   But I'm willing to stop short of saying
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.360]   that they knew about the signal--
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.560]   they knew about the extra bars that's
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:09.000]   been present apparently for the past three years
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.880]   without ever telling anybody about it.
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:16.280]   John Gruber has a great post on daring fireball.net.
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:18.040]   He posts this on Friday.
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:21.960]   Translation from Apple's unique dialect of PR speak
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.760]   to English of the letter from Apple.
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:28.760]   So the first paragraph, the iPhone 4
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.960]   has been the most successful product launch in Apple's history.
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.280]   Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:34.920]   We were surprised when we read reports of reception problems.
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:36.520]   We immediately began investigating them.
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:38.000]   Here's what we have learned.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.760]   John says, translated, we cannot believe we had
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.360]   to write this effing letter.
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.720]   To start with, gripping almost any mobile phone in certain ways,
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.400]   will reduce its reception.
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.560]   This is true of all phones.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.400]   We cannot believe we're getting crap for this.
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:55.080]   But some users who reported that iPhone can drop four or five
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:58.880]   bars when held tightly in a way which covers the black strip.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:06.360]   So he goes on, we've discovered the cause of this dramatic drop
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.920]   in bars, and it's both simple and surprising.
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:11.880]   Gruber's translation, we're going to blame AT&T.
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.360]   By an investigation, we were stunned.
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.280]   This is the word I love.
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.520]   Stunned to find the formula we use
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:20.480]   to calculate how many bars of signals of strength to display
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.280]   is totally wrong.
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.600]   So you're right, Andy, they're not admitting
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.560]   that they did it on purpose.
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:27.760]   But come on, that's the logical conclusion.
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.280]   The stunt was a bit more--
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:32.440]   Let me-- I'm suggesting-- well, what do you mean by
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.120]   did it on purpose?
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.640]   Are you suggesting that they've intentionally
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.000]   falsified the number of parts?
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.120]   They used a formula to calculate it that showed more bars
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.400]   than it should have because it made the phone look better
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.440]   than it was for three phones.
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.120]   You don't think so?
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.480]   If it depends on how you put it.
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:49.880]   If you put it that they had three different methods--
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.760]   X number of different methods of calculating
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:55.240]   the signal strength, each of which had equal validity.
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.880]   And one of them showed more bars than any other.
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:00.200]   And of course, they chose the one that showed off
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.360]   the iPhone to its best.
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.040]   No, they don't say it was equally valid.
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:07.400]   Our formula, in many instances, mistakenly displays two more
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.600]   bars than it should have forgiven signal strength.
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.480]   I'm saying that if you--
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:14.360]   the-- my only disconnect here, my only problem here
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:17.840]   is with the suggestion that Apple committed a knowing fraud
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.880]   on performance on its iPhone.
[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:21.800]   I don't think there was enough evidence to really say they
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:22.360]   did that.
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:23.040]   Well, you're right.
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.160]   We can't say it for sure.
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.880]   Just like, again, if there are three independently
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:32.640]   published methods for calculating my top speed on running,
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.120]   and there are three international Olympic Committee,
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.960]   Canadian Olympic Committee, US Olympic Committee,
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:39.680]   three different ways of calculating it,
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:42.360]   and the Canadian method puts my top speed at 5%
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.120]   running, fascinating, but else.
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:46.880]   I'm going to promote myself as using that standard
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:47.480]   than anything else.
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.520]   I think that's what Apple was doing.
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:51.080]   If that's--
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:55.280]   Groover writes, this is Groover's translation.
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:58.120]   We decided from the outset to set the formula for our bars
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.560]   of signal strength indicator to make the iPhone look good
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.960]   and to make it look as if it gets more bars.
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:06.920]   That decision has now bitten us on our ass.
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:07.880]   I mean, you're right.
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.160]   We can't know Andy if they did it on purpose,
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.920]   but they clearly chose to calculate it in a way that
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:18.600]   was reflected better on the phone than it ought to have.
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.880]   And now they're saying we're going to use AT&T--
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.680]   and by the way, this word is important.
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:27.200]   To fix this, we are adopting AT&T's recently--
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.680]   that's the important word--
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:31.880]   recommended formula for calculating how many bars to display.
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.640]   So the implication is, this is new.
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.600]   The way we're going to do this is new.
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.240]   And we're doing it wrong, but that's only
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.280]   because we were working on imperfect information.
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.200]   What you're saying, Andy?
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.400]   And I agree that that's one interpretation.
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:48.040]   But to me, and I guarantee you to the rest of the world,
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.000]   it looks like Apple was lying.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.120]   Well, it just looks messy.
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.240]   I mean, I think I agree with Andy that the biggest problem
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.560]   was is that they shouldn't have said anything
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:57.720]   until they figured out what it was.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:01.000]   And telling people to buy bumpers or holding it differently
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   was not an answer that should have ever come out of their eye.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.720]   It's not a coincidence that they're first--
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.040]   I was talking about this with some friends
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.640]   on "Rovar Breakfast" this morning.
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.800]   And I was saying that the way that Apple should have said it,
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.360]   it was knowing that, gee, it really
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:17.600]   is important that we keep this idea that we have this most
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.440]   advanced, incredible new phone.
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.840]   Keep it going for at least two weeks.
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:24.000]   And for two weeks, we're going to say, gosh, that's interesting.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.680]   We're definitely going to totally look into it,
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.480]   and we'll have some answers for you in a few weeks.
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.480]   If there's a problem with the phone,
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.040]   we definitely want to get to the bottom of it.
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.280]   But we don't want to say anything
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:34.520]   until we really have some concrete answers to it.
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.000]   I don't know.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   I think they have a massive--
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   I know.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.240]   --that ain't a problem right here.
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.440]   They're obviously not slowing down
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.400]   the sales of the iPhone.
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:44.160]   But Ray, this is Ray's first time on the show.
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.640]   And Ray, I just want to tell you, don't wait until somebody
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:48.280]   stops talking.
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.040]   You've just got to leap in.
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:50.880]   OK.
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:54.080]   Well, let me put a different slant on this whole story.
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.640]   The question I have-- and I have an answer for this.
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.160]   So the question I have is, why didn't they
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.520]   catch this before they released the phone?
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:05.960]   And the answer, I think, is I have a suggestion for them
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:10.080]   before they send their phones out for beta test.
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:15.600]   Take off plastic cover that disguises it as a 3GS.
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:16.960]   Have you thought about that?
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.640]   Everybody's saying that because the great power phone had
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.240]   that big plastic cover to disguise it.
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:22.640]   Maybe that didn't-- they also--
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:27.160]   I mean, let's face it, weird, amazing coincidence.
[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.960]   But for some reason, AT&T signals around the Cupertino
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:31.560]   area just fantastic.
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.600]   I actually have a suggestion for this.
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.360]   And that is that if Apple would like to us
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:36.800]   to beta test their phones--
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:40.880]   --come to our office, our office is the perfect beta test
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.880]   for reception because it is practically a corona case.
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:44.560]   Yeah.
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:45.160]   It just barely--
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.360]   Well, this is the irony is that everybody else who uses
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.920]   the iPhone apparently lives in bad AT&T signal area.
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.960]   Everybody in San Francisco, for instance.
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:52.960]   Yeah.
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:53.600]   Not that we're bitter.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:57.040]   Not that we're bitter or nothing.
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:57.880]   All right.
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.240]   OK, as long as I'm trash in Apple,
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.800]   why is it that for the first time ever
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.880]   that they ever release a case, they release a case that
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:07.880]   just happens by weird coincidence to fix this problem
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.360]   but do nothing else, the stupid ass bumper case,
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:12.440]   for $30 worth of plastic.
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:16.440]   Which by the way, Tom Merritt on Tech News Today,
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:19.720]   last week on our channel, tried his Livestrong bracelet,
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.440]   the rubber band bracelet works fine.
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.560]   We're just like a bumper.
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:25.800]   Protects it just about as well.
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:31.000]   OK, so that's-- to me, smoking gun number one.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:31.560]   I know.
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:32.080]   I know.
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:37.640]   We'll have that pulsing soundtrack from JFK.
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.560]   [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:40.000]   And then--
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.200]   All right, as long as--
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:44.000]   here's another one.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:44.960]   [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.720]   Calling, what's his name?
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:47.680]   Oliver Stone.
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:49.360]   Here's another one.
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:51.120]   How come none of the major reviewers who
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.000]   had the iPhone weeks ahead of time,
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.880]   David Pogue, Walt Mossberg, Ed Begg, whoever else,
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.160]   didn't notice this problem.
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.960]   But the minute we get the phone, we notice it.
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.400]   I believe Mossberg did notice this.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.000]   Did he say something?
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.360]   Interesting signal drop.
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:07.400]   I don't think he prosecuted it as well as people who got it
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:08.720]   afterwards did.
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:09.520]   But I do believe--
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:10.560]   I'll have that afraid now.
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:12.800]   I think the problem is that a lot of us who use iPhones
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.800]   have a very low expectation of the reception.
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:15.320]   We do.
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:18.040]   It's kind of like you're reviewing all the other stuff.
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:19.520]   And yeah, yeah, yeah, the reception's horrible.
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:20.720]   But it's always horrible.
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.000]   Yeah, that's normal.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.320]   What else would you expect?
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:25.160]   Compressious.
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.160]   All right.
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.480]   So, Ray, you think that just didn't test it properly?
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.280]   I think--
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:32.640]   But that throws me for a complete loop.
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:35.240]   I can't believe that Apple didn't test this.
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:35.600]   Of course it did.
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.520]   Unless they were running around with all disguised units
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:39.520]   during the test.
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:41.400]   No, no, these guys are more on.
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.640]   Yeah, this is insane.
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:47.720]   And any RF engineer and--
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:50.360]   she put the antenna on the outside of the phone,
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:53.360]   which is good from a standpoint of radiation
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:56.880]   and not having the phone attenuate your signal.
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.160]   But it's really bad from the standpoint
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.600]   that it can be touched or attenuated by the grip.
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.800]   And by the way, it's not the DC coupling.
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:05.320]   It's the wrapping--
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:09.080]   I mean, if you wrap your hand around a 3G-S phone,
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:10.960]   your bars go down as well.
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.800]   Well, in the old days when we had the start tech
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:14.520]   where you extend the antenna, if you held the antenna,
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:15.520]   the same thing would happen.
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:16.520]   I mean, this is just--
[00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:16.680]   Yeah.
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:17.800]   That's normal.
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:18.800]   Right.
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:20.480]   I think this comes back to the fact
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.760]   that Apple is a computer company.
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:25.160]   What they care about is the computer end of this.
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:28.360]   The phone is like this other thing that they have to add to.
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.240]   I disagree with you that people who buy iPhones
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:32.480]   don't care about phone service.
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.400]   Obviously, they do.
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.200]   I think they care about phone service.
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.120]   They don't buy an iPhone.
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.880]   I-- you know, they're like--
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.240]   Ah, there's a solution.
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.880]   Yeah, but you want a phone.
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.240]   We recommend an Android.
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.000]   No, no.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.560]   I'm just saying that when I talk to people who don't have
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.720]   an iPhone, I say, why don't you have an iPhone?
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:49.960]   And you just had a curiosity.
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:52.360]   They're like, because they want Verizon.
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.560]   And that's the bottom line is they want good.
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.040]   They say, I spent a lot of time on the phone.
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.160]   I care about my calls.
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.240]   I care about all this other stuff.
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.560]   I'm afraid I'll drop calls.
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:01.680]   People like me, you know, I look at dropping calls
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:02.600]   as a feature.
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:04.480]   Well, good news because--
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:05.160]   A feature.
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.240]   Yeah.
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.200]   Good news, baby.
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.040]   Go ahead, Danny.
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:09.360]   That's all I was about to say.
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:12.560]   I've pulled up Mossberg's iPhone 4 review.
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:16.080]   And it was, as I remember it, where he's saying, my test--
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:19.160]   network reception was a mixed bag, next paragraph.
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.080]   Yet in some places where the signal was relatively weak,
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:24.360]   the iPhone 4 showed no bars or fewer bars than a predecessor.
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:25.600]   Here's an interesting line.
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.280]   Apple says that this is a bug it plans to fix
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.920]   and that it has to do with the way the bars are presented,
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.840]   not the actual ability to make a call.
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:33.800]   So they knew this.
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:36.320]   And this is something they were telling Mossberg a week,
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:39.080]   before like at least a few days before the thing was released.
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:39.680]   Wow.
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:42.000]   So it's interesting that this was--
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.520]   if this is the same issue, if part of the company
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:49.000]   is telling some things to the press that other parts of the company
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.360]   are either unaware of or we're not
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:53.080]   telling to the rest of the public until really they
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.040]   found themselves kind of backed up against the wall here.
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:57.080]   Because this is exactly the line they ended up saying,
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:58.640]   which is, oh, it's a software problem.
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:00.200]   On at least six occasions during my test,
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:02.160]   the new iPhone was either reporting no service or searching
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:04.920]   for a network while the old one held in my other hand.
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.680]   It was showing at least a couple of bars.
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:07.680]   Oh.
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:08.760]   Well, I haven't seen that.
[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:09.920]   That's worse than I thought.
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.160]   I mean, I haven't seen that problem.
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:11.920]   Well, that's consistent.
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:14.920]   That's what I was seeing on day one myself, where I actually
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.120]   had the two side by side.
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:17.960]   I was trying to--
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:21.800]   I would hold the iPhone in my normal left hand
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:25.520]   and I'd see the bars go, beep, down, down, down, down.
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:28.920]   And I'd be holding the iPhone 3 in my other hand,
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:29.720]   check it out.
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.280]   And of course, by the time I didn't understand the problem,
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:35.200]   so I grabbed my cameras, trying to document the problem.
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.680]   And of course, I do that by putting both phones back down
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.040]   on the desk so I can operate cameras.
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:39.560]   It gets better.
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:42.240]   And all the bars would get that up again.
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.800]   Well, I can't remember why we tried it,
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:48.280]   but we tried it the minute we got a phone in studio on Thursday,
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:50.480]   a week ago, Thursday, when the phones came out.
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:54.120]   And we immediately were able to document it.
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:54.560]   But I think--
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:58.680]   I think probably somebody tipped us and said, try this.
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:02.200]   All right, let me chime in here and say that, of course,
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:05.920]   we haven't got the iPhone 4 in Canada yet.
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:12.760]   But my 3GS, I have four networks available to me in Canada,
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:15.680]   all of which I can tether to my laptop.
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.080]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.280]   Well, you can tether now the iPhone 4 OS
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:22.280]   allows you to tether for a fee.
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:24.040]   Oh, there's no fee on ours.
[00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:25.040]   Yeah, shut up.
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:26.240]   Do you have a data limit, though?
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:28.120]   Do you have a data limit?
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:28.680]   Yes.
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:31.760]   Yeah, and we don't have any unlimited data.
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:34.440]   And we pay more per month than you go.
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.520]   I pay $60 a month.
[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:40.760]   And that gets me 500 megabytes, which is--
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:42.760]   the way I use it, that's fine.
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:44.760]   So wait, wait, wait, 500 megabytes?
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:45.840]   Yep.
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:46.240]   I'm sorry.
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.120]   I know, because I was just going to--
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.280]   No, I use that in a week.
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:49.120]   I use that in a--
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.120]   Yeah.
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.120]   Day.
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.560]   No, you don't use that in a day, do you really?
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:55.360]   Not maybe 500, but 200.
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.600]   You use it more in the field than most people.
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.720]   Because if you use Wi-Fi at all, it did.
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:01.880]   My son pointed out, I guess, he figured out
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:04.360]   how to-- he finally set up his measurement to measure a month,
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:07.640]   and he said he goes through about six gigs a month.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:08.120]   Interesting.
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.720]   Let me just check this iPhone, which
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:15.280]   has been in use for what a week and a half.
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:18.320]   25 megabytes, 100, 1 megabytes received.
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:20.280]   So you're using a lot more than I am.
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:21.480]   But I use Wi-Fi a lot.
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:25.920]   I just-- I'm out of the house a lot, or out of the office.
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:26.440]   By the way.
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:27.320]   So I just use it heavily.
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.480]   Battery life on this is much, much better.
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:30.000]   Is it?
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.840]   I found-- well, you don't have one, that's right.
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:32.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:33.000]   Sorry.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   Didn't mean to interrupt that.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:34.880]   It's for rubbing in the salt.
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:36.280]   The salt it burns.
[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.520]   It burns.
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:40.080]   Only half of the panel today have Wi-Fi.
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:40.720]   I'm waiting.
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:43.080]   It should be any day now.
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:45.640]   So the good news from Bloomberg, once again,
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:48.080]   another rumor that this time Verizon is coming.
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:49.840]   For sure in January.
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:50.440]   For sure.
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.400]   It's got to be.
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:54.480]   It couldn't-- it has to happen.
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:57.040]   I believe the rumors that Apple is building--
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:59.720]   has a CDMA version working.
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:01.360]   I think that would just make sense.
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.080]   Apple's the-- they were doing that
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:06.000]   with the PC version of OS X.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.680]   Is the version in Canada GSM?
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:11.680]   There is no CDMA iPhone anywhere in the world.
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.920]   I believe it's GSM.
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:13.760]   Yeah.
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:14.720]   It's with--
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.600]   Well, all four of our things.
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:19.760]   Now, they had-- tell us started out with the CDMA network,
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:21.760]   but I believe they've added the GSM.
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:24.880]   Oh, so everybody's GSM in Canada now.
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:27.200]   There's still CDMA available on--
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:27.720]   OK.
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:28.240]   --in some areas.
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.240]   It's with the last--
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.480]   US and Mexico or the last.
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:33.080]   No, there's actually more CDMA out there now.
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:35.960]   I mean, I used it in Brazil.
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:39.520]   It's rolling out in some areas of Africa.
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:41.480]   One of the reasons the CDMA is popular
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:44.120]   is because it costs less to distribute it.
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:47.800]   Because each tower covers-- that's why Verizon has better--
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:48.760]   Foot coverage.
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:51.080]   --is because each tower can handle more people
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:53.560]   and cover a larger distance than GSM.
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:27:02.240]   So are people who got the GSM iPhone on AT&T
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:05.400]   going to be sad when this Verizon is a--
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:06.400]   Some people are.
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.840]   Some people are going to be-- they're going to really
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:08.480]   wish they had the price.
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.160]   Should people wait?
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:10.960]   No.
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:12.640]   Because this is another rumor likely we've
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:13.640]   been hearing for a year and a half.
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:15.640]   And we've already decided iPhone users don't care about--
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:16.640]   They don't care about phone calls.
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:17.520]   Oh, good news.
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:20.080]   You don't care about phones.
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.440]   You thought you did.
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:23.320]   Well, that's what I--
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:25.400]   I carry a Nexus 1 for phone calls.
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:26.280]   And I use the iPhone--
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:30.160]   I think it's really care about great phone calls.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.320]   And it's really that important.
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.960]   The reception-- it is always going to be better on Verizon.
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.080]   And it's not going to become--
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.080]   you should really shouldn't--
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:39.960]   the iPhone just isn't the phone for you.
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.120]   It's not just reception.
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:42.320]   It's also coverage.
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.760]   There are places where I would--
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:46.480]   there have been times when I've been testing out
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:48.320]   like a Verizon phone.
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.680]   And lo and behold, I'm in the middle of a highway
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:53.720]   or I'm in the middle of a Vermod or any of these other--
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:56.040]   technologically backwards places.
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:59.040]   And zero bars on AT&T, at least three bars on Verizon.
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:01.840]   So for me, it's more about the coverage map than anything else.
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:03.240]   Gary K. and our chatroom points out,
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:07.000]   there is a good feature to this antenna attenuation issue.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.680]   If you are talking to somebody you don't want to talk to,
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:11.960]   you just hold the phone a certain way.
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:13.520]   Yeah, then you can call back--
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.920]   you can email him later and go, you know, I lost you.
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:17.440]   You know, these iPhone 4s.
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:20.360]   There is a good reason to have an iPhone.
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:24.520]   Because if any time you want, you go, I'm on an iPhone.
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:25.280]   And you're gone.
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:25.800]   Exactly.
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.320]   Yeah, that's actually a good reason.
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.200]   You said to go, that's a set of headphones.
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.640]   It's a good phone.
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:31.600]   And we're going to take a break.
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:34.000]   Ray, I forgot to mention before you joined us
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.120]   that we do a pick of the week.
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.640]   So think about between now and the end of the show,
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.400]   which is about 18 days from now.
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:41.800]   Think about--
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.480]   If they run through the form.
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:45.880]   Yeah, and we'll talk about how much brighter this show is.
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:49.320]   Not smarter, just brighter in a little bit.
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:51.160]   But Ray, we'll give you a chance to do that in a second.
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.880]   Before we do the ladies and gentlemen,
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:57.720]   it's time for me to mention Drobo, D-R-O-B-O. Drobo.
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:00.480]   I can't play my sound effects right now.
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:05.120]   We're still in the rewiring that we're missing that little piece.
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:09.000]   But just imagine, if you will, a lovely Drobo jingle
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.680]   leading into a great Drobo commercial.
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:17.920]   Drobo is the amazing device that allows you
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:22.880]   to store tons of data.
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.120]   Just tons of data.
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:25.120]   There's the original Drobo.
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:28.160]   That's the one I still have backing up my Mac at home.
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.920]   It has four disk bays.
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:33.280]   So it's great for your iTunes library or your photo collection.
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:34.760]   Anything where you got a lot of data.
[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:35.800]   It's got data redundancy.
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:37.920]   So if any of those drives fails--
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:38.640]   I have some Drobo's.
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:39.280]   You pop it out.
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.600]   You have some original Drobo's.
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:41.960]   I have some of the original ones.
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:44.840]   I have the Drobo elite as well.
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:45.320]   OK.
[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:46.520]   Well, we have it at the office.
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:48.360]   We have five iMacs editing from it.
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:49.960]   And then we have the--
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:51.120]   and then I have two at home.
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:53.120]   And those ones like my company stuff
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:54.240]   and the other ones, my personal stuff.
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:57.920]   And what's great is I started off with 500 gig drives.
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:01.320]   And then just slowly-- now they're all two terabyte drives.
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:03.600]   But I just slowly just added them as I needed them.
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.680]   Well, the good news about Drobo is there's
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:08.640]   Drobo for every user.
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:11.280]   You can start with the Drobo, then go to the Drobo S.
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:14.280]   That's a five drive Drobo.
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:15.840]   So that has more storage.
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:16.280]   What is it?
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:17.040]   What is the biggest drive?
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:19.200]   I think they've announced three terabyte drives now.
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:22.600]   So when those come out, you'll be able to get 15 terabytes.
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:24.280]   And the thing is with Drobo, I've also
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:26.320]   been a little bit more adventurous getting the bigger drives,
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:28.320]   knowing that one fails, like just put another one in.
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.320]   Yeah.
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:30.520]   That's another thing I like about it
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:33.600]   is that unlike RAID where the smallest drive
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:38.480]   becomes the size of all the drives, you can mix and match.
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.440]   And it adds them all up.
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:42.840]   It takes about a third quarter to a third of it for redundancy.
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:45.560]   That's why it doesn't lose any data when a drive dies.
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:46.960]   And the rest of it is available to you.
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.040]   It's just amazing.
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:50.560]   You can't get into a situation where you're adding like a drive.
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:52.480]   And if you add another big drive,
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:54.160]   you don't see that much growth because it does
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:55.880]   have to keep track of what that is.
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:57.440]   But it is--
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:59.600]   I just-- when people ask me how do they want to back stuff up
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:01.120]   for their house, I'm just the easiest way.
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:01.800]   Don't think of--
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:04.400]   Now the Drobo Pro has eight bays.
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:06.680]   So that's eight times two 16 terabytes,
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:08.440]   although soon to be 24 terabytes.
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:10.560]   That's the beauty of this is as drive capacities go up.
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:12.120]   So does your Drobo capacity.
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:13.480]   And you have the Drobo elite.
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:14.840]   That's also eight bays.
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:15.680]   But it's a SAN.
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:17.800]   It supports 16 computer connections
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:20.560]   via its dual gigabit ethernet ports.
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:23.160]   So they look like hard drives to the rest of the network.
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:24.480]   That's why your editors can work on it.
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.480]   It's fast enough for multiple people to use.
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:28.080]   I didn't think it was going to work.
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.800]   But it's pretty tough when I was looking at it.
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:30.760]   I don't know if this was going to work.
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:31.920]   I've tested it and it works great.
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:35.640]   The Drobo FS, which is the file system Drobo,
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.760]   I guess that's what the FS stands for.
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:42.920]   Look, you can find out more by going to Drobo.com/MacBreak.
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:45.800]   And you can use the coupon code MacBreakWeek Weekly,

[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:54.360]   If you've got some lying around, as most of us do,
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:55.960]   you don't need to buy the drives.
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:58.200]   You can also buy them with hard drives in them.
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:00.280]   Drobo testimonials is Victor Caiel.
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:03.000]   Talking about Drobo.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.840]   Callie Lewis too, which Drobo is right for you?
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:06.520]   Well, take a look.

[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:19.320]   D-O-P-O Drobo.
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:20.760]   I missed those jingles.
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:21.320]   What happened?
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:22.040]   Oh, because the Drobo--
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:23.720]   Things are gone in the three--
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:24.440]   It's on this thing.
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:26.120]   It's a wiring.
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:27.240]   It's a thing.
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:29.480]   OK, so literally what happened
[00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:33.160]   over the last 24 hours is kind of stunning.
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:35.480]   We tore the whole studio apart.
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:38.360]   We-- Ken and Ted Sheperson, John,
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:40.360]   Slimina, tore the--
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:42.760]   Oh, Kelly, what's Kelly's last name?
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.600]   From allinonetruck.com.
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:45.160]   You ought to know.
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:47.160]   You're the one who looked us up, Alex.
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:47.880]   Kelly's great.
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:50.920]   Kelly is a movie and lighting guy.
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:52.840]   And he drives around in this truck.
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:53.800]   It's kind of amazing.
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:55.800]   It's called All In One Truck.
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:58.680]   It has everything in this one truck.
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:01.080]   If you go to All-In-One Dash.
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:01.960]   The truck is the--
[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:04.040]   It is literally the coolest truck I have ever--
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.480]   It's parked in our driveway right now.
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:07.560]   Yeah, it's the coolest truck I've ever seen.
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:08.760]   It's so amazing.
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:11.080]   It's got a little area for the director
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:13.880]   to sit in the back part of the cab.
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:15.800]   So you can be shooting and you can be watching.
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:16.680]   It's--
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:20.280]   He's got a red camera in it, a 25-foot jib camera.
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:24.600]   Toe, dolly, a bunch of lights.
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:25.960]   This guy's amazing.
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.360]   The whole crew-- anyway, so we love Kelly.
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:30.440]   He came and he did us a great service.
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:33.320]   He way underbid what it should cost to do this.
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:34.920]   And we put in a whole new rig now.
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:36.920]   The rig, the lighting rig, was the first thing we did
[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:40.120]   when we moved into this studio, Colleen Kelly,
[00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:42.040]   set this up for us, you remember?
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:43.240]   We were stuck with the Kelly's.
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:43.720]   We went from--
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:45.640]   We only used Kelly's to do this.
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:46.440]   And--
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:50.520]   But Kelly's replaced the original kind of--
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:52.280]   Wasn't exactly code.
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:53.000]   Gorilla.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.600]   Gorilla lighting rig.
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:56.280]   With what do you call this tubing?
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:57.160]   It's called Speed Rail.
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:58.120]   Speed Rail.
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:58.920]   So this is just--
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:33:59.720]   It's freestanding, though.
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:01.160]   It does not-- because we're in a heritage home.
[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:03.240]   We're in an antique house.
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:04.280]   So that was one of the challenges
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:06.840]   was to build it that in a way that doesn't
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:07.720]   affect the house at all.
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:10.040]   And this is something that is common in Hollywood,
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:11.400]   but it's not something that you--
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:15.160]   And the Speed Rail-- I mean, it was so beautifully done.
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:17.240]   So now all the cameras are suspended from the ceiling.
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:18.680]   There are no more tripods.
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:20.040]   We've got new lights in here.
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:21.640]   You probably noticed if you're watching the video,
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:22.440]   that's a little bit brighter.
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:25.640]   We're still tweaking the lighting.
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:26.520]   But it's a lot more light.
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:28.200]   I mean, it's a lot more light.
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:29.720]   Well, it's interesting, too, because these
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:31.640]   look like they come from Ikea.
[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:34.680]   Well, there's three China balls.
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:35.400]   And the China--
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:37.640]   A China ball is actually a paper lantern.
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:39.400]   It's a paper lantern, and it's $3.
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:40.120]   That's $3.
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:42.200]   And then they have CFLs that are inside of them
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:45.720]   that are, I believe, they're 80 watts that put off--
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:47.240]   50, 100 lumens.
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:50.120]   I think they're the equivalent of either a four or 500 watt
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:50.680]   bulb.
[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:51.160]   So they--
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:52.280]   I mean, like a standard--
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:53.960]   They satisfy the two lighting requirements.
[00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:55.560]   You know, we still have the LED light panels,
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.200]   quite a few of them as highlights and hair lights
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:34:58.840]   and stuff like that.
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:00.520]   But they satisfy the requirement that we
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:02.360]   had for lighting here, which was that it doesn't use a lot
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:04.600]   of power, because this is, again, an antique home.
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:05.480]   But also, it doesn't--
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:06.120]   There's no heat.
[00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:06.360]   Yeah.
[00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:08.200]   And so this is kind of amazing.
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:10.600]   We are in a very bright studio now, all of a sudden.
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:11.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:12.440]   Yeah.
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:14.360]   And when they were doing that, they
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:17.480]   took the opportunity to tear all of the wiring out
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:20.120]   and rewire all the cameras, rewire all the audio and stuff.
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:22.040]   So that's why just-- I can't play jingles right now.
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:25.160]   We're still rewiring some of the audio, the Axia system,
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:27.160]   the Telos put in for us, which is awesome.
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:29.000]   This studio is getting better and better.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.480]   And we keep talking about moving to a bigger studio
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:32.520]   because of TNT and stuff.
[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:33.720]   And I almost don't want it now.
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:35.160]   It's getting nicer and nicer.
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:35.800]   They're like, oh, no.
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:36.920]   He added the speed rail now.
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:37.800]   He's-- I don't want to move.
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:38.600]   He's going to be here for another--
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:39.640]   I want to stay here.
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:42.200]   Not only you have an actual chair.
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.080]   I have a chair.
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:45.480]   Well, we moved the desk forward six inches.
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:49.640]   We couldn't actually put a chair behind the desk,
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:51.880]   because it was too tight.
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:54.040]   So we moved it forward six inches.
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:54.840]   And now it's chair--
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:56.440]   And it still feels like there's more room.
[00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:58.040]   It still feels like there's more room because--
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:00.360]   The cameras are all suspended from the grid now.
[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:02.360]   Anyway, nobody cares about this, but I just--
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:04.200]   That's the long way around of explaining.
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:05.240]   It's cool.
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:06.600]   Yeah, if you ever come to visit--
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:08.280]   We do have visitors come to the studio all the time.
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:10.760]   In fact, Tony Schutz is in here from Champaign, Illinois.
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:12.200]   I need to shoot a new QuickTime VR.
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:16.680]   And Glenn Cardi, who's visiting from outside of Tokyo,
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:17.560]   he grew up in Napa.
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:21.240]   But he lives in Kawaguchi.
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:22.280]   Wow, that's neat.
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:23.160]   Nice to see you both.
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:25.480]   So we stuck them in the corner.
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:30.040]   And Tony, by the way, is Tef Man in the IRC-T-E-F-M-A-N.
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:32.680]   So it's nice to have you both in studio.
[00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:35.160]   We have more room now for guests.
[00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:39.160]   Moving right along to item number two.
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:44.600]   We're only an hour into the show on our second item now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:50.920]   Consumer report says iPhones supposed signal woes aren't unique
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:52.440]   and may not be serious.
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:57.160]   This-- John Gruber says-- and I think he's right-- that the consensus now is that,
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:02.840]   yes, there's a problem with this antenna thing, but the iPhone still has a better
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:07.800]   reception than it has in the past and nobody should worry too much about it.
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:08.600]   That's absolutely true.
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:12.920]   In my testing, for five days, I had both of the old phone and the new phone.
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:16.280]   The old phone is my real carry-around phone.
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:20.920]   So every time I was using my own phone, I noticed that I didn't have the full five bars.
[00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:24.680]   I'd always take out the iPhone and every single time I'd have more bars
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:26.760]   on the iPhone 4 than on the iPhone 3GS.
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:30.040]   That's just half the story.
[00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:35.800]   Every single radio inside this device is better than the 3GS from the data speeds,
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:38.040]   all the way down to the Wi-Fi, all the way down to the GPS.
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:42.920]   So that's such a-- the bad reception is a very real problem,
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:44.840]   but it's only one part of the whole story.
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:46.360]   There's also other issues.
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:51.160]   There's a proximity sensor issue which is intermittent for me.
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:54.760]   That's the thing where you hold it up to your face and it's supposed to blank the screen.
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:59.160]   But I noticed this in day one that I was accidentally triggering touch tones or muting the call
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:02.840]   while I was talking on it because of course I have sculpted cheekbones.
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:07.400]   Maybe it's just me, maybe it's because of my model appearance, but
[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:10.280]   no, I actually have a face like a potato.
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:11.880]   However, it's still enough to--
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:14.040]   Maybe those implants are very high capacitance.
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:17.720]   I might be-- I should have gotten maybe the plastic ones instead of the Botox.
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:18.680]   It's actually the Botox?
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.440]   It's really the problem.
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:23.480]   But that's a known problem people have talked about.
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:24.760]   Maybe it's an easy thing to fix.
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:26.440]   I don't know if it's a hardware or software issue.
[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:33.480]   Apparently there's a software problem with FaceTime and blank screen, FaceTime issues.
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:36.440]   So there are a few bugs in this iPhone 4.
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:37.400]   Let me ask the panel.
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:39.640]   Now only two of us have iPhones.
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:43.160]   So maybe this isn't the time to do it.
[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:46.040]   I'll ask Andy, would you recommend an iPhone 4?
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:51.800]   Definitely, because when you look at all the different pluses of the iPhone 4,
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:55.720]   they really outweighs the few negatives that there are.
[00:38:55.720 --> 00:39:00.360]   That said, I don't think that anybody should be in a particular rush to get one,
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:05.800]   because even if it were a perfect product at release, some people need to be reminded
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:07.960]   that they're making more than 30 of these.
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:11.160]   So if you want to buy one six months from now, they'll probably have.
[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.360]   They can probably help you out with that.
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:12.920]   They'll have a chance.
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:20.280]   There's a basic principle that I always talk about whenever Apple does a radical new way of
[00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:22.040]   designing something or building something.
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:25.240]   It is a radical new way of putting together a phone.
[00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:31.080]   And I don't think that anybody really knows what the problems are with this design until they put
[00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:32.040]   a million of them out there.
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:38.360]   If you, it's the difference between buying a Toyota model that's been out for six or seven years
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:43.160]   and buying the brand new product line, they've been building these things for years and years
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:43.640]   and years.
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:46.280]   They know where the wiring harnesses should go.
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:50.280]   They know which steps they should take an extra four minutes on when they're assembling it
[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:52.120]   to make sure that something is checked properly.
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:56.760]   They know which glue needs to dry a little bit longer than this other sort of adhesive.
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:59.080]   It takes a while before they can figure out those things.
[00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:02.040]   It takes millions and millions and millions of these before they figure it out.
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:04.840]   So anytime Apple comes out with a radical new design,
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:09.480]   my general advice is to hang back, wait for the revision B if it's going to come
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:13.800]   for a few months and just see what comes out three or four months from now.
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:17.240]   That said, I mean, I have an order for my own iPhone 4.
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:22.440]   If it were possible for me to simply temporarily put my SIM in one of these
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:25.000]   loaner phones and use that for a few months, I would do that.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.520]   But the fact that the iPhone 4 brings so many extra advantages to me, especially
[00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:34.120]   advantages that I personally really, really resonate with,
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:38.440]   like that really, really improved new camera, that means that, you know what,
[00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:42.520]   I don't think there's any show stopping problems for me or nothing that won't be fixed with a
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:45.640]   firmware update in the future. So my order still stands and mine's coming in next week.
[00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:49.800]   All right. Ray, I won't. I mean, you're going to buy one, I presume, when the one's available.
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:53.560]   The camera part is the part that really interests me because
[00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:59.080]   great camera. Yeah, from everything that I'm hearing, the camera is great.
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:04.040]   And I would, I mean, I really don't use the camera in this 3GS because I'm too fuzzy.
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:09.960]   Yeah. I mean, you're a 5D shooter. You may not, you and, and, and, and
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:14.760]   leafbacks and stuff. You, you really a high end shooter. So you may not still like this,
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:18.040]   but I have to say it's as good as a five megapixel point and shoot.
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:20.920]   I think I'm just, do you wouldn't say that, Andy?
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:27.080]   I think it's the, I think it's the best phone camera that has not been designed specifically
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:32.520]   to be a kick butt camera. There are no key differences, has made a couple of cameras that were really,
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:36.520]   they start off with a big, thick lens, and then they build a phone around it. I don't think anything
[00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:41.000]   can really compare with that kind of a build quality. It does have a few, it does have a few
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.600]   problems. It has, it's having some problems with white balance, as far as I can tell.
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:48.600]   It also has the flash. I don't think it's quite as powerful as it should be.
[00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:53.800]   No, it's a single LED. Yeah. I mean, I've been, the Droid X has twin LEDs.
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:58.440]   That makes me do this. It light up the room. Yeah. I've been taking, I actually did a five way
[00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:07.880]   side by camera phones, plus my Nikon P6000 like pocket cameras control group. Those are going to
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:13.560]   be posted on my blog and on Flickr later this week. The iPhone 4 was clearly the winner for so
[00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:17.880]   many reasons, not the least of which was the fact that I think they have the best software
[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:21.800]   for controlling the camera. It's fast to an un-lotta lag time. You can take pictures,
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:25.880]   that you can take shots in sequence with it very, very easily. I think you could really do like
[00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:31.880]   a three or four sequence shot very, very easily with it. So I'm really, really pleased with it.
[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:36.680]   I really do think it's the best camera phone out there, again, taking out the ones that have like
[00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:42.040]   the $8,000 lenses in them. But I don't think it'll, you're still in the situation where,
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:44.600]   if you're in a situation where you think you're going to want to take pictures,
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:47.000]   you're going to want to take a real pocket camera with you.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.760]   Yeah, I guess you're right. I shouldn't have said it's as good as a pocket camera. But the nice thing
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:57.240]   is you have it. It's fantastic. My standard test shot is of Bates Hall at Boston Public Library,
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:05.240]   just this gorgeous cavernous room built in the 1890s. It's a study area with deep, rich wood,
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:09.400]   oak tables going all the way off into infinity with marble on the sides.
[00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:14.840]   You want to test a low light, you want to test a detail, you want to test a color,
[00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:20.040]   that's the best test you can possibly find. And boy, that picture I took with the iPhone 4 is
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:25.080]   almost good enough to say it's as good as any of the camera that I've ever tried with it.
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:30.920]   It's just fantastic. And I think I really believe in the concept of the best camera is the camera
[00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:35.720]   that you have with you. And I think that there are many times when I find that I'm taking these,
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:39.640]   what turned out to be great photos, photos that are happy to capture the moment that I'm in.
[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:44.440]   Because I'm not carrying around. This shot was a few inches away from that rose. It's almost a
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:50.120]   macro capability. It almost has macro capability. You can get the focus length on it. I haven't
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:55.400]   done official tests on it. It's quite good. So Ray, that's one of the things that's going to
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:44:02.440]   sell you on this. Yeah, I want to have a look at the camera when it comes out. But like I say,
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:11.080]   I shoot 99% of my stuff with a 5D Mark II. So yeah, you know, I think it's a good, it's nice for a phone.
[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:16.280]   I guess we could agree on that. Ray, as a serious shooter, are you happy with the
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:22.840]   iPhone's just one button sort of interface? Just a camera app works, even though the 3GS.
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:31.080]   Yeah, on the 3GS, I'm not wild about the pictures that come out of it. I have shot a few.
[00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:39.080]   And everyone is just a snapshot record shot that, you know, I'm the only place I'm happy to put it
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:46.360]   up is on the web in a kind of three by five inch maximum. It falls apart too much. And
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:52.120]   it isn't the fastest thing to work with compared to a live DSLR.
[00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:57.000]   I mean, if there's one thing that I wish that Apple could steal from the Android cameras,
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:03.800]   the Android software is just terrible. But I wish I had more manual controls. If you want to
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:08.280]   overexpose by one stop, you can tap a button and tap overexpose by one stop. If you want to set
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:14.760]   manual white balance, you can set manual white balance. I really wish that the next iteration
[00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:21.000]   of the software had a little like a page curl or a little revolving button where we just simply
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:27.080]   flip the entire screen around to reveal a set of like SLR type little icons so that if I want to
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:31.800]   have really precise manual control, I can do it. Yeah, all you can do right now is just touch the
[00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:35.880]   screen and expose. And that's good because you can select focus, you can select an exposure point.
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:40.280]   But every single time that the iPhone 4 screwed up a shot, it would have been a
[00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:45.880]   simplest thing in the world to simply say, Oh, I need to set this to tungsten white balance.
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:50.040]   And that would fix it immediately. But there's just no solution for it with the iPhone 4's built
[00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:57.720]   in camera app. So Ray, you're going to get one. Well, we'll see. I'm going to try one out.
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:03.080]   Let's put it that way. Andy is already getting one in you. Alex have ordered one.
[00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:08.600]   I'm going to buy. I think I'm going to buy four or five. I'm getting I'm getting I'm upgrading my
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:12.360]   kids. It was $18 to upgrade them for their, you know, they already have iPhones. So I'm going to
[00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:16.760]   upgrade my kids iPhones and my wife's iPhones. That's actually maybe a better question is not
[00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:21.560]   would you buy one? But what would you upgrade a 3G s to this? Is it is it enough of an improvement?
[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:27.400]   My kids have 3G's 3G. I can see I'm moving them all up to the I'm going to move them to the
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:34.120]   4 because I want to use FaceTime with them. And that's my big regret is it because I don't have
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:38.840]   a family of not that they'd ever want to talk to me, but the family that have a FaceTime.
[00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:45.000]   That's such a big deal. But one of my neighbors, I was driving, I was driving past and I saw like,
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:52.920]   I saw the I saw one of my neighbors like chasing her little kid with a MacBook and like play and
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:57.640]   the kid was also playing with a father and I pulled over like as what was going on. It's like the
[00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:01.400]   second time he's walking and now he's like, I've got eye chat with his grandparents.
[00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:07.480]   She's like mad. Literally, I was like, you know what, I have two loner phones from Apple. I was
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:12.200]   so adorable. I wanted to give him give her one of mine and have her send the other one to the
[00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:16.120]   grandparents because that is an Apple. That's a face. And we're getting them for the grandparents
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:19.720]   specifically for FaceTime just because we've got little kids and you know, grandparents want to
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:25.160]   see him. That's a good point. I hope my mom's not watching. I see I can say that kind of stuff
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:29.000]   because I know that my grandparents are my parents and parents in law are not watching. So I can
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.320]   say we're getting the iPhone. Oh yeah, they're all gonna have iPads, iPhones, laptops, everything.
[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:37.160]   By the way, Macworld Magazine is reporting and I'm going to try it right now on my phone that the
[00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:42.040]   proximity sensor that Apple's Apple care is telling people with proximity sensor issues
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:49.480]   that they just if they reset their network settings that that fixes it. So I'm going to go to the
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:53.800]   settings reset. Don't reset the whole thing. You don't want to erase the phone erase all
[00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:58.280]   contents. All these just reset network settings. That's all you have to do. And then they say that
[00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:04.200]   that's sufficient. I'm going to hide my password here. That's sufficient to fix the proximity.
[00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:10.680]   We'll see sensor issue, which does indicate that would be a software issue.
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:18.120]   Has anyone had a bug with their iPads related to when you're watching a movie? And this is
[00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:22.600]   I mean a movie that you bought from the iTunes store or whatever on your iPad that it suddenly
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:27.080]   becomes unresponsive. You know, wow, the movie's playing. You can't get to the time control.
[00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:32.520]   It's hers. Because I'm running into it every single movie that I get from iTunes. Now, if I
[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:36.920]   if I have my own movie or whatever else I put on, it's it's fine. It's totally responsive. But if I
[00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:42.520]   get it from if I get a DRM movie from what if it's checking the DR, I don't know what it's doing,
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:46.600]   but it like it will not let me get you. So I literally have to quit out and then come back
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:50.680]   in to get it. And by the way, I've decided I've given up on movies on iTunes and iPad.
[00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:57.880]   Really? I'm done. So angry. What? I downloaded a bunch of movies. So my family, we were on vacation
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:01.480]   last week in Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and I figured we would watch a couple movies
[00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:05.800]   at the house. And I downloaded them on my iPad, figured I could plug them into the TV and we can
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:12.440]   all watch them together. Yeah. No, no, you can't. You have to if you plug your your iPad and take
[00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:17.960]   the movie that you paid for and put it on your TV, you know, you can't do it because it's not an
[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:21.160]   approved device. But if you rip it, it works fine.
[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:28.920]   Not Apple, the NBA, just a bunch of idiots. I mean, you know, they don't they don't allow
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:32.680]   because of VJs and analog connector. They won't allow that signal to go through HDMI
[00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:37.720]   or rather to go out. It is. And yeah, that was that was the when I was reviewing the iPad,
[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:41.640]   that was my major whiskey tango Fox wrap moment for the entire thing. It was literally,
[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:45.400]   you know, it's you have that like sort of Tyra Banks moment where you're like,
[00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:49.880]   I'm not seeing what I'm seeing because if I'm seeing what I'm seeing right now,
[00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:54.920]   if you've decided that I can't use the movie that I just bought and paid for on this HD TV
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:58.680]   with all on this device, I just paid an extra 30 bucks for you're not telling me you're not
[00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:02.680]   going to allow me to do that. Are you? It's just insane. It is. And the thing is, is now,
[00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:05.800]   I'm just, you know, people ask me, you know, how do you get the movies on there? I'm like,
[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:10.680]   you rip them because it's not even worth buying them. You guys, you know, the movie
[00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:15.880]   companies need to get their ass out of that dark area that it's stuck in, you know, and
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:21.080]   and start realizing that people are paying for it. They're paying for it. So you should let them,
[00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:26.200]   you know, plug their iPad in. What, what is wrong with these people? Maybe they spend too much time
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:33.240]   waiting in a iPhone line. I wish I knew how long we've been waiting. The iPhone has an app for
[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:40.600]   that. They're an app for kissing my shiny metal ass. Several. This is future. I'm a,
[00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:48.120]   the iPhone. Oh no, the life. I guess I'm off the hill. That's the store, professor. You all.
[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:55.960]   iPhones felt E. Y. E.
[00:50:55.960 --> 00:51:02.040]   Well, it's that obscure underground song that's constantly playing everywhere.
[00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:10.600]   Hello, dearies. Welcome to the Bond store. The new iPhones are in short supply. So please form an
[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:16.840]   orderly world. Are there any left? There may be one.
[00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:26.040]   Okay. There's a $500. You have no choice of carrier. The battery can't hold a charge and the
[00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:31.880]   reception isn't very shut up and take my money. The new iPhone is wonderful. I use it to check
[00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:36.840]   recipes and send threatening emails to unauthorized third party app developers.
[00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:43.160]   Well, that was a future. I'm at the debut episode for this new season. And actually,
[00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:47.480]   you got to go see the whole thing. Well, was it true that that scene was actually cut? It
[00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:53.160]   aired once and then seriously disappeared? I don't know because it is. I can imagine Apple might have
[00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:58.520]   some problem with the word iPhone in there, even though it's spelled E. Y. E. It seems like that
[00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:04.360]   would be that would fit into the satire. That's why the clause really that's that's our defense
[00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:09.640]   for running it, by the way. Right. We're covering it. It's journalism. It's journalism. It's the
[00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:15.640]   news. It's in the news. I don't know. That's interesting. If it didn't look. I'm looking up now.
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:19.800]   I remember seeing I remember something about that. Third episode, I should say, not the debut
[00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:25.800]   episode, the third episode. And I'm not going to play. I played on Twit, the best by a guy who's
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:32.040]   losing his apparently losing his job for making the you've seen that the Evo versus iPhone video.
[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:36.600]   Yeah. If you didn't watch Twit, we bleeped it there. I don't want to put the others through the
[00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:44.440]   hell that I put them through with. According to MacLife, notices that the clip of that same episode
[00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:49.960]   on Comedy Central dot com, entitled Fry and Leelis humiliation differs from the broadcast in the
[00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:54.600]   last few seconds in which a set of zombies are shambling into the mom core store to a voice over
[00:52:54.600 --> 00:53:00.360]   of introducing the all new iPhone 2.0 to which the crowds cheer with the festivals of money.
[00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:06.200]   Katamom who then says dumb bastards. Oh, yeah, we didn't that was the clip I ran the Comedy Central
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:09.960]   clip. It does not have that. Right. So I guess you're right. They cut it a little bit.
[00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:14.920]   Oh, maybe it was the blue language, a Comedy Central, you know, they don't approve of that
[00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:18.760]   working blue. No. They want people to get by on their materials, not on.
[00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:25.560]   Oh, exactly. Exactly. All right. Moving along, we're going to come back. We will stop all this
[00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:30.360]   iPhone nonsense. I think we've covered it. Oh, I didn't ask you any upgrade from the 3GS to an
[00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:36.840]   iPhone 4, you think? I think so. The differences between the old one and the new one are that big
[00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:42.120]   and that significant, I think, to make it worthwhile. It would depend, though, like how far you are
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:47.400]   into your contract. I mean, if you think that if you look at the list of features in the iPhone 4
[00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:51.720]   and you don't think that you are going to desperately need these for the next few months,
[00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:55.800]   I would hold off until the next three or four months for not only for the reasons that I already
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:54:04.040]   stated, but Verizon, it's, David Mamet is going to definitely direct the introduction video for
[00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:08.840]   Verizon iPhone because it's been a waiting for Godot sort of sequence for the past two or three
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:14.280]   years. But I think that anybody who buys an iPhone and then two months later, Verizon comes out with
[00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:19.400]   Mon, it's not necessarily you're going to want to get the Verizon version of it, but you're at least
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:24.520]   going to wonder, "Gee, you know, I wish I had that extra option." I travel enough internationally
[00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:28.760]   that I actually want the GSM version instead of the CDMA version. Right. That's a very important
[00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:33.000]   point. The other point is that the CDMA version will not allow you to do data while you're on a
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:39.320]   phone call. That's something only GSM can do. And GSM is easy. You can use Verizon phones
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:45.640]   internationally, but not nearly as widely as you can if it's a GSM model. So those are important
[00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:49.560]   points. I probably, because I travel, I would probably stick with the AT&T version because,
[00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:55.480]   like Alex, I don't make phone calls with this thing. Well, the text messaging is very important to me.
[00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:59.960]   The funny thing is, is that it's so expensive that you go overseas though, and the problem you get
[00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:03.240]   into is just how expensive is it going to be to make that phone call? Now remember, you're going to
[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:08.360]   get iOS 4 on your 3GS. So it's not like you don't have multitasking for that. Man, that screen.
[00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:13.960]   I know the screen. And the FaceTime? No, I think FaceTime is an absolute gimmick that no one will use,
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:19.000]   except you and your family. Yeah, exactly. Make sure you mark that clip for editing later on.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:24.120]   Yeah. Please do. I stand by this. I stand by this. I think FaceTime, we're going to look back in a
[00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:28.840]   year and say, yeah, that was the one thing on the iPhone 4 nobody used. Really? Yep. Okay. I'll stand
[00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:35.800]   by it here. Let me say it here. Let me say it like this. Note the date, July 6th, 2010.
[00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:40.760]   1225. FaceTime is a stupid gimmick that no one will end up using.
[00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:45.880]   There I said it. Yeah. Now I would point out that there's a
[00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:53.240]   phase problem in other countries. You see, you're asking me if I will upgrade. One of the problems
[00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:59.320]   with me upgrading right away, even when it appears in Canada, is I've only had the 3GS for about six
[00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:04.920]   months. I had to wait a year to get the 3GS. And I don't know how long I'll have to wait before the
[00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:10.920]   iPhone 4 is available in Canada. I think you're speeding up that cycle though.
[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:14.840]   Yeah, I think you're right because it builds a huge grave, grave of grave market.
[00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:18.440]   That's what happens if you don't do it. The demand is so high. I mean, in Africa, there's
[00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:23.560]   almost no country has it, but everyone has one. Right. You said that way in China for a long time.
[00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:28.920]   All right. We're going to take a break. Come back with more. A great panel, Mr. Ray Maxwell,
[00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:31.000]   erstwhile of Maxwell's house color scientist,
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   rack-onter photographer, Photoshop whiz, is here from Vancouver. We've got Alex Lindsey
[00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:40.760]   sitting in the chair to my left in the brand-new hot light.
[00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:45.160]   See his hair light? We're going to have to brush our hair now when we come in here because our
[00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:50.760]   hair is lit. Used to be we're sitting in murky darkness. Yeah, now we can see that, you know,
[00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:55.560]   I got the whole right. Yeah. We didn't used to be able to see that. I've got another whole hair.
[00:56:55.560 --> 00:57:03.080]   And I look tired. But Anionaco looks fantastic because he's lining himself there in his studio
[00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:11.480]   in New England. Thank you. Thank you, Ikea. That's what we got. China Globes.
[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:16.760]   There you go. It's like a cylindrical China. Andy writes for the Chicago Sun times in his website
[00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:24.280]   is CWOB.com. How much did that set you back? This set me back a good like $23. I like it a lot.
[00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:29.400]   It's perfect. It's exactly what we did in here. Yeah. And if I have carpentry skills,
[00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:34.200]   I still need to set up lighting in here because again, I don't need I don't look quite so
[00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:37.560]   like fresh-faced as I was back when I was a lad and started doing the show two years ago.
[00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:45.320]   Look at my nose. It's getting bigger. And it's definitely I've given up long ago. So it's not
[00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:50.600]   really not really this show brought to you by squarespace.com, the place where great websites

[00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:41.320]   Let's see. Oh, you know, this is an interesting story and I'd like to get your take on this.
[00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:50.040]   There was a Steve Jobs email exchange in which at the end Steve Jobs says, calm down, retire.
[00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:59.560]   It's just a phone. Apple denied it. Then the people, was it Boy Genius Report?
[00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:02.120]   I think it was Boy Genius Report. The people who published originally said, no, no,
[01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:05.960]   it's true. It definitely came from Steve Jobs. We can prove it,
[01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:11.160]   except for the last line retire. It's just a phone that we added that accidentally.
[01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:19.320]   So they added that accidentally at the end. In an editing error somehow, it got added.
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:24.520]   See, this is this gets a whole journalistic blog thing that gets them in trouble.
[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:28.520]   Yeah, we were off the hook here because we just report what they say.
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:31.480]   So we don't have to take any responsibility for actually journalism or anything.
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:38.760]   Exactly. So Apple says it's a fake. Boy Genius says it's not a fake.
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:45.720]   It's very confusing. I don't know what the gist of it is. It didn't feel real. I have to say
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:52.440]   when I read it, Steve was much more engaged than he would normally be. It felt like something made up.
[01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:57.720]   So absent any more information, I'm going to say I think it was a fake too.
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:00.440]   Did you read it, Andy? Do you have anything?
[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:04.920]   I read the exchange. It didn't feel like a typical Steve Jobs exchange.
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:11.400]   You look at the, just like when you're trying to develop the provenance of an artist,
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:15.080]   is this a real Picasso or not? You look at the artist's previous works,
[01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:21.320]   and the artist who has done previous exchanges like this has given you maybe one follow up and
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:29.000]   that's it. And he has never been this wordy. So I think that whoever it is, who was trying to get,
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.400]   they were get some plate for this conversation.
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:33.560]   Apparently shopping it. They shopped it around.
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:37.720]   Saying there's that too. I think I think the burden proof is on him to not simply
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:42.360]   not simply say it, but also, well, you got to prove that this was coming from where you saying
[01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:46.040]   it's coming from. Boy, Genius reports said we looked at the headers, we're satisfied.
[01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:51.320]   They couldn't be easily faked, but the guy sold it to Gmail.com.
[01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:56.280]   What else are you going to ask for? The guy who sold it, apparently gave them access to his
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:02:02.440]   Gmail account so they could see the headers directly themselves. And I don't know. I don't know.
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:06.760]   I just, we report you decide. It's good enough for Fox. It's good enough for me.
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:12.280]   [laughter]
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:16.360]   We were, I'm trying to think, did we talk last week about the Hulu Plus coming to the iPad?
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:21.080]   I think we, I think we just, it's just released, but it's in private beta. Has anybody gotten the
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:25.160]   invitation I ask? Yeah, I have it. I have had it for about a week.
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:32.040]   God damn you. And it works. It works well. It's going to be $10 a month.
[01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:38.520]   He says, it delivers what they say it delivers, which is you get the Hulu content on your iPad
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:44.040]   and your iPhone. And it works just fine. Even over 3G networks. I watched three different,
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:49.480]   I'm watching TV episodes and even, even when I turn off the Wi-Fi and just watch it over 3G,
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:55.080]   it's, I get mostly HD presentations. Sometimes it does drop down into SD.
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:03:00.120]   The first day I had a couple technical glitches with it, but that seemed to have been ironed out
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:04.600]   over the days after that. It just, I think it's just down to a question of, is this a really
[01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:09.960]   practical thing? And that's something that only you yourself, each individual person can answer.
[01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:14.760]   For me, the problem is that half hour episode of that comedy that took about 25 minutes to
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:21.480]   spool out was 150 megabytes of trans, the data transfer. And if you're stuck to gigabyte cap,
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:27.000]   that's a problem. The bigger problem is the ads. And it's kind of, you're kind of okay with the
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.560]   idea of paying for ads on cable because you're getting like a jillion channels for 40 bucks.
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:37.400]   And it's on 24 hours a day. When you're paying 10 bucks a month, and there's still commercial
[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:43.480]   breaks and worse, not only the very first show that I watched, the first commercial break,
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:48.760]   not bad enough, it was a, it was an ad for Sex and the City too. That's bad enough.
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:55.320]   But there was also an electronic ad pop up overlay for Lipton iced tea on top of the ad.
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:59.400]   Oh, no, no, no. And so I felt like, okay, so you're going to be sending it. If I were paying
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:03.880]   subscriber, you're going to be sending me now a check for 83 cents, because I feel as though I
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:12.200]   need to be paid to watch all that stuff. So if you're that addicted to Hulu content, it's fine.
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:17.960]   Otherwise, I'm not sure where this is going. The good news is that Hulu free will continue to be
[01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:22.840]   a free service the way that they, that Hulu explained it to me. And I had to really
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:26.360]   fine tune this question three times because I kept answering it. And I wasn't sure that they
[01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:32.600]   understood the question. They seem to be telling me that the same Hulu free service that you're
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:37.480]   using right now will still be available to you for free, that this is a paid service that will
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:42.920]   extend the reach of Hulu onto other devices, whether that is really the case or not. Again,
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:46.600]   I'm not 100% convinced he really understood exactly the question that I was answering,
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:51.400]   asking. But for now, I believe that if you're watching new episodes of house every week for
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:55.400]   free via your web browser on your desktop or your notebook, that you'll still be able to do that
[01:04:55.400 --> 01:05:00.120]   a year from now. Something a little more serious happened this week. I remember I think it was
[01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:05.000]   I was doing the radio show and the number of people in the chat room said, my iTunes was hacked.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:12.600]   And apparently, according to Mashable, a number of Apple IDs were hacked. And people who lost
[01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:21.800]   their account lost hundreds of dollars worth of apps in the app store. Some are saying it's not
[01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:27.080]   as widespread as it reported. We don't really know. We just know that this was happening. And
[01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:32.200]   we saw it on Twitter. People were talking about it on Twitter. I noticed a lot of funkiness with
[01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:38.120]   my with my account last week, which is that it was suddenly I had to log in like every time it did
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:43.160]   something new. It's suddenly a tightened up somewhere. And I there was something wrong, but I couldn't
[01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:47.640]   figure out what it was. I don't think anyone's hacked it. Yeah, I don't know what the story is
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:55.560]   on this. If there was if there was a larger issue with iTunes security or if just an unusual number
[01:05:55.560 --> 01:06:00.920]   of people, you know, maybe somebody was trying to guess passwords in a broader net.
[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:07.320]   Apple said Tuesday that it removed a seller from its online application store after discovering
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:13.000]   a ha that he gained the store's sales ranking system
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:19.640]   to appear as though his ebooks accounted for 42 of the site's top 50 electronic books.
[01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:23.160]   Well done. That's all I got to say. Whatever he did. That was good.
[01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:30.520]   Not subtle. His apps removed from the app store for violating license. Okay. This is not the
[01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:34.040]   this is not the same hack attack I was talking about.
[01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:41.960]   There's a note I can interject here with regard to iBooks. And that is I have my iPad here in
[01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:47.000]   Canada. I had to wait for that, but I have it. Love it. Read books all the time. Yeah,
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:55.240]   mostly from Amazon. However, the iBooks store in Canada has nothing but the free books, you know,
[01:06:55.240 --> 01:07:03.320]   the old classics and so forth. We have no, you know, current selling New York Times list
[01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:05.960]   iBooks yet. Darn it. Get with it, Apple.
[01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:13.800]   So the the hack, I guess the story I just read is related in the sense that Apple used that
[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:17.960]   as an opportunity to tell people to change your passwords probably in response to these other
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:22.360]   issues. They said we don't believe any information developers don't get any information that they
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:29.000]   could use to get your account information. So even if you downloaded this guy's malicious app,
[01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:33.480]   he wouldn't that wouldn't get but they said but just in case change your password.
[01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:39.720]   Yeah, I mean, definitely if you go into iTunes, if you go into the the store homepage and to your
[01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:44.360]   iTunes, you can also check to see if there have been any recent purchases. Sometimes it takes a
[01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:49.240]   few days for purchases to actually be applied to your account. So and look, just be on the
[01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:54.600]   lookout for any suspicious activity. Definitely something weird is going on. And you definitely
[01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:58.520]   need to start taking a look. I wouldn't go so far as to say that you should definitely
[01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:02.440]   disassociate your current credit cards from your account or even change your password just
[01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:06.920]   yet. Unless unless you haven't changed in a while, in which case you should always be rotating
[01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:09.960]   your password. Isn't that it's hard to do that. Isn't the general security rules that
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:13.800]   passwords are like underwear and they they're the best way to change changed often. Often.
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:21.240]   Not daily. It does. But it does cast some line on one of the we will often like sort of made
[01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:26.120]   jokes about the presence of some of these really weird like $100 and $500 and $1000
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:31.800]   iPhone and iPad apps. And you think, Oh geez, who's going to spend $500 on a flashlight app?
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:38.120]   Now you start to wonder, maybe this is part of a larger plan that we're going to that step step
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:43.880]   one is to get a whole bunch of $500, $1000 really, really expensive apps out there so that when you do
[01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:48.600]   exploit this second hack, you're not just taking people for 99 cents or dollar 99, you're going to
[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:55.720]   get them for 500 bucks in one shot. I books is available in Canada now, right? Did you know that?
[01:08:56.520 --> 01:09:00.760]   Well, it's the iBooks is available, but it doesn't have anything but the
[01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:06.920]   classics on it, the free books, there's no New York Times bestseller list or anything.
[01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:10.040]   They're saying they just told me in the chatroom that they've updated it. So you might want to check.
[01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:13.880]   I don't know. Well, I'll check it while we're talking. Check while we're talking to see if it
[01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:19.160]   was just recently. I do find that the iBooks is way behind. I'm still buying a lot of stuff for
[01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:24.200]   the Kindle app on my iPad because there's just a lot of the books that I'm interested in
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:26.520]   are not available in the iBook store. Right.
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:32.520]   Well, and as Ray said, you still can use a Kindle. You can still go to Amazon.
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:36.200]   Well, you still use a Kindle app. Yeah, and I prefer that too. Yeah, I mean, it's just
[01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:43.240]   there was a recent study by Jacob Nielsen who says you read 10% slower on an iPad or a Kindle
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:49.480]   than you do in a real book. To make any sense. I don't really really. I don't really want you
[01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:54.120]   to be really slow. Well, I was keeping distracted by Twitter maybe. That's why.
[01:09:54.120 --> 01:10:02.200]   Okay, I stand corrected. There are new books. Yay. New books are now available. You can get a
[01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:07.480]   clip finally. Yeah. Yeah. So you're waiting for that, weren't you? I know that Ray was like,
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:10.680]   where when is a clip's going to come out? I got to read it. I got to see what the difference in
[01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:19.400]   the movie is. Right. I stand corrected. Good news are available. And that's wonderful.
[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:26.360]   I've been looking forward to it. I checked within the last weeks, but it's fairly recent.
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:30.840]   The chatroom credit to the chatroom. They just told me it was just recently updated. Just now.
[01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:36.200]   Oh, okay. That's that's why we have them. That's why we've got them there. Keep us on our toes.
[01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:42.680]   Tapulous. Here's a here's a nice story. I love stories like this. Tapulous,
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:50.280]   which is the company that did the free Tap Tap revolution app on the iPhone. It was hugely
[01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:58.760]   successful. They gave it away. They've just been acquired by Disney. Nice job. Tapulous had raised
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:06.280]   1.8 million from angel investors, including Mark Benioff and Andy Bechtelstein. Bechtelstein.
[01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:16.040]   Tap Tap revenge. That's the one that was the big free game. And then Tap Tap radiation for the iPad.
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:22.280]   So Disney Interactive Studios. I'm just looking to see if there's a price for it. They don't say
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:29.160]   how much they got, but I can bet they got that was a that's a nice success story. Yeah. For a company
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:35.160]   that did some really nice stuff early on for the iPhone. We're gonna take a break. Any other
[01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:40.200]   stories before we go that you think are hot? Let me ask the chatroom. Tap Tap revolution was a
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:46.440]   was that it was it ever on the iPhone or was that a game? Why do I why did that come to my mind?
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:53.480]   I don't know. Cat cat revenge revenge is the one on the iPhone, right? Yeah. Yeah.
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:59.880]   All right, we're gonna take a break. Come back with more. We'll talk a little bit about audible.com
[01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:03.800]   as we get ready for our picks of the week. I always like to start our picks with a audio book
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:09.160]   pick from audible.com. If you go to audible.com/macbreak right now, you can get a free book
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:16.600]   by signing up for the audible gold account. That's a book a month, but they don't charge you for
[01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:21.640]   the first month. So that first book is free and incidentally, you can cancel at any time.
[01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:27.640]   So you're not you're not tied in and you get to keep the book. Unlike a lot of other places,
[01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:34.200]   the books in that you've purchased are available forever in your library, which is very, very nice.
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:39.640]   audible.com/macbreak Andy, you got a book you've been listening to lately?
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:45.960]   Yes, absolutely. And this is a really, really good one. One of the one of the coolest espionage
[01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:53.560]   stories of the 20th century was when there the allies were planning, planning like them the
[01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:58.040]   massive DDA invasion, and they're working on ideas of how to produce,
[01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:03.000]   produce disinformation so that we wanted to force the Nazis to sort of make sure that they're
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:08.760]   defending the wrong ports, the wrong areas. And so, and lots of people working on this problem,
[01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:15.080]   but this group of really interesting people in British intelligence came up with this
[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:23.480]   diabolical plan that what they wanted to do was they came up with this idea of dropping a set of
[01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:26.840]   fake plans and fake orders and fake information. I don't remember this.
[01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:30.120]   Exactly. Into their hands. So they would so they would divert their forces.
[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:34.120]   And the way to make sure they would believe it is that they constructed this idea that
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:39.080]   this this false story in which there was an air disaster. And one of the people who died in that
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:43.880]   air disaster was actually a top, a courier carrying top secret high command orders.
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:49.080]   And the idea was that if they drop the body from a submarine in the right currents will probably hit
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:54.520]   not hit Nazi controlled areas. And then the key is that they couldn't just put like these papers.
[01:13:54.520 --> 01:14:00.600]   Oh, by the way, we're totally not invading here. So boy, make sure you don't mother don't send
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:04.120]   if you're gonna send me cookies, don't send me here to Sicily because we're because we're
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:09.080]   definitely going to be be attacking Greece first. And that's where we're going. And so they realized
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:14.200]   that that would be seen through in like about 10 seconds. So they develop so they've developed
[01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:21.880]   this huge literary story behind this guy. They basically had to find someone who had died
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:26.440]   of pneumonia. So as long as would naturally be filled with fluids would look like he drowned at
[01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:30.760]   sea. But so they found that they found a fresh body that they could use for this. But they also
[01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:35.880]   had to develop a detailed backstory where they had to make sure that his uniform was absolutely
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:38.920]   perfect all the way down to the underwear. Not only that, but they had to make sure that they
[01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:44.120]   went to the store where those uniforms were sold and make sure there was a customer record
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:49.160]   for this fake guy. They filled their wallet with theater tickets, letters from home,
[01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:55.000]   nature that all the letters had like ink smudges on them as if it would be handled step by step by
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:01.080]   step. It became the most stunningly successful and important piece of fan fiction ever created.
[01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:05.880]   >> That's a nice way to put it. Yeah. >> And so the book is called Operation
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:11.160]   Mints Meat and it tells the story about how this project came to be and how it was put together.
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:16.440]   >> It was a movie The Man Who Never Was, right? >> The Man Who Never Was was based on the memoirs
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:23.720]   of one of the guys who was in charge of this operation. It was an 1953, 1954. But this one is
[01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:30.360]   it's a much more of a spy novel sort of telling of the story. Also it incorporates a lot new
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:35.160]   and lot of information that has become available in the past 50 years. It stops being a bit
[01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:39.640]   it's when you really get into it. I'm not quite done with it yet. I'm about I think about I'm
[01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:46.520]   about 80% through the auto book right now. But it just gets into this idea where everybody's just
[01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:50.840]   you can tell that in a sense they're having fun doing this. They're figuring out that
[01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:56.120]   they're having these discussions like should there be like a button on his uniform that has
[01:15:56.120 --> 01:16:00.280]   fallen off and he put it back on again. But he doesn't know how to sew so we didn't do it very
[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:07.240]   very well. But that really helps sell it. And the end of the story is of course that it did work
[01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:13.000]   and that it helped divert enormous amounts of troops and ships away from the from an
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:17.960]   attending landed zone. It saved like God knows how many lives. But just in this nice little bubble
[01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:23.560]   of storytelling, you're just amazed that at some point that you're used to spy stories being that
[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:29.480]   well we we use one of our double eight we picked up a Soviet agent and we turned him five years
[01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:34.120]   ago and so then we simply had him put this one piece of information in this 20 page report that
[01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:39.560]   just sort of sort of interestingly changed a certain number. You're not expecting this really easily
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:45.560]   accessible and really detailed just James Bondi and sort of or even Lewis Carroll style
[01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:49.960]   spycraft and it's just a terrific story. And you just want to you just keeping you're just
[01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:54.840]   keeping on reading thinking that Joel Cohen somewhere has a movie in this in this idea because
[01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:59.160]   it's just such an interesting story. I love the movie when I was a kid. I just love the idea. You
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:07.560]   know? Yeah. Yeah. Very cool. So operation mince meat by Ben McIntyre just came out about a month
[01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:11.560]   month and a half ago as a matter of fact. Now I just noticed if you join audible you get that for
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:16.280]   free by going to audible.com/macbreak and audible is always giving away stuff for free. I see here
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:21.720]   they have a new Woody Allen short story. My apology that he both wrote and read and it's free for
[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:27.080]   members. So everyone's wanted to just throw stuff in like that which is fantastic. The fact that
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:31.880]   there's a whole list of free short stories in first chapters at audible.com. Audible has books
[01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:38.680]   in every category sci-fi fiction nonfiction. I read a lot of history on audible.com. I'm listening
[01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:45.160]   to a book that was recommended by Tom Merritt and Veronica Belmont the wind up girl by Paolo
[01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:52.360]   Batcha Gallupi. Really great sci-fi book right now. Really really great. There's always something to
[01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:59.640]   read when you're a member of audible audible.com/macbreak get that first book free. But I should warn you
[01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:04.920]   you're going to get hooked. Once you start listening to audible books you cannot stop audible. I mean
[01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:10.520]   in fact I'm adding operation mince meat to my my list. I cannot wait because I loved that story
[01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:19.800]   when I was a kid. The man who never was audible.com/macbreak. Thank you Andy. Great pick. As usual I
[01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:24.760]   don't know how he does it. You're a very literate person Andy. I'm a very lonely man who has a
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:29.160]   very limited social life. I spend a lot of time posting inside my house reading books and driving
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:37.880]   alone so very alone Leo. Now let's get to our picks of the week starting with Alex Lindsay.
[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:44.600]   So I have one that is uncharacteristically inexpensive for me. How many Alex's? Zero. Zero
[01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:50.520]   Alex free. So I'm actually going to recommend a demo. So it actually the actual full app cost
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:54.760]   something. But I'm going to recommend a demo because it doesn't expire and it's actually going
[01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:58.200]   to be useful for many of our listeners. So there's a program that a lot of us use in
[01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:03.160]   movie making called final draft. And final draft is of course it's kind of word processor for
[01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:09.400]   doing your scripts. Now you can use pages or word or even text edit to do these kind of things.
[01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:14.760]   But when you have a script editing software what it does is it formats everything for you. So
[01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:18.680]   it'll remember the interior scenes or the exterior scenes or that you're doing those. It'll format
[01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:23.320]   everything out. It'll put everything in the way that you need it. And it really makes it makes a
[01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:27.880]   writing a script much much easier to throw together. What's interesting about what final draft does
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:33.960]   is that they actually have a demo that will work indefinitely. And it simply is limited to 15
[01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:39.480]   pages. And the reason 15 pages is important is because a regular TV show is 22 minutes or 22
[01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:44.680]   pages. So you can't do a half hour show on it. And so they're selling to people who are really
[01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:50.040]   professionals who are doing. But it turns out if you're doing short films, if you're doing web
[01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:53.720]   video, if you're doing other things like that, you want to write you want to take advantage of one
[01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:58.440]   of these script. The script it's free. And I'm sure that their approach to this is that you can
[01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:03.160]   you know you can grow your skills. You can start proving yourself and it'll print with a watermark
[01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:07.160]   that says final draft or whatever. And that's fine. But you can really start getting started and
[01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:11.560]   use it for what you're doing. Don't submit that script. However, if you're going to submit the
[01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:14.280]   script, what you probably want to do, but you're not going to submit the script because it's only
[01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:20.040]   15 minutes long. So the thing is it's $150 I think or $199 or something like that for the full version.
[01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:23.880]   So if you decide you want it, it's not that expensive. If you're a professional screenwriter,
[01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:27.400]   you do want it. Once you decide you're going to do that, but the thing is the best one. I mean,
[01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:30.600]   there's a number of these. You know, I really think that this is still the best one. This is
[01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:34.920]   the king. Yeah, I still think that this is the best one out there. I think that this is the one
[01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:39.160]   that most people kind of expect having it around also is useful because people will send you final
[01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:44.440]   draft versions of things. And so it's nice to have that. And I believe the demo will open the other
[01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:49.240]   the longer versions. I'm not 100% sure that. But the final draft is still pretty much the standard,
[01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:54.360]   I think. And there's and there's setups to do it in pages and you can try that. But I really think
[01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:57.720]   that if you're getting started with this kind of thing, if you want to see how this really runs,
[01:20:57.720 --> 01:21:01.320]   I mean, it allows you to organize in a way that I just haven't seen anywhere else.
[01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:05.160]   Andy, I get the feeling you were writing a script even as we speak. I don't know why.
[01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:09.240]   Don't you feel like Andy's writing a script? I think he's always writing a script.
[01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:15.080]   I'm running lots of stuff. I have a couple scripts that I've written to teach myself
[01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:21.080]   how to format things and you use a script writing program like final draft or I'd like to.
[01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:25.160]   Unfortunately, it's kind of out of my price range. I believe or not, I use Scrivener,
[01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:28.040]   the word processor that does everything because it has a really nice script writing.
[01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:31.880]   It does have doesn't it has modules. I believe it's I believe it's it's even compatible with final
[01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:40.680]   draft. We lost that. Final cut. Final cut. Final draft. It is also compatible with other
[01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:44.360]   script writing apps. And I think Scrivener is great. I think that I think that when I'm when
[01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:48.200]   I'm looking at doing something and I just want something that's very specialized to exactly what I
[01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:53.160]   want to produce, I think that there's just the thing with final draft is that they've gotten so
[01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:57.720]   much feedback from guys who write scripts all the time that you just end up with lots of little
[01:21:57.720 --> 01:22:02.120]   things about being able to tag things and move things around. And I just find its focus is
[01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:06.280]   is really good. Did you ever try the free open source program that I had recommended a while ago?
[01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:11.080]   Keltex. I played with it. It's a little here. The thing is, is it for the price? I think it's
[01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:15.480]   a great solution. It's free. And so and so I think people are going to work on it. I think that
[01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:18.600]   once you get the here's the other thing is if you decide you want to get into the industry,
[01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:21.400]   a lot of people are going to are going to when you start working with people are they going to go
[01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:24.920]   can you send me an file? Something other than final draft, there's going to be a little like,
[01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:31.720]   yeah. And so and so it's great to at least know how it works. And the demo, as I said, will work.
[01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:37.320]   And especially one of the things that we get into when I talk to film budding filmmakers
[01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:41.400]   is they talk about writing their first feature. And I don't you know, I'm playing around with ideas
[01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:45.160]   for features. But what I'm really worried about is building short films because you want to learn
[01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:48.360]   how to do this. You want to learn about story progression. You want to learn about production
[01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:55.240]   while you're in short versions, two to five minutes, two to eight minutes. Think about those kind of
[01:22:55.240 --> 01:23:00.920]   numbers because you don't want, you know, a longer film is just more of the same. And it's also just
[01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:05.160]   more places for you to make mistakes, have problems, all these other things. And so in a lot of ways,
[01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:09.880]   it's really good to think about your first films being short films. And this is an application that
[01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:17.160]   for free you can you can build those. I'm just reading Oliver Stone uses final draft, according to
[01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:23.480]   the most. I still think it's in one of those lands where most major screenwriters are still using
[01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:28.040]   final draft. Yeah, I'm a big fan of the creative screenwriting podcast where it's just wonderful
[01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:32.360]   hour long and nine and long interviews with with screenwriters of whoever's written
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:36.600]   really good movie that you've seen in the past three months he'll have the whole have the guy who
[01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:42.280]   wrote up. Oh, great. The guy who wrote the Hurt Locker on it's just really wonderful. And so I've
[01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:47.320]   been listening to this for like two years now. And every time they mention an app, final, you know,
[01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:51.160]   that that app is so ubiquitous that it's almost like it's almost like Photoshop.
[01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:55.160]   Yeah. Oh, well, you know, I decided to put it into Photoshop, you know, because there's
[01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:57.640]   they everyone knows what you're talking about when you talk about this app.
[01:23:57.640 --> 01:24:01.640]   What's in it? It's a screenwriters podcast, is that it? Creative screenwriting. One of my
[01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:05.240]   favorite podcasts. Oh, it's a magazine creative screen. No, it's it's a magazine. But he also
[01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:11.080]   does a podcast where he does they if you live in LA, they he they set up regular screenings in
[01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:15.160]   which they will screen the film and then have not just an interview with the with the with the
[01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:20.280]   screenwriter where it's like, so what was it like working with Madonna, but she was heading on.
[01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:24.840]   The he always starts off. I say we always start off with breaking in stories. How did you break
[01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:29.480]   into the business? And it's 90 minutes about the craft of writing the experience of writing in
[01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:34.440]   Hollywood. And then the experience of writing this particular, this specific movie. Look at the
[01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:38.600]   cats. He gets this guy gets let me let me let me say though, if you have not if you if you're
[01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:44.120]   this is the first time looking at this podcast, your first download is going to be the screenwriter
[01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:49.800]   of Valkyrie, because it was an especially long one in which he had the screenwriter had a million
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:54.040]   stories about working in Hollywood and it's not. And that's why I will never work with William
[01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:59.320]   Preston ever again, because he drinks. It's you learn about here is how stories get broken. And
[01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:03.880]   here's how something has developed year after year after year and how sometimes it's a question
[01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:07.320]   of patience and sometimes it's a question of luck. And sometimes it's a question of
[01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:11.400]   some Hollywood starlet who want who finally wants to make a Western because she likes the clothes she
[01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:17.640]   saw. Western heroine working wearing. And all of a sudden this this Western screenplay you've
[01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:22.200]   had kicking around for five years is suddenly hot again because this this this Hollywood this
[01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:26.840]   famous actress who now wants to make any movies he wants wants to wear those clothes in a movie.
[01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:33.880]   So anyway, so his name is Christopher McQuarrie. And I found that. And he really I there's almost
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:38.200]   not a single dud in that entire podcast creative screenwriting magazine.
[01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:43.320]   Blogspot.com or just creative screenwriting.com. Wow, I'm gonna I'm that's a I have a bunch of
[01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:47.800]   shows to listen to that sounds really great. He's got John Lithgow on the most recent one talking
[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:52.600]   about Buckaroo Bonsai. How can you get better than that? And that one the screening they showed Buckaroo
[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:59.560]   Bonsai and then his segment from Amazing Store Amazing Stories. I know the Twilight Zone. Yeah.
[01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:05.240]   Anyway, wow, wow, wow, wow. Well, Andy, we just got another recommendation from you absolutely free.
[01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:09.960]   I'm gonna mention since we're in the midst of the the semi finals and soon to be finals of the
[01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:15.000]   World Cup an application for the iPhone that I've been using to follow the World Cup
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:22.440]   from ESPN. They have a great application. I was a couple of weeks ago, you know, I was at the
[01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:30.520]   food camp and I was missing the USA game and I was freaking out. How am I going to see the USA game?
[01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:37.480]   So I was able to, you know, using the using the, let's see, where where am I coming in?
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:42.600]   Where is that? Ah, there it is. That's not where I want. I'm gonna show you that I want to show you
[01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:48.680]   the picture of this here. Let's go back to a six camera five over to six sorry, we're still
[01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:53.880]   working out the studio. So here's the ESPN application and you can, you know, they have brackets you
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:27:00.360]   can find out who's who's winning and stuff. And then they had an ad for Moby TV. Turns out Moby has sold
[01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:06.760]   now a million, I think a million copies of Moby TV just because of the World Cup. You can actually
[01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:15.080]   watch the World Cup on your iPhone or your iPad. So I was stuck in a seminar at food camp. They
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:20.200]   have other things besides the World Cup, but this is actually pretty good. I think it was like
[01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:25.400]   $10 a month. You can have six month or yearly subscriptions. I just bought a month just to see.
[01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:29.960]   But you know what? The video looks pretty darn good. I was able to watch the game,
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:38.520]   even though it's small on an iPhone. It really looks great. So two recommendations. One, if you
[01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:44.600]   want to follow the World Cup, ESPN has a great World Cup application. And if you want to actually
[01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:53.320]   watch the games and we have a game going on, even as we speak right now, you can Moby dot TV.
[01:27:53.320 --> 01:28:00.440]   Yeah. The vuvuzalas are firing Moby dot TV is a great little lap for the iPhone.
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:06.680]   Can I say something about this arc? Did you see that Elgato came out with a vuvuzella filter?
[01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:11.080]   Yeah. You know, it's great. Something is like, that's great. But why didn't they just do that?
[01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:15.480]   You know, at the broadcast level, you know, it was kind of like, you know, as soon as I heard
[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:18.520]   the vuvuzella, I was like, that's an identifiable sound. They could totally get rid of that.
[01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:21.880]   So, you know, like I was just like, you know, just sample that and you'll be able to reduce that by,
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:26.760]   you know, 20 or 30 dB at least. I don't know. I heard the broadcasters were doing that.
[01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:31.560]   Well, you know, they don't have to mic them at all. The truth is they're they're miking them.
[01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:36.440]   They don't have to have audience sound at all. Right. I mean, they're in a booth for crying out.
[01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:39.560]   Like they can decide how much they want. They're doing it on. They're putting exactly as much as
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:42.600]   they want, Alex. Right. We like the vuvuzella.
[01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:46.120]   Yeah, I don't like it that much. Where's my house?
[01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:50.040]   They always use an overall, no one else in the podcast like the vuvuzella listeners.
[01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:54.040]   Oh, well, it's too bad because I'm giving Alex a vuvuzella and I, you know, I've never,
[01:28:54.040 --> 01:28:55.800]   I've listened to them. I never actually played one.
[01:28:55.800 --> 01:29:03.720]   Now try that Elgato thing. I kind of like it.
[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:14.280]   I wouldn't mind them at all if they restricted it to when they score.
[01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:16.680]   No, it's just constant though, isn't it? I can imagine.
[01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:20.360]   We got to let me clean off the mouthpiece and we got to let Ken Shepertson,
[01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:24.680]   our director of engineering, we actually hired him not for his programming or engineering
[01:29:24.680 --> 01:29:36.200]   skill, but because he plays a mean vuvuzella. Okay, we're losing the audience now.
[01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:41.000]   I just love the fact that we're capping off a discussion of how annoying that sound is.
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:45.320]   I play it. If I'm stealing our own power podcast with the sound of vuvuzella.
[01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:51.640]   So I was making a recommendation that you will continue to make for Moby TV.
[01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:57.320]   I play on a number of different things. I have to say it's really good even on 3G.
[01:29:57.320 --> 01:30:01.000]   It's really nice to be able to watch on a case like this when there's news or something going on
[01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:06.520]   to watch on your iPhone. Looks great. And I kind of remember how much I paid. I don't think it was
[01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:11.560]   very expensive. It was I think 10 bucks, 10 bucks a month.
[01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:17.080]   Mr. Now, did I give you enough warning, Mr. Reaxwell?
[01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:18.600]   Yeah. Your pick of the week, sir.
[01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:26.840]   My pick of the week is from a company called Topaz Labs. You can find it at TopazLabs.com.
[01:30:26.840 --> 01:30:33.800]   These people make a beautiful, in my opinion, one of the finest sets of Photoshop filters in the
[01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:39.720]   business. I bought this because of you, Ray. Yep. And you can get all kinds of wonderful
[01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:46.840]   artistic effects as well as one of the filters that's really getting a lot of press now is
[01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:54.120]   Denoise. Luminous Landscape just did a write up about it and said it's the best noise removing
[01:30:54.120 --> 01:30:58.680]   filter on the market. They compared it to a whole bunch of other. Now, Lightroom 3 now has a
[01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:02.440]   very good Denoise or iPhone. Have you compared it to the new Lightroom 3?
[01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:06.040]   Well, anyway, I don't know whether they compared it to it, but they compared it to a lot of other
[01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:11.480]   plugins and said Denoise is one of the finest. But you can get there's several things I really
[01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:16.920]   like about this company. The first thing that I like about the company is you can download all
[01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:25.720]   of these filters absolutely free and use them for 30 days with no restrictions whatsoever. You can
[01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:30.840]   download them and use them on real work. You can publish what you get. There's no watermarks,
[01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:37.800]   nothing. You get the full meal deal. And for 30 days, they work just like they will when you
[01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:46.840]   pay the license fee. And you can buy the whole set for 179 bucks. And that saves you a fair bit
[01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:52.040]   of money over buying the individual filters. But the artistic looks you get with them are just
[01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:57.720]   fantastic. Now, they also have a set of video filters, which I haven't tried. Alex, have you
[01:31:57.720 --> 01:32:02.600]   looked at this outfit? I have seen them. I actually haven't gotten around to requesting a
[01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:09.880]   30 days as well for the video. Yes. I haven't off the test. I haven't tested them. Ray did
[01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:13.960]   it. Ray took one of my pictures from China and ran them through one of the Topaz filters.
[01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:18.440]   And it turned out well. It's incredible. Not video stills, but just incredible.
[01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:22.920]   No, I should definitely check it out. And I have to admit I haven't gotten to it yet.
[01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:27.480]   I introduced this to the Western photographic circle, which is a printmaking group that I
[01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:32.760]   belong to. And the whole bunch has gone nuts over these. Have they gone 64 bit with these?
[01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:39.160]   Yes, they have. They're good. They are 64 bit now. That was very recently in the last two weeks.
[01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:44.600]   Because that was one issue. I had a restart Photoshop to. Right. Yeah, you had to set it to
[01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:50.680]   open in 32 bit. But that's gone now. If you download the current set of filters, there's 64 bit on the
[01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:55.560]   Mac. I think that I think that one of the reasons that I haven't used it much for the for the video,
[01:32:55.560 --> 01:32:59.000]   I was trying to figure out why I haven't opened these in the video side of things.
[01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:03.000]   I just there is a little bit more focus than what they have for the still side. And so it's
[01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:07.880]   just been stuff that I haven't needed. Right. That was the issue. But the the the this stuff looks
[01:33:07.880 --> 01:33:13.560]   amazing. I'm sorry. Yeah, the clean filters simplify filters.
[01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:21.560]   We like to we like to call them Leo squirrel Lindsey.
[01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:28.360]   Looks like the Netherlands are going going all the way. Oh, why? It's a big pile of orange people
[01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:33.560]   on the field right now. Go ahead. Please continue. Well, all I can say is I have really enjoyed
[01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:38.680]   these filters and the people that I've shown them to without exception. Everybody's run out and
[01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:44.680]   got them and they're doing really wonderful work. Like I say, the simplify filter, the clean filter.
[01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:54.280]   If you shoot fashion or glamor, the clean does things to women's skin that the women love it.
[01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:58.200]   Let's put it that way. The ladies love to pass. The ladies love it.
[01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:05.080]   So it's it's fantastic. I have to I buy routinely when you know I upgraded to the latest Photoshop
[01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:09.960]   and I make sure that I have the Topaz filters and the Nick filters. Yeah, those are those. You
[01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:14.360]   know, if you've got those, you're done. And I have to say that I think they work with Lightroom. I
[01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:18.440]   know Nick does. I think the Topaz filters work with Lightroom as well. I believe so. Yeah. And
[01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:22.280]   I've been using Lightroom three. I mentioned it last week. I just really alike in that. That's a
[01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:26.200]   great combination. Lightroom three, Photoshop. I have played with the next stuff and the
[01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:29.400]   Nick softwares and the Nick filters and the Topaz filters and you're done. Yeah,
[01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:33.320]   there's nothing you could take any crappy photo and make it look good. God knows. I don't know
[01:34:33.320 --> 01:34:41.960]   about that. Thank you, Ray. Good recommendation. Topaz Labs at TopazLabs.com. And last but not least,
[01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:50.040]   Mr. Andy Notko. Actually, my pick of the week is an old pick of the week made more sexy and more
[01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:57.160]   awesome by a price drop. Another shoe has dropped as a result of the iPads release. The price of
[01:34:57.160 --> 01:35:04.840]   the Amazon Kindle ebook reader is now down to 189 bucks, which I think makes it into a different
[01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:10.120]   sort of beast because there are great many people that we're not willing to spend close to 300 bucks
[01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:14.840]   on the ebook reader. None of those people would have been willing to spend 500 bucks on an iPad,
[01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:21.160]   certainly not 630 bucks for an iPad with 3G connectivity. That's even before you throw in the 30 bucks
[01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:27.560]   a month service contract. But when you talk about having a really good compact ebook reader for 189
[01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:33.400]   bucks that comes with free 3G service for the life of the product, you start off with a really
[01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:38.200]   good book reader that has access to the largest commercial book library available anywhere.
[01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:42.840]   You're for I mean, if you were looking for an ebook, chances if it's not available on the Kindle
[01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:47.800]   store, chances are it's not available as a copyrighted book for purchase and your search kind of ends
[01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:54.520]   there. The iBook store is great. I think it's a better piece of software as a book reader, but the
[01:35:54.520 --> 01:35:59.400]   selection just isn't there. Also, the Kindle is a lot more compact than the iPad. You can definitely
[01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:06.360]   stick that in the back pocket very, very easily. And the screen is just simple of the eink display,
[01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:11.480]   so it'll be readable in any amount of sunlight and the battery runs exactly forever. I'm sorry,
[01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:16.040]   eight seconds short of forever. So you do have to recharge it once every 32 years or thereabouts.
[01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:21.560]   But one thing that people don't really remember about the Kindle is that if you look into it,
[01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:27.560]   it has one page of its menu is what are called experimental features. And one of those features
[01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:35.320]   is a mobile web browser. So it will access something like the mobile edition of Google Reader very,
[01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:42.120]   very easily. And you can actually through 3G access all your blogs, all your news, everything like that
[01:36:42.120 --> 01:36:47.960]   free for life completely wirelessly. And there are enough Kindle fans out there that you can get
[01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:54.680]   your email on it. Their waste is sort of abused that 3G connection. Amazon doesn't really care because
[01:36:54.680 --> 01:36:59.400]   you're just really just pushing tech. So that's next to nothing in terms of data that you're
[01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:05.800]   transacting. So when you drop the price to 189 bucks, suddenly this is in the realm of credibility
[01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:12.040]   for a great number of people for whom the iPad was a total non-starter only because of its price.
[01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:18.760]   And so I liked it at 200. I believe the original price is 269. I liked it at 269.
[01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:23.640]   At 189, I really, really love it. I'm really interested to see what this does,
[01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:28.840]   what this does not just to the Kindle market, but the market for eBooks in general.
[01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:32.920]   Because at this price, it's close enough that for Christmas, a lot of people are going to be
[01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:37.080]   getting e-book readers for Christmas. And I think that's going to really expand the credibility
[01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:42.200]   of electronic publishing in general. I think you're right. Very nice, very tidy device. It's not
[01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:48.520]   like a, you see other bargain rate e-book readers that look like it's a homebrew project made out of
[01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:52.360]   just parts glued together with spit and bailing wire. But this is a very, very trim, wonderful
[01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:59.400]   product. It does read e-pubs. You can email your own desktop documents to it, and it will convert
[01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:04.600]   it for like a dime per document. You can also hook it up by USB and just dump PDFs and stuff onto
[01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:08.680]   it. It doesn't handle e-pub. Unfortunately, that's really the only downside of the entire device.
[01:38:08.680 --> 01:38:13.480]   But again, for 189 bucks, it's almost like they're unveiling a whole new product. It's called the
[01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:19.640]   Kindle Affordable. I'm really interested to see this new DX. I don't want to buy it.
[01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:25.240]   I have the only thing with the DX. I mean, I think that the Kindle makes at $189 makes a lot of sense
[01:38:25.240 --> 01:38:30.680]   for a lot of people. $49 a couple of days ago. Yeah. You buy the company and you let themselves.
[01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:36.600]   Yes. At $379, though, with the DX, I kind of go, really? I mean, you know, like, are you really
[01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:40.760]   going to buy that instead of an iPad? I mean, at that, when you get into that price range, I think
[01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:46.520]   that there's, I really think that over $250 or $299 at the highest is really above that is like
[01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:51.480]   no man's land. It's like I had no man's land. It's like 3.79 for the DX, but they've got this new
[01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:56.680]   higher contrast screen. I'm kind of treats to buy it. It's the future. Because it's in color.
[01:38:56.680 --> 01:39:01.000]   Oh, wait. It's not coloring yet. No. No, it's not. It plays video.
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:06.680]   No, I don't know. It plays games. Oh, no. It doesn't do that either.
[01:39:06.680 --> 01:39:10.760]   For reading books, I still think that I'm with Andy a little bit. I think the Kindle is probably a
[01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:15.080]   better experience for just reading books. For 189, absolutely. But it's got to be cheap. But I'm not
[01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:18.680]   going to, you know, once I go to that price, I'm just going to be, you know, I want to do all
[01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:23.480]   those other things too close to an iPad at that point. Yeah. Above. Once you get into 200, 300 bucks,
[01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:30.440]   definitely. Hey, great show. Thank you guys. Really appreciate it. Andy Enoco is at the Chicago
[01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:41.160]   Sun Times, his website, www.cwob.com. He's got his own gang signs, apparently. That's lovely.
[01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:46.360]   Thanks for being here, Andy. Thank you, Ray Maxwell, for joining us. We'd love to have you come back
[01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:54.440]   on a regular basis. Ray is just a real asset to the Twit Network. We have a bunch of Ray's show,
[01:39:54.440 --> 01:39:59.240]   Maxwell's house is no longer being produced. We canceled it. I'm sorry to say, but Ray will make
[01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:04.120]   regular appearances on all of our other shows because his expertise is so valued here at the
[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:09.560]   Twit Network. So it's great to talk to you again, Ray. Thanks for being here. And I'm sorry, Alex
