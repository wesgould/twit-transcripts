[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.680]   It's time for a Mac Break Weekly, the show where we cover the latest news from Apple.
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:35.440]   And the Applers are assembling Renee Ritchie is here from iMore.com and the Vector Podcast.
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.840]   Hi Renee. Hey Leo, how are you doing? You have the blinds drawn, which tells me you have blinding
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.360]   snow out the window. No, this one is open but is so bright that it feels like it's washing me
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.760]   out till I closed it halfway. Because it's hitting the snow, the entire river is frozen,
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.560]   it's hitting that giant snow ice pile and then blasting me in the face. And unlike Superman,
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:03.760]   it cannot absorb its power for itself. Harvers. The entire river is frozen? No, the entire country
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:10.000]   is frozen. So what it did is it snowed, melted, iced, froze, snow melted, ice froze. Now we have
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.920]   the world's largest snow and ice copycrisque. We're just all living under it. Yes, it's a layer
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.560]   of cake. And Jim knows about that because he's from the Maritimes, Jim Dalrymple.
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.320]   Loop Insight. Hey, Leo. That's great to have you. He's moved, of course, to southern climbs.
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.520]   Now in the Silicon Valley. Now in California. Yeah. Smart man.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.240]   So now I just make fun of Renee. Although it was 74 degrees. Yes.
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.440]   The river is frozen. The whole thing's frozen. The man listens to the weather report and then
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.200]   calls me and laughs. It is amazing. Well, there's always room down here for you, Renee. Just want
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.280]   you to keep that in mind. I don't think you want to evacuate though just yet. This might be
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.800]   this might be from the frying pan to the fire. It's warmer, but maybe too warm. Also here,
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:06.000]   Andy and I go from Boston Public Radio and an echo.com. Hello, Andrew. Hello. But it must
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.720]   be disappointing that you don't get so many moose sightings in the in the area.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:20.160]   Do you miss the moose? Sorry. Yeah, I really I truly hate to say this, but that noise in the
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.480]   background is the gardener. So we actually had a moose on the road like like a month ago. There
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.400]   was one that crossed over the ice and was just walking around the street down the street.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.720]   This was a big week. Mark Gurman called it last week. He tweeted,
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.240]   "Apple will probably clear the deck for their March 25th announcement, their upcoming Monday
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.360]   announcement about Apple news and Apple TV and get the new hardware out of the way this week."
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.840]   And he couldn't have been more right. New iPads announced yesterday. New iMacs announced
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:58.960]   today. And I'm still waiting for new MacBooks. You think they'll do that or wait for WWDC?
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.600]   The 12-inch or that rumored 16-inch or 15-inch with a...
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.800]   That's not yet. Anything that's a new design is going to get its own show later this year.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.960]   So that's what that's what these all have in common. They're refreshes of existing designs.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:20.480]   Right. No, no retooling necessary. Actually, in a way, I understand why Apple didn't update the
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:26.400]   iPad Air and the iPad Mini. I mean, they put 12 A12 bionic processors in them. So that's a big
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.680]   internal update. But they've got the home button. They've got the same bezel size and they have
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:38.800]   the courage port. And it feels now fairly retro to still offer iPads like that if those are your
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:45.200]   new ones. Well, they did add pencil support. And for the iPad Mini, I think that's a huge, huge thing.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:52.560]   That's the old pencil, not the new pencil. Oh, wow, wow, wow. Crime me a river. Oh, no. I only get 10-28
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.040]   levels of support and it doesn't have a magnet in it. Oh, no. I have to be aware of it rolling
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:04.480]   off my desk. I'll take it for the... To have the everything that I love about the iPad Mini,
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:10.320]   plus having pencil support so I can take notes and I can draw really the only thing that's ever
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:16.320]   tempted me about Samsung phones has been that S Pen having a high-end size thing that has a
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:23.600]   really, really good stylus on it. And now, I mean, I was still using my iPad Mini second generation
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.120]   as late as like four days ago. And this has got me excited about having a second iPad in the
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:36.160]   house in addition to my iPad Pro. Yeah. And in fact, I understand why Apple also did it because
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.200]   they can keep the prices down and they probably have a... Well, you'd have to retool it, right?
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.600]   Like you'd have to make the edge flat, you'd have to insert the product charging unit.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.960]   And then it would be an iPad Pro and they'd be charging iPad Pro prices and they wouldn't have
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.760]   their medium tier. But it's kind of... I mean, it's kind of like a car manufacturer selling
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:06:01.680]   this year's car and 12 years ago's car. It's kind of... It's a little weird to have that product line.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.560]   Well, maybe it's a little weird to have a brand new Apple pencil that doesn't work with every
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:13.840]   single model of iPad. But I'm perfectly fine with them keeping hardware support for legacy
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:19.840]   iPads. It really does show how important the iPad is to Apple that they want to have this
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:26.720]   variety of hardware, but also this variety of price points out there. So this is really a huge,
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:32.160]   huge, huge statement about how big they think the iPad is, not just for education and not just
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:38.880]   for a thousand dollar laptop replacements to compete with high-end Chromebooks and medium price
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:44.720]   Windows machines, but actually just as a platform, as an ecosystem into with sales.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.800]   I have to now go fun. I may be why I'm complaining as I have to now go find my old pencil.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:54.320]   Well, it's the $4.99 price point, too. It's like that original iPad price point that the original
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:59.520]   iPad had it and then we went through the errors and the errors, too. The magic $500 price point.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.280]   Yeah. And I have to find it again, but my favorite tweet was from the gentleman who runs
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:08.480]   Android police. And it was just, oh, from David Rudd, where he said, "Apple just launched a $500
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.160]   iPad. They pretty much fatally killed the Pixel Slate and didn't even bother having an event for
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:17.280]   it." Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think it took much to kill the Pixel Slate to be honest with you.
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:27.760]   So I think it also reminds me of what Apple did in the mature era of the iPod, where they started
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:35.280]   to fill in the price gaps. Yeah. So that there was, so now there's a $329 iPad and there's a
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:41.760]   whatever you want to pay iPad, $1,200 iPad. But there's pretty good,
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:47.200]   divisions along the way. So you could pick the price point you want.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:56.000]   I do think that this indicates how much competition Apple feels for those devices and at those price
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:02.480]   points, the fact that they don't feel the need to give use that they in laptops, they don't feel
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:07.040]   the need to give you a whole range of prices because I feel as though they don't feel as though
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:12.560]   they've got a lot of competition that they've got. They're serving Mac users who are not very,
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:18.560]   very inclined to switch to Windows or switch to Chromebook. However, at the sub $1000 price point,
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:23.520]   they're feeling pressure from all sides, including from people who are going to start to think that,
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:27.840]   gee, I've got this phone. It's got this wonderful high density screen. It's actually really,
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:33.760]   really big. What do I need a $500 computer for? I think that part of it is not only filling in
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:38.800]   the price points and not only chasing after everybody for every budget to make sure that they get
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:43.840]   money from somebody for shining a new iPad, but also realizing that they need to have an answer
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:51.920]   to the question of why would I spend $400 more for an iPad when $500 will buy me this, which is a
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:57.280]   very, very capable, incredible little laptop or a very, very capable, incredible little tablet.
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:02.320]   They're saying, well, don't spend $400 more. Give us $500. We'll give you something that doesn't
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.800]   snoop on your security. It's way, way more secure. And Jim can put it in his back pocket.
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:15.520]   Yeah, right. There's a lot of people that just don't need the power of an iPad Pro,
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:23.600]   the highest-end model that's out now. There's a ton of people that will be satisfied
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:28.320]   with the new models that are out now and don't even need pencil support.
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:37.360]   I'm talking people that use it as an auxiliary device. You could even use that as your full-time
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:44.320]   device and be perfectly happy with the speed and everything that comes out of it. My grandmother,
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:51.920]   90 years old, never wanted a computer, but she said an iPad for a few years. I mean,
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:58.080]   obviously she's not going to need a pencil unless she has some Picasso yearnings in there somewhere
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:05.040]   that I don't know about. But I really don't think that this is a bad release at all.
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:10.720]   And certainly anybody who was holding out hope that the Mini was not dead is going to be gratified.
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:11.920]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.960]   Yeah, great to keep it alive. Although when you put them together,
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:19.280]   and by the way, Apple's press release did say the most complete lineup of iPads ever.
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:23.680]   So they're making that point. But when you put them together, it just looks like the
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:30.080]   iPads with the Touch ID and the home button and the camera and the big bezels just feel so
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:36.080]   to me so old-fashioned. But that inspires you to upgrade. But my mom has the original 12-inch
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:40.480]   iPad Pro, and she's been using an iPad Air. She has high availability iPads.
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:47.680]   And I wonder why. She has an iMac, but she almost never uses it. As she calls her iPad or
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:52.640]   computer, and for her, it's the most approachable computer she's ever had. And my father was an
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:57.680]   IBM engineer and just had computers all my life, and she just didn't grok them. But the iPad
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:01.600]   she does everything on. And the iPad Air 2 is getting a little bit long in the tooth. So she's
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:06.720]   like, my birthday is coming up. That new 10.5 iPad looks amazing. That's the one she watched.
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.280]   Not the 11-inch. She wants that one. Yeah, it's interesting.
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:15.440]   My sister has the 9.7-inch iPad Pro and an older iPad Mini, like the iPad Mini 3. And she's like,
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:19.600]   yeah, the 3 is kind of old too. My birthday is coming up. I want that new Mini. So it's going to
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:27.440]   be like iPads. My family has just got big iPad love. So for 3.29, you can get the base model 9.7-inch
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:32.720]   iPad for 4.99. You can get that kind of perfect middle of the road iPad Air 2.
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:39.920]   And for 7.99, you can get the 11-inch iPad Pro. I think that does look kind of like a nice lineup.
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:44.720]   And they all everything supports a pencil of one kind or another. I'm sure at some point,
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.040]   Apple would like to settle on one pencil though, right?
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:52.640]   When they have more distinguishing features in the Pro, there's what they do. The Pro gets a new
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.720]   feature and it keeps it for a little while until it gets something else new. And then that previous
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:02.240]   new feature drops down to the lower end. So it had a pencil and then it had the smart keyboard.
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:06.320]   Then it got much bigger and the pencil dropped down and then it got the new design and the keyboard.
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:12.800]   As it gets new differentiators, things that make it decidedly more pro, Apple feels comfortable
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:17.440]   moving the other stuff down into the lowest and the entry level line to make it more attractive.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:25.120]   But to be clear, something that Apple's done with iPads and iPhones as of the last edition
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:28.320]   is to keep all of the devices very powerful.
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:34.400]   Yeah, 812 in the new iPads, the 810 is still in the 329 model.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:39.520]   What's the difference between the 812 Bionic and the 812X Bionic that's in the iPad Pro?
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.440]   So the 812 has...
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.240]   812 has...
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.520]   Thank you.
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.280]   The gym always cuts right through to the...
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.360]   It's X here.
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.960]   It's X here.
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:53.920]   Four efficiency cores and two performance cores instead of four and four.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:57.200]   And it's got four GPUs instead of seven GPUs, I believe.
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.640]   So it would be faster.
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:12:59.280]   Well, it's the X.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:12:59.760]   The X.
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.200]   It's extremely faster.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:07.040]   And of course, a lot more storage capability in the pros, a lot more screen and no touch idea.
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:07.360]   I agree.
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:10.400]   There are some people who would say, I want that touch ID.
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.040]   I kind of like touch ID.
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:17.040]   I don't have to worry about lighting conditions and holding it so and all that stuff.
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:17.280]   So...
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.760]   Told my hand is blocking the camera every time.
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:20.320]   Every time.
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.160]   I know it is.
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:27.120]   So that's why I kind of dig the slightly larger bezels on the iPads.
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.320]   They give you a place...
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.080]   They give you a safe zone to hold things.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.360]   It's like a Polaroid picture.
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.880]   You're not going to get fingerprints all over it.
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.800]   And you're not going to cover up any parts of the interface.
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.560]   Yeah, so you can make a case for it.
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:41.440]   So now iPads range in price from $329 to $1700.
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:44.640]   You pick the iPad.
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.320]   That's right for you.
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:46.800]   It's nice.
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:51.200]   It is very much like very reminiscent of the latter days of the iPod where,
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.320]   you know, pick a price point.
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.440]   There'd be an iPod for you.
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.360]   And they were very different capabilities.
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.600]   The iPod touch is very different than the shuffle, right?
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.600]   The iPad shuffle is terrible.
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.600]   There's no iPad shuffle.
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:02.160]   Thank God.
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.440]   All right.
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.440]   Anything more to say about these new iPads?
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.440]   Except they're here.
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.160]   They're available.
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.160]   You can't get them quite yet.
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.800]   You can pre-order now and what is it?
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.960]   It's a couple of weeks before you can get it delivered.
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.360]   Leo, we're going to go buy one.
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.560]   Which one would you buy?
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:21.520]   I like the mini.
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:24.400]   In fact, we already bought a mini for review purposes for us.
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:31.520]   I don't feel like the air is enough of a differentiator from the last year's iPad Pro
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.080]   to make it worth rushing out and getting.
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.440]   But I really like the mini.
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:38.720]   The mini is one I would use day in day out.
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.760]   So that's the one we ordered just so we could demonstrate it.
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:47.040]   Maybe this is also Apple's way of saying that our devices are so good.
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.480]   You will never want to fold them in half.
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:51.280]   You can fold them.
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:52.240]   You just can't fold them back.
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.880]   Do they have?
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.040]   You can fold them just unintentionally.
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.120]   Do they have the smart cover for the mini?
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.240]   Yes.
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.120]   Really?
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.080]   Yeah.
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:02.880]   Have you used it?
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.960]   Not the keyboard, not the keyboard, but the smart cover.
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.720]   Oh, the cover, but not the keyboard.
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.040]   Okay.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.880]   No, I asked about that and they're like,
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:13.200]   "Well, we don't really have a tiny finger market yet for a smart keyboard that small."
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:16.320]   But third parties will probably like logic has been making.
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:17.760]   Yeah, you know people would complain.
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:21.280]   It's cute. Who was this made for? These keys are too small.
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:24.000]   So yeah, I think this is great.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:24.480]   I'm glad.
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.760]   I mean, it's been a few years.
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:30.160]   We needed the return of the mini is great news and we needed the updates.
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:34.320]   And Apple's clearly listening to its audience because I had the mini must have been.
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.920]   There must have been some discussions.
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:36.880]   Should we make it?
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:37.600]   Should we kill it?
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.120]   I'm glad they kept it.
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:44.720]   They said there was like two people who liked the minis.
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.120]   There were people who liked them because they used to be less expensive
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.760]   because they were smaller and smaller things must be less expensive.
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.760]   But some people liked them just because they were portable.
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:52.160]   Perfect.
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.200]   And Apple has this problem sometimes where like with the iPhone SE,
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.200]   it wasn't really clear to them, at least from the outside.
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:00.400]   It didn't look clear to them whether people actually wanted a smaller phone,
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:01.680]   not just a cheaper phone.
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:05.120]   But they realized with the iPad mini that there were some people who wanted it cheaper,
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:08.640]   but the 9.7 inch is a better, cheaper product for those people.
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:12.480]   And there were people who just really wanted a digital field notes that syncs with iCloud or
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.760]   Dropbox and you could sit there and draw with and do all this stuff with.
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:18.960]   And there are some awesome apps like Moleskin is doing some really,
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.680]   really cool agenda style apps.
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.880]   And there are just some amazing editing apps that can be taken photos and go through them.
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:25.680]   Perfect agenda sets.
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:26.800]   It's a really coolable device.
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:30.880]   If only I could get a fountain pen for the iPad mini, then I'd be happy.
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:36.320]   You're welcome to just, you know, you might need a blotter.
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:44.560]   The press release, all new iPad Air and iPad mini delivered dramatic power and capability.
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:47.280]   Maybe overselling it a little bit.
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.160]   Dermishing.
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:49.520]   Well, yeah.
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:50.960]   Modern CPU.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:55.360]   Another thing to consider is that maybe Apple is also thinking that if we're going to have
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:59.760]   a really cool streaming video service that's locked to Apple's, we're going to need to have,
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:05.920]   it behooves us to make sure there's some awesome, awesome, tiny tablets out there for people,
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:09.120]   and affordable tablets for people to carry around these movies and TV shows with.
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:13.280]   Then there's the new iMac.
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:14.000]   It's pretty.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.120]   Period.
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:16.720]   Freaking powerful.
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:17.520]   Period.
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:21.440]   That's Apple's verbiage.
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:26.160]   This is the same exact design with eighth generation Intel processors.
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:26.720]   Is that right?
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:31.520]   It's completely unchanged, except for the 21.5 inch goes to eighth generation
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:36.320]   and with new Radeon cards and faster memory and the 27 goes to ninth generation,
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.600]   because you can't just have a coffee lake.
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:39.600]   You got to have a coffee like refresh now as well.
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:45.280]   And that also has new AMD up to Vega Pro and faster RAM.
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:49.200]   The addition of the Vega I would expect, I don't know, but I would expect is welcome, right?
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.120]   You've had a Vega.
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:51.440]   I mean, yeah.
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.280]   They put the Vegas and the MacBook Pros now.
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:55.200]   They're not, yeah, they're still mobile.
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.000]   They're not like the beefy ones that are in the iMac Pro.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.040]   Oh, this is the mobile.
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:17:59.520]   This is the mobile.
[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:02.960]   I believe I have to double check, but they're not the iMac Pro cards.
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:07.040]   And people still want Nvidia, and that doesn't answer that, but you know, you'll have EGPUs.
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:11.520]   So these are better, much better than the ones that were in the previous generation.
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.240]   So if I take whatever's not in the machine,
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.440]   yes, of course.
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.120]   Yes, they want absolutely right.
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:18.480]   They want beer to come out of the portion of that.
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.360]   I don't know who asked for that.
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:26.800]   So if I say let's get a 5k 27 inch iMac, which is really a nice machine,
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:34.560]   I could put a eight core i9 turbo boost up to five gigahertz.
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.080]   I can put up to 64 gigs.
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:42.240]   By the way, the iMac Pro also has additional RAM choices now up to all the way to 256 gig
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:43.680]   for $5,000.
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:46.480]   We'll only put 64.
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.240]   It's the Alex Lindsey plan, Leo.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.080]   Your time is literally worth more than your money.
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:50.320]   Yeah.
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:51.840]   And you know, that's an easy purchase.
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:55.520]   That's known as the first week in December.
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:58.080]   Gotta spend the rest of this budget money.
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:58.640]   The budget.
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.400]   Before the end of the year, or else we lose it.
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.560]   Let's put in the Vega Radeon Pro Vega 48.
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:08.240]   I can't believe they're still selling these fusion drives.
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.280]   Get rid of that.
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.040]   Put in a terabyte SSD.
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:12.720]   Don't buy a fusion drive, right?
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.240]   Only one terabyte SSD.
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.720]   Yeah, never buy anything with a platter that's in an all-in-one
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:19.360]   that you'll have to drag to an Apple Store if anything goes wrong with it.
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:20.880]   Hang all your platters outside with it.
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:21.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:24.480]   That's why I think a terabyte internal is sufficient
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.480]   because I'm going to hang out some Thunderbolt 3.
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.800]   I have a very nice, that new blade from Otherworld.
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.200]   It's great as long as you've never had two terabytes internal.
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.640]   Once you've had two terabytes.
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.040]   Okay, you talked me into it.
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:40.400]   So we got it up to iMac Pro prices, $5,249 maxed.
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.440]   If you max it out.
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:44.320]   And exactly where the iMac Pro begins with 8 cores.
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.640]   And then if you want more than 8 cores, you gotta go Pro.
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:47.760]   Isn't that funny?
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:48.480]   Yeah.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.880]   The other cool thing is that they're still keeping the,
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:55.760]   what was it, the $1,100 basic 19-inch iMac on the price list.
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:59.840]   So there's still less expensive buy-in.
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.880]   You don't necessarily have to have an 8-core processor.
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:06.640]   If all you're doing is you just want an iMac for the family room,
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:10.480]   or you just want to buy an 8-pack to do video editing in a school lab.
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:11.760]   Yeah.
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:15.680]   I mean, you know, $1,000 and that's a pretty nice computer for $1,000.
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:17.120]   That's competitive.
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:17.520]   Yeah.
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.280]   Seventh generation i5.
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.760]   Including including a top-of-the-line display,
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:24.080]   including this really nice build quality.
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:24.480]   Yeah.
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:25.840]   Yeah.
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.960]   And they still have, they still put spinning drives in.
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:31.120]   This says that this, the cheapest one, is it?
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.320]   $1,500 RPM.
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.320]   That's out of drive.
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.920]   That's okay.
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:36.320]   Yeah.
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:37.680]   For school.
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:38.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:43.760]   For school, also for lower capacity, the SSDs are cheap only for lower capacities.
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:47.360]   Once you start to get into half a terabyte, a full terabyte,
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:53.280]   then it becomes well, do I want to spend this extra $200 on a better case design?
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:58.320]   Do I want to spend that $200 on better cooling or more software or software subscriptions?
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:04.640]   I mean, I've got eight terabytes in the NAS behind me.
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.880]   It's not SSD storage.
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.600]   It works fine.
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:10.800]   It's an okay thing.
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:15.600]   I wouldn't ding any machine at that price point for having spinning hardware.
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:24.080]   Actually, given a $1,099 price point, a very competent machine, frankly, most people don't need
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:29.360]   more than eight gigs, i5, a terabyte spinning drive.
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:32.320]   That's a very competent machine for a home computer.
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:34.800]   And actually, that's not a bad price.
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.400]   Really?
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:40.640]   I mean, I know you can get a Windows machine for, I mean, a decent Windows-
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.640]   Windows-all-in-one is going to be 800 bucks.
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:46.800]   So it's not that much. I don't think that the Apple Premium is so visible here.
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:53.040]   Also, we consider that it's buying anything with an Apple logo on it.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:56.240]   You got a factor and it's getting sick in Canada.
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:59.040]   Like, you get premium healthcare built into the price.
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:02.720]   You pay a little bit more in taxes, so to speak, but you still get better healthcare.
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:02.960]   Yeah.
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.240]   This is a good family computer.
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.680]   21-inch or a good school computer.
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:06.240]   There's 21-inch.
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.160]   Yeah, and Apple said that they were seeing a lot of people.
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:12.480]   Well, a lot of people buy it because they're doing one of those new desk implementations
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:14.080]   and no one can just buy a computer anymore.
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:17.760]   They have to put all the sculptures and the desks and the because of YouTube now.
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:21.120]   And a lot of people just, for them, it's a set piece.
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:22.720]   I'm happy to turn it on.
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:27.200]   But with the family, they have fast family switching now, too, fast accounts switching.
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.920]   So you can have four different accounts and one of the kids could walk up,
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:32.080]   you know, switch it to them, do their, like, take, and they said,
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.840]   like one of the other big use cases now is continuity.
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:37.440]   Like they're doing something on their phone and it just becomes too big a task for a phone.
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.520]   So they can walk over to the iMac in the living room,
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:42.720]   switch to their account, continuity it over, and finish a report or
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:46.320]   answer that long email or something, then walk back away and someone else can do what they need
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:46.880]   to do on it.
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:51.680]   So it's proving really popular in those, and also like front of houses and businesses because
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:58.000]   they do these beautiful health club or, you know, nail salon or, you know, spa set up.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.080]   And the iMac becomes like part of the implementation in that business because it does
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.680]   enough that iconic design.
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:09.520]   So we're going to get that beautiful shiny iMac in the background of your podcasting set.
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:10.800]   Is that set on?
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.480]   No, that's my Mac Pro.
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.840]   That's my Mac Pro.
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:15.360]   It's not on.
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.480]   Well, now here's the deal.
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:19.600]   So we did talk about the range on the iPads.
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.560]   So we could start iMac at 1,099.
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:30.960]   If you max out an iMac Pro, I just did with an 18 core Xeon with 256 gigs, this new memory
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:36.960]   choice with a Radeon Pro Vega 64X with a 4 terabyte SSD.
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:42.080]   It's a mere $15,700, $15,000.
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:43.600]   You can get a car for less than that.
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:48.880]   But you can't get a Tesla car is not going to render your final video.
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:53.440]   At least anyway, I'm glad to see this.
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:59.680]   You don't think a new map laptops this week because they have to be a redesign.
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.120]   They just did.
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:03.440]   So they did almost all of them in October.
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:04.000]   They were fresh.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.240]   They did the new MacBook Pro as late as July.
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.200]   They did the other Macs.
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:10.400]   Only when they haven't done is the 12 inch MacBook.
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.520]   They gave it a new color scheme, but they didn't touch anything else about it.
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:16.400]   So that one, you know, that one, they traditionally updated in the spring.
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:20.080]   And the thing about Apple is like anything that's not urgent or important or not a new design,
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:22.480]   they can just drop it a press release anytime.
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:22.720]   Right.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:23.200]   Yeah.
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:23.280]   Yeah.
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:25.600]   It's really matter could be now could be in April.
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:26.160]   Doesn't matter.
[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:34.000]   Apparently, my groomers noticed they have added some new storage options for the MacBook
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.520]   Pro with touch bar, new high end for terabyte SSDs.
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.600]   What a four terabyte SSD in your MacBook Pro.
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.040]   It'll cost you 20 hundred bucks.
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:43.760]   Was there already?
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:44.240]   Was it?
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.800]   I think because I, yeah, there was reviews of the four to maybe it's a different.
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:47.280]   Oh, it's cheaper.
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:49.040]   No, no, no, that's what they're saying.
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.720]   Yeah, but now it's less expensive.
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:57.200]   They've cut 200 bucks off the two terabyte and they've cut $400 off of the four terabyte.
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.160]   I hardly noticed.
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.880]   It's a price of the machine.
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:01.600]   Yeah.
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:06.800]   If you can pay 2800 bucks or 3200 bucks, what's the difference?
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:07.280]   Really?
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:09.280]   But I got to talk to a lot of the Alex Alex.
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:12.160]   Well, when that extra 400 bucks, you could buy a new iPad.
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:12.800]   True.
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:13.840]   Now you can.
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:14.720]   That's a good point.
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.640]   I love how Jim thinks.
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:17.920]   Hey, what about the Mac Pro?
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:18.960]   When are we going to see that?
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.520]   And they said this year.
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.440]   So that means like December 31st.
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.440]   Like the exact 11 50.
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:29.120]   Same time as Google's new Stadia gaming system comes out.
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.400]   We'll get a Mac Pro.
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:34.080]   I think I think the Apple is actually actually building an Apple store in the
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:37.840]   Aleutian Islands to have the absolute benefit of the latest items.
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.760]   So it's possible for that product.
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:47.440]   It does shock me every time I go to the Apple store and I see the 2013 Mac Pro still for sale.
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:48.880]   It's.
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:51.760]   It's the loneliest Mac Pro.
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:52.320]   It's.
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.960]   It's like Ford still selling the Edsel.
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:55.440]   It's just.
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.280]   It's bizarre.
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:58.800]   It's like the iPod touch.
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:02.400]   They haven't even really updated the the website or anything.
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:02.880]   It's just.
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.800]   It's just sitting there.
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:05.280]   It's just.
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:05.920]   Yeah.
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:07.360]   I guess there are people buying it.
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.480]   I must be right.
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:13.920]   Well, there's no there's no point in canceling something that's in stock that fills a whole.
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:15.280]   It's not what they're going to cancel.
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:16.560]   It's just out of spite.
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:17.200]   So right.
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.760]   But they could update it.
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:21.040]   I guess they don't want to even do that.
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.160]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:27.360]   It's actually I think the whole even announcement the way that these iMacs were announced with
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:30.880]   just take is what there's new press releases that are sort of up there and people are getting
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.240]   phone calls as opposed to meetings.
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:38.880]   It's an indication a little bit about how frustrated Apple is with Intel's
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:40.880]   lateness on shipping product.
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:46.240]   How when were recent when was Apple supposed to get the hardware they needed to make these updates
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:49.920]   and what how did it affect the development of these iMacs.
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:54.720]   Well, so is this chip like the i the the ninth generation one these are literally
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:55.920]   fresh off the fab.
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:56.160]   Right.
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:00.320]   So I mean, like everyone always confuses Intel announcing a new generation with the actual
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:02.400]   chips for like all the range of chips.
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:02.560]   Yeah.
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:06.160]   Coming out and it takes months or a year sometimes to get the specific chips,
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.000]   especially the ones Apple uses.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.440]   What they supposed to shouldn't they didn't they say they're going to be shipping these
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:15.200]   like middle of last year or this is what all.
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.080]   Yeah.
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:23.360]   I thought that the story Intel is late with a new chip design to manufacturing is
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:28.560]   is they all these all these different news pieces tend to blob together in my brain.
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:32.880]   I have I tend to forget which one it is, but that's got to be an ongoing frustration with Apple
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:37.920]   that they can't really plan if they if they plan something with an amp with an arm processor,
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:42.960]   they know that something they're doing in house if they they have full control over that design
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:47.760]   and manufacturer, they know that if they're targeting October of 2019 for something,
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:49.120]   they're going to hit that target.
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:53.040]   If they've got a redesign for the Mac book, if they got a redesign for the iMac that centers
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:58.640]   around a really, really new like 16 core, whatever from Intel, they know that, okay,
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:04.240]   we're going to make sure that there's a that we can clear away some of this old stuff to make
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:08.640]   away for the new stuff, but we have to have a plan B just in case we don't get the product that we
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:12.000]   need in time to put it into the product that we want to make.
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:17.200]   So I think you I already know the answer to this, but the chat rooms wondering,
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:21.120]   do any of the new iMacs have the T2 chip? I don't think so, right?
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:25.280]   No, so they're not re-architected at all. They are literally just chip swaps.
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:29.440]   So Apple would have to re-architect them to put those in and that's not in the cards yet.
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:34.240]   Right. It's in competitive that the the T2 only I think only works with SSDs.
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.480]   They haven't they haven't made it compatible with anything spinning.
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:40.560]   So anything that has a fusion drive is not going to have a T2 unless as Renee says,
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.640]   there you go. That's their giveaway.
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:46.240]   And are they putting APFS on the fusion drives or the spinning drives? No.
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:51.680]   Here's your answer. We healed the floor.
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:58.080]   No, so they they pulled it and I didn't I mean, I think they reintroduced it.
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:00.160]   Like remember they warned people not to do it. Yeah.
[00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:05.440]   Okay. And I feel like they fixed that, but I don't I don't like fusion drives.
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:08.880]   So I went pure SSD and then Neguligently did not follow up.
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:12.800]   Scooter X in chat room says, yes, you can put APFS on the spinning drives.
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:17.200]   I don't know if they come with it on it though. You know, I maybe that may be a choice you have
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:22.320]   to make. I don't know. What what a word choice the fusion drive was to begin with it really.
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:27.120]   Apple is usually the company that says that we're not really going to invest in a transitional
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:30.640]   thing. We're going to go all in on the next thing that we know is coming and that we're
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:36.160]   helping to develop. It's amazing that it's interesting to me that they decided to go with this
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:43.280]   kind of tricky sort of hybrid drive that has been tried before, but hasn't been thought of as a
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:47.280]   really next generation thing, as opposed to saying, well, look, if you got if you need super,
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:51.760]   super fast, then you're going to spend extra for the SSD. If you're okay with the way that the
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:56.960]   things that the speed you get now, you get to 400 drives and get 70, 200 drives, we're not going
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:02.240]   to mess around with something that's sort of in between. It's it's not it's not like this is Apple's
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:08.880]   the 2019 version of the Twiggy Drive. I mean, it works, but it rates all kinds of problems for
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:14.160]   maintenance creates all kinds of problems for getting data off of getting data off of it if it
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:19.200]   fails. And they had this thing that was really, really good. That was again, if people wanted that
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:24.480]   extra speed that could spend extra money for it just seems a typical for me for for to me for Apple
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:30.800]   to have gone with this idea, which makes me think that maybe they had this is a plan B sort of thing,
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:34.720]   where they did think that they could see a few years in the future that we don't know what's going
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:39.840]   to happen to the SSD market the next three years. We need to have an alternative to speed up these
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:43.360]   these lower processor Macs to make them feel a lot faster than they are.
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:46.480]   I did ask. I did ask about that because I was like, was
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:52.640]   go ahead, Jim. I think part of the problem with that was is that you were looking at
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:59.760]   these fusion drives coming in at a time when SSD was so expensive, right, that having people
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:04.160]   just come in and say, okay, I want to spend that extra money on SSD, which you can now
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:11.840]   because the cost has come down. But at the time, they were trying to to work out how to
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:20.160]   have extra capacity in these machines and SSD at the same time and, you know, trying to mitigate
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:26.080]   the cost a bit for everybody. I'm a little disappointed that APFS hasn't really,
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:29.520]   they haven't done much with APFS. There's a lot more they could do, including
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:36.320]   snapshots. They could have replaced their cookie little hyper backup.
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:40.960]   Fixing it every I mean, I did ask about the fusion drives in specifically because it did
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:45.280]   it is an outlier now. And the answer I got was that it was an easy choice to go all SSD for
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:49.680]   laptops because laptops carried around and the chance the higher the rate of fall of failure is
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:55.680]   much higher for Mac mini and Mac Pro. Those are essentially external devices anyway. You have to
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:32:00.080]   hang a monitor off of it. So adding hanging drives off of it is not a problem.
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:04.800]   But for the iMac, it was a lot of families buying a lot of first time desktop customers buying it
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:08.160]   and they wanted everything all in one. They really bought into the all in one thing,
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:12.640]   and they but they wanted enough capacity to do their home movies and their photos.
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:16.800]   And this was sort of the best solution they could do was you can get the SSD if you want it,
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:21.840]   but it's expensive. We understand that. So to keep them to have the lower entry level price models,
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:26.720]   fusion was sort of the best of my my target worst of both, but the best of both worlds option for
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:32.480]   that computer. I mean, I correct myself. Apparently they are starting to turn on the snapshot feature
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:37.760]   of APFS. When you do a system update, it's all it's taking a snapshot. There's also
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:43.840]   going to do a scooter X a snapshot taken every hour, which I didn't know about. You have to use
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:48.960]   time machine. I think replacing time machine with something to use the snapshots would be a
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:55.840]   very good move. So those are so they are doing some stuff, but it's all kind of hidden away.
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:33:01.920]   Let's take a break because we just cleared the decks as Apple has getting all the new hardware
[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:06.960]   out of the way so we could think about the big announcement on Monday. We'll talk about that in
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:11.920]   just a little bit. First, I want to show you my my ring. In fact, I always enjoy this. I haven't
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:18.320]   done it yet. How well did I sleep last night? Let me fire up the Aura app and check my Aura
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:24.800]   ring, which is the best sleep tracker I've ever had an activity monitor. Aura ring tracks your
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:30.960]   sleep and activity 24/7 to build an accurate and insightful baseline of information so you can
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:35.760]   perform it your best. It has all sorts of stuff in it and infrared optical pulse measurement
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:41.920]   with a 3D accelerometer, a gyroscope. It even measures your body temperature. Now you ready?
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:47.360]   Show my app. Let's fire it up and it's going to update from my ring. It automatically updates
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:54.080]   using Bluetooth LE. It's very fast. I could see my rings charge state. Oh, my readiness is only 74.
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:34:01.120]   It says, "If you feel tired, Leo, don't push yourself too hard today." I did get a nice sleep
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:05.840]   score though of 78. That's for me. That's pretty good. I mean, most of you probably get
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:11.200]   nadys and 90s, but I'm happy. I can see when I look at my sleep score that I was awake for
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:17.760]   an hour and 57 minutes. I remember that. I was looking at my phone. I had dreaming REM sleep for
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:23.200]   an hour and 10 minutes, light sleep for 5/23, but oh, this is a little disappointing. Only 39 minutes
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:29.840]   of deep sleep. That is a little bit disappointing. You want more than that because, frankly,
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:36.320]   that's what's clearing out those cobwebs. You could see over a period of days, weeks and months,
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:43.440]   your sleep stages and how well you're doing. You can see what each sleep state tells you.
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:48.400]   For instance, my latency was very good. It took only six minutes to fall asleep.
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:53.920]   My restfulness, not great. My efficiency pretty low. Resting heart rate though. I'm pretty proud of
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:35:00.960]   that. 51 beats a minute. I'm practically dead. When you look at your readiness, you can see a lot
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:06.160]   of stuff. It's really amazing. This all comes from this little ring. This is a beautiful,
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:10.880]   very lightweight. It's made out of titanium. You can wear it everywhere. I wear it even in the
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:15.520]   hot tub in the shower and the bath. It's got these sensors right in here. Because it's on your finger,
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:21.520]   it's the most accurate heart rate monitor of all. The veins in your finger are actually
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:25.760]   right there on the surface. It's a much easier way to measure heart rate.
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:29.920]   Also measures temperature. I don't know of anything that measures temperature.
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:36.880]   Turns out your body temperature is a really strong indicator of overall health. If it starts to go
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:42.160]   up, you might be starting to get sick. We're only talking half a degree or less. I could see the
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:49.680]   trend of my body temperatures up a little bit. It was down last week. It's very, very interesting
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:55.120]   to correlate this to what's going on with you and what you've been eating, drinking,
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:04.000]   and how your stress is and all of that. It's just fantastic. You get such great insights,
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   guidance about when it's time to go to bed, when a best bedtime is sleep quality measurements,
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:15.520]   sleep stage tracking. The readiness thing is great too. Using heart rate variability,
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:20.240]   it turns out the more variable your heart rate is, the better. When your heart rate availability
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:26.080]   starts to go down, that means maybe you want to take a day off from your gym workout, things like
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:31.200]   that. Daily feedback gives you the information you need to better understand your body, improve
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:37.120]   your health, reach your goals. Now, this is all the good news. The bad news is these are super
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:42.400]   popular. If you order now, you won't get it till May. I just want to warn you, but you can go to
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:48.320]   order a ring, o-u-r-a-r-i-n-g.com and use the code TWIT and you'll get $50 off your purchase.
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:54.480]   They have two shapes, heritage, or the one I have around a rather balanced, which has a kind of a
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:59.440]   striking point. See, those are the balanced rings. I think they're really pretty. In silver, black,
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:04.320]   stealth, or diamond, I have the stealth, which is kind of a matte black. It's aging kind of nicely
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:10.560]   too. I really like how it's wearing. They even have a diamond version for an engagement ring.
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:17.040]   That's a little pricey at $9.99. Maybe that'd be a great wedding ring. Give one to your spouse.
[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:23.200]   The battery lasts full week and it charges fast, so I never take my ring off. In fact,
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:28.560]   really, I just charge it when I'm getting a massage. Once a week, I'll put it on the charging stand.
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:33.520]   That's plenty to keep it charged all week long. Uses Bluetooth LE. The data, by the way,
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:39.440]   this is a Finnish company. The data is absolutely secure. The Ringel store, six weeks of data,
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:43.840]   so you don't have to pair it to the phone, but once every six weeks, you want to do it every
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:48.480]   day to get those insights daily, but you don't have to. There are apps, as I showed you, for iOS,
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:52.560]   but there's also an Android app. I like using iOS because it automatically imports workouts
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:58.640]   from Apple's Health app. My workouts are imported into it automatically. Track your sleep, make the
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:04.560]   most of your day, and act now because it's going to take a couple of months to get it.
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:10.240]   Or a ring.com. Use a code "tuit at checkout." $50 off your purchase. They are making it faster
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:16.720]   and faster. I think maybe saying "may" is just so you don't get too disappointed, but I've been
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:22.240]   hearing from people that they are getting them a little faster. You are a rng.com. Use a code
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:28.800]   "tuit at checkout." You'll get $50 off your or ring. Everybody in the studio is now starting
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:38.720]   to wear these. It's really awesome. Really like it. Let's talk about Monday. Renee, you're flying
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:48.000]   out, right? Yes, sir. Jim, you could practically walk. I will be walking there. That's amazing.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:54.320]   He's going to walk over. The Steve Jobs Theater. I'm jealous of you guys because I think there's
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:39:00.240]   going to be some big celebs there. They're going to love eating Jim. They're going to just rush over
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:04.880]   to him all the Aniston's and the Lars Sands. They're going, "Oh my God, it's a beard!" I don't
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:11.680]   care about them. Only Jennifer Garner. She's got a new show. Yeah. Electra. JJ Abrams.
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:20.080]   Let me actually go through because the New York Times published a good summary of all of the content
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:26.080]   from that Apple has produced. What I didn't know and I learned from the New York Times summary is that
[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:30.160]   they already have a significant number of shows in the can. They've been working hard.
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:40.640]   Blue through that billion dollars pretty quick, I would guess. Let me see what it says here because
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:51.920]   I can't remember the exact number. Some number already in the can and many in the can and then
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:58.080]   many rapping. Half a dozen more on the verge of rapping. According to several people familiar
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:03.120]   with the shows, we're not authorized to speak publicly. They're going to do even more next year.
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:09.680]   Here's a rundown of what we know from the New York Times. This is the one that everybody's saying
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:16.560]   is going to be the flagship. This is this Reese Witherspoon Jennifer Aniston project.
[00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:23.600]   Steve Carell is in it from the office. Billy Crudup marked a plus. It is based on the cutthroat
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:32.000]   world of. Yeah, it's all stars. Cutthroat world of morning TV. Weird that the showrunner is Hillary
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.080]   Clinton's former press secretary, Jake Carson. That worries me just a little bit.
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:42.800]   And the supervising producer of House of Cards. Oh, I'm sorry. They were replaced.
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:48.560]   They were a little drama, Cornet of the Times. They were replaced by the co-creator of Bates
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:56.480]   Motel, Kerry Aaron and Brian Stelter, who is CNN's media guy, is the consultant on this.
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:03.200]   They're almost done with season one. They've committed to two seasons. In fact, Apple
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:10.480]   committed before seeing a script. So interesting. Amazing stories that rebooted the Steven Spielberg
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:19.920]   series from the duo behind the ABC series Once Upon a Time. Actually, that was also
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:24.960]   a show that the showrunner was replaced because according to the Times, the original producer's
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:29.440]   vision was too dark for almost everyone involved, including Mr. Spielberg.
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:34.880]   Also expected a rap soon. Octavia Spencer has been
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:43.520]   Instagramming pictures of Are You Sleeping? It's a drama based on a crime novel. And that shoot
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:49.680]   finished late last year, a sci-fi series called For All Mankind from the producer of Outlander
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:54.640]   and Battlestar Galactica, Ronald D. Moore. That's the one about if the space race never ended,
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:58.560]   right? Where there's two competing aggressively for space dominance. That sounds awesome.
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:04.960]   That's also in the can. Jason Momoa, who's hot today because of Aquaman, will keep his clothes
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:12.080]   on and stay out of the water in a fantasy epic called Sea, which the plot's a little weird. What
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:18.320]   would happen to humanity if everyone went blind? If he keeps his clothes on, the whole audience
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:21.600]   thing is going to fail. He's like an Instagram model. Will not let him take his clothes off.
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:26.080]   Apple apparently is being quite prudish in these. But it's abs. I mean, all he wants is a little
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:29.360]   bit of abs. You got to give people the abs. Give them the abs. I'll show mine.
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:36.800]   Well, Jim, the servers would just melt at that point. I show mine, but I don't think the screen
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:41.280]   is wide enough. We just all get those investors to loan shirts and then we'll be fine. Yeah,
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:48.160]   there you go. M Night Shyamalan has a new story. It's secret. Filming is over, but we don't know
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:54.720]   what it is. Little America from the, I love this because it's Camail Nanjani and Emily Gordon,
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:59.760]   the authors of The Big Sick. That should be fun produced by Elise Leisenberger, who's a producer
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:06.160]   of The Office. The folks who did it, it's always sunny, Rob and Charlie are back. They're going to do a
[00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:12.640]   sitcom. That was a pretty dark show, pretty weird show. I imagine Apple will be keeping an eye on that
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:19.440]   one. A cartoon musical from the creator of Bob's Burgers, Central Park, Josh Gad of Frozen.
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:29.520]   We'll be in that home. Fras is a unscripted, i.e. documentary from the maker of Scotty and the
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:35.760]   Secret History of Hollywood in Studio 54. We'll take viewers behind the lavish homes owned by
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:42.000]   non celebrities. It's Robin Leach. Yeah. Inside the lifestyles of the rich and infamous.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:49.200]   And if there's ever been a better moment in world in American culture, I like people who have
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:55.360]   millions and millions of dollars. Or is it San Francisco? Where here's my $8 million vote.
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:44:05.120]   Actually, you know, billions and succession, which are two HBO shows, actually one show time,
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:10.560]   the other HBO, about the super, super rich. We're both quite popular. People do like seeing a little
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:20.240]   peeking into that world. And then finally, Anemaly Dickinson comedy, a new spin on the
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:29.600]   reclusive poet of Amherst. They got your letter. Okay. So when are some losers in this one?
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:36.160]   The time says they've long ago spent their billion and they're well into their second billion,
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:41.840]   which is a trickle compared to Netflix and Amazon. Netflix is up to eight, I think, last year.
[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:47.600]   It's still a really, really laudable risk they're taking because
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:54.320]   they can, when they're designing a phone, when they're designing an iPad or a watch,
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:58.080]   they've got other things in the marketplace that they can really compare it to.
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:01.200]   You say, here's what here's what people are buying and here are the reasons why people are
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:06.480]   buying it. You can make something that is creative that has all the right creative people behind it
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:10.560]   and boom, it just sinks without a trace and you will never know the reason why.
[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:16.640]   So this is, this is, I do think that this does show a certain amount of courage in Apple's part
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:22.000]   to realize that they're going to sink a lot of money into huge names and huge talents and huge
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.400]   budgets. And it could just go away like the last Al Pacino movie did.
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:30.800]   Hearing Andy say that, I suddenly won an Aaron Sorkin show that goes behind the scenes of
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:35.680]   decisions to remove heads on Jack's from all the major companies. Like the meetings in between
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:41.360]   the keynotes. We did leave out shows that haven't yet began production, including an Oprah project.
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:45.280]   You mentioned Jennifer Garner. There's a project with her.
[00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:53.280]   There's, that's going to be JJ Abrams produced. Actually, JJ has two Apple series in the works,
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:56.720]   one with Jennifer Garden and one with a singer songwriter, Sarah Bareilles.
[00:45:56.720 --> 00:46:02.320]   And they have the alias together. So that'll be cool. Yeah. Oprah went for Damien Chazelle,
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:09.920]   the director of La La Land and First Man, Chris Evans. So some real all-star talent, although
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:18.640]   there's been some concern. We've mentioned it before that Apple may be a little bit
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:24.720]   prudish. That's a Disney thing right now too. Like they're all worried that Fox is going to lose
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:28.720]   its edge because it's moving into the Disney Empire. And it's fine to have Disney's as long as
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:34.240]   you also have Fox's. It's when they all start to go on right around the same idea that we lose out on.
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:39.600]   Apple was sensitive to, this is the New York Times article, Apple was sensitive to a reputation
[00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:44.400]   it earned early on as a home for uplifting programming with Liddler No Room for the gritty
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:49.200]   anti-hero fair that has defined many critically acclaimed series over the last two decades from
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:55.200]   Sopranos onward. Executives at the company bristled when they discovered there would be scenes involving
[00:46:55.200 --> 00:47:01.840]   crucifixes and Shyamalan's new thriller. This was the Wall Street Journal story we talked about
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:07.280]   last fall, but Apple ultimately, and this I hadn't heard, allowed the crucifixes to remain.
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:14.080]   So there's there's Apple of course had nothing to say about this article.
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:19.760]   God, I don't want to know about the context behind that. Yeah. Oh, leave the crucifixes.
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:30.480]   It's either it's either on the one hand it could be just God-swalloping stupidity of whatever or
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:34.960]   it could just be, you know, maybe you don't want someone to be clubbed over the head and killed with
[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:41.120]   a religious icon. Maybe it's tough because Hollywood does in HBO certainly in Showtime,
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:45.520]   let them get pretty darn edgy. And those shows have developed an audience.
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:52.640]   Sometimes it's appropriate. Like I still, you know, the series premiere of The Shield ends with
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:58.720]   a copying shot right in the face by one of those fellow cops. And that's what that is what feeds
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:06.160]   the entire seven seasons of the series tension and drama. And so we'll see. The other thing to
[00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:12.480]   keep in mind is that it doesn't even necessarily matter so much if every one of these series is a
[00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:17.200]   hit or is a flop. The whole point is to get people to sign up or to get behind this service.
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:22.960]   And if two years from now, they've got enough for momentum with subscriptions that they can
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:27.840]   simply say, here's a here's a playwright that we really, really like was a really great idea for
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:32.720]   comedy or drama. No one's heard of her, but we're going to we're going to green light her series.
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:38.480]   At this point, you really do need to have things on the shelf with recognizable logos or else people
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:44.560]   are not going to come into your store. Do we really have any idea what Apple's going to do though? I
[00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:49.440]   mean, for TV or for general, what are they going to do with this? Are they going to charge for
[00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:52.640]   they're going to give it away? Is it going to come with it? Some of us, some of us sounds like it's
[00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:56.160]   going to be free. Some of it sounds like it's going to be premium. And it's going to, because they
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:49:00.800]   don't have the back catalog the way Netflix does or a way like a Disney's going to have for a lot
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:04.320]   of the other services you're going to have, they're going to do sort of what Amazon does and let you
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:08.800]   bundle other subscribe to other services through them, except for Netflix, because we hate
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:12.720]   afflicts is a little wide. I already said no. Yeah, Netflix has already said no. There's not a
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:16.720]   lot of love. Which you can do in your Netflix. He was really interesting because he said he loved
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:21.680]   Apple. He loved working with them, but he wants people to only experience Netflix through Netflix's
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:26.560]   apps. And what Apple's already done with the TV app is for a lot of services, including Amazon Prime.
[00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:31.760]   You can the TV app will show you what you watch the most recent episode for it. Things that
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:35.520]   thinks you're interested in right there. So you go to one place and you see all the stuff you are
[00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:39.040]   watching and the stuff you might be interested in. And Netflix is like, Nope, don't want to go
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:43.040]   through that. You want to watch Netflix? You come to Netflix. It's not always the best experience
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:47.680]   because I'll see. Okay, the next, you know, the Showtime show we're watching and it'll launch.
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:52.640]   If I click it in the Apple TV app, but yeah, I mean, it's behind the scenes launching the
[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:58.160]   Showtime app and but it immediately starts that show playing. If I don't want to start there,
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:03.280]   if I want to go back, I have to exit out of the show and dig. It's not a great experience. Yeah,
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:06.960]   there's no clear hierarchy because it can't tell if you want to go back to the TV app or back to
[00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:10.880]   the it just launches what it thinks is next. And if it's wrong, that's not right.
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:16.560]   But that is strange because my Android TV devices have that behavior with Netflix. It's
[00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:23.040]   there is a my homepage is here's YouTube channel. Here's Hulu channel. Here's frequent apps. And on
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:27.760]   each one of the individual tiers of here's the here's your Hulu tier. Here's your Netflix tier.
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:32.320]   It's here's what you were just watching. You want to dive back into it. Here's some other things that
[00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:36.800]   as on Netflix that for God knows what reason has been placed inside this this preview pane.
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:42.800]   So there might be more going on than that though. Well, you can show the page like that's fine.
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:46.480]   There's one a commingled and it's like you Apple won't let like phone carriers show the
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:51.440]   iPhone with any other phone. It's what happens when yeah, yeah, I honestly would like to have
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:57.840]   Apple redesign Netflix app. It's crap. It's the most user hostile experience ever. I find myself
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:03.040]   trying quickly to jump from program to program so that the trailer doesn't launch. Yes,
[00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:07.440]   because all the trailers auto play it is native and they but they don't so they have a really
[00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:12.080]   good team a really smart team. The director on Twitter talks about it sometimes. It's a complete
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:17.520]   Apple app unlike the OpenGL apps that Google like YouTube and Prime have posted on us,
[00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:22.240]   but they don't allow you to choose to turn the kind of stuff off. That's right. Well, and on
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:27.440]   any platform it's the same on every platform. It's terrible. Leo, I'm so glad like when Jason said
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:32.880]   this when you said this, it makes me feel less insane because I don't know what it is but the
[00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:38.560]   way that my brain is wired up. But I do feel that tension that I've got. I can't stop long enough
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:43.760]   to read the description because it's going to start playing audio. It is absolutely true that I
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:49.200]   always mute the sound whenever I go to the Netflix app because otherwise for some reason,
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:54.560]   the auto play of sound interrupts my ability to really digest what's going on there. And if I
[00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:59.200]   could turn that off, I would and it annoys the hell out of me. Well, changing poster art. So I
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:02.560]   keep thinking there's new stuff that's not new. They just change the poster every three days.
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:06.960]   Good luck finding what you just were watching last night. There's no object permanence.
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:09.840]   Like it's like one thing you and David's nothing the other day. I can't tell what to do.
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:15.760]   Always start with what you just watched. Yeah, you know, you want episode two, it should be
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:22.960]   right at the top there. It's randomly distributed throughout. It's a terrible UI. Clearly, they're
[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:27.920]   good at what they do. It's clearly intentional. And it's my contention that they don't want you to
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:35.120]   think they want you to just watch. Just watch every. It's like a slot machine,
[00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:39.920]   video slot machine, keep them playing, keep them playing. Although, there's so much about
[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:47.120]   this business that's changed in the last five years. Just the psychological point of contact,
[00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:52.800]   the psychological interface, the idea that Apple wants you not to think that you're watching Hulu,
[00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:57.120]   you're watching YouTube, you're watching Netflix, they want you to think that you're watching Apple
[00:52:57.120 --> 00:53:02.720]   TV. And there are lots of content providers, but your point of contact is Apple computers,
[00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:07.600]   or excuse me, Apple Inc. As opposed to Netflix and Chills. Like, no, you're not going to go into
[00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:12.480]   Netflix and spend three hours looking at Netflix content. Your loyalty is not to Netflix. Your
[00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:19.600]   point of contact for all this is going to be Apple. So I think that's one of the reasons why we see
[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:25.280]   so many companies building all these little ecosphere like Disney, making sure that it's no
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:32.160]   longer good enough for us to have the ability to sell Disney content everywhere and making
[00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:36.160]   sure that everybody everywhere can see it. We want to make sure that people are not only
[00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:42.720]   going to be making money for us exclusively, not only is it going to be a signature for our own
[00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:48.000]   subscription service, but we want you to be a Disney watcher. We don't want you watching Disney on
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:53.520]   Netflix, Disney on this other channel, Disney on streaming, Disney on DVR.
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:58.640]   We want you to be a Disney customer, not a Disney watcher.
[00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:05.040]   Yeah, and it's not really consumer friendly because I often exit the TV interface on the
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:08.240]   Apple TV because I want to see what's on Showtime. And there's no...
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:09.840]   Beautiful. You wait. It's just not realized.
[00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:18.880]   Apparently Apple is this week scrambling to get everything set up for Monday. Mark Gurman writing
[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:23.520]   in Bloomberg, actually, this is from last week, Apple courts HBO and Showtime for service to
[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:28.240]   challenge Netflix. Sounds like they hadn't made the deal by last week.
[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:34.640]   But apparently most of the content in the initial launch of the service will be coming from these
[00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:40.720]   third parties, not from Apple itself, but HBO, Showtime, and stars. Otherwise, you just have a...
[00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:47.840]   Here's five shows you can watch. Just to get back for a quick second about
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:58.800]   some of these other partners in the video service, Apple doesn't like to share
[00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:03.280]   with those people either. They don't like to share customer information.
[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:09.360]   Yeah. Andy would say, "Disney wants you to be a customer of Disney." Well, that's absolutely true.
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:16.480]   But you would think that Disney would want to go out and have its content in as many places as
[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:23.280]   possible, but they want that information. They want to know what's going on. And Apple typically
[00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:29.680]   will not give that information out. So whether it's new subscriptions or whether it's Netflix or
[00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:37.280]   whoever. So that's something to consider too. That's an excellent point. And it works both ways too.
[00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:44.560]   One of the things that makes Amazon so troubling as an industry titan is that they are a marketplace
[00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:52.160]   for products, but they also have their own branded products. So as a result, they get to watch you,
[00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:58.640]   a manufacturer of batteries and cables, how you sell your stuff. They get to see how people are
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:04.400]   buying your stuff. They get to see what did they look at before they bought your stuff. And based on
[00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:08.800]   my customer profile, how to predict that I'm going to be buying that stuff myself. So therefore,
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:13.200]   they don't have to do a whole lot of marketing research. They get to look at the entire marketplace
[00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:18.560]   before they decide what to purchase and what to manufacture and how to price it. Apple can put
[00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:24.160]   themselves in the exact same situation where if your point of contact is Apple, they get to see
[00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:31.920]   that, wow, Andy, the moment that a new episode of Mrs. Maisel came on, he didn't even wait. He just
[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:38.080]   went and saw it right away. They get to see the demographics of people and what the demographics
[00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:43.120]   of their customers, what they're watching, did they abort after 10 minutes or did they immediately
[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:48.880]   go into like three hours worth of binge watching on this show. And that could inform their decision
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:55.360]   to produce new content for their own exclusive content channels. So there's a lot of back and
[00:56:55.360 --> 00:57:00.640]   forthness. There's a lot of variables in this calculus. And all of it basically puts Apple in
[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:06.000]   a really, really good position to become a good force the next three or four years. I don't know
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:11.120]   how they're honestly on Monday, I have no idea how they're going to pitch this. I have no idea
[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:15.600]   how they're going to sell it. I have no idea whether they're going to pitch this as this is the
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:22.640]   greatest union of Apple hardware software and and and services or whether they're simply going to
[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:28.160]   say we are Hollywood. We are a provider of we have always been at the intersection of liberal arts
[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:32.960]   and and and science. And this is the perfect this is the perfect point of content for us.
[00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:37.600]   But it's going to be it's clear that Apple is not just dawling around with this. This isn't just
[00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:41.840]   like Apple trying to say, Hey, we've come up with this new standard for iTunes so that if you want
[00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:47.600]   to have like album liner notes, here's a way to get album liner notes. This is a really big, big thing
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:52.000]   as big as Apple health. I figured it out. They made deals with all the agents who are now doing
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:56.560]   all the packaging for all the celebrities. So they bypass the entire industry. And they're just
[00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:59.520]   the thing that's curious to me though, it's not like we're going to have the new service and we've
[00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:03.280]   talked about that. But there's still rumors that they're going to do the gaming service as well.
[00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:08.320]   And Google just just now announced their gaming service. So what could Apple's be because I have a
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:12.880]   hard time thinking like Fortnite would just wrap themselves into a subscription package or Pokemon
[00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:18.000]   Go or any or Clash of Clans. Any of the games that are literally making billions a year. So what
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:24.960]   but are there games that are good and fun that wouldn't mind giving up IAPs and and other sorts
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:30.240]   of monetization options because they never really took off but would still in some be compelling
[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:34.880]   enough that someone would want to subscribe to Apple just for constant access to as many of them
[00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:41.200]   as they want. That's a great point. So draw us a picture of what we're going to see on Monday.
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:46.400]   Are they going to start with news and then the celebrities, you know, you got to save the best
[00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:51.600]   for last. Who will be there? What's it going to look like? It's going to be Academy Awards.
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:55.440]   Interfranis is going to walk out to introduce the first product. I think that would be great.
[00:58:55.440 --> 00:59:00.720]   They should be a lot of star power on stage. It's going to be a red carpet and a lot of you
[00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:04.720]   think that you think that some of these people actually had outfits made for this?
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:11.520]   10. Who are you wearing? Oh, of course. I'm honestly I'm not interested really in
[00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:19.600]   the star power. We all know that Apple can bring star power if they they want to whether it's music
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:28.480]   or Hollywood or whatever. I mean, that's not really of a whole lot of interest. To me, it's about the
[00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:37.280]   details of the service and where Apple is going, fundamentally where they consider themselves
[00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:45.200]   to be a part of this whole streaming industry now. That's what I'm most interested in and I'm
[00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:53.200]   interested to see how they're going to market it and where the pricing and all of that comes.
[00:59:53.200 --> 01:00:02.480]   And finally, I guess, Jennifer Garner. See, I honestly think that Apple will save that for a
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:07.920]   briefing and not Jennifer Garner, the first part and we'll focus on the Jennifer Garner. I think
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:13.520]   this is going to be more like the Oscars than it is a press briefing, but it's, you know, who knows.
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:17.600]   Michael Bay, Apple, you've seen the warning signs. You know what's going to happen if you have Michael
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:22.800]   Bay there. So just don't. I love, I love you. I just want to ask you, do you have like the number
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:29.520]   of a bail bondsman ready to go? I think Jennifer Garner is going to give Jim a big hug. She's
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:37.360]   electric. She can feel fine. Yeah. I think I don't know. I don't know. But I given Apple's aspirations.
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:41.920]   I honestly think they're going to play this up. This is going to be more Hollywood than it's
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:49.280]   going to be Silicon Valley. Yeah, I think I think so. It's it's I'm keen to see how they how they
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:55.280]   decide to spend that first five minutes where before they start bringing on the stars, before they
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:59.840]   start showing previews of these shows that we've been hearing about, but we haven't even seen so
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:06.640]   much as a God, how rare is it that you haven't even seen like a photo from the set leaked out
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:10.560]   somewhere on Instagram somewhere. But before they get into all that sort of stuff, they're
[01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:15.600]   going to have the world media attention. How are they going to use that first five minutes? What
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:19.520]   is it about Apple that they're going to want to promote that they might not have gotten any
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:26.880]   attention for beforehand? Or are they going to use that time to on a humanitarian sort of aid,
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:30.160]   excuse me, a humanitarian sort of purpose basically to say that, hey, we're still
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:36.560]   we want we want to we're concerned about these events that have been taking place.
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:42.160]   And we're monitoring this sort of stuff. It's it's an it's going to be one hell of an event. I often
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:49.600]   I don't always watch a live feed of something, but this is something where I really want to see
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:55.440]   not just the news that comes comes later. I don't just want to interview and talk to people and get
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:02:00.560]   briefed a couple days later. I really want to see every detail of how Apple presents this and how
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:05.360]   Apple uses this time, I think is going to show us something about this company in 2019.
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:11.040]   There was I remember the watch event. There were a few. Sorry Jim, go ahead. No, go ahead,
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:15.600]   Bernie. No, I was just going to say that at the watch event, they had PR there that were like
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:19.600]   people from the fashion world there. And I remember a few people who looked like no jokes
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:23.920]   right out of the fifth element like with these giant here, and amazing costumes. And they were
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:29.040]   like, Oh, this feels like a fashion event, doesn't it? It really feels like it's fashion. And that's
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:32.640]   exactly what they wanted. And they were they were the people hovering over the gold watch table.
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:36.960]   And it just it had that vibe. And it sounds like they're going like they're going to have a lot
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:40.000]   of entertainment media there. And you know, new media that kind of stuff.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:45.600]   Angela Aron's left. Apple stopped selling the edition. But not that kind of fashion. This is
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:50.640]   this is not like the watch thing. This is like the whole internet media generation,
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:53.600]   like yeet, you know, someone's going to yell yeet and just everyone's going to go.
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:03:00.160]   And it is it is a case, I think that when you're in a plateauing market where it's hard to get
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:05.280]   differentiators from a technological perspective, the only way to get people back in the market is,
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:12.240]   you know, the the the categories that do well are fashion, where you have update or refresh every
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:17.520]   season or cars, wherever year there's a new car, there's no technological change, frankly,
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:23.600]   premiere to year, but people buy the fins. And I think Apple's in its fin stage. So I suspect
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:28.800]   they'll really push the flash. They'll push the fast. Well, they pass up aggressively, make any
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:34.160]   reference to the Spotify stuff. We'll get to Spotify in a second. That's interesting. I also
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:42.000]   thought it was interesting. The Andy mentioned that ready. And he mentioned the the idea of being
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:47.840]   politically aware. And that may happen as well. Because remember, it's hard to get
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:55.600]   the Oprah's of the world to come to your stage in Cupertino. You can't offer what are you going
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:04:00.560]   to offer Oprah money. You can't offer her money. But if you if you're doing it in a good cause,
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:04.240]   you're much more likely to get these celebrities to show up. They're not there to line Apple's
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:08.240]   pockets. They've already lined their pockets. But if it's for a good cause, maybe it's a little
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:14.240]   easier to get them. So I wouldn't be surprised to see something like that, Andy, actually, but more
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:18.400]   unfortunately more about getting celebrities to show up than anything else.
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:22.880]   Well, it's it's a this is an event. The likes of which Apple has never thrown before.
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:26.960]   They've never they've never done it. They've had they've had some huge names. I
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:31.680]   if if anybody asks me, Hey, who the great who the greatest live acts you've ever seen,
[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:35.360]   I can give them a list that will make them super envious. I just won't tell them that. I know I
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:40.160]   didn't go to Apple. These were these were the other and one more thing. By the way, here's you
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:45.680]   too. Like how did Apple get you to with Project Red, right? But they really went all out supporting
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:51.280]   Bono's right AIDS efforts. But what what I was going to get at is that that was, Hey, here's a
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:55.600]   here is a tech event where we're going to be talking about and promoting our technology.
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:05:00.400]   They've had events where it's been mostly about the software. They have never had an event that is
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:06.640]   100% a cultural event. This is all about stuff that we are we're not just we're not just bringing up
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:13.600]   musicians and movie makers and book writers whose work we are selling in our store. We are producers,
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:18.560]   we are we made the selection. We sought out these people. This is a group of people that we feel
[01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:22.960]   that will represent excuse me, who's going to be doing the sort of work that we want to present
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:27.920]   and we want to put our associate our names with. So this is going to be event the likes of which
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:35.280]   we have never seen from Apple ever. Historically, it's been an ungainly relationship between Silicon
[01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:40.400]   Valley and Hollywood and so angry about the music. They're just so angry about the music.
[01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:46.960]   And and Apple's already you know, they're competing with the likes of HBO and Showtime and stars and
[01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:54.720]   even Amazon has more of a kind of Hollywood glitter Disney soon Disney so many so they're the only
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:06:00.160]   really pure Silicon Valley play in this space. Go ahead Jim. That's that's part of the problem.
[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:06.400]   Look at look at this as a from a consumer standpoint. By the way, Leo, I get a new haircut for you.
[01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:11.360]   I like it. By the way, I noticed it almost has a notch though. I just careful.
[01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:21.280]   If you turn me upside down, I could be Jim. If you look at this from a consumer standpoint,
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:30.560]   we have Hulu and we have Netflix and we have Amazon that are already entrenched and that have
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:36.320]   great programming that we're watching. So how is Apple going to fit into all of this?
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:44.320]   I don't know if bringing stars out is going to be enough. But you know, looking at the roster of
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:50.960]   shows that they have, you know, Leo, you said it there's depending on what your your likes are.
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:55.760]   There's some sci-fi. There's some thrillers, you know, a little bit in there for everybody comedy.
[01:06:55.760 --> 01:07:01.120]   You know, there's a few shows in there that I'm certainly interested in watching. But
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:06.560]   it's a matter of fitting that in. And I think that's where the key is going to come from this
[01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:14.640]   event. It's going to be how Apple prices it. Do they, Apple music they gave away for three months.
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:19.040]   Are they going to give away the video service for three months for people to try? Are they
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:25.520]   going to combine pricing? You know, that if the pricing is, you know, for Apple music and the video
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:31.680]   services, five extra dollars a month, let's say, you know, somebody might say, well, yeah, it's only
[01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:37.040]   five bucks a month. I can add that on to what I already have. But if it's an extra 15, they might
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:44.640]   say, I've already got Netflix and Hulu. I'm fine. I don't need that. Yeah. And Apple's the details.
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:49.040]   History is not good in this regard. I mean, the two shows Apple's already done.
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:55.840]   Haven't been great. Carpool karaoke was okay. And Planet of the Apps was
[01:07:55.840 --> 01:08:02.160]   god awful. We do not speak of these of this time. And it's Apple's going to get a real lesson
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:08.640]   in Hollywood economics because you only make if you only have five shows, chances are only one of
[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:15.440]   them is going to be a hit at best. And it's I think I think that Apple's already learned that lesson
[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:22.560]   from those two shows in particular, especially Planet of the Apps, which was just awful.
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:30.960]   I think Apple threw that out to see what was going to happen. They may have been surprised or
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:39.040]   maybe not with the response from it. But looking at all of the people that they got into produce and
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:45.040]   write and star in these shows, it seems to me that they've learned a very big lesson.
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:50.400]   And by watching what other people have done, like Netflix, I mean, Netflix is going to be,
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:57.120]   I believe, last week that Netflix is going to be in the double digit billions in investing in
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:05.520]   original content this year. So I mean, that Apple's not there yet. And it would be silly for Apple
[01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:11.920]   to go out and spend double digit billions in TV programming before they launched these first
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:18.480]   shows to see, okay, what's popular with our crowd and what's not popular. And then they move on
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:23.280]   from there. But eventually they will be they'll probably outspend the rest of them.
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:28.720]   Yeah, and they also have this huge, huge safety cushion of money behind them so they can keep on.
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:34.640]   They have the Apple has the ability to absolutely write its own destiny. They don't have to make
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:39.600]   this a success right out the right out the door. All they have to do is have maybe,
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:44.960]   not even necessarily a smash hit, but the kind of shows that people like enough that they want,
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:48.320]   they're going to want to blog about it, the kind of stuff that the New York Times is going to want
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:53.840]   to say, this is a really, really good stuff. More importantly, if they can get some awards
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:58.400]   the next couple of years, they get an Oscar two years or three years from now. That is all they
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:04.720]   need to basically make sure this is an ongoing concern. And as far as Planet of the Apps goes
[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:09.440]   and Carpool Karaoke, I don't necessarily even see them as failures. There there there would be
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:15.760]   failures if we knew that Apple had great hopes for them as enduring signature money makers.
[01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:22.160]   I get the feeling that they believed in those shows. They wanted to make those shows. But the
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:27.920]   point of those shows was let's we know we're going to be launching this huge thing in a couple of
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:34.240]   years. Let's get a couple of shows out so that we are that part of the business has some stuff to
[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:41.840]   work on and will learn from these relatively low risk shows how the giant corporation of Apple
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:47.280]   will interface with producers of individual shows and the talent that works on their shows.
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:52.960]   So I don't think it was necessarily a failure. It was a beta. It does have the risk of damaging
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:58.960]   the brand. It was the rocker. It was the rocker phone of content. And in fact, Apple will be chasing
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:05.840]   Oscars. Gurman reported this week that Apple has hired Oscar Chasers, a team of people with
[01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:13.680]   awards strategy experience to go after Emmys and go after Oscars. It's kind of ironic that one of
[01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:18.720]   their producer, Steven Spielberg has come out saying streaming services shouldn't be eligible
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:23.280]   for the Oscars. Awkward. Maybe they're going to have a big game. I saw the documentary on it.
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:30.000]   Wow. Is that not at all what I thought the Oscars were like? Yeah. No, it's Oscar night in Canada.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:36.080]   Is that what you're saying? Yeah. We have the Junos. They count. Green Ryan Reynolds. They count.
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:42.560]   That's it really says something about their interest in this platform that they are. They
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:48.080]   are hiring these sort of people because I have I have I am one of those people who starts like
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:54.240]   making their little Oscar like betting slips. They're the little there. I'm so non sports.
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:12:00.240]   I don't even know like people are making their their their. What is it? God, what is it? Brackets.
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:04.240]   Thank you very much. I don't know. I start I start thinking of an Oscar bracket.
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:12.160]   This could be this could be a new year. And the amount of money that gets spent to essentially buy
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:18.080]   an award for and it's not like it's not like the the Golden Globes where you can pretty much influence
[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:22.720]   100 the 100 people who vote for this. We're talking about you really do have to have a
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:27.200]   political campaign that starts month. Oh, go down. Go down to L.A. you know,
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:32.560]   towards the end of the year and their billboards in theirs for your consideration and there's all of
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:38.000]   this. They send out a lot of stuff. There is a huge in fact that's what Netflix did to get Roma.
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:43.520]   All of its nominations and its three Oscar wins. They spent a lot of money on a person to do this.
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:46.000]   Now here's the final question before we move on.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:54.720]   Is this apple chasing the wrong in the the wrong era? Is this apple trying to emulate old Hollywood?
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:13:01.120]   Just as old Hollywood is fading away. Shouldn't I mean look at YouTube. Look at this YouTube
[01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:05.280]   stars. Look at the revenue YouTube's generating. Look at that controversy though that apples
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:12.080]   go. But it has nothing to do with modern entertainment and I don't know if Jennifer Aniston is going
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:17.280]   to draw an audience under 40. Jennifer really want to wake up with their biggest star talk about
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:27.040]   what he did or not. We're all a little bit older here. I don't know if this what apples
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:32.640]   creating is going to appeal to the new generation of consumers. Give them Game of Thrones. I'll be
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:39.120]   happy. Yeah. Well see that's I think YouTube might even show why this is a great idea because
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:45.200]   this isn't the 70s or the 80s anymore where you had to make a you get a hit show like Friends by
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:51.920]   making something that a great number of people like you can have now a hit by making a show that
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:57.360]   a lower number of people absolutely love. Like again like Mrs. Maisel or like one of my favorite
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:14:01.600]   shows the past 10 years one day at a time which I'm a little bit heartbreak and broken the
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:08.240]   down to the other series and is this something that everybody is talking about? No but it does
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:13.920]   what it needs to do for the for Netflix which is that it brings in a demographic of people that
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:19.440]   maybe they're not getting with their with their other programming and it also means that this is
[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:25.600]   getting a lot of prestige talk about it. People are the people are saying what it really is a
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:33.440]   magnificent show it almost I don't want to I love it so much that I have to almost restrain my
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:37.440]   praise for it because I don't want to sound quite so silly it almost transcends what you think a
[01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:44.080]   sitcom should be and that's really all a streaming show has to do it has to find its niche it has
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:48.720]   to be something that's a little bit apart from everybody else and just like the making a smaller
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:54.800]   iPad just like making a $329 iPad just like making a thousand dollar iPad you need to make sure that
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:59.440]   there's somebody there with attention to that that's willing to be spent that there's a product
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:04.240]   for that person so as long as they fit all of those little holes I think they're going to do it
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:10.720]   they're never going to they're never going to get a Paul whatever the jerk youtuber that keeps
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:14.720]   getting in trouble every couple of months they're never going to get Jake Paul and Logan Paul thank
[01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:21.120]   you they're they bisected like any good amoeba but the they're never going to get 12 year olds
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:27.120]   that are as passionate about their about an apple branded series as someone who is just doing stuff
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:31.200]   off the top of their head they're going to find that kind of fandom nor do they have to they're
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:36.480]   their apple and part of their brand is making sure that we're not just going to we're not just an
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:41.200]   open channel for anybody to post anything on at some point somebody had to be convinced that this
[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:45.840]   was a good idea before we decided to put this as part of our package well there's also kind of an
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:53.520]   unknown at eddy q has said apple is unlikely to seek exclusive rights for sports but I think it was
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:57.840]   actually Alex Lindsey who brought this up a couple of weeks ago he's of the opinion and I'm
[01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:05.600]   increasingly agreeing with him that the the major networks rights to this the NFL MBM Major League
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:10.720]   Baseball NBA those are about to expire in the next couple of years and he says and I think he's
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:15.760]   absolutely right it's going to be the big digital giants like Amazon that are going to outbid the
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:20.240]   networks not making a phone Leo that's what they said and then the iPhone can you imagine that
[01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:25.440]   Eddie not wanting to do sports yeah the man almost misses all the wdc for the Warriors game every
[01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:30.400]   year and honestly if you have a subscription service and it's the only place you can watch the NFL
[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:33.200]   it's over game over man
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:40.400]   but people with people Stanford though like is every single sports fan going to be willing to pay
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:45.840]   are they are they going to feel like it's sort of a dereliction of the
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:51.040]   relationship between the fans and the sport to say that no you no longer get this free over the
[01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:55.760]   air you know I'll get a certain number of shows over the year we've us we've exclusively sold the
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:17:01.440]   NFL we've exclusively sold the Super Bowl for God's sake to a streaming service that's a pay
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:07.440]   per view that's going to happen and may not happen it's gonna happen and because the budgets
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:13.440]   are of these companies just too huge and and if apple for instance bought that franchise and
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:20.080]   they certainly can afford to that's the one last thing at least in America that we all gather to
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:24.640]   watch well I'm sure it's true in the rest of the world it's just not football it's football
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:30.000]   yeah or hot curling but that that's the one there is you can't think of any you know it's a
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:34.720]   lot of otherwise it's a lot of slices of niches like one day at a time but sports is one thing
[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:40.080]   it cuts across all boundaries you know you just maybe think yes you just maybe think of something
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:45.520]   for the for the very very first time we talk about how apple is they promote themselves as and to a
[01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:51.760]   great degree they actually are very very interested in being a positive force in society what a great
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:57.440]   opportunity they would be to say guess what we've bought exclusive rights to the to WNBA and so
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:02.640]   we are going to promote it as though we care about this as though we seize this as a point of pride
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:07.120]   for us and so you are going to be able to watch WNBA games and also we're going to put enough money
[01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:13.520]   into the league that these people who these stars these wonderful athletes will actually be
[01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:20.160]   paid like professional athletes and not like Walmart managers this would be I would love to see
[01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:27.360]   them to be essentially ESPN 2 only treating all these sports extremely seriously that would get
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:35.120]   my attention really quick great article today in sports on Sports Illustrated Si.com about Apple's
[01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:43.840]   sports surveillance room there this is basically a war room it's what informs the sports portion of
[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:50.160]   Apple TV which right now just tells you what you can watch on the major networks but when you're
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:55.360]   doing something this big and you're putting this much money into it it could indicate despite Q's
[01:18:55.920 --> 01:19:02.400]   denial a real interest in that kind of thing and I honestly if you want to make a subscription
[01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:08.640]   service succeed even if you just got college football you know you maybe you don't have to have
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:15.600]   the the big guys but college football is huge right there's too much money in the NCAA is so
[01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:21.440]   money focused that I don't think that they would want any offer from Apple I think that's why I
[01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:27.120]   think that they're there I imagine that their big opportunity is in the sports that haven't been
[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:32.480]   super monetized yet the the the sports that don't have an electronic arts game yet
[01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:41.520]   it's the XFL they all want the XFL the NCAA's contract was for 8.8 billion dollars with CBS and
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:48.160]   Turner it goes to 2020 from 2025 to 2032 so the NCAA isn't going to be available
[01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:54.800]   for a while but 8.8 billion dollars is chump change to Apple they could double that they could
[01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:59.840]   double that offer how much what could they buy with a billion dollars if they on more than one thing
[01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:08.240]   could they right now it's sitting in a CD and the first national bank they might as well
[01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:15.120]   as well spend it well it's it's it's seed money once again the the definition of power in a company
[01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:21.440]   is the ability to call its own shots to basically decide its own its own future and so long as they've
[01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:26.880]   got all that money that's making money for them I don't think that I don't think I think 8 billion
[01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:30.720]   dollars is way more than chump chump change I would take one tenth of that in cash if they offered it
[01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:35.280]   yeah can I suggest that they pay us half of that for a second exclusive edition of Mac Break Weekly
[01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:39.520]   every week where we tell them what's wrong and how they can fix it there you go I'll do it for a
[01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:44.480]   billion can I say the fed amount of money I would say whatever the hell Apple wants me to say
[01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:49.520]   I've noticed that I can't actually I just said for a billion dollars I understated the amount and
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:56.160]   it's not by the way for all of the NCAA it's just for the tournament 19.6 billion dollars total
[01:20:56.160 --> 01:21:01.920]   contract it's not still double that it's not it's pretty it's it's pretty nice when you've got
[01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:06.080]   you when you claim that you've got a moral that it's a moral point for you not to pay your athletes
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:12.960]   yeah yeah athletes are free yeah I would take a break there is a lot more to talk about Spotify
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:17.680]   for sure and Google announced something today maybe we can talk about how that impacts Apple it's

[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:30.080]   continued to be a great support to our show so thank you FreshBooks. Spotify it's gone back and
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:34.800]   forth back and forth I did we show the Spotify website I can't remember last week time to play
[01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:41.520]   fair I don't think so no we I talked about it on other shows Spotify by the way changed it
[01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:48.640]   really quickly after they put it up there and Jim is our music lover are you a Spotify user Jim?
[01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:59.120]   I have been a Spotify user yeah but Apple music has really fixed the way that it does a lot of
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:04.960]   recommending and and integration although I did get upset over the weekend because it replaced
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:12.880]   some of my songs with live versions yeah so that and these were playlists that that I had built
[01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:20.560]   and they were there for a long time and all of a sudden I was playing the playlist and there was
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:26.160]   a live version of a song that now when I picked the studio version and the studio version had been
[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:34.400]   there for you know a year or more so that was frustrating but well Spotify in its website time
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:41.360]   to play fair.com would avert that the reason that you switched is because of anti-competitive moves by
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:47.680]   Apple for instance bundling bundling and charging more you know Apple of course takes 30 percent
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:55.760]   out of Spotify's cut and that means that they can charge you 30 less Apple can for Apple music
[01:25:55.760 --> 01:26:02.960]   they pointed out and somebody said this is not the case but they says according to Spotify
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:10.320]   you can't you can launch Spotify on the iPhone but you can't say play that playlist
[01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:16.080]   I don't think they say a lot of things are specific to Spotify that are actually just part
[01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:20.080]   of Apple's continuing you know like they they didn't let us make an Apple watch app on day one
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:24.640]   when the no ability existed to actually make Apple watch it I think there's a lot of merit to
[01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:29.120]   Spotify's case I think they have a lot of facts on their side especially in the EU which historically
[01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:34.640]   uses competition and not consumer welfare to judge these sorts of cases but through this website
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:39.600]   and this video they don't argue facts all the time they don't stick to them at least they make a lot
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:44.480]   of emotional arguments they make a lot of as fans of Spotify you are being affected they say they
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:49.840]   transpose lack of options on their parts a lot of it's just it I think they have a sound case and
[01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:53.760]   could win on the merits but they're making a lot of strategically weird decisions to me and how
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:58.960]   they're choosing to prosecute well and Apple it kind of an unprecedentedly released a long press
[01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:04.960]   release contesting many of Spotify's points which they couldn't do if they just stuck to the fact
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:09.920]   that's the thing is like Apple couldn't have done a lot of this if Spotify had been clearer and more
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:15.680]   factual in their original argument yeah yeah and not done it as a series of cartoons I think yeah
[01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:21.760]   Apple Apple did the one thing that Apple didn't address in the net that the newsroom piece was the
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:28.880]   was the most damaging thing that Apple that Spotify said that yes we don't want to have to pay this 30
[01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:34.960]   percent even if it does go down 50 percent but the big deal is that Apple your music service
[01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:38.880]   doesn't have to pay that 30 percent or that 50 percent and wasn't it interesting that when we
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:45.200]   raised our prices you basically introduced your service at our old price that's the thing that that
[01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:50.880]   with remember that the Spotify released this as part of their complaint with the EU basically saying
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:55.120]   EU you should go after these we're basically filing an actual legal claim against Apple for
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:28:01.440]   anti-competitive processes that this is the sort of thing that will really really stick with the EU
[01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:05.760]   when they but running is absolutely right when they make these sort of emotional arguments
[01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:10.400]   it's those those are the things that you just take right off of the top to try to get at the
[01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:15.280]   real protein of the argument and it's just a distraction it gives and it gives Apple other
[01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:19.600]   things to address that they can easily address like gee why didn't you tell them that we we cut
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:24.480]   the price down after the first year of a subscription that yeah I guess they should have mentioned that
[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:31.600]   as well Spotify also says Apple disregards its own rules this is a case with a lot of the store
[01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:36.160]   where Apple does things that other apps can't including sending promotional notifications
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:41.440]   and this one says give a friend a free month of Apple music whereas third party apps aren't
[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:48.160]   allowed to do that but but again I'm just quoting Spotify's time to play fair site there's a couple
[01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:52.560]   I mean there's a couple of this thing a couple of these things are really like we we talked about
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:56.960]   the news service and people said there was a 50/50 split on it and some people were outraged
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:29:01.760]   and the big papers were never going to pay it but other papers that had no access to distribution
[01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:06.720]   channels thought that 50 percent of hundreds of millions of users was way better than 95 percent
[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:12.640]   of hundreds of dozens of users and Spotify does not benefit from Apple's scale at this point because
[01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:17.440]   they're a big enough service on their own but there are other apps and other businesses that do
[01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:21.520]   benefit from the scale of being on the app store so it's not a black and white thing there might
[01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:26.720]   just have to be you know contact around how much you charge and to who and they're real they're
[01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:30.480]   also they didn't distinguish they're like oh they let uber do things they don't let us do when
[01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:35.760]   apple has never charged for in real world services but always charged for digital services and for
[01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:40.720]   example my local restaurant will deliver to me for free but if I want uber eats I have to pay
[01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:46.560]   extra for it and that's not unfair to uber eats that's me paying a convenience fee and maybe I'd
[01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:51.600]   be willing like if apple apple should absolutely allow me to pay for Spotify through the web on
[01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:57.200]   Spotify if I want but just like I use the Mac app store I would like to use the on app store in
[01:29:57.200 --> 01:30:02.240]   many cases because it's central I trust the payment transactions it's convenient for me to only have
[01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:07.360]   one place to go to update everything and I think I think Spotify again wins on some of these arguments
[01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:13.200]   but I think apple wouldn't lose by not doing some of the things that it does either yeah so
[01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:21.440]   who's right in the shoot more and they can think about what they what Renee said earlier that
[01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:28.480]   they're they're both right in in a lot of regards I mean Spotify I don't know why they kind of went
[01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:33.840]   off the rails with some of their stuff but they do have a couple of good points but they gave apple
[01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:42.400]   enough to come back with some very valid points of their own yeah so you know it's it's going to
[01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:45.520]   be an interesting battle and there's no way that this is anywhere near
[01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:52.400]   being finished but and this is the court they made Microsoft do the browser ballots you never
[01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:56.880]   know what's going to happen and that was real like I always thought that was really dumb at the time
[01:30:56.880 --> 01:31:01.520]   because chrome was on its way to being competitive Firefox was competitive and they had to have like
[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:10.720]   what was it schlepnir and yarmungonder browser ballot the infamous Icelandic browser yeah so earlier
[01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:14.320]   today we by the way we will be streaming the apple then I forgot to mention this
[01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:19.760]   we're going to take our life in our hands and do what we always do which is take apple stream
[01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:26.640]   and comment on it uh 10 a.m. on monday that's 10 a.m. pacific 1 p.m. eastern time
[01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:34.080]   1700 UTC so I hope you'll come by and and watch I think what we're going to do well I won't say
[01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:38.240]   what we're going to do I think we're going to well what can I say you think it I should keep
[01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:46.640]   it a secret all I could say one word puppets uh I have a suggestion that I think might work if
[01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:51.920]   you want it yeah you put it in a you put it slightly boxed and you have a source apple in the bottom
[01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:56.960]   left corner we could put source apple on it that's not a bad idea um
[01:31:56.960 --> 01:32:06.720]   the debate the internal debate is it it's fair use it's commentary uh so it's fair use
[01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:12.640]   so I don't want to do anything that kind of says well okay yeah maybe it's not quite fair use
[01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:17.520]   but I think source apple is not a good idea yeah I only I've only ever had one video flagged it was
[01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:21.680]   a wwc video where I was literally so tired I forgot to put that on yeah that's a good idea
[01:32:21.680 --> 01:32:28.000]   when I added it when I added it I had no further problems yeah that's that's a good idea so we will
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:34.480]   uh we'll do that that's a great idea uh we did stream without event google's gdc keynote right
[01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:41.280]   before the show today and which they announced stadia which is a really interesting play from
[01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:49.680]   google not unexpected uh in a nutshell it's a gaming platform that uses google's powerful
[01:32:49.680 --> 01:32:56.480]   servers to render the game and allows you to play on almost any dumb device even a Chromecast
[01:32:56.480 --> 01:33:01.200]   ultra connected to a tv google says they're going to do a controller to go with it that does
[01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:08.320]   some interesting tricks to reduce latency uh stadia is I you know and they're announcing at the game
[01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:13.600]   developers conference so their goal was to get developers working with them there aren't any
[01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:19.920]   big name games coming out at least so far although they had somebody from id talking about a new
[01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:25.040]   generation doom game that's not anything that's going to warm the heart of modern gamers and they
[01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:29.840]   also announced some interesting features including first of all they're going to use youtube as part
[01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:34.640]   of the platform for this so you could be watching a gaming video on youtube whether live or recorded
[01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:39.840]   and there'd be a button that says play now you press it in the browser and the game starts
[01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:46.320]   playing almost instantly no downloads no updates no configuration you're playing the game as fast
[01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:52.320]   as they say 4k 60 frames per second what they didn't say is that's going to depend an awful lot on
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:58.400]   what your internet service provider let's you get away with yeah I have no doubt this google has the
[01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:04.720]   server capacity in fact there are they got a special and vidya chip or ops or amd chip designed
[01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:10.960]   uh for this that they say is going to give them 10 teraflops or performance you'll have a dedicated
[01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:15.920]   stadia server you might even have the game rendered on multiple servers and with that kind of performance
[01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:21.440]   they out they actually have better server side performance than an xbox or playstation 4 but
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:27.760]   again they've got to push it down that pipe that's controlled by a bunch of monopolistic
[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:32.560]   companies at least in the us and uh it's unknown how that experience is going to be
[01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:36.960]   um it's interesting they didn't say anything about price in fact the only thing they say about
[01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:42.560]   availability was sometime this year it's free as long as you turn the camera on kidding i don't know
[01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:50.080]   i bet they're gonna have to they're gonna have to release the do this in stages i think i don't
[01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:54.320]   think they can possibly open up all the tabs and let millions of people who are sampling the
[01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:59.360]   service in at the same time they're gonna have to say it was here their first 100,000 invites went
[01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:05.520]   out now here's another 500,000 invites um i i was part of the assassins creed trial did you use to
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:10.800]   play the assassins creed honesty on your chrome browser i was i was super impressed it worked just
[01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:17.200]   it worked great but the thing is um i'm not a typical gamer i'm not the person who was uh i
[01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:23.760]   don't have a special pair of gaming socks for for to increase my performance in playing the games
[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:29.360]   i'm i'm a really casual gamer but the thing is it really did feel like i was attached to a
[01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:35.520]   well-performing pc a well-performing console but but i have no idea how this is going to scale up to
[01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:40.560]   once you have millions and millions of people trying to use the service at the same time or
[01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:45.200]   millions tens of millions hundreds of millions of people uh when they scale it up to worldwide
[01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:51.440]   and also the first time that's it's not just latency affecting your performance in the game they can't
[01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:58.240]   even have the the they they can't even let people imagine that the reason why they got killed was
[01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:02.000]   because it was the stupid streaming game servers that they're never gonna trust never gonna play
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:09.040]   again so hard really really interesting uh but i'm curious to see what the marketing of that is
[01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:12.960]   like the people who are interested enough in gaming that they want these really wonderful
[01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:18.880]   experience but aren't necessarily willing to spend two to five hundred dollars on a game console
[01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:24.800]   i don't know what that market is well it's i think anybody who has a game console or gaming pc is
[01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:29.920]   not the market you know unless they're mobile i mean you could also you could do it on your android
[01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:34.480]   phone in the subway well okay maybe remember that diablo press conference leo i'm sure that's
[01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:40.000]   their reaction to this right now yeah yeah i also there's some also with some interesting features i
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:45.280]   mean the integration with youtube the potential for e-sports that name stadia does kind of imply that
[01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:52.640]   uh the fact that you can save a game state and share it which means that i could say oh this was
[01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:58.000]   a really good part andy let me send it to you and then you could pick up gameplay at that exact
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:03.200]   point with all the same inventory my character that's really interesting there's how soon before
[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:07.440]   someone figures out how to sell that as a marketplace thing we will take you to nearly the end of cup
[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:12.960]   heads yeah get to start at the final level isn't that interesting i never thought of that uh so
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:19.200]   i think that google has thrown a lot of stuff against the wall uh the devil being the implementation
[01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:22.960]   that's my question it's like because we we wonder about apple moving further and further
[01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:27.280]   field from what you would consider core technology not a lot of this is core to google but it goes
[01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:31.520]   back to like how many industries can all these companies be in and be in them well right before
[01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:36.640]   they end up being general electric or something right no chance apple would consider something like this
[01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:45.040]   uh never i mean the subscription gaming service might be a different take on this yeah yeah it's
[01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:50.000]   an interesting idea of course they're going head to head with microsoft's subscription service
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:55.520]   which downloads the content onto your xbox uh google does have a sorry sony does have a streaming
[01:37:55.520 --> 01:38:03.360]   service uh they bought guy steamed steamed which isn't quite uh streaming but yeah uh we'll have
[01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:09.840]   streaming soon microsoft will have streaming soon uh yeah i have well it's i i was gonna say that i
[01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:15.680]   don't i don't know if apple would want to do that but i uh my uh set top box is uh the Nvidia shield
[01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:21.920]   uh which also does screen streaming games through Nvidia and you know what uh it doesn't cost more
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:27.360]   than what an apple tv would cost me i get this gaming feature so somewhat for free and i have
[01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:33.200]   bought a few games just to sort of play around with incidentally so maybe that so much of so much of
[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:39.760]   staying in business is not all about making sure that the what you would call a target demographic is
[01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:44.400]   being met as so much is figuring out there are people who have money in their pockets that aren't
[01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:49.520]   isn't being spent on games how do we get them to spend that money on gaming so maybe the the point
[01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:54.480]   is not to become a competitive game platform but to get people like me to suddenly want to spend
[01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:59.920]   eight dollars a month to be able to play a game that's three years old but it's still wonderful
[01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:06.720]   for this person of course apple is it is in the gaming space the ipad is a is a very popular gaming
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:14.000]   device so go ahead Jim i i think google has a real uphill battle in front of them here and i'm not
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:20.080]   i i don't want to say that they're they're not serious but google has a uh a habit of starting a
[01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:25.120]   lot of these things and then leaving it but you know they're looking for new sources of revenue
[01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:30.560]   too i mean how what's what's the gaming industry hundred hundred fifty billion dollars
[01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:37.040]   you know that the the amount of money in that uh industry is just incredible and if google can
[01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:43.120]   grab some of that then why not yeah and i don't think apple's into gaming in any serious way
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:48.240]   they've never been known for it that's for sure no it's all the money out of casual gaming right
[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:54.320]   at google at google has the frankly already has all this hardware it's just lying around it's not
[01:39:54.320 --> 01:40:00.960]   like they don't they don't have the infrastructure to do this so anyway i thought i'd bring it up
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:10.000]   because uh well it just happened um let's see what else were we going to talk about garage band is
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:18.080]   15 wow yeah that's kind of amazing rolling stone piece yeah yeah a secret recording studio in apple's
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:26.160]   kupertino campus has made the beats of some of your favorite hits for the last 15 years i was
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:30.000]   hoping we could trick dalrymple into telling us what it's like in there but he's too savvy come on
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:40.000]   jim tell us all about it carpeting garage band is is a revolutionary app it really was i mean
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:47.120]   uh the the things that you know there's all the the promotion you know band saying well i'm
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:52.800]   going to create an album on garage band and stuff like that but the fact is it really brought a lot
[01:40:52.800 --> 01:41:00.800]   of of musicians gave them the ability to record in a way that they never really could be for i mean
[01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:08.160]   there was all the high end gear and high end daw's that that professionals use but garage band is
[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:16.800]   really the first that allowed people to sit down and put beats together and maybe play an instrument
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:26.240]   through uh an interface and be able to record kind of like a professional did and they talked
[01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:32.640]   they i think it rolling stone interviews uh patrick stump of fall out boy he said when he first
[01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:37.520]   encountered garage band 15 years ago i just started recording without having to learn a new program
[01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:42.240]   which was always one of the scariest things about music he said i never looked back i opened it that
[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:49.520]   first time and never looked back and for people who weren't pros it was also amazing that you could
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:42:01.920]   make music yeah there's no way to to to properly account for what garage band did for music
[01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:07.600]   and allowing musicians to come out because you could do any type of music that you wanted and it
[01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:15.760]   would help you along the way it would conform loops to the the tempo that you wanted and it would
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:24.560]   place things you know properly in a session so that you could actually make a song yeah i remember
[01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:35.040]   putting my son as a as a kid in front of of garage band and he was able to i didn't show him anything
[01:42:35.040 --> 01:42:42.000]   he was able to just drag things in and move things around and make a better sounding electronic
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:49.520]   song than what i was here's uh john mares instagram post from january six he says on this day
[01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:56.240]   15 years ago i helped steve jobs and produce garage band to the world looking back on it i
[01:42:56.240 --> 01:43:00.880]   believe this was a kind of altruism on steve's part offering the app for free on apple devices
[01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:06.560]   and eventually for all he loved music as much as anything else in his life and garage band was
[01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:12.160]   steve's way of giving people the tools to discover the music within themselves yeah pretty smile on
[01:43:12.160 --> 01:43:17.760]   steve's face yeah that yeah you've seen that smile not on every single product demonstration this is
[01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:25.840]   genuine mayor ends his instagram post i once knew a man who changed the world pretty cool that's a
[01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:32.000]   great tribute to steve uh and and and yeah i guess we should give steve and his love for music a
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:38.000]   little bit of credit because they didn't charge anything for that and even logic which they do
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:44.400]   charge for is an amazing deal at 200 bucks i bought it once years ago and i still you know
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:48.960]   still use it it gets updated lots of loops it's pretty amazing
[01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:55.520]   well and don't forget that logic when it was a separate company sold for about 1200 right
[01:43:55.920 --> 01:44:02.080]   yeah right yeah i was a particular i was particularly impressed with that piece when you think that
[01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:07.360]   at least at the time that garage band was released they weren't necessarily saying that here is a
[01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:12.800]   wonderful professional creative app it's like here's we're we're going to be bringing audio
[01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:18.160]   recording and music creation to the masses just like i movie brought video editing to the masses
[01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:23.680]   and what a wonderful thing that they've created the the same person who is just plunking on a
[01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:30.560]   little middle midi keyboard uh in in in grammar school as using the same tool that someone is
[01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:36.640]   using to create the next really really annoying hit of next summer this the uh mauling stone uh
[01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:43.920]   has a picture of the studio where uh gairhard lengeling still the the german engineer who created
[01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:50.960]   your e-magic which is a backbone of garage band and logic still records those loops yeah uh that's
[01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:56.560]   pretty neat too um and decides how they're gonna sound and how they're gonna play back in a garage
[01:44:56.560 --> 01:45:03.840]   band really a great article yeah and you could do an awful lot with garage band it's perfect for
[01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:12.560]   somebody like me yeah uh let's see what else should we talk about before we wrap this thing up oh i
[01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:20.320]   guess we gotta mention Qualcomm it's another one you win some you lose so is that they're never ever
[01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:27.200]   gonna collect because because of making this go another five years yeah so uh on the one hand
[01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:40.720]   a jury has found that uh wow just got a site blocked for for malware i was gonna read this
[01:45:40.720 --> 01:45:50.640]   article from cnet and i got this so uh sorry cnet but uh a jury has awarded uh
[01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:54.960]   Qualcomm what was it like a hundred fifteen million dollars thirty one million dollars
[01:45:54.960 --> 01:46:02.320]   uh because they said you didn't get that huh only only on brave and because they say the apple
[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:09.760]   violated Qualcomm's patents but then that's offset a little bit by a ruling in by a u.s. district
[01:46:09.760 --> 01:46:16.320]   judge for the southern district of california one march 14th said Qualcomm owes apple a billion
[01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:22.720]   dollars so i guess they'll meet uh in the middle of a bridge in exchange checks i don't know
[01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:32.320]   uh it's just gonna be continuing wrestling tvos oil each other or oil themselves up get naked
[01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:38.880]   there you go just yeah when when when one group just take this take this total act of dignity
[01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:47.040]   to its towards end point already uh wwdc dates have been announced june third the mckenry
[01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:52.720]   auditorium in san ose it's been there for the last few years i guess we'll see ios 13
[01:46:52.720 --> 01:47:00.560]   the next mac os watch os tvos maybe we'll see new laptops there maybe we'll see the mac pro
[01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:07.280]   for the first time there and then again maybe we won't but we'll cover it and if they do a
[01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:13.280]   keynote we'll we'll stream it that'd be a great place to show the mac pro it seems to me that's
[01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:18.640]   where you do it right yeah yep you don't have to have you could be you could say available at the
[01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:23.120]   end of the year but just don't say dates anymore because after air power you just gotta you just
[01:47:23.120 --> 01:47:29.360]   gotta shift yeah just don't say anything do you think it'd be funny if if on monday the one more
[01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:38.160]   thing is air power no no no no it's no any stranger and now the moment you've all you've seen opera
[01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:45.040]   you've seen jennifer goner now the moment you've all been waiting there for air power yeah i was
[01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:50.000]   you know i was even wondering if the reason why we saw these two announcements monday and tuesday
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:56.640]   was because these was this is if the deal of all the last deals for related to next week's uh event
[01:47:56.640 --> 01:48:01.440]   had not gone through or looked bad like four or five months from now we would have seen a more low
[01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:06.160]   key apple event with just showing off here's here's our up here's some here's 20 minutes worth of
[01:48:06.160 --> 01:48:12.480]   news about how the store is doing uh here is uh some reaction to the spotify thing and here's some
[01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:18.160]   new hardware updates just for people who happen to live within uber distance of the campus so i think
[01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:23.680]   that it's it's it's interesting timing that this all these are dropping a week beforehand i do think
[01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:26.640]   this was their plan be yeah get this out of the way clear the bex
[01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:38.320]   400 000 participants in a heart health study with the apple watch pretty much conclusively proving
[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:45.840]   that the apple watch will save lives 0.5 percent of those participants very tiny number
[01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:53.920]   received in a regular heart rhythm notification uh in people under 40 according uh to uh assemble
[01:48:53.920 --> 01:49:00.400]   decide who's apples vp of health a physician and people under 40 years of age only 0.16 percent
[01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:05.920]   received a notification in those over 65 the number of course more frequent over 3 percent
[01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:10.400]   this tracks with what one would expect with a fib
[01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:21.200]   it's it's not screening it's not diagnosis it's an initial data point but the study at least apple
[01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:26.640]   says the study uh proves that the apple watch is going to save lives
[01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:35.280]   oh i've seen i've seen debate and reaction to that it worked it did what it's supposed to do and it
[01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:40.080]   didn't create a huge number of our concern my concern was it would create a number of false
[01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:45.280]   positives and uh send a lot of people to the doctors uh unnecessarily maybe even to treatment
[01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:51.280]   unnecessarily but in this study it seems like the number yeah apple watch is already you know
[01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:57.040]   it's already saved lives so i i don't know well you can be in the middle but you don't know as if
[01:49:57.040 --> 01:50:01.520]   it was sending a lot of people to the hospital necessarily and this study seems to conclude that's
[01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:08.480]   not the case yeah there's no clinical data from the trial to show that these diagnosis helped these
[01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:13.680]   people um christopher kelly is a cardiologist at columbia says just because you know about a
[01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:20.640]   disease earlier doesn't prove it's a good thing um so yeah it's a step in the right direction he says
[01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:25.280]   the findings could lead to clinical studies where doctors determine whether early detection
[01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:31.120]   helps people who are at risk of a fib at least we don't have a huge number of false positives i
[01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:36.960]   guess yeah but no Jim is absolutely right i still remember the Jim i just remember the talk you
[01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:41.600]   gave at the Yosemite conference about how the apple watch had helped change your life
[01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:46.720]   and it's just it was such a wonderfully clear and personal statement that really has stuck with me
[01:50:46.720 --> 01:50:50.320]   for three four years now what tell us about that Jim what did you what did it do for you
[01:50:50.320 --> 01:51:00.960]   well the the apple watch gave me information that i didn't previously have i mean you know i was
[01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:06.720]   we all talk about closing rings and things like that but it's not necessarily about closing
[01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:16.720]   rings it's about knowing how active you are and and that's what was really personal for me because
[01:51:16.720 --> 01:51:25.120]   i ended up losing a lot of weight because i would have the information on my wrist to know
[01:51:25.120 --> 01:51:33.360]   exactly you know how how active i was and how much more active i should be or could be and
[01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:39.840]   everything that i did i knew that there was a consequence for so if i decide not to go for a
[01:51:39.840 --> 01:51:44.880]   walk today well there's going to be a slight consequence for that tomorrow if i hop on the scale
[01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:53.120]   you know if i go out and need a big Mac today and don't exercise there's a consequence for that
[01:51:53.120 --> 01:52:01.040]   and i know that i know that now and i can actually see it you know on my on my watch so
[01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:09.520]   i didn't stop going out you know for dinner with my friends and have a nice Italian meal and a
[01:52:09.520 --> 01:52:17.440]   couple of beer or or a burger or whatever i just knew that i needed to exercise and i needed to
[01:52:17.440 --> 01:52:22.560]   keep up this routine and it's not about you know i'm gonna have a burger today so i'm gonna walk
[01:52:22.560 --> 01:52:34.400]   five extra miles no i you know i walk for 30 minutes and at at a decent pace and you know just go from
[01:52:34.400 --> 01:52:39.760]   there and that's that's really what it was what it was all about for me actually and and that kind
[01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:46.000]   of i think that's a more really the thing that always concerned me about it saves lives is it
[01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:50.160]   implies that oh you're gonna die and if you didn't have the apple watch you wouldn't know that i think
[01:52:50.160 --> 01:52:56.640]   the kind of change lifestyle and long-term change that it gave you is really a much better
[01:52:56.640 --> 01:53:00.960]   example of the value of the apple watch i i don't think focusing on the guy who would have been
[01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:07.120]   dead tomorrow if he hadn't gotten a warning today well that's that's more important for him though
[01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:12.400]   sure for him it's a big deal absolutely but it's not the reason everybody should run out by apple
[01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:18.000]   watch i was gonna say normally the the skeptical view towards anything is so well that this is all
[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:22.640]   anecdotal evidence but if i'm the person telling the anecdote that i wasn't going to be singing
[01:53:22.640 --> 01:53:27.120]   about the next six months true and i saw him tomorrow and he said okay guess what i'll give you
[01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:31.760]   that your family we're putting you into the ER right now that's that's that's a good anecdote for me
[01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:37.200]   but i think that the gyms story though is much more common and uh yeah it much more difficult to kind
[01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:42.400]   of promote in an advertisement but it says a real difference and i think that that's absolutely
[01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:47.760]   true it gives you that you put it perfectly the information you need in the incentive to do the
[01:53:47.760 --> 01:53:55.760]   right thing yeah uh let's see i think one more story i just really uh loved this
[01:53:55.760 --> 01:54:05.520]   story in the verge that came from a leak uh a twitter leak by somebody named redphone m68
[01:54:05.520 --> 01:54:14.480]   or the red m68 on twitter the original iphone prototype tom warren who usually writes about windows
[01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:22.080]   on the verge wrote about this and it really is interesting this is the the mechanical it's really
[01:54:22.080 --> 01:54:28.880]   a board a logic board that was provided to engineers working on the iphone in secret in 2006
[01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:33.360]   in 2007 it has all the features of the iphone
[01:54:33.360 --> 01:54:41.040]   on what looks like a maybe a two fx motherboard oh they deleted the cereal port those guys just
[01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:49.280]   won't stop yeah it had a cereal port it had a bunch of really interesting things including
[01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:57.680]   notice a 30 pin dock connector so in effect uh tom says that red m68 says when i connected that to
[01:54:57.680 --> 01:55:02.320]   an apple and ran iTunes it said i see an iphone you want me to restore it
[01:55:02.320 --> 01:55:08.400]   uh it has a screen it was free wallaby right is this what they do straight before the wallaby
[01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:14.160]   uh you know i don't i don't know the exact uh story behind this the impression i got is this
[01:55:14.160 --> 01:55:20.560]   before the release of the iphone and nowadays of course um uh engineers are working on something
[01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:25.520]   that really looks a lot more like a phone uh at this point they may not have even wanted people
[01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:30.640]   to know you know that it was a phone that they were working on uh there is a sim card slot on it
[01:55:30.640 --> 01:55:38.720]   though and Wi-Fi and bluetooth antennas pretty cool to see this and it's been kept secret i
[01:55:38.720 --> 01:55:45.120]   somebody had to leak it out i guess i really hope that apple starts to embrace its history
[01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:49.600]   because it is fascinating what you get to see here is how again here's how the sausage is made but
[01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:53.680]   the ingredients in the sausage are actually really really interesting yeah people see that this is
[01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:59.360]   what people were what engineers were interfacing with this is what a developer had to deal with to
[01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:06.400]   get the first nopad app up and running uh this you eat this up with a spoon and people who are
[01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:11.440]   young engineers even people who are ten years old who just have learned what an engineer is
[01:56:11.440 --> 01:56:16.080]   this is what the struggle is like this is how you create this beautiful thing that winds up in
[01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:21.760]   stores lots of work lots of testing lots of struggle uh i just hope that uh apple
[01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:27.840]   internally is maintaining a good database of this stuff uh and i would love to see them
[01:56:27.840 --> 01:56:31.200]   start to release art books like this that here are apple prototypes
[01:56:31.200 --> 01:56:36.960]   yeah although maybe maybe it's like the reason why we still don't know the technical details of the
[01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:44.320]   f14 tomcat because some of the some of the data from 1973 is still classified but uh it's
[01:56:44.320 --> 01:56:48.800]   such an inspirational and such a great piece of piece of history yeah and if you're i mean i'm
[01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:52.880]   sure people within apple take this completely for granted or within any company that's designing
[01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:57.680]   prototype hardware would take this for granted but for us the unwashed masses this is really
[01:56:57.680 --> 01:57:03.520]   interesting to see that this is what they uh what they use to prototype the phone and get the
[01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:07.520]   first operating system up and running imagine the person who made the first phone call on this thing
[01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:14.800]   that's been a pretty good feeling uh i was not a total restorative yeah the most expensive pizza ever
[01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:23.920]   uh it says copyright 2007 apple on it it also says do not connect battery without removing
[01:57:23.920 --> 01:57:31.520]   j49 so before you uh connect a battery you might want to go find that j49 wherever that is
[01:57:31.520 --> 01:57:38.080]   all right let's take a timeout and come back with your picks of the week fellas get those ready
[01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:45.280]   while i talk about hover our sponsor and i'm proud to say our official domain registrar
[01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:52.160]   all of our domains are registered at hover.com because it is the best place frankly to do it
[01:57:52.160 --> 01:57:58.400]   it's fast it's easy there's no upsell they give you who is privacy by default no extra charge
[01:57:58.400 --> 01:58:04.160]   and they make it very easy to manage your dns uh it's really the best place and i have to say
[01:58:04.160 --> 01:58:11.280]   you need you may not know it but you need a domain name right now if you don't already have
[01:58:11.280 --> 01:58:17.200]   a domain name for your business or for your personal family name i have one actually several for our
[01:58:17.200 --> 01:58:23.600]   family name uh you ought to run out and get it uh when kids are born or couples get married
[01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:28.960]   buy them a domain name it's the best gift you can give them register it for 10 years when my kids
[01:58:28.960 --> 01:58:35.120]   were born i did that i registered their names dot com for 20 years figuring at the time they're 21
[01:58:35.120 --> 01:58:40.080]   they'll know whether they want this or not both of them have kept it i must i might add hover has
[01:58:40.080 --> 01:58:47.520]   over 400 extensions to choose from you get really you can i mean this kind of hysterical uh lot
[01:58:47.520 --> 01:58:54.240]   lot of people like the dot me t it's called a tld so leo dot me for instance be a great place for
[01:58:54.240 --> 01:59:00.400]   your personal portfolio if you're an artist or performer uh or even if you're a teenager i think
[01:59:00.400 --> 01:59:05.840]   it's really important to get teenagers to create their first website to own their own domain name

[02:01:07.280 --> 02:01:16.880]   waited for air power no Jim dowerimple and his pick of the week all right i'm going to surprise
[02:01:16.880 --> 02:01:25.680]   you with this one leo not rock and roll it it well it is but it's not a new band like i normally do
[02:01:25.680 --> 02:01:34.960]   i normally have a a new good hard rock band uh but there was an album that was just released by um
[02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:42.320]   from tom petty and the heartbreakers i've heard of them the definitive the definitive career
[02:01:43.440 --> 02:01:50.880]   and it includes some notes which is what i find very interesting from apple music where mike
[02:01:50.880 --> 02:02:00.160]   Campbell uh tom's long time guitarist tells you about writing some of the songs and mike would
[02:02:00.160 --> 02:02:08.240]   write some of the songs give the tapes to tom and he tells stories about how the songs were written
[02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:17.120]   and it's just so great some of the songs are from uh what's that band called mud crunch
[02:02:17.120 --> 02:02:25.680]   mud mud crunch which is the first tom petty band out of Gainesville florida which really
[02:02:25.680 --> 02:02:36.880]   launched his uh his career nice so i one of the songs he talks about he gave the music to tom
[02:02:37.440 --> 02:02:45.760]   and tom went over to bob dillins hotel room wow they wrote the lyrics for it they while watching tv
[02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:53.760]   they turned the volume down and they were watching so i i just i love this i'm gonna run out yeah yeah
[02:02:53.760 --> 02:02:59.360]   yeah i think it's something that everybody uh will really appreciate he was touching them on
[02:02:59.360 --> 02:03:06.000]   yes i'm back to to hard rock so there yeah this is great it's called the best of everything
[02:03:07.200 --> 02:03:12.400]   tom petty and the heartbreakers of four disc set and uh it sounds like something worth
[02:03:12.400 --> 02:03:17.760]   looking at on apple music for those uh additional notes that's really cool yeah well they actually
[02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:26.880]   gave the um uh mike kambal uh inter was interviewed by apple music nice he gave those those notes are
[02:03:26.880 --> 02:03:35.120]   in um the apple music content nice um for those yeah so that sounds great so that's a good reason
[02:03:35.120 --> 02:03:43.040]   to have apple music thank you jim loop insight dot com and the anaco what do you have for us uh
[02:03:43.040 --> 02:03:51.520]   inspired by the uh new ipad mini uh my recommendation is my favorite word processor slash get ideas out
[02:03:51.520 --> 02:03:59.280]   of your head and in an organized fashion onto a small screen dio is device ulysses it's a it started
[02:03:59.280 --> 02:04:05.520]   off as a focus oriented text editor which means that if you maximize it you just have an empty
[02:04:05.520 --> 02:04:10.480]   screen with just your words in it but they kept adding more and more features without reducing
[02:04:10.480 --> 02:04:16.720]   its simplicity and its directness uh they just came out with version i think 15 last week uh and
[02:04:16.720 --> 02:04:23.120]   hands down i i my favorite app for larger screen dio is devices and for my mac is scrivener and they
[02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:28.560]   do have a wonderful uh phone app but when it comes to i need to have an app that's on this small screen
[02:04:28.560 --> 02:04:33.840]   device that i can either write a thousand words on or just some very very organized notes and
[02:04:33.840 --> 02:04:40.000]   record keeping sort of things it's such a powerful and flexible tool and i also like the fact that
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:45.520]   it is a subscription app so they cost 40 bucks a year which sounds like a lot of money but it's a
[02:04:45.520 --> 02:04:50.000]   wonderful app and the fact of the matter is the read the fact that they are making sure that they
[02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:55.040]   get paid for their work means that they get to keep coming out with wonderful wonderful new features
[02:04:55.040 --> 02:05:00.560]   there's so many apps that i've spent like nine bucks for total three years ago that have barely
[02:05:00.560 --> 02:05:04.720]   gotten an update since because someone had to go back to their lives and had to go back to their
[02:05:04.720 --> 02:05:09.920]   jobs they can't think they don't make enough money off of this to sustain development of the project
[02:05:09.920 --> 02:05:15.520]   but ulysses is one of those apps where whenever i see that automatic debit on my card i think oh
[02:05:15.520 --> 02:05:19.280]   oh that's right okay good thank you thank you i would have forgotten otherwise thank you for
[02:05:19.280 --> 02:05:23.840]   continuing to give me access to ulysses you know it's funny i renew that every year i hardly ever
[02:05:23.840 --> 02:05:29.440]   use it but it's such a beautiful app i just want to thank them for creating it it's simple and yet
[02:05:29.440 --> 02:05:36.800]   very very effective it's hard for me to think of an app that transitions from phone to ipad mini to
[02:05:36.800 --> 02:05:44.800]   ipad probe to desktop as easily as ulysses does this is a brilliant piece of design nice i want to
[02:05:44.800 --> 02:05:52.160]   give thanks scooter x in our chat room by the way who is uh gave me the link to ken kashenda's tweet
[02:05:52.160 --> 02:05:58.400]   ken is of course the guy who worked on the original iphone ui the software and ken had pictures
[02:05:58.400 --> 02:06:04.640]   of these of this prototype board in use with people working on it that's pretty wild
[02:06:04.640 --> 02:06:09.840]   um so if you don't follow ken on twitter k-o-c-i-e-n-d-a
[02:06:09.840 --> 02:06:17.600]   this is this is really really really cool to see was the guy who ran ui kit until he retired a
[02:06:17.600 --> 02:06:22.960]   few years ago yeah he refers to ari lomero who's uh he was amazing he built a lot of the modern
[02:06:22.960 --> 02:06:29.120]   underpinnings of ios and all of the stuff we use today man you know when you when you experience
[02:06:29.120 --> 02:06:35.040]   something like this in your life uh it you know it really is a high point you never forget that's
[02:06:35.040 --> 02:06:39.440]   really cool thank you ken for sharing those on twitter uh rene richy your pick of the week
[02:06:39.440 --> 02:06:46.640]   so uh there's this great iphone photography app called halide made by benson ovsky and
[02:06:46.640 --> 02:06:53.040]   sibastian de witt and they have launched a second app called specter um hal the the first one halide
[02:06:53.040 --> 02:06:59.360]   was really working on manual focus and depth of field this one uses machine learning to do long
[02:06:59.360 --> 02:07:05.680]   exposures they're calling it smart long exposure so what it does is take a number of frames and
[02:07:05.680 --> 02:07:09.600]   then use machine learning sort of smooth it out into one of the shots that you would get if you had
[02:07:09.600 --> 02:07:15.120]   a classic long exposure system but it eliminates a lot of the problems that come with those like
[02:07:15.120 --> 02:07:19.600]   you know you don't always have a tripod conveniently situated for every time you want to use it for
[02:07:19.600 --> 02:07:23.280]   example or you know sometimes they're really short because they can't get consistency from
[02:07:23.280 --> 02:07:27.920]   enough frames so this just lets you point and click i mean it's better if you're stabilized
[02:07:27.920 --> 02:07:34.960]   obviously but really you can just go out and if you see something like you's water or traffic or
[02:07:34.960 --> 02:07:41.040]   just anything that you think would make a really interesting looking long exposure shot you can
[02:07:41.680 --> 02:07:48.080]   just take it with specter and then experiment with it to sort of get the most that you can get out
[02:07:48.080 --> 02:07:53.600]   of it and again it's you know apple makes a very simple camera app for ios you know it has a lot
[02:07:53.600 --> 02:07:58.560]   of basic functionality but they make a lot of api's for a lot of developers to do a lot of really
[02:07:58.560 --> 02:08:05.200]   cool things and sibastian and ben have been doing some really amazing things with it very nice
[02:08:05.200 --> 02:08:11.040]   yeah i downloaded it i have an eda occasion to use it is also if you have a tripod it's tripod aware
[02:08:11.040 --> 02:08:19.200]   yeah yeah very nice friends we have done it again thank you so much for being here rene richie
