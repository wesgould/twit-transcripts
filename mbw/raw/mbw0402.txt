[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.300]   This time for Mac Break Weekly, the show where we cover the Apple news and
[00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.600]   obsessive detail.
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.300]   It's it's sometimes there's very little news.
[00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.000]   Sometimes we're even more obsessed.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.400]   But Andy Inako says it's going to be OK from the celestial ways to bandwidth
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.900]   and the Chicago Sun times.
[00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.700]   There he is holding his Simpsons phone.
[00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.200]   What is that from?
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.100]   That's from a Sunday's episode of the Simpsons where you get to see what
[00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.500]   apps the Homer has launched on his eye.
[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.900]   I pwn or whatever they call it.
[00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.900]   It looks like grand.
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.200]   Well, you got your you got your worms with friends.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.500]   You've got your I runes.
[00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.100]   You've got your splintrest.
[00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.400]   You got your whimper.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.600]   Grand Theft Walrus Instagram.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.000]   Snub hub.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.700]   Twitter call of Daddy and the app he actually launched, which is Duff countdown,
[00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.400]   which is the countdown until you will be absolutely drunk.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.000]   You're not supposed to share your wife that one.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.800]   That's awesome.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.000]   That's a great screen grab.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.700]   I love it.
[00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.700]   Is there an entire department of the Simpsons that's only that's only there
[00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.400]   to write gags for people who have the ability to freeze frame absolute
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.800]   high definition video because you're not going to get these jokes.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.300]   You're right.
[00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.500]   I mean, but but but you know that's they call that in a in a real life show.
[00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.900]   They call that the the playback life playback and those are the guys who are
[00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:43.500]   doing the computers.
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.700]   The reason I know that is because one of them is a fan of ours.
[00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:52.500]   And as I mentioned, snuck a twit tab into the browser on Silicon Valley.
[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.000]   He's now told me that that that one of the screens in the newsroom, the HBO show
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.600]   the newsroom will feature a twit screen sometime in the near future.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.400]   So that's an important job.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.400]   Those guys who make up the fake screens.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.000]   He had to get the unsung heroes of our industry.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.700]   Thank you for giving us free free exposure and the reminder that there.
[00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.800]   We actually do have some sort of an audience somewhere in this world that could
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.600]   be applied into television and some some value somewhere also here with us
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.400]   from Washington, D.C.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.700]   At the White House, it's Alex Lindsey.
[00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.700]   Hey, how's it going?
[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:32.700]   Reporting live from we're here to talk about the FCC.
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:33.300]   Yes.
[00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.600]   I had to cover this directly and get right to the right to the point.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.100]   Very nice.
[00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.700]   It's good.
[00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.000]   We have Mr.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.800]   Mr.
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.800]   Lindsey goes to Washington, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.800]   Yes, exactly.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.300]   Exactly.
[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.000]   It's a good it's a good picture anyway.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   It's a I love it.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.400]   I can be I love it.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.200]   We're working our way slowly up the East Coast from Boston to Washington.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.400]   Oh, no, that's the other way around for Washington, Boston and now to Montreal.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.200]   Dagnebitt.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:03:59.900]   It's Mr.
[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:00.600]   Renee Richie.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.900]   I'm going to go.
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.800]   This is you're in the Bermuda Triangle.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.200]   Absolutely.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.900]   You know what else is in the bemere to triangle.
[00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.400]   We thought today would be the day that the big announcement that Apple was
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.000]   requiring beats for $3.2 billion.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.800]   They said the round Tuesday, maybe tomorrow.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.700]   I'm on record saying it's bogus.
[00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.500]   It's it's a bogus rumor that these sources are Jimmy Iovine and Dr.
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.100]   Dre.
[00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:35.000]   But I don't know if it okay let's I mean, obviously that's the biggest story to talk
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.400]   about.
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.000]   You've got your ear to the railroad.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.600]   You know, we actually have it on tape.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.200]   Let's see it.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.900]   Oh, crap.
[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.800]   It was a rumor created by Dr.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.660]   Dre and Jimmy Iovine in an attempt to sell headphones and stock or whatever and to
[00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.400]   drum up gin up some interest in a company that is actually failing.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.200]   Failing.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.500]   Thank you to our editors.
[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.100]   Way too far.
[00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.400]   Way too far.
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.600]   So I'm on record.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.500]   There's some Fox News or something because that's a well that was a well turned
[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.400]   be the promotion.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.600]   We're going to save that.
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.700]   And then when they actually announce it, we're going to play that.
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.200]   So I could be completely humiliated or John Stewart can play it.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.100]   Yeah, right.
[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.900]   Exactly.
[00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.500]   What do you think Renee?
[00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.900]   I mean, it's it's an interesting rumors.
[00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.500]   Not one that we there was an April Fool's Day joke about this not too long ago, which
[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.000]   immediately made everyone think they were reporting the April Fool's Day joke.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.700]   But it's interesting because there's several areas of technology that Apple is good at, but it's
[00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.800]   having trouble in a securing because they're Apple.
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.600]   For example, streaming rights and there's a rumor that beats as the only company in streaming
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.500]   audio right now that has transferable rights.
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.500]   And if that's true, then maybe that'll help Apple.
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:52.100]   But more importantly, Eddy Q is one of the most busy executives at Apple.
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.300]   I'm not saying something because all Apple executives are busy, but he has to run the
[00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.900]   iTunes store, he has to run iCloud and he has to secure all these deals.
[00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.800]   And if Jimmy Iving can come in and maybe help take that off Eddy Q's plate so that
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.200]   he Q doesn't end up being one of those former Apple executives, then I think that might be, at least
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.100]   to me, the most interesting read of where this could help Apple.
[00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:14.800]   That's an interesting take on it, that they want Jimmy Iovine, who is a record company
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:22.200]   executive and for long many years, and highly respected that they want him to run iTunes
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.800]   in effect.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.600]   Or at least do the music deal so Eddy can focus on the TV and movie deals and not have to do
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.600]   everything all at once.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.900]   Yeah.
[00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:34.500]   So I'm looking at an article from Apple Insider in, well, it just came out, but they
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:40.900]   reported in March, Beats Music had 110,000 subscribers, fairly pathetic.
[00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.900]   It's around 200,000 now, but just as I can say, I don't think that what Beats Music has right now
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.400]   means anything if Apple takes over.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.400]   I mean, Apple has 450 million credit cards.
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.100]   You know, what do they need this for?
[00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.800]   And they've got iTunes radio.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:59.700]   I think they have had trouble getting a specific type of subscription service because, and if
[00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:03.100]   it's true, that Beats has transferable rights.
[00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:09.700]   I think that I think the music industry has been very resistant to giving them this, this
[00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:14.500]   access because they're afraid of what will most likely happen, which is Apple will crush everybody
[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.000]   else.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.500]   I mean, they have too many.
[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.300]   They have a lot of opportunity there.
[00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.800]   I mean, the only the biggest problem with this acquisition if it goes through is antitrust.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.200]   You know, the amount of damage Apple could do with this acquisition.
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.800]   I don't think there's any antitrust threat at all.
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.300]   I think they're buying a the failed music subscription service.
[00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.700]   Beats is not getting any traction at all.
[00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:36.400]   Has no reach.
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:40.200]   Yeah, but but but if you add Apple's reach to.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:45.700]   Well, wait a minute, if you're a record label, okay, maybe you were stupid enough to sign this deal with
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.300]   Beats that they could actually transfer the rights to another company.
[00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:53.800]   Well, even if you're going to submarine this in some way, you're going to sabotage it quick.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:00.300]   Maybe, but I mean, what if Apple doesn't actually absorb beats, then then the question is, is whether they
[00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:04.800]   whether they actually lose the, I mean, they may not lose the the access to that subscription service.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:09.000]   If they don't if they don't make it Apple, you know, so so that's another
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:09.300]   opportunity.
[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.200]   What of the headphones?
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.400]   Is there any value to that?
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.300]   Andy Enoco?
[00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:18.600]   I mean, it's making a billion dollars a year off of what a lot of people think are some very cheap.
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:23.800]   Plastic headphones that are kind of ugly that really show off the logo over the performance of the audio.
[00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:30.100]   I don't it's a valuable brand and to valuable to really crush, but when I as I've been spending the weekend,
[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:34.600]   as everybody else has thinking about if this is an actual acquisition, why would Apple be interested?
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:40.000]   I don't think they'd be interested in the headphones because of all the things that beats has in the entire
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.100]   package headphones is the one thing that Apple could absolutely build themselves and do a better job of building it
[00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.900]   and probably even marketing it to their existing customers.
[00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:56.100]   I really think this is about personnel that they want to there's segments of the customer base out there that
[00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.500]   they're not reaching with their existing products and their existing strategies.
[00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.400]   It's one thing to buy a streaming music service.
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:09.000]   It's another thing to find that 10 to 12% of people out there who are just not into iTunes right now or maybe not
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.600]   even into Apple hardware right now that you could be reaching and to to an ace point.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:21.200]   I also think it's a big deal to for the next step for the company to do instead of treating iTunes as it maybe
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:27.400]   originally was as a way to sell iPods and then as a way to sell iPhones and now treating it as this is a core part
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.400]   of our business right now.
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:35.700]   And if Apple really is becoming a more mature company as a content maker, then the day would definitely be coming
[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:40.500]   where they they can't run that division, but with a tech guy who understands the music industry,
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:44.900]   you now have to have a music industry guy who understands the tech business and that's what they would be getting
[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:45.400]   with beats.
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:51.800]   So the more I look at this, the less I think that it's about the hardware market as profitable as that as that is and
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:57.900]   it's less about the streaming market as important as it is to get into a subscription music service in the new
[00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:58.400]   future.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:03.600]   I really think it is about the ability to get a core of executives that has grown up and eats,
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:09.600]   breathes and does everything else with the with music and they're the ones who can instinctively know how to operate
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.500]   and market music to the entire world, not just a fans of Apple products.
[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.900]   That's where the $3.2 billion comes from.
[00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:20.500]   Again, assuming this is a real thing and assuming it actually happens because remember this really is just a rumor
[00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:20.900]   right now.
[00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:25.400]   Well, and fundamentally, I think a lot of people in the music industry don't think that anyone in the tech industry
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.800]   really gets gets them.
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:34.100]   You know, I mean, I started the music industry and every time you go to a tech party, you're like, OK, these guys are
[00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:34.700]   kind of cute.
[00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:39.500]   Like they don't know, you know, it's like it's like it's like, you know, you know, this is not nothing like
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:43.600]   what you're what you're used to and nothing at the level that you're used to having it.
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.000]   If they want to make those deals, they have to have people like that.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.100]   So I definitely agree with Andy, but I do think that there is an incredible amount of value and something
[00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:54.100]   that's already generating a billion dollars as well as in hardware.
[00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:57.700]   And I think the subscription services also makes a lot of sense.
[00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.300]   I think Apple hasn't been able to make this turn.
[00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:02.600]   And I think they've and of course, I've been talking about it for years that they need to make this turn.
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:06.400]   The I think one opportunity for Apple is a high quality music service.
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:14.500]   So, you know, would you pay $20 a month or $15 a month or whatever it is to have 24 bit audio with your cool headset?
[00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:18.500]   I think it's a bogus rumor.
[00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:19.000]   I think Dr.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:28.400]   Dre is right now secretly laughing as he listens to all of this and be if it is not a phony rumor, then it is a clear sign
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.700]   that Apple is completely run out of ideas.
[00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.600]   No, I disagree with that.
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:39.700]   I think I think the I think the different I had a problem with this rumor when I first broke on Thursday and it didn't take me
[00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:44.000]   long to realize the reasons why I was having problems with it is because I grew up with Apple.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:50.500]   I grew up understanding Apple as a maker of computers and every time they come up with a product that is not a cool
[00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:55.300]   piece of hardware, at least some of me is always thinking that, of course, they're making eye movie because that
[00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:56.600]   helps sell Macintoshes.
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:01.300]   And of course, they're selling they're having an iTunes store because they want to sell content that makes their devices
[00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:02.700]   more valuable on and on and on.
[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:09.600]   But just as you sometimes have to let go of your original concept of Star Wars as the way it was when you were a little
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:16.000]   kid, you have to realize that a generation now thinks of Apple as a content brand as a consumer brand and that now
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.300]   then that's why I keep thinking about the next step for Apple can't be just we were in our business based on very,
[00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.000]   very high margins on hardware.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.600]   It has to be on we are making the entire widget and now the widget includes the entertainment.
[00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:35.700]   And if you continue this line of thought, beyond the ability to get content for the iTunes store, like licensing deals
[00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:43.700]   and not and extended, extended past that point where now you have a relationship with the creative community where
[00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:47.800]   they know that the person who heads this music division at Apple is one of them.
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:48.700]   They're producer.
[00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:51.200]   They're they're they're they're recording industry executives.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:56.600]   They're not there just to figure out how can we make this into how can we make your new album or your new track into a
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:59.300]   way to market our new commercials or our new hardware?
[00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:02.000]   How can we make as much money for you as possible?
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:09.200]   And if they can turn the iTunes store into a destination label that people want to actually artists want to work with,
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:15.600]   that could be a real turn of events that Amazon can't deal with and that Google Play can't deal with.
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:20.300]   So there are a lot of really real opportunities here that goes beyond what I again, what I consider to be tacky,
[00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.500]   big plastic headphones with way too much base.
[00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:28.500]   There's something to be said to that when we spoke about this earlier that the iPhone is the single biggest business at Apple and
[00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:33.100]   it's going to be the biggest business for a long time and no one's apples not going to be able to sell enough eye watches at a high
[00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:34.900]   enough price to even come close to that.
[00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:40.300]   The same thing with the iPod, sorry, with the iPad with the Mac and there's no other product coming along the pipeline that
[00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:42.100]   looks like it could be an iPhone sized business.
[00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:47.300]   So Apple, if they want to maintain growth, that's important to them because it's certainly important to shareholders and to the
[00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:53.000]   industry is going to have to look at other ways of making that money and absent a big thing is going to be a bunch of little
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.700]   things and iTunes already has the potential to be.
[00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:59.300]   I mean, it's contributing more and more to Apple's bottom line and as silly as it is.
[00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:01.800]   Is it music or is it video and TV?
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.700]   I mean, it's all of that.
[00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:06.900]   It's the music is certainly important because downloads are falling.
[00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:13.400]   So Apple needs something that will replace downloads, but as silly as they are, a $14 headphones itself or $200,
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:18.000]   whether it's Beats by Apple or whether Apple makes their own or whether, you know, they want that brand because it
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.900]   appeals to different people than the Apple brand.
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:25.600]   That contributes towards not the Internet of things, but the Apple of things that can be carefully selected products that once
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.600]   again, increase the overall value of Apple's core business.
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:34.700]   Well, and I think that also again, if you if you look at Apple squeezing the music industry from both directions through
[00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:43.500]   subscription service that could theoretically dominate the subscription service process as well as the ability to possibly
[00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:49.700]   even curate and, you know, sign their own bands directly to iTunes or directly to that subscription service with the kind of
[00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:55.200]   people they just brought in, it puts the music industry in a pretty heavy clamp if Apple chooses to do it.
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:15:00.100]   And once you're done, if it was me, once I finished with the music industry, I would focus on film and TV.
[00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.600]   You know, you know, it's, you know, you can do that over and over again.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:09.700]   Well, since Katie Cotton is retiring, maybe Dre'll have a job in PR.
[00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:12.500]   That's why she retired Leo, so she wouldn't have to deal with this story.
[00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:15.000]   Dan Warren jokes that I'm stealing.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.600]   That's a good, it's a good.
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:26.100]   I wonder if her replacement will get like a ceremonial ceremonial like nicely mounted version of her keyboard and instructions.
[00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:31.300]   Here is the here is the command alt alt function button to automatically pace and reply.
[00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:34.300]   Apple does not comment on unreleased under announced products.
[00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:40.200]   Katie's been there 18 years as vice president of worldwide corporate communications.
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:43.900]   She was the name that you'd refer to when you had a quote from Apple.
[00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:52.700]   Now, Sam Biddle, of course, on Valley WAG has the opposite take.
[00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:56.700]   He says, goodbye to the evil, the queen of evil tech PR.
[00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:57.300]   Disgusting.
[00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:58.700]   Absolutely.
[00:15:58.700 --> 00:15:59.500]   That's fantastic.
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:04.100]   I thought Katie was was a class act at every respect.
[00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:05.800]   Never had a problem with Katie Cotton.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:13.000]   And that that that article has absolutely no convergence with what I the experiences that I had over 20 years.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.500]   I was discussing, discussing article and I was deeply ashamed to.
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.500]   I've read it posting on to the same medium as that.
[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:20.500]   I was terrible.
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.800]   Well, and that's why I bring it up because it wasn't my experience.
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:26.700]   And I was just curious if any of you had a any negative experience.
[00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:33.600]   Now, you know, one of the things he points out, it was her job to hide and Steve's illness.
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.200]   But that was her job.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.400]   And I think she did it very well and with class.
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.400]   I don't think that you could say in any way.
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:43.000]   She was the evil queen of tech PR.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.800]   She created Apple's PR organization.
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.700]   Like a lot of companies have external PR.
[00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:48.900]   Like they'll hire, you know, wagget or some company.
[00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:52.800]   She built a world class PR organization in Apple and one that didn't.
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:59.300]   I mean, some people would say that they were that they were very quiet or that they were a wall instead of, you know, an enabling force.
[00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:03.900]   But she built an absolutely first class press organization and she built the culture of that inside Apple.
[00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:10.860]   And there's a lot of wonderful senior and junior press people at Apple who are all were part of that teaching that process or that in
[00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:14.160]   acculturation and that that at least is going to persist long past Katie.
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:19.860]   Cotton's a comment to a recode is this is hard for me.
[00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:21.960]   Apple's been a part of my heart and soul.
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.760]   Apple said the official Apple statement.
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.060]   She wanted to spend time with her children for some time now.
[00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:27.960]   We're really going to miss her.
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:31.560]   You know, 18 years, a long time to be doing what she's been doing.
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:35.060]   And I think I think she deserves a break, frankly.
[00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:35.860]   Yeah.
[00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:40.460]   That's every time that one of these departures becomes big news.
[00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:49.160]   I wonder why there isn't just a realization that a lot of these people at Apple, they don't just dip in for a couple of years, then move on to 3M or Xerox.
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.360]   They are lifers because they are part of that culture and part of that community.
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:53.460]   They like what they do.
[00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:59.260]   And it's a long, long chunk of your life to spend doing one thing, no matter how much you enjoy doing it.
[00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:05.560]   And there is there does come that point in which you have your monthly meeting with your accountant and which he starts off with the same question.
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.260]   Now, why are you still going to work?
[00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:08.460]   Because here's how much money you have.
[00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:08.760]   Yeah.
[00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:13.560]   And sometimes that month comes where that person does not have a good answer to that.
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:21.260]   You've got to figure stock options you got 18 years ago, long vested probably for 15 of those 18 years, probably worth some money.
[00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:36.260]   I mean, it's important to understand I have friends in a lot of different tech companies and a lot of some of them will tell me, oh, you know, I made an icon last month or I made a line of code last month and they'll have projects that come and go and they'll have time to take off and they'll have, you know, it's not a constant struggle.
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:41.160]   At Apple, almost everybody is doing the equivalent of a marathon in bursts of sprints.
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:49.760]   And that includes their PR people who are busy on Sundays, you know, in all hours of the day and night and to do things like launch an iPhone, launch an iPad and it's exhausting.
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.960]   It's like a forced March after forced March.
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:59.560]   And now some of them are taking the opportunity to, you know, it can since there is a change of the guard at Apple, they're taking the opportunity to take stock and say, okay, I'm done.
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:00.260]   I need to rest.
[00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:01.060]   Yeah.
[00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:05.660]   And I've known folks that have, you know, no longer an Apple PR.
[00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:16.960]   And in the level of pressure and detail is intense, you know, from everything, you know, it's just the incredible every little bit of every little shoot of every little, you know, it's never just like, okay, that's good enough.
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:25.660]   I mean, it's the way they make their products is exactly the way they make everything else, you know, and it's a very, very, you know, it can be very stressful for a lot of people.
[00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.460]   And they're chronically understaffed.
[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:28.860]   I mean, we think the engineering is understaffed.
[00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:32.460]   Marketing in PR is incredibly small for company Apple size.
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:35.560]   Any word about who will take her place?
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.760]   Steve Dowling.
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:41.760]   I think it was who was the guy who issued the statement, probably somebody from her office.
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:42.160]   I don't.
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.860]   I mean, who would I think Jimmy Iovine or Dr.
[00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:47.860]   Dre would be maybe the two of them together.
[00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:50.360]   Would be would be a wonderful.
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.660]   I'll I want to think for sure.
[00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:55.660]   They're they're calling their call on hold music is going to be awesome now.
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:09.260]   They're not a cup or Tino when okay, so when this doesn't happen by next week, can we say it's not it was a bad rumor or how long do we have to cycle it next year.
[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:10.160]   Leo, how long do we think?
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:18.060]   No, I it's so obviously bogus despite the fact that Dre put out a video on Facebook saying thanks to the sale.
[00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:24.860]   He's now the first rap billionaire video he immediately put down, which makes me think, frankly, the whole thing came from his office.
[00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:30.160]   Well, it's I agree. I mean, I don't know if it's real or not.
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:30.660]   We're good.
[00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:32.560]   We're going on such little stuff.
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:52.460]   The the only thing that makes it more interesting than most rumors is the number of high profile people who are really sticking their necks out about this where the financial, the financial journals are using language that you don't write that word and then take your hands off the keyboard and then look at that screen and not think if this does not happen.
[00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:57.460]   Then anytime I'm wrong about anything in the future, they have the right to cut and paste is a yes.
[00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:02.860]   But of course, remember that Gurne Blanson was the person who absolutely swore blind that Apple was buying beats.
[00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:08.460]   And as we knew, Google actually picked it up only four months later for much lower price and what was being was being tossed about.
[00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:10.860]   So we just don't know what's going on.
[00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:14.160]   Anybody in a position to really, really know is not supposed to be talking about it.
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.860]   That's something that we should always remind ourselves.
[00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:18.360]   And as somebody pointed out in the chair, Apple has not denied it.
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:19.160]   And.
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:30.560]   I think here's what I think is happening. Yes, they're meeting with the beats executives, but it's to talk about something maybe bundling beats headphones with the iPhone.
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:31.460]   That would make sense.
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:40.160]   Yeah, but but so maybe they don't want to say to issue a denial right now because they're in delicate negotiations anyway.
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:44.760]   And there's and there's absolutely no reason for them to to say anything one way or another.
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:48.460]   I mean, they they're not they're not required to swing at every pitch.
[00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:55.460]   And if you think about what how do they benefit by officially denying this rumor or even saying Apple does not comment on rumors?
[00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:57.860]   What does that gain for them? It doesn't gain them anything.
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:59.960]   So there's no reason for them to do anything at this point.
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:14.460]   It's more interesting right now as far as I'm concerned is that it's an opportunity for pretty much everybody who professionally and semi professionally and on an amateur basis likes to likes to talk about Apple and what they think Apple is and what they think they should be doing.
[00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:19.360]   It's sort of a litmus test on what do you believe Apple is?
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:31.660]   Why do you if if you were to if you were to think about this acquisition on what basis would you say that this does not make sense for Apple and this does then this does make sense for Apple and that will reveal what you yourself think Apple is like.
[00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:40.460]   Like I said, it made me think about how oftentimes when I think about what I think Apple should be doing, it's because I historically think of them as a hardware company.
[00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:50.960]   And it's hard for me to imagine them as a umbrella company that has a lot of services that are in this in the orbit of technology, but not necessarily in the form of metal and plastic.
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:53.160]   This could be just electrons that they're in the business of.
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:57.260]   All right.
[00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:57.960]   Well, what, you know,
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:03.860]   you can't prove a negative.
[00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:04.660]   No.
[00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:07.560]   And so we're just going to wait and when it doesn't happen.
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.360]   But either Leo, you know it, we can't prove that either.
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:11.060]   We don't you know it.
[00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:15.060]   When Dre walks out on the WWDC stage, we'll know once and for all.
[00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:25.460]   No, when when Johnny I walks out with any beats product on his body, then we'll know if that ever happens, I will get me a baloney hat so I can eat it.
[00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:27.560]   We have to make nice with the new guys.
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:29.060]   We have to make them welcome.
[00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:35.060]   That's why I'm wearing these hot phosphorescent, diamelle covered purple headphones right there.
[00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:37.760]   That is soon as I'm off the stage.
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.560]   You just can't imagine Johnny Ivan.
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:41.060]   Anyway, counting and seeing this.
[00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:48.560]   That well, okay, look, if they do it, it's for the streaming service, which is dying, but okay, they'll kill the beats business or what?
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:49.060]   I don't know.
[00:23:49.060 --> 00:24:00.660]   Maybe spin it off to get their money back because with a billion dollars a year, it won't take long for them to remember that's revenue, but I figured the profit margin on beats headphones is probably 98%.
[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:01.260]   Yes.
[00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:08.560]   I'm not sure that even even Apple is a company that's going to say, well, this division is generating a billion dollars a year.
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:12.460]   Maybe we want to hold on to that because we did write a pretty big check for it.
[00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:26.960]   And also remember if the part of this that makes a lot of sense to me is when you think about as a company grows, you have to start looking at the part of the world map that you don't have the little apple logo colored in on what parts the market are you not reaching.
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:40.460]   And if it's a part of the market that you've been trying really, really hard to get into, but it's defied all of your attempts, the next line of thought is, okay, who is successfully marketing products to these people and how can we buy these people and just buy their expertise?
[00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:40.960]   I understand that.
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:41.460]   I understand that.
[00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:41.960]   I understand that.
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:42.460]   Yeah, I understand that.
[00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:43.460]   It's interesting.
[00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:44.460]   It'll be to me.
[00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:44.960]   The press conference.
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:50.660]   Apple has always represented quality and for them to get in bed with sleazy Hollywood music industry shills.
[00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:53.560]   Oh, they did that when they opened the iTunes store.
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:55.260]   They did that when they started selling movies.
[00:24:55.260 --> 00:25:03.960]   I mean, you know, and also, and also as much as I check myself when I see when I call beats headphones, oh, they're cheap and they really don't sound very good.
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:08.960]   The fact of the matter is they do something to sound that customers really, really like.
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.360]   Yeah, they go kinds of music.
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.960]   Apparently it's not accurate, but it's very, very plow.
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:18.660]   It's the same way that like those of us who take a lot of pictures can complain about how this phone or this camera.
[00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:19.160]   Oh, man.
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:24.860]   The only reason why people like this camera is because it's hyper saturating the colors and it's making things way too black.
[00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:25.360]   Right.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:26.460]   It's blowing out these colors.
[00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:28.260]   Well, well, you know what?
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:29.560]   That's something for us to complain about.
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:31.360]   But people like that people like Instagram.
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:32.460]   They like they like salt.
[00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:33.160]   They like sugar.
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:33.760]   They like fat.
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:38.760]   That's why McDonald's does so very, very well in the the the the store that made air drug air.
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:46.760]   I'm so I swear to God air fried California style French fries that opened up a couple miles away from here.
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:53.760]   We're not a business about three months because air frying you basically just put the potatoes out and you let them dry out in the air fry.
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:58.660]   It's sort of dunking them in hot beef fat for for for for five or ten minutes.
[00:25:58.660 --> 00:25:58.960]   Okay.
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:25:59.360]   Whatever.
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:00.260]   Good luck with that.
[00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:05.460]   It's it's also I mean, if you look even in the three point two billion is about what a couple days a week's worth of money for Apple.
[00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:10.760]   And if you and one of Apple's biggest problems is how to buy companies and in culture and get them into part of Apple's culture.
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:14.660]   And with beats, you're getting to high profile guys who may or may not fit that model.
[00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:21.860]   But as a company in general, it's something that will probably either be just totally overwhelmed by Apple's culture or easily integrated into it.
[00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:24.960]   So it's it's not as disruptive as a lot of other big purchases might be.
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:32.360]   Well, and I think also they they definitely give Apple access to parts of the music industry movie industry that even Steve Jobs didn't have access to.
[00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:33.160]   Well, yeah, that's the question.
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:36.460]   Can Jimmy Iovine then walk in even carrying an Apple business card?
[00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:40.360]   Can he walk in to places where Tim Cook couldn't probably.
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:41.060]   Very can idle.
[00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:42.060]   That can idle.
[00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:43.960]   Hey, did you Alex?
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:45.560]   Did you you you worked in the music industry?
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:46.960]   Did you ever deal with Iovine?
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:53.460]   I did early very long ago, but only shook his hand in Metam in the early 90s.
[00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:56.260]   So I don't know if he's sleazy or not.
[00:26:56.260 --> 00:27:03.460]   I my sense of him is that he is a hype master, but he has produced some of the greatest albums of all time, including you.
[00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:04.460]   You're the master.
[00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:05.460]   I mean, we're talking about Apple.
[00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:12.960]   Well, I mean, there's you know, you know, I think that that's I mean, Apple does make good products, but a lot of it's built on what people believe around.
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:13.060]   Right.
[00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:15.660]   And he's been very good at marketing beats.
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:19.960]   If all I get is HTC style speakers on the next iPhone, I'll be happy with the deal.
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:20.960]   That would be awesome.
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:26.960]   And by the way, look how well beats helped HTC sell the one last year so much so that they sold off their steak.
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:29.460]   I bet now they wish they hadn't.
[00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:34.560]   If the rumor is true, they just threw away hundreds of millions of dollars, but that's another matter.
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:35.460]   Can't catch a break.
[00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:39.560]   Can't catch a break, but it didn't help the HTC one have the beats label on it.
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:46.260]   They got rid of it and they boom sound, which is identical on the HTC second HTC one.
[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:51.160]   I don't know what the advantage of the beats name was in that particular market.
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:52.460]   I don't think I don't think it's the beats name.
[00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:54.260]   I really think that the it's the people there.
[00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:59.760]   I think it's subscription service and I think the trying to, you know, I mean, I think that the headphones definitely generate revenue.
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:00.860]   So that makes it an easier.
[00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:01.260]   Right.
[00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:02.060]   People swallow the far.
[00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:05.460]   Although this is US dollars and most of Apple's cash is overseas, right?
[00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:06.460]   For tax reasons.
[00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:08.360]   And that could be useful for them as well.
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:09.960]   But it's not an international purchase.
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:14.060]   If you know what if beach where beats were headquartered in Belgium, I'd say this is true.
[00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:16.360]   Because it's almost free money.
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:23.460]   But if it if there but it's a US it's US dollars and that that's cash that Apple is not open enough.
[00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:26.760]   We're talking about the dollar amount that we don't know as genuine or not.
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:27.260]   Right.
[00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:28.160]   Or what currency would be paid in.
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:28.860]   So right.
[00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:30.460]   Be paid in Frank's.
[00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:31.260]   I'm sure I have.
[00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:32.960]   It has a Cayman Islands, you know, hotel.
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:33.960]   He could run business out of it.
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.460]   It's no.
[00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:44.860]   It's it's a nice bit of serendipity that this rumor was was really spreading the same weekend as the NFL draft, which is another thing that everybody who's paying attention and slaving over.
[00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:45.660]   Every detail of this.
[00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:47.260]   They don't have any roots in that business.
[00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:49.960]   They don't understand the ramifications of any of these deals being made.
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:55.160]   But it's fun to talk about because that's part of your community and maybe it will help you to understand the next decision a little bit better.
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:59.260]   So Andy, are you an expert in NFL draft strategy?
[00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:05.260]   Well, I will say that I bought a very nice suit to wear over the weekend.
[00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:07.660]   Just in case I got that call that call did not come.
[00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:13.160]   I also was not picked for the Eurovision song contest and nobody sent me flowers from other's day.
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.760]   So why did I bother getting out of bed this weekend?
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:16.960]   That's why I've been asking myself.
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:21.160]   Andry and we'll call you and Deria reversed.
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:26.760]   I want to know how they print those teach.
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:35.360]   Do they know at a time in the draft that the guy is going to get picked by that team or do they just like they announce it and the guy.
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:41.160]   There's a guy in the back with one of those machines making the jersey, putting the guys letters on the jersey.
[00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:43.260]   So they have it because it's so quick.
[00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:45.160]   Or they print every jersey in advance just in.
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:52.360]   Oh, I know he has a video in advance of every single potential pick going.
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:55.160]   I wonder I wonder the same thing too.
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:30:04.460]   But I also thought that it probably would not cost a lot of money if you were in any way at an NFL prospect to make sure you have one of every baseball caps standing by.
[00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:06.760]   I guess so at your house and win for that call.
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:07.860]   That's your age's job.
[00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:08.760]   I'm absolutely with you.
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:11.460]   I think about these things and just like I'm thinking about.
[00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:16.860]   Okay, so what is when you win an Oscar, what is the process for actually getting your name on the thing?
[00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:18.260]   Yeah, actually they take it back.
[00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:20.360]   Yeah, actually they had that.
[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:22.860]   That's why it was so cool to see it at the governor's ball.
[00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:28.960]   They actually had an engraving station set up where you at every Oscar winner at the party had a weighted line.
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.660]   Like here's my Oscar.
[00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:31.660]   See here's my tick.
[00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:32.660]   Here's my claim ticket.
[00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:38.660]   They would engrave up the plate for you and actually stick it on it with a special jig because like, okay, so that's how you do it.
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:39.760]   Great because you don't want to.
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:40.560]   You don't want to have an ill.
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:42.860]   Awesome line when you love to be in that line.
[00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:45.360]   Hey, Kevin.
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:50.660]   It's a it's a it's a line of people who are not used to waiting in line for it.
[00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:51.360]   That's anything.
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:53.260]   Cut sees cut sees, Meryl.
[00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:55.860]   I got she didn't win this year.
[00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:56.960]   I'm sorry, Meryl didn't mean to.
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.160]   I'm salt in the wound.
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:00.760]   She she won by virtue of being Meryl Streep.
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:01.960]   That's the greatest prize of all.
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.860]   One at the end of the day you get to be Meryl Streep.
[00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:05.260]   You're not going home a loser.
[00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:06.060]   She should have won.
[00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:10.760]   She actually did her performance in was it August of Sage County?
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:11.760]   I can't remember what the movie was.
[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:17.960]   It was just unbelievably good and involved fisticuffs.
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:18.960]   So that's nice.
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:23.060]   Our show today brought to you by audible.com.
[00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:24.060]   My friends.
[00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:29.560]   All I have to say is audible.com and then Andy will go for another minute and then we'll end the ad.
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:35.560]   I we are audible fanatics that we were talking before the show about Andy's recommendation a few weeks ago.
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:43.360]   A really great biography of the Beatles and I made the mistake of and Andy Andy has warned me now.
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:47.860]   So I won't make this mistake again, but I was I'm three quarters away through flash boys,
[00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:52.660]   which is a great book too, which I recommended a couple of weeks ago.
[00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:57.860]   And I thought, well, I think by start by accident, the Beatles book tune in started by accident.
[00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:01.060]   So I just listen to a little bit four chapters later.
[00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:05.960]   I've completely forgotten about high frequency trading in the stock market and I am living in Liverpool.
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:06.660]   I love it.
[00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:14.560]   Mark Lewis and amazing book 43 hours and they only get to 1962.
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:20.360]   The part the place where the Beatles are about to become famous, but are not yet.
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:24.060]   I thank you for that recommendation.
[00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:26.660]   So this book could be yours free 43 hours free.
[00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:32.560]   If you visit audible.com/macbreak audible has 150,000 titles.
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:35.360]   All the new books come out on audible.com.
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:36.460]   They're phenomenal.
[00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:37.560]   Andy, what are you listening to?
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:44.560]   Right now it's a creativity incorporated overcoming the unseen forces that stand in the way of true inspiration.
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:45.260]   What the hell?
[00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:46.060]   Yeah.
[00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:48.060]   And but but look at the cover of the book.
[00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:49.360]   I see that it is actually Buzz Light.
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:50.560]   You're that it's okay.
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:53.060]   Oh, it's a control exactly.
[00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:56.160]   Our cat mother, get more. Oh my God, he's one of the founders of Pixar.
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:33:03.960]   Yeah, this is it's it's mostly a management book, but it's also specifically here's how we manage creative people at Pixar.
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:09.760]   So if you're looking for inside stories of, well, when we first tested Tom Hanks for no, you're not going to get stories like that.
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:16.860]   You're going to get stories about how how do you how do you design a building so that creative people can actually get stuff done.
[00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:22.960]   And even the first couple chapters, he goes into detail over the simplest thing about how there's a conference room with a table in it.
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:33.060]   And how that screwed everybody up the fact that there is a long conference room table in this building in this room because if there's a table, then there are chairs at that table.
[00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:52.860]   If there are chairs at that table, then people have to choose where to sit and they're going to decide that if you've got important things to say, then they have to sit next to the important person, which leads to having place cards set up, which leads to people entering the room and seeing the place cards and immediately deciding that, okay, that person must be more important than me, but I must be more important than this person, which is why it became really important.
[00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:54.560]   It's important to get rid of that damn table.
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:34:00.360]   So it really is a nice little look into the problems of it's not enough to be highly creative.
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:04.960]   You have to run a business that allows creative people to get stuff done as a major team.
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:09.060]   So you don't do that by saying, you know what, we're not going to have any walls anywhere.
[00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:17.360]   We're just going to have a giant porch with natural grass and you're not allowed to wear shoes or any pants that go below the knee because we're not into that corporate stuff.
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:18.660]   Well, no, you have to run a business.
[00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:19.860]   So great stuff.
[00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:22.760]   I'm only above four or five chapters into it right now.
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:27.960]   But it's becoming a really, really cool book with a lot of insights that I would never have figured out.
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:29.960]   I can't wait.
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:30.760]   Another great book.
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:31.560]   This is the problem.
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:33.460]   There's so many great books at audible.com.
[00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:35.260]   Really tough to pick your first one.
[00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:36.860]   There's a huge variety though.
[00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:39.660]   So go over to audible.com browse around when you're ready.
[00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:40.560]   You got the book.
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:42.460]   Go to audible.com/macbreak.

[00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:56.260]   You also get the book and pay nothing for the first 30 days.
[00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:59.960]   If you cancel on that time, you keep the book, but you don't have to give them any money.
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:01.460]   So that's truly free.
[00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:04.460]   But if you decide to stick around, you will be thrilled.
[00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:06.060]   Enjoy life more.
[00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:10.160]   Your commutes, your exercise sessions, Audible's just great.
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:15.660]   Last night I went to sleep listening to tune in listening to the Beatles book.
[00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:17.360]   It's just so great.
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:20.860]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:23.860]   Thank you, Yam, in our chatroom.
[00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:38.860]   Just inform me that coming up, I guess it's right now, the FCC's attorney, the senior council for external affairs for the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission,
[00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:45.360]   Gigi Sohn will be monitoring questions on the Twitter.
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:47.860]   This is how far we've come.
[00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:57.860]   Use the hashtag #FCCNetNeutrality or you can follow the discussion, #FCCNetNeutrality on Twitter.
[00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:02.860]   Now, the interesting point in this whole conversation is we still haven't seen the rules.
[00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:09.860]   We'll see them presumably tomorrow when Chairman Wheeler presents those rules to the commissioners and says,
[00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:12.860]   "What do you think? Should we open a period of public comment?"
[00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:14.860]   That's what they're going to vote on tomorrow.
[00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:19.860]   But I guess they understand what a hot button topic this is.
[00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:25.860]   They're already, even before the rules come out, at least entertaining people's questions.
[00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:26.860]   FCC.
[00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:30.860]   I think this happened on the votes on Thursday, right?
[00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:32.860]   Thursday, not tomorrow, yeah.
[00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:40.860]   So for the listeners, I think one of the things, this is the opportunity to continue to push the heat on the folks that are involved in this.
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:42.860]   So we shouldn't be letting up.
[00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:50.860]   No, and it may be the case that Chairman Wheeler is thinking about what he's going to ask about.
[00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:51.860]   I don't know.
[00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:59.860]   But I think that also the real question is that I think that if he doesn't think he's got enough people to move this forward with a vote, he may delay it.
[00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:02.860]   And I think that that once it gets delayed, I think it dies.
[00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:09.860]   Here's Gigi apparently using TweetDeck monitoring the Twitter.
[00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:13.860]   I don't know, but that looks like that big red staples button right behind her there.
[00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:16.860]   I think she's going to slap that and say that was easy.
[00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:17.860]   Yeah, easy button.
[00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:19.860]   Gigi Bson, SCC.
[00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:21.860]   It's all going to be very, very civil.
[00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:22.860]   Everybody's being polite.
[00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:25.860]   Oh, I can only imagine what these tweets are looking like.
[00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:27.860]   Well, let's look.
[00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:33.860]   A number, what's interesting is a number of members of Congress are using that hashtag right now.
[00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:37.860]   Senator Bernie Saunders from Vermont says the FCC is not dealing with widget production.
[00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:43.860]   It's dealing with the issue of how we create a vibrant democracy where people hear all points of view.
[00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:51.860]   Anna Eshew, who is a representative from Silicon Valley, many constituents calling for title two reclassification as MI.
[00:37:51.860 --> 00:38:00.860]   That's the one that says that broadband providers are common carriers to ensure strong FCC net neutrality rules with the FCC commit to considering this option.
[00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:03.860]   Thank you, Anna Eshew.
[00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:16.860]   This is really a, what maybe humorous or ironic or whatever is the fact that the industry pushed so hard for this to happen and what they end up with is reclassification as a result.
[00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:18.860]   And they probably would have been happy if they just left.
[00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:23.860]   Yeah, AT&T filed this week a brief.
[00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:32.860]   I presume for the FCC saying whatever you do, don't classify the Internet service providers as common carriers that would burden them with false security.
[00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:37.860]   It would burden them with far more regulations than mere net neutrality.
[00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:46.860]   It would be a, but I think that that's a good, I think that's a really good lesson for the industry that's trying to push this forward is for them to realize that that's all we're going to talk about every time they bring it up.
[00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:53.860]   Every time they try to pull back on that neutrality, what everyone else is going to push back for is reclassification.
[00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:56.860]   And they risk that every time they bring up the conversation.
[00:38:56.860 --> 00:39:02.860]   That's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it was.
[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:07.860]   Only I think every part of the world that has common carrier and local loop on bundling has not only cheaper service, but way, way better service because suddenly infrastructure and quality of service becomes competitive competitive.
[00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:09.860]   The key is competition.
[00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:22.860]   And I like what you said about, uh, unbundling, uh, open loop on bundling because that's one thing that has kept competition from happening in the US cable carriers, uh, have exclusive access to their own cable.
[00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:27.860]   So if you have Comcast or Cox or Time Warner, only they can provide internet over those cables.
[00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:29.860]   It's not the case with telephone lines, as we know.
[00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:33.860]   And I see no reason why the FCC shouldn't require the same of cable companies.
[00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:35.860]   That by itself might be enough.
[00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:37.860]   That would maybe make us a first class citizen on the internet.
[00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:38.860]   Yeah.
[00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:39.860]   Yeah.
[00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:43.860]   Anyway, I know we've talked a lot about this and you know what?
[00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:46.860]   It's not over and we're going to talk a lot more after Thursday.
[00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:51.860]   Um, but I think boy, I'm really gratified by the incredible, uh,
[00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:54.860]   amount of conversation and outcry.
[00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:57.860]   Uh, you know, you don't see it on CNN.
[00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:01.860]   You don't see it on your local news, but you do see it on the internet.
[00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:06.860]   In fact, Ben Collins says as TV blacking out net neutrality coverage.
[00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:12.860]   Um, you know, I think this is, I think this is a huge topic.
[00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:16.860]   Ben's writing for Esquire magazine is there a media blackout on the net neutrality story.
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:17.860]   We'll find out today.
[00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:22.860]   Well, a Twitter disaster finally be enough to make net neutrality an issue TV can care about.
[00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:25.860]   And of course he's referring to this chat that's going on.
[00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:27.860]   I think it might be over actually.
[00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:32.860]   I think this might be very illustrative of the growing power of the internet versus TV.
[00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:35.860]   You know, it used to be the TV was really where you had to get to to move that forward.
[00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:40.860]   But for things that constantly be scuttled without any coverage at all, I think in many ways,
[00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:44.860]   by TV not covering it, they undermine their own relevancy.
[00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:47.860]   You know, as we keep on looking at these things moving forward.
[00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:49.860]   Very hopeful.
[00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:50.860]   I am very hopeful.
[00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:59.860]   Uh, I think that what has become very clear is that we're paying attention and they can't just, you know, sneak this stuff by.
[00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:05.860]   I'm looking forward to the change where historically the people who vote the most are the youngest and the oldest.
[00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:13.860]   Uh, and the fact that now we're getting into an older generation of people who grew up with technology and grew up with the internet.
[00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:20.860]   That we are going to be the ARP people at 72 73, importing the senior trolley to the voting center and we want net neutrality.
[00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:28.860]   And we want to make sure that we have, uh, we have access to encryption and we want to make sure that law enforcement can get access to our data.
[00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:31.860]   That's going to be an interesting shift in the next 10 to 20 years, I think.
[00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:32.860]   Yeah.
[00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:39.860]   Hey, let me ask you about 10, nine, three, uh, Mr. Renee Richie.
[00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:41.860]   When are we going to see that?
[00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:45.860]   Uh, sometime between now and WWDC, if Apple holds to their previous patterns.
[00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:46.860]   I mean, that's what they usually do.
[00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:47.860]   They're working on it.
[00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:48.860]   There's no real pressure for it.
[00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:50.860]   It does a lot of things like the 4K display.
[00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:53.860]   That's why I'm asking because I bought a 4K display.
[00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:54.860]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:54.860 --> 00:42:00.860]   So again, like we don't want it out too early because then there will be a lot of bugs that annoy us even more than having to wait for it would.
[00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:05.860]   Um, so when they released the developer seeds and developers like, we're really happy with this one.
[00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:07.860]   That's when I kind of wanted to be really.
[00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:14.860]   So, uh, I bought the, I got, I finally got, uh, uh, I had to keep up with the, uh, with the brownies.
[00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:22.860]   Arkez Brownlee, MKBHD, he's been, you know, he was on Twitter, Twitter and last week and said, oh, I got the 4K display.
[00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:25.860]   And so I guess there's only two that are worth getting.
[00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:31.860]   The sharp and the Asus both are, I think, they're the same panel made by just with different branding on them.
[00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:36.860]   Both apparently can do 60 Hertz, which you're, but you said your boss at, uh, uh, uh,
[00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:37.860]   Marcus, yeah.
[00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:41.860]   Marcus has, has three 4K displays on his back, bro.
[00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:43.860]   Which ones does he have?
[00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:44.860]   The sharp.
[00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:47.860]   Uh, no, I think he got the dels when they were on sale.
[00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:48.860]   The dels are.
[00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:49.860]   Yeah.
[00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:50.860]   Yeah.
[00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:54.860]   Now apparently even the dels can go to 60 Hertz with his new to 10.9.3.
[00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:55.860]   Yes.
[00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:58.860]   So you're never, you're never blinded by a stutter recursor ever again.
[00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:05.860]   And then the other issue, actually maybe in a bigger issue is scaling because when you're running in display,
[00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:09.860]   that is, uh, what is, what is 4K?
[00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:10.860]   40.
[00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:11.860]   It's four times.
[00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:12.860]   It's 4 times 60.
[00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:13.860]   Yeah.
[00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:15.860]   Then what, then a 1080p display.
[00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:16.860]   All the icons.
[00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:17.860]   The text.
[00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:19.860]   So that's the part of 10 of a 10.9.3.
[00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:22.860]   That's not finished yet is the ideal would be like a retina display on the Mac.
[00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:23.860]   Currently they're going to do that.
[00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:24.860]   Yeah.
[00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:25.860]   Yeah.
[00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:26.860]   And they're working on that right now.
[00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:28.860]   It doesn't look like it's perfectly finished yet.
[00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:29.860]   Oh, okay.
[00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:30.860]   That's probably the last 100 yards on.
[00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:33.860]   So Apple opened this beta program to the public.
[00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:36.860]   You don't have to be a developer.
[00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:45.860]   You can, you can get into the beta seed program by just going to apple seed dot apple dot com.
[00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:46.860]   And sign up.
[00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:48.860]   And all you have to do is have an apple ID.
[00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:49.860]   You do not have to pay 99 bucks.
[00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:51.860]   You do not have to be a developer.
[00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:56.860]   You can join it that you'll download a little thing that will change your machine in some subtle way.
[00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:59.860]   And all of a sudden the app store will offer an update to 10.9.3.
[00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:00.860]   I did it this morning.
[00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:03.860]   So I could hook up this 4K display.
[00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:05.860]   But was that a mistake Renee Richie?
[00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:16.860]   No, I mean for you Leo, it's not a mistake for a normal person who only has one machine and doesn't have something like a secondary drive to boot from stay stay, you know, whatever curse word you want to put in away from it.
[00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:18.860]   It's not meant for you.
[00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:21.860]   You give up standard apple care, standard apple support.
[00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:26.860]   It's really a sign that says I am an expert user and I am willing to take on this responsibility myself.
[00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:29.860]   And I hope Apple's making that really, really clear to people.
[00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:35.860]   But for someone like you, someone who has multiple machines, someone who's happy booting from secondary volumes and it's a fun thing to play with.
[00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:38.860]   I think so.
[00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:40.860]   I'm not boasting.
[00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:42.860]   But.
[00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:43.860]   Humblebrag.
[00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:44.860]   Humblebrag.
[00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:46.860]   Mac Pro.
[00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:49.860]   Two cinema displays, 27 inch cinema displays.
[00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:54.860]   And in the middle, the 31.5 inch 4K monitor, it's just.
[00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:56.860]   I thought you look a little more tan Leo.
[00:44:56.860 --> 00:45:00.860]   Well, I can't turn on the monitor because I don't have the right cable.
[00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:05.860]   Have you figured out exactly where to put the microwave burrito to have it automatically cook on your desktop?
[00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:07.860]   Look, I'm already sterile. It's not going to make it any worse.
[00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:09.860]   So it's good.
[00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:17.860]   But it looks like nice because it doesn't match, but the middle monitor is big, a little bigger, and it just looks like it has wings.
[00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:19.860]   You can run NORAD out of pedal.
[00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:21.860]   Have you done any flight simulators in it?
[00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:22.860]   I can't do anything.
[00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:23.860]   I don't have the right cable.
[00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:28.860]   So in order to make this work, you have to have a monitor has a full size display port.
[00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:31.860]   And then I have a Thunderbolt 2 port on my Mac Pro.
[00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:35.860]   And you have to have a mini display port to maxi display port cable.
[00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:37.860]   So I ordered one. I'll have one later today.
[00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:38.860]   But.
[00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:39.860]   I would probably have one downstairs.
[00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:43.860]   You know what? There probably is one in the studio, but I didn't want to take a chance.
[00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:46.860]   Because there's nothing sadder than sitting at your desk.
[00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:48.860]   And both these side monitors are working.
[00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:50.860]   But the middle wires are just this black hole.
[00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:52.860]   Power setting mode.
[00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:56.860]   Anyway, I did it for again. I always do this.
[00:45:56.860 --> 00:46:03.860]   I do it for you, the people, so that I can report on how 4K support is going and etc.
[00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:04.860]   etc.
[00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:05.860]   I appreciate it, Leo.
[00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:06.860]   It's just for you.
[00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:07.860]   Yep.
[00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:12.860]   But you do need, apparently to get 60 Hertz, you do not, you do need a display port connection,
[00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:16.860]   not an HDMI connection because HDMI just won't do it.
[00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:22.860]   And you need to have 10.9.3.
[00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:24.860]   Because what I was reading, this is weird.
[00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:27.860]   What it sends out is two 1920 by 1080 signals.
[00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:29.860]   Like it's two, it makes it two monitors.
[00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:31.860]   It's like dual link.
[00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:32.860]   The EI was in the old days.
[00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:33.860]   Yeah.
[00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:35.860]   Because even now the display, I mean the rumors are thunderbolt three already.
[00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:39.860]   But even now it's hard to push that much data through the cables we have now.
[00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:43.860]   3840 by 2160.
[00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:48.860]   And then supposedly they're going to have this scaling that they do on the red in this place.
[00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:52.860]   Enough pixels to show the entire internet at once, Leo.
[00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:57.220]   I can't tell you how happy that makes me the little boy version of myself who had the Apple
[00:46:57.220 --> 00:47:03.460]   2 TV set plugged into an Apple 2E with just green phosphor.
[00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:09.140]   And just seeing that I've got one, two, three monitors, all ultra high definition and whatever
[00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:11.860]   I want to put on any one of them, it works great.
[00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:17.220]   I think that is totally the right style to have multiple monitors as opposed to a one
[00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:18.220]   big one.
[00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:22.260]   I'd rather have three small ones that are just about this big than the one big 60 inch
[00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:23.260]   right.
[00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:27.860]   But I have to say 31 and a half inch 16, nine monitors, pretty big ass monitor.
[00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:35.100]   That's pretty, you know, you almost want a virtual ping pong game so that you can actually
[00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:36.100]   that's.
[00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:37.100]   I want.
[00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:41.820]   Is there something, is there like a screensaver I can get that will scroll all those?
[00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:44.540]   It'll take a day and it has to get a cost.
[00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:47.860]   Basically what you're saying is that if any of our listeners have any blown pixels on
[00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:50.660]   their display, it's because Leo needed that pixel for his model.
[00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:51.660]   That's my pixel.
[00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:53.780]   I put a picture in the chat room.
[00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:56.980]   Leo, that's before the latest beta enabled him to do all three though.
[00:47:56.980 --> 00:47:57.980]   Oh, good.
[00:47:57.980 --> 00:47:58.980]   All right.
[00:47:58.980 --> 00:47:59.980]   So this is your boss's setup.
[00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:00.980]   Yeah.
[00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:03.020]   Uh, at, uh, yeah.
[00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:04.620]   But see now, see, yeah.
[00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:05.620]   Yeah.
[00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:07.340]   So he's got two of those.
[00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:08.340]   Yeah.
[00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:09.340]   They're big.
[00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:10.340]   Wow.
[00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:12.340]   Lawrence of Arabia.
[00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:14.900]   So with the Mac book pros, it's only got two thunderbolts out.
[00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:16.260]   So the third one has to go in the HDMI.
[00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:18.780]   So you have a little, you're giving up a little bit there, but with the Mac pro, you should
[00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:20.540]   have no problem.
[00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:21.540]   Okay.
[00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:24.380]   So we'll see.
[00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:26.940]   I feel like there's no way this is going to work.
[00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:28.220]   It's going to end well.
[00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:30.580]   This is not going to end well.
[00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:32.180]   Um, all right.
[00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:34.180]   I'll send you a picture.
[00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:35.180]   Perfect.
[00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:37.180]   So many pixels.
[00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:40.660]   I don't even, I have no reason to do this.
[00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:42.500]   I have no need for this.
[00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:43.500]   What?
[00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:47.580]   That's, that's exactly the reason why you should, you would not be a Mac user if you
[00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:50.940]   didn't just simply say, Oh, you mean that theoretically I could have this many displays
[00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:51.940]   attached?
[00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:52.940]   Let's test that out.
[00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:53.940]   Right.
[00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:55.940]   That's why you crossed the scene and climbed the mountain.
[00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:56.940]   Because it's there.
[00:48:56.940 --> 00:49:01.500]   And I'm still less than Ryan Shrout over a, of our this weekend computer hardware show
[00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:03.540]   that PC perspective, he has five.
[00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:07.580]   You have to come over to my, my house sometime, Leo.
[00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:09.340]   Alex has a vest.
[00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:10.780]   Now I'm going to feel bad.
[00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:11.780]   What do you got?
[00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:14.900]   Well, it's not all connected to one computer.
[00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:22.260]   So it's, but I have an array of, um, it's, um, it's only got 10 monitors right now, but
[00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:24.980]   it's, it's capable of 10.
[00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:30.700]   Yeah, but I pulled, I pulled sections out of it so that I could put up some other things.
[00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:32.340]   So it's not, it's not all on.
[00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:33.340]   It's not all on at one time.
[00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:34.340]   That's at home.
[00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:35.340]   This is not your office.
[00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:36.340]   This is home.
[00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:38.940]   Well, many of those are live shots from friends.
[00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:40.780]   It's how I do, it's how I do remote training.
[00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:42.500]   It's, it's a test test for that.
[00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:46.340]   So it's, so I've got a bunch of, a bunch of stuff that's, so I have like confidence monitors
[00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:50.140]   so that no matter which way I turn, I can, uh, I can see what I'm editing and because
[00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:54.860]   I'm editing, you know, it's kind of like your office, your other studio, um, except if monitors
[00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:57.620]   were home in front of you and you could turn in a couple of different directions and have
[00:49:57.620 --> 00:50:00.860]   confidence and see question engine stuff and, you know,
[00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:02.220]   here's my question.
[00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:03.220]   How can I do this?
[00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:05.820]   Is it like Ozmandias in the watchman?
[00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:07.820]   Is that what Alex has?
[00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:09.820]   I don't know.
[00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:11.700]   I keep on falling asleep in the middle of the watchman.
[00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:12.700]   I'm not geeky enough.
[00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:13.700]   I do.
[00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:17.420]   I think it's too long and I've already had too much gin or something.
[00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:18.420]   I watch it.
[00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:19.900]   I get like halfway through where he's underground.
[00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:21.380]   He's got some ship and then I fall asleep.
[00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:23.060]   So it's like 12 TVs at once.
[00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:24.260]   The seed program is kind of me.
[00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:29.100]   I don't remember Apple ever doing this, allowing people to download a beta version of, uh,
[00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:31.780]   the West 10 without being a developer.
[00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:32.780]   Kind of.
[00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:37.220]   I mean, they, they're years and years ago before they really, uh, locked down the developer
[00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:38.220]   program, you could get access.
[00:50:38.220 --> 00:50:41.940]   I don't, I don't, you can almost get access to pricing, I think, in the very, very early
[00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:42.940]   days.
[00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:47.880]   But yeah, what I'm concerned about is that, uh, I'm hoping that people follow Renee's advice
[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:50.940]   and they need to understand that this is beta for a reason.
[00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:53.580]   It really isn't ready for human consumption yet.
[00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:56.980]   And I'm wondering what knock on effect this is going to have for support in the Apple
[00:50:56.980 --> 00:51:02.260]   store where something is something isn't working now and you bring it in and you kind of lead,
[00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:05.020]   would you, would you kind of get zorched out of support by saying, Oh, it's a beta.
[00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:08.620]   So now we don't, we don't know how to test what's going on because it could be just
[00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:13.820]   the beta and how is this going to affect, uh, makers of independent developers of software
[00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:18.140]   where now they've got to work on bug fix reports that could be just a simple fact that they
[00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:22.420]   have, they're running on, uh, on a computer that is essentially made out of cheese whiz
[00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:23.780]   and broken Lego bits.
[00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:24.780]   Yeah.
[00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:28.420]   Well, I think the big advantage for us is users though who are waiting and I'm still, you
[00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:31.860]   know, most of my computers are all still on 10 on 10, eight, six.
[00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:34.940]   Um, we slowly, we slowly add nine.
[00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:38.340]   There's a bunch of video stuff that we have on, on the back end that doesn't work as well
[00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:40.340]   and in the new one and the new version.
[00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:43.980]   So, so we've been very slowly like adding one computer at a time.
[00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:46.980]   But the big advantage and one of the reasons we like to do that is we like everybody else
[00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:47.980]   to test for us.
[00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:52.700]   And so in a lot of ways by making this more open, it also means that there's more gamutesters,
[00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:56.700]   you know, that can, um, you know, bang on things and give theoretically Apple a lot
[00:51:56.700 --> 00:52:00.300]   more feedback before they actually have to pull the trigger so we don't complain about
[00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:01.300]   the release version.
[00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:04.140]   I'm also, I'm also a little superior.
[00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:05.140]   I'm sorry.
[00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:06.140]   Go ahead.
[00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:08.140]   I thought Microsoft has done open beta is in the past as well.
[00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:09.140]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:11.300]   But that's, that's actually, oh yeah, Microsoft does it all the time.
[00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:12.300]   Yeah.
[00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:15.180]   The kind of ties into what I was going to say too, because they don't just simply, it's
[00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:16.500]   not just for bug reporting.
[00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:20.940]   It's for we're produced, we're introducing a radical new feature and we want to get, we
[00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:26.260]   want it to get it into hands of people who are highly motivated to try out new things.
[00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:32.300]   And so it's not as though the version that actually ships to consumers is just the developer
[00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:33.860]   edition with some fixes.
[00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:38.300]   You've seen entire features come and go or tweaked amazingly from the start to the finish
[00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:40.380]   based on usability feedback.
[00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:43.700]   So when I, when Apple first announced this, one of the thoughts going through my head
[00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:49.340]   is, uh, it's no secret that the next version of, uh, of, uh, Mac OS is probably going to
[00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:54.700]   have a UI overhaul is one of the reasons for this, the ability to put some of these radical
[00:52:54.700 --> 00:53:00.460]   changes in the field early so that they can simply say, okay, people do not like the, the
[00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:02.100]   lightness of these fonts.
[00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:05.220]   People wish, want a little bit more guidance and highlights on buttons.
[00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:09.300]   Uh, and so they know that they have the ability to fix that before they send it to the general
[00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:10.300]   population.
[00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:12.900]   This is exactly what happened when they redesigned iOS seven.
[00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:17.860]   Uh, if you compare the version that they released to developers at WWDC last year to
[00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:22.700]   the version that shipped, it was substantially the same interface, but there were a lot of
[00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:25.620]   subtle tweaks made to make it easier to navigate.
[00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:30.740]   A lot of the translucency was toned down a great deal to, uh, tone down some of the confusion.
[00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:33.300]   So that's, that's what went through my mind as I'm thinking about this.
[00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:37.460]   If they are really doing a radical redesign of Mac OS, it's a good thing to put that in
[00:53:37.460 --> 00:53:41.740]   front of as many people as possible before you are telling every or telling or forcing
[00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:45.220]   everybody to force, uh, to, uh, upgrade to the new one.
[00:53:45.220 --> 00:53:48.900]   And the amount of QA or development in the world is equal to a million users pounding
[00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:49.900]   on yourself.
[00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:52.580]   I think Microsoft got a lot of benefit with the public, uh, beta's.
[00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:54.340]   It's done off the last couple of versions of Windows.
[00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:57.140]   It's been really, I think a big part of, uh, success.
[00:53:57.140 --> 00:53:59.980]   They don't, uh, I mean, that's how you, that's how you find the books.
[00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:04.780]   You get all these, we, and especially from Microsoft, cause there's hardware is not heterogeneous.
[00:54:04.780 --> 00:54:06.020]   There's all kinds of different hardware.
[00:54:06.020 --> 00:54:07.020]   Yeah.
[00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:08.020]   It's not.
[00:54:08.020 --> 00:54:09.020]   It's not.
[00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:10.020]   It's heterogeneous.
[00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:11.020]   Insert mail dot app.
[00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:12.020]   Joke here.
[00:54:12.020 --> 00:54:14.060]   Oh, I got a whole story about mail dot app.
[00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:15.060]   I'll share with you.
[00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:19.000]   Um, real quickly, uh, somebody I think beat master in the chat room said, uh, does this
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.500]   mean journalists will have access and can report about it?
[00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:26.300]   And as Renee pointed out in the chat room, no, you're still, you signed the NDA.
[00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:32.340]   I had a sign in NDA, but my, my feeling is 10, nine, three is out any minute now.
[00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:34.860]   I mean, at worst case in months, right?
[00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:37.020]   Also, I looked very carefully at the language.
[00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:42.100]   I, I didn't join the program chiefly for that reason, but the, the, the language in the
[00:54:42.100 --> 00:54:47.380]   agreement explicitly says that your secrecy is limited to only things that you could not
[00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:50.220]   have found out, uh, at least you were part of the program.
[00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:54.900]   So if Apple insider or any of these other sites were to report on something, then you
[00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:56.780]   are, you have the ability to comment on that.
[00:54:56.780 --> 00:55:00.460]   So long as you're not saying, well, I have access to the beta and here's what my experiences
[00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:03.580]   were on my G four cube, but I don't download it.
[00:55:03.580 --> 00:55:04.780]   So I'm not on D eight either.
[00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:08.740]   I'm, I'm kind of very interested in the idea of how this four K thing will work.
[00:55:08.740 --> 00:55:13.460]   The other question that people have is, can you use the cheap four K displays, the sub
[00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:17.100]   thousand dollar four K TVs and so forth, uh, with it?
[00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:22.460]   And I think the consensus seems to be, you might be able to you probably, but you'll
[00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:23.700]   probably be limited to 30.
[00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:24.860]   You won't get 60 Hertz.
[00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:25.860]   Yeah.
[00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:26.860]   Yeah.
[00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:30.820]   So that's, it's unknown, I guess, and I'm not going to go out and buy a sake or something
[00:55:30.820 --> 00:55:33.380]   just to see, but, um,
[00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:36.380]   And that doesn't bother some people.
[00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:38.980]   And some people are much more sensitive to visual refresh rates than others.
[00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:39.980]   Right.
[00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:42.660]   Lucky enough that, you know, the cursor doesn't bother you and it bleeds a little bit of a
[00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:44.700]   trail than, you know, save your money.
[00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:45.700]   Right.
[00:55:45.700 --> 00:55:46.700]   I'm excited.
[00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:48.220]   I'll be, I'll be playing with it tonight.
[00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:51.300]   And now the chat rooms challenge, I mean, they said, well, if you do that, then you've
[00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:57.020]   got to get the 128 gigabyte memory for two thousand bucks.
[00:55:57.020 --> 00:56:03.260]   I can't now, now I do have to, I'll, I'll defer to you, Alex on this one, because I
[00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:06.540]   have a 16 gigabyte, which seems to me a lot.
[00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:10.740]   Uh, I think what you're doing, I don't think that there's any reason to go more than more
[00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:11.740]   than 16.
[00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:14.780]   I don't, I mean, you wouldn't even look at it when it was 12 gigabytes.
[00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:16.300]   You said, no, no, no, we can't use that.
[00:56:16.300 --> 00:56:19.980]   Uh, I mean, 16 is what we, we really consider kind of a minimum to do a lot of the stuff
[00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:20.980]   that we're doing.
[00:56:20.980 --> 00:56:21.980]   Yeah.
[00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:22.980]   Yeah.
[00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:23.980]   Yeah.
[00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:24.980]   That's where we were, you know, that voice a lot of problems.
[00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:28.980]   I mean, Ram and Ram and hard drive space for the two things that generally get, you
[00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:33.940]   know, the biggest hits in performance is where, you know, when you improve those is
[00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:34.940]   where I usually get that.
[00:56:34.940 --> 00:56:39.020]   And so you start opening up big Photoshop files or you start opening up, you know, 3D
[00:56:39.020 --> 00:56:41.860]   renders, there's lots of things that start to suck up a lot of Ram.
[00:56:41.860 --> 00:56:45.020]   But if you're just doing the, the, a lot of the stuff that most of us normally do, I
[00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:46.580]   don't see any reason to have more.
[00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:50.900]   You know what I'm most excited about and actually we'll use this for is Lightroom and Photoshop
[00:56:50.900 --> 00:56:55.860]   where, uh, because of the scaling, I'll just as with the MacBook Pro Retina, I'll be able
[00:56:55.860 --> 00:56:57.620]   to see the interface normally.
[00:56:57.620 --> 00:57:01.060]   Um, I'll keep the image, the full size image on one screen.
[00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:05.220]   I'll have the editing image on another screen and that image will be one to one on high-res
[00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:06.220]   photos.
[00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:10.820]   And I think that that's going to be really nice to have that kind of clarity at that size.
[00:57:10.820 --> 00:57:11.820]   Yeah.
[00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:15.980]   Being able to move a lot of your palettes in Photoshop is actually moving to other, other
[00:57:15.980 --> 00:57:16.980]   screens.
[00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:20.260]   I mean, that's, uh, I've never done it with three.
[00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:23.740]   I've had three, but I've never really been able to settle into three monitors.
[00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:24.740]   I really prefer two.
[00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:28.940]   Um, but moving all of my stuff over for a lot of my applications definitely allows you to
[00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:30.740]   really focus on what you're working on.
[00:57:30.740 --> 00:57:34.420]   With Lightroom, uh, two is probably plenty because what you have is one display will
[00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:39.740]   have the image full screen that you've selected to work on and then the palette and the tools
[00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:44.100]   and the thumbnails, smaller version will be on the mounting screen.
[00:57:44.100 --> 00:57:49.260]   And so you can look at the, yeah, and I don't know what the color accuracy on the, uh, on
[00:57:49.260 --> 00:57:53.580]   the Asus is or what it's an IGZO, which is supposedly the Exos are pretty accurate,
[00:57:53.580 --> 00:57:56.260]   but I don't know what the, I don't know what the color space is or anything.
[00:57:56.260 --> 00:57:58.580]   It probably won't match the Apple on it or so.
[00:57:58.580 --> 00:58:01.860]   You can, you can oftentimes get those pretty close, almost any monitor pretty close with
[00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:03.900]   something like a spider, you know, a little spider.
[00:58:03.900 --> 00:58:07.740]   Um, you know, you put those on and they get it's not, it's not as accurate as a color
[00:58:07.740 --> 00:58:10.820]   accurate monitor, but it's within a hair.
[00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:15.540]   I kind of in my lesson because I bought that cheap monitor.
[00:58:15.540 --> 00:58:21.460]   Um, the 30 inch, remember that way back when I bought a 30 inch display from, uh, uh, which
[00:58:21.460 --> 00:58:25.580]   McCollum, those cheap guys, Shimian, no, and I didn't buy the Shimian.
[00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:26.580]   I know you like the Shimian.
[00:58:26.580 --> 00:58:29.820]   I just, but it was, it was the same time as you bought the Shimian, but I got it from,
[00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:31.900]   uh, the cable company, you know, which McCollum.
[00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:32.900]   Yeah.
[00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:33.900]   Monoprice.
[00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:34.900]   Yeah.
[00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:35.900]   Monoprice.
[00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:36.900]   They had a 30 inch monitor.
[00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:37.900]   It was fairly cheap and I could never get it.
[00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:39.300]   The, the cinematist play looks so much better.
[00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:43.900]   Having that next to a cinematist play was just unusable because it's like, ooh, uh, ooh.
[00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:44.900]   Right.
[00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:46.540]   And I could never get it anywhere close ever.
[00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:48.100]   Well, and was that consistency?
[00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:50.500]   I mean, because a lot of times it's, it's how long it lasts.
[00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:51.500]   It's brightness.
[00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:53.100]   It's consistent from the entire image.
[00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:54.100]   So loads of it.
[00:58:54.100 --> 00:58:55.100]   Yeah.
[00:58:55.100 --> 00:58:57.100]   And the colors, I think the color space was different.
[00:58:57.100 --> 00:58:58.100]   Right.
[00:58:58.100 --> 00:58:59.100]   Anyway, we'll see.
[00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:00.100]   We'll see.
[00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:01.900]   I mean, I'm not buying 128 gigs of RAM.
[00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:05.700]   What do you think I'm not someone on Twitter has to buy it first and then.
[00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:06.700]   Yeah.
[00:59:06.700 --> 00:59:08.180]   Not until Marcus Brownlee does.
[00:59:08.180 --> 00:59:12.740]   If Marcus Brownlee buys it, then you better believe I'm going out and getting it.
[00:59:12.740 --> 00:59:13.740]   Damn.
[00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:14.740]   Yeah.
[00:59:14.740 --> 00:59:15.740]   I'm just trying to think.
[00:59:15.740 --> 00:59:17.380]   I just realized I think that there was a, I can remember a time when it was, I think
[00:59:17.380 --> 00:59:20.460]   it was, was it 64 mags of RAM was.
[00:59:20.460 --> 00:59:21.460]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:21.460 --> 00:59:23.140]   I remember eight megs of RAM was a lot.
[00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:27.780]   I remember going into a egg head store, not new egg, but egg head.
[00:59:27.780 --> 00:59:28.940]   Remember them?
[00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:33.140]   And listening to the shop guy said, well, the idea to set up for your Mac would be eight,
[00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:35.300]   eight megs, megs of RAM.
[00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:41.740]   You got two megs for the operating system, two megs for the app, a two meg RAM disk.
[00:59:41.740 --> 00:59:42.740]   And I've came over.
[00:59:42.740 --> 00:59:44.620]   Oh, two meg cache.
[00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:47.340]   Now eight megs.
[00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:52.420]   I had four megs in my little PC that I did my first print work on for Prime Sports Network,
[00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:55.700]   and I had to like save things in parts, you know, like, like, because there wasn't enough
[00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:56.700]   RAM to keep it all.
[00:59:56.700 --> 01:00:00.660]   You know, there's only so big of an image I can do for an ad because you guys had make
[01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:04.420]   make a big megabyte killer bitch.
[01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:13.580]   We had a tough and core memory, which we had to adjust manually with a tip of a pencil
[01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:16.380]   that we had to borrow from our fathers.
[01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:18.860]   And there were punch cards everywhere.
[01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:22.220]   Gary from, you know, Gary Coughler.
[01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:26.940]   I do tech in our chatroom and a good friend of the show said that Apple that Apple to
[01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:31.460]   high res screen Andy was 280 by 192.
[01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:32.780]   I think it was 240 by 192.
[01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:33.780]   240 by 192.
[01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:37.740]   Well, depending on where you are, HDR, HDR two.
[01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:38.740]   Okay.
[01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:43.500]   So 38 40 by 20, six, the text underneath or did you want to just have the full screen
[01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:44.500]   of graphic?
[01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:45.500]   Pretty funny.
[01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:47.500]   You have the people brothers texts.
[01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:48.500]   The legal brother.
[01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:49.500]   These built in.
[01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:50.500]   Yeah.
[01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:53.700]   Love those people brothers.
[01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:54.700]   I don't hate Marcus.
[01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:58.860]   I love Marcus, but I'm jealous as heck of Marcus and, and, but he's earned every bit
[01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:00.580]   of his success.
[01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:04.860]   And, you know, I just, just trying to keep up with the Joneses here.
[01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:05.860]   That's all there.
[01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:08.140]   So our show today brought to you by legal zoom.com.
[01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:09.980]   Hey, it's not a law firm.
[01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:12.140]   It's a self help place.
[01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:17.620]   It's a self help services at your specific direction doing what you need to do to start
[01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:20.500]   your business to protect your family.
[01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:27.300]   You don't need a white shoe high price, $350 an hour lawyer to create an LLC or even a
[01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:28.900]   chapter S or C corporation.
[01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:32.060]   You can do it for 99 bucks on legal zoom.com.
[01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:34.020]   That's what we did.
[01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:36.860]   We're still using those corporation papers.
[01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:40.580]   If you're going to start a business, you actually really do want to do this.
[01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:44.980]   Furthermore, if you have a trademark, you know, a brand or a logo, you got to protect
[01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:46.860]   it or somebody else will steal it.
[01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:49.060]   It's only a hundred sixty nine bucks.
[01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:53.500]   Legal zoom gets a lot of the work you need to do for starting your business done, starting
[01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:54.500]   and running.
[01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:57.180]   And if you're, of course, if you got to protect your family too, one of the great things about
[01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:59.580]   league with your last one, testament, sixty nine bucks.
[01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:06.580]   One of the great things about legal zoom now is the legal zoom legal plan.
[01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:13.900]   They have pre contracted flat rate, low flat rate fees with attorneys in every state.
[01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:14.900]   They're independent.
[01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:19.860]   They'll help you answer your questions, help you get your stuff done.
[01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:21.060]   And this is so cool.
[01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:25.860]   You can look at their profiles and audited reviews from legal zoom customers to choose
[01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:28.580]   the attorney that's right for you.
[01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:31.500]   So you don't pay an hourly fee.
[01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:35.060]   You pay a monthly flow flat monthly rate and you've got advice.
[01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:36.300]   I think this is such a great.
[01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:40.700]   I cannot tell you how valuable this is.
[01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:46.060]   They should get a medal of honor because they have made it easy for people to do the stuff
[01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:47.820]   they need to start their own business.
[01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:51.860]   And that's the best thing in the world for our economy.
[01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:53.180]   Legal zoom.com.

[01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:11.020]   Frankly, it's better.
[01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:13.020]   Legal zoom.com.
[01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:14.180]   Okay.
[01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:18.100]   Do any questions, Leo, from the.
[01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:19.940]   Are you doing that thing?
[01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:20.940]   That thing is running.
[01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:21.940]   Should we give out?
[01:03:21.940 --> 01:03:22.940]   We didn't give out the URL.
[01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:23.940]   I forgot about that.
[01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:26.660]   So what's the URL for our question engine?
[01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:28.060]   It's bit.ly.
[01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:29.060]   B.I.T.
[01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:32.020]   dot l y slash and B W four O two.
[01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:34.980]   I could have figured that out last week.
[01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:36.580]   It was a week.
[01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:39.220]   Last week we didn't do it soon enough.
[01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:41.700]   So we got some good questions here.
[01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:43.780]   We've got a couple that have been popular.
[01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:44.860]   All right.
[01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:46.740]   Let's take a look here.
[01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:49.820]   You want to start with with the rumored multitasking on IO eight?
[01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:52.100]   We haven't talked about this yet.
[01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:56.460]   This comes from Jehudu Sar in Geneva, Switzerland.
[01:03:56.460 --> 01:04:01.340]   The story I heard it this morning on tech news today with Mike Elgin is that iOS eight
[01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:06.340]   will have multitasking, windowing pains.
[01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:08.420]   And I think Jehudu has a great question.
[01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:11.740]   Wouldn't this fundamentally change what the iPad is supposed to be?
[01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:12.740]   I agree with him.
[01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:13.740]   It's a bad idea.
[01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:14.740]   What do you think Renee?
[01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:18.420]   So there's a couple I saw Mark Gurman reporting about it this morning.
[01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:22.980]   So it might be making the rounds, but what's interesting with this rumor is if you look
[01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:27.420]   at mobile, very specifically, especially with Apple, they wanted to do full screen apps
[01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:29.300]   because it's easier for a mainstream purpose.
[01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:33.500]   Their goal since the creation of computing at Apple has been to make computers more accessible
[01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:38.060]   to more people, sort of empowering rather than just, you know, power user stuff.
[01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:40.820]   And the full screen app did that because you're in an app, you press the home button
[01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:43.820]   as your escape nozzle, you're back on the home screen, you're in another app.
[01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:44.820]   It's very simple.
[01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:48.980]   The problem with a lot of early mobile implementations of multi window, whether it was the cards
[01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:54.340]   and stacks in WebOS or the snap stuff in Windows or the stuff that Samsung was doing,
[01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:55.820]   is that it really had minimal benefit.
[01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:58.540]   You could look at two things, but there was no interaction.
[01:04:58.540 --> 01:05:03.140]   And anyone who's ever used OS 10 knows that one of the benefits of multi tasking is dragging
[01:05:03.140 --> 01:05:07.540]   and dropping between applications or in other ways of making sure that both those applications
[01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:11.300]   are doing something greater than the sum of their parts.
[01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:14.420]   And what's interesting to me about this rumor is that that's part of this rumor that Apple
[01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:17.140]   is enabling drag and drop between applications.
[01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:20.900]   So rather than just having something that could be in one app like a text editor and
[01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:25.460]   a browser, you'll be able to put apps there and drag information between the two.
[01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:30.580]   So like multi tasking, like notification center, like control center, for 80% of the population,
[01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:31.660]   it will be invisible.
[01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:32.660]   You'll never see it.
[01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:33.900]   You won't have to worry about it.
[01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:36.580]   You can use your iPad just like you always did.
[01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:42.060]   But for those tech, for people who wanted to be able to use the iPad to do more multitasking,
[01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:46.500]   more computer like work, they'll be able to open up this functionality and enjoy it.
[01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:49.700]   And it's also interesting to me that, you know, Craig Federicki is very different than
[01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:52.180]   Steve Jobs, very different than Scott Forestall.
[01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:57.380]   He tends more towards the geek and more towards the power user feature, like battery shaming
[01:05:57.380 --> 01:06:03.100]   and OS 10 would never have made it onto the Mac in previous years.
[01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:05.220]   That was a departure in Apple's policy.
[01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:09.460]   And I think that if this is rumor is true, and if those implementation details are true,
[01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:14.220]   then it's kind of showing us how you can, how Apple is increasingly servicing the needs
[01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:16.180]   of power users as well as mainstream users.
[01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:17.180]   Would it be a bigger screen?
[01:06:17.180 --> 01:06:18.780]   I mean, would it be just an air?
[01:06:18.780 --> 01:06:19.780]   Same.
[01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:20.780]   Yeah.
[01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:21.780]   Same thing.
[01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:27.620]   It'd be a long delayed, long needed move because Apple has always, Apple has always had a,
[01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:31.900]   remember, never forget that the iPad Air is a $500 computer.
[01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:33.060]   There are some configurations.
[01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:38.740]   There's almost a $900 computer that has a desktop class microprocessor in it that is
[01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:44.140]   capable of doing 80 to 90% of the work that most people want a notebook to do, which is
[01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:48.660]   why it's been a little bit bit fun to me that some of the simple things they could add to
[01:06:48.660 --> 01:06:53.220]   this to make it easier to use as a laptop replacement just aren't there.
[01:06:53.220 --> 01:07:00.060]   I've used the snaps, the snap screens features in Windows, which actually works extremely
[01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:03.860]   well because it's not as though you need to have two windows open simultaneously and
[01:07:03.860 --> 01:07:06.540]   your full attention is on both of them equally.
[01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:10.300]   It really is just as simple as I'm watching a movie, but I also want to keep an eye on
[01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:16.380]   Twitter or I am writing and editing a document, but I also want to be able to occasionally
[01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:22.060]   look up facts in a little sidebar window browser and the ability to simply split the
[01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:27.180]   screen in any trivial way would be a huge enhancement as would the ability to have keyboard
[01:07:27.180 --> 01:07:31.020]   for shortcuts as would the ability to switch between apps really quickly from a Bluetooth
[01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:32.020]   keyboard.
[01:07:32.020 --> 01:07:33.860]   That's something I really, really want.
[01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:38.940]   At the same time, I have to acknowledge that what I'm asking for is a MacBook Air.
[01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:46.340]   It's possible that as I look at rumors like this, I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:52.540]   Apple's answer to that is, "Look, we've for $899, you can have a real Macintosh that
[01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:58.280]   is only marginally larger than your current iPad that can do so much more of what you apparently
[01:07:58.280 --> 01:07:59.280]   want this thing to do."
[01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:00.280]   It doesn't have to touch.
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:06.100]   I think a lot of us, I think a lot of us, and my issue is I carry around a couple laptops
[01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:07.580]   and a couple tablets.
[01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:11.220]   The thing is that I want that tablet to be my computer.
[01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:15.980]   My little computer that I work in just doesn't have quite enough to do that.
[01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:19.420]   This being able to split the screens and being able to have a keyboard, all the stuff that
[01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:24.460]   Andy was talking about, really, I think it does open up a whole other subset of people
[01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:26.140]   that want to move away from a laptop.
[01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:30.420]   I can't quite get there for, and I don't know if I'd do it all day every day, but it would
[01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:33.660]   definitely be half my day or 75% of my day.
[01:08:33.660 --> 01:08:37.420]   I could use that, but right now it just doesn't have enough for me to get my work done.
[01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:41.100]   I also think as we look at the merger, I still think we're slowly moving.
[01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:46.700]   I don't think that they're necessarily depreciating OS X, but I think that we're seeing OS X have
[01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:52.580]   some things like the battery and other bits and pieces of it that come from the iOS world.
[01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:58.340]   I think the iOS world moving towards OS X also makes a lot of sense from a, we're slowly
[01:08:58.340 --> 01:09:01.220]   merging this idea of a computer into something completely different.
[01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:08.380]   There's a character on the HBO show Veep, which is Julia Louis Dreyfus' 30-minute comedy
[01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:09.380]   show.
[01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:11.380]   Why are you showing it out?
[01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:12.380]   Thank you.
[01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:14.140]   Because my lighting is so good, Leo.
[01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:15.380]   No, we want to say more, Andy.
[01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:18.500]   I'm not saying that, but I am talking about some texture with it.
[01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:19.780]   I'm very pleased with the lighting today.
[01:09:19.780 --> 01:09:20.780]   I don't know why.
[01:09:20.780 --> 01:09:23.460]   I just feel bad because you have to sit there, Andy, and pretend you're interested in what
[01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:25.980]   I'm saying when this camera's on you.
[01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:28.340]   And so I'm actually interested.
[01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:31.580]   There's a character on the show, which is a great show, by the way.
[01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:36.940]   Her campaign manager, Dan, who carries two iPads in his hand because one is not enough,
[01:09:36.940 --> 01:09:39.940]   and one of the characters says, "Hey, watch out.
[01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:40.940]   Soon you're going to need three."
[01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:44.660]   I think it was all stimulated by this ad from Samsung.
[01:09:44.660 --> 01:09:46.620]   You remember this one?
[01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:52.300]   It's an extremely simple tool, but also extremely pointy.
[01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:57.820]   It's been used to make tentative appointments and to cheated golf.
[01:09:57.820 --> 01:10:00.820]   Students have used it to play ceiling darts.
[01:10:00.820 --> 01:10:04.020]   It's, wait a second, what's hiding behind this pencil?
[01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:09.020]   An iPad Air.
[01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:14.020]   What's this?
[01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:19.020]   The even thinner Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1.
[01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:20.020]   Interesting.
[01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:27.020]   Not only are you thinner, your HD screen is killer for more robo beat down action.
[01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:28.020]   And would you look at that?
[01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:29.020]   There you go.
[01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:31.020]   The Galaxy Tab even does multitasking.
[01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:37.060]   Again, the ability to simply have one little utility app hiding intruding on the side of
[01:10:37.060 --> 01:10:38.060]   the screen.
[01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:42.820]   Because, again, as someone who uses the iPad heavily, that's the one big frustrating thing.
[01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:49.140]   And during my two or three weeks of full immersion of using the Microsoft Surface, that's the
[01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:53.780]   one thing I absolutely missed when I went back to my iPad a few weeks later.
[01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:55.980]   It just seems silly not to be.
[01:10:55.980 --> 01:11:02.980]   Given that so many of the major iOS apps are already articulated, both as a phone screen
[01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:08.260]   and as an iPad screen, the ability to simply say, "Look, if I want to minimize this app
[01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:12.420]   but also have it on the screen, can you just give me the iPhone view of this?"
[01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:14.300]   And just let me tuck that on the side of the screen.
[01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:16.100]   Is that something you could make happen for me?
[01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:17.980]   Well, I feel you do it at your own peril, though.
[01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:18.980]   It just makes it so much.
[01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:23.860]   I mean, one of the advantages of the iPad is its simplicity and the idea that you do one
[01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:25.660]   thing in your full screen.
[01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:30.620]   The other thing is that the average user need to see that as well.
[01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:34.380]   So the other thing is that you could have it so that if you didn't know it existed,
[01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:36.740]   it would just be the same modal system.
[01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:37.740]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:37.740 --> 01:11:41.780]   But can I tell you this from my use of the Galaxy Note, it pops up by accident when you
[01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:42.780]   least expect it.
[01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:43.780]   But that Samsung interface.
[01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:44.780]   Okay.
[01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:45.780]   All right.
[01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:46.780]   But it's annoying.
[01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:47.780]   I mean, it's not completely invisible.
[01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:48.780]   It's there.
[01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:52.860]   Maybe Apple has a switch that says, "Never show that ever."
[01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:53.860]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:57.820]   I see it coming out, a way to test this as a default off.
[01:11:57.820 --> 01:11:59.900]   You have to go into settings and turn it on.
[01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:02.540]   And if you really want to go down that rabbit hole, you can.
[01:12:02.540 --> 01:12:05.900]   But you know when you do that, 90% of users will never know it's there.
[01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:06.900]   That's fine.
[01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:10.900]   The testing gestures was tried in beta and it was left off when it was put in the shipping
[01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:11.900]   product.
[01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:14.900]   You had to go turn that on so you wouldn't accidentally pinch and lose your screen.
[01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:15.900]   Right.
[01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:16.980]   That's the beauty of this kind of a feature.
[01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:20.340]   For the first two or three months or two or three weeks when people are brand new with
[01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:24.820]   the device and very easily confused, they will not discover this because it's a setting
[01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:26.180]   that's been turned off.
[01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:29.940]   But as they get more adept with this after three months, four months, five months, and
[01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:34.100]   now they're starting to attack, what are the pain points of this experience and what
[01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:35.100]   can I change?
[01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:37.660]   That's when they start saying, "Well, maybe there is something in settings that can find
[01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:38.660]   there."
[01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:39.660]   And whoops, there it is.
[01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:43.260]   And they tap that slider and now they have the ability to use this gesture.
[01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:47.500]   And I often thought that that would be a really good model for a lot of software.
[01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:50.140]   Some of the mistakes that we made with some of the software that we wrote, the conduit
[01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:53.820]   being one of them and even some of the other ones was that it's very complex when you
[01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:56.140]   start it, when you open it, it's very hard to understand.
[01:12:56.140 --> 01:12:58.100]   And there's too many options.
[01:12:58.100 --> 01:13:01.780]   And I think that a lot of applications would benefit even Photoshop and so on and so forth
[01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:04.420]   from having three versions of it.
[01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:07.500]   Here's this beginner one that just lets you play with stuff and really quickly understand
[01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:08.500]   it.
[01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:11.180]   Now we're going to introduce you to layers and now you'll be introduced to channels.
[01:13:11.180 --> 01:13:13.620]   Let's move quickly through the next few questions.
[01:13:13.620 --> 01:13:18.380]   We're going to wrap it up in a bit, but here's from Brent York, question two on the question
[01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:20.180]   engine, Greensboro, North Carolina.
[01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:23.700]   What would Apple have to do besides a bigger screen size to get Leo and Andy to switch
[01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:25.180]   back to an iPhone full-time?
[01:13:25.180 --> 01:13:27.380]   You first, Andy.
[01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:29.740]   Mostly it's a change in a lot of basic philosophies.
[01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:33.580]   I want applications to be able to interact with each other far, far more intimately than
[01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:35.100]   they can on iOS right now.
[01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:39.300]   The ability to, if there's a piece of information inside one app on my Android device and I
[01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:43.300]   want to do something with it, chances are I can make two taps and have it available
[01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:45.620]   to whatever other service I want.
[01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:50.220]   And also the ability to, actually, just what we've been talking about just a few minutes
[01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:54.820]   ago, the ability to say that I know that this feature could possibly lead to a rough
[01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:56.260]   experience for me.
[01:13:56.260 --> 01:14:00.700]   However, at this point, I really, really want this to behave the way that I wanted to behave
[01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:02.460]   and I'm willing to take that risk.
[01:14:02.460 --> 01:14:07.020]   So the ability to have, for instance, an app draw on top of another app so that you have
[01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:11.940]   a text messaging app that you don't necessarily have to switch between the mail app you're
[01:14:11.940 --> 01:14:16.540]   using right now just to keep up with the text messaging thing, the ability to have different
[01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:17.820]   launchers installed.
[01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:21.780]   These are all things that if you don't allow the user to do that, you'll have a much cleaner
[01:14:21.780 --> 01:14:24.060]   and much more stable experience for that user.
[01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:28.220]   But again, three, four, five months later, when that user is very, very adept at this
[01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:32.020]   device, it's okay for them to decide what if I were to be able to simply go to the app
[01:14:32.020 --> 01:14:36.780]   store or buy an alternative launcher that works more the way that I would like it to
[01:14:36.780 --> 01:14:39.700]   and then simply tap to install and it installs and it works.
[01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:44.740]   So it's not so much a larger screen or even the rumored features of iOS 8 to let you
[01:14:44.740 --> 01:14:46.700]   cut and paste between apps like that.
[01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:51.300]   It really is the fundamental philosophy that says that we trust you to get into trouble
[01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:54.180]   and get yourself out of that trouble if you so desire.
[01:14:54.180 --> 01:14:55.660]   Yeah, I'd agree with you.
[01:14:55.660 --> 01:15:01.700]   I think that the great of icons of springboard, it seems, feels fairly limited.
[01:15:01.700 --> 01:15:05.420]   If they fix that, you're giving me an option there and frankly, you got to give me an option
[01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:06.420]   on the keyboard.
[01:15:06.420 --> 01:15:07.420]   I love the iPhone.
[01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:08.420]   There's nothing wrong with the iPhone.
[01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:15.020]   Absolutely superb, but I just need the grid of icons is too limiting for me.
[01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:19.700]   I want something a little more flexible and I just can't use the Apple keyboard.
[01:15:19.700 --> 01:15:20.700]   I'm sorry.
[01:15:20.700 --> 01:15:24.780]   Just every time I use it, I just want to punch myself in the face.
[01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:29.380]   Or I feel like I have one more or a couple more here, real quickly, Mark Shepard, Wichita,
[01:15:29.380 --> 01:15:30.380]   Kansas.
[01:15:30.380 --> 01:15:34.020]   Well, I guess we kind of did that discussion about the newly rumored iOS 8 features.
[01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:38.740]   We really, again, and I really want to emphasize rumor, multitasking, pains.
[01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:40.260]   We've already talked about health book.
[01:15:40.260 --> 01:15:42.540]   Is there anything else Rene Richie that is in the?
[01:15:42.540 --> 01:15:45.020]   Yeah, there's a ton of stuff.
[01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:48.500]   But the one thing that's important to remember is that the development of iOS is a continuum.
[01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:50.380]   So they'll be working on a bunch of features.
[01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:54.220]   They'll have to cut it at a certain point and given the focus on 10.10, a lot of stuff
[01:15:54.220 --> 01:15:58.300]   that's rumored now might end up in, you know, 8 point, so iOS 8.1.
[01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:02.340]   So just remember that you won't be as disappointed come up easy.
[01:16:02.340 --> 01:16:03.340]   Thanks, Mark.
[01:16:03.340 --> 01:16:06.180]   You probably will learn about this in June.
[01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:10.860]   Do you think this comes from Steven Dainty, Stoke on Trent UK?
[01:16:10.860 --> 01:16:15.180]   Do you think Angela Arendt's, the new head of retail at Apple, will be looking into improving
[01:16:15.180 --> 01:16:18.060]   the iTunes and App Store experiences?
[01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:20.620]   Are those even in her daily wick?
[01:16:20.620 --> 01:16:21.620]   I think so.
[01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:22.620]   She's retail.
[01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:24.460]   Yeah, retail not.
[01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:29.460]   Retail online Apple store, which is almost like its own division.
[01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:30.460]   Right.
[01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:33.500]   Nico Mabasso, Guatang, South Africa.
[01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:36.500]   We're getting great questions from really?
[01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:37.500]   Yep.
[01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:38.500]   Wait a minute.
[01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:39.500]   Yep.
[01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:40.500]   Your South Africa.
[01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:43.860]   Yeah, Johannesburg used to be the trans-vall and now it's called Tang.
[01:16:43.860 --> 01:16:44.860]   What the heck?
[01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:45.860]   I didn't even know that about you.
[01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:47.940]   Well, Nico, your buddy Renee says hi.
[01:16:47.940 --> 01:16:53.260]   Does the iOSification of OS 10 decrease the need to have a more powerful Mac?
[01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:55.900]   Leo says, I hope not.
[01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:56.900]   I would say so.
[01:16:56.900 --> 01:17:00.420]   I think Apple's going to be doing smart things and making
[01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:06.460]   the Mac Pro into an outlier device and making more mobile devices and more friendly devices.
[01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:09.300]   I think it might well be in the works, right?
[01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:11.540]   I think they've moved.
[01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:16.060]   They long ago moved beyond the idea that we have to have really good specs on our processors.
[01:17:16.060 --> 01:17:19.880]   It's all about what performance do people act or without people actually going to experience
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:20.980]   with these things.
[01:17:20.980 --> 01:17:25.580]   So I think that the trend is to make smaller, simpler, more profitable and more accessible
[01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:28.540]   devices rather than now we're going to the next version.
[01:17:28.540 --> 01:17:32.060]   We're not working on a Mac Pro that has two towers on it with a bridge connecting the
[01:17:32.060 --> 01:17:33.060]   two.
[01:17:33.060 --> 01:17:34.660]   I don't think that's where they're going.
[01:17:34.660 --> 01:17:38.900]   Yeah, there's an ARM Mac and they bring it out every time Intel starts to falter on their
[01:17:38.900 --> 01:17:39.900]   dates again.
[01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:42.300]   It's a sort of down on these Apple labs.
[01:17:42.300 --> 01:17:48.060]   And I think for the average user, the air is a powerful enough to do most what you did
[01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:51.900]   in an iPad is powerful enough to do what 90% of the users out there are doing.
[01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:55.900]   So I think that it's, I definitely think that we're going that direction either way.
[01:17:55.900 --> 01:17:57.900]   I mean, we're not really going that direction.
[01:17:57.900 --> 01:17:58.900]   We're just not moving.
[01:17:58.900 --> 01:18:01.780]   We're not moving forward faster.
[01:18:01.780 --> 01:18:04.380]   Question from John Eazy, Mountain View, California.
[01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:08.260]   Will they reboot the cinema display?
[01:18:08.260 --> 01:18:11.980]   And you know, I have to say that now that I'm buying a 4K display for my Mac Pro, I have
[01:18:11.980 --> 01:18:14.780]   to wonder where is a Mac 4K cinema.
[01:18:14.780 --> 01:18:16.220]   They were waiting for you to buy Leo.
[01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:18.500]   Yeah, maybe that's what always happens.
[01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:19.980]   WWDC, WWDC.
[01:18:19.980 --> 01:18:24.220]   Cinema display, mark my word, cinema display with Apple TV built in.
[01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:27.380]   You've been working on it for a while.
[01:18:27.380 --> 01:18:31.340]   And I think like when you see something like 10.9.3 and you see the other stuff, it's just
[01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:34.380]   a question of getting to the point where it makes sense for Apple to release it.
[01:18:34.380 --> 01:18:35.380]   Very cool.
[01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:37.340]   I like, I like that idea.
[01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:38.340]   We're having fun.
[01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:39.340]   This question engine's great.
[01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:41.660]   I'll do a couple more and then we'll move on.
[01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:43.540]   No, that's a bad one.
[01:18:43.540 --> 01:18:45.100]   Okay.
[01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:46.100]   Never mind.
[01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:47.100]   Forget it.
[01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:48.100]   Those were both bad.
[01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:49.100]   Thank you question engine.
[01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:54.180]   Thank you to Alex Lindsey for his generous donation.
[01:18:54.180 --> 01:18:56.180]   Of the question engine software.
[01:18:56.180 --> 01:18:59.580]   Here's a picture of a car in an Apple store.
[01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:01.580]   Apparently, it was part of a robbery attempt.
[01:19:01.580 --> 01:19:07.140]   The car smashed through the glass doors and the security gate at the 4th Street Apple
[01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:10.420]   store in Berkeley, California on Friday morning.
[01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:13.140]   And apparently some other stuff was stolen.
[01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:15.340]   I think cars have been used a couple of times.
[01:19:15.340 --> 01:19:16.340]   Yes.
[01:19:16.340 --> 01:19:19.700]   Because of all the glass, it seems like anything at all by the road or a lot of them are by
[01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:20.700]   the road.
[01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:21.700]   It seems like a good way to do it.
[01:19:21.700 --> 01:19:23.860]   Or somebody was in a big hurry to get the new iPad.
[01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:24.860]   I don't know.
[01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:25.860]   Wouldn't that be interesting?
[01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:26.860]   I'm not sure.
[01:19:26.860 --> 01:19:32.420]   Wouldn't be interesting if the next iteration of Apple stores have some sort of mechanical
[01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:36.740]   barrier that they can erect after store closing to prevent the stuff from happening.
[01:19:36.740 --> 01:19:37.740]   Well, they do.
[01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:38.740]   That's what that is.
[01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:39.740]   And the car went right through it.
[01:19:39.740 --> 01:19:41.380]   There was a safety gate over the glass.
[01:19:41.380 --> 01:19:42.380]   Oh, not a gate.
[01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:48.620]   I'm thinking about how like concrete like now that they're like pylons that can come up
[01:19:48.620 --> 01:19:52.780]   to block off a street after hours to make sure that a car cannot barrel down there and
[01:19:52.780 --> 01:19:54.020]   do whatever they want to do.
[01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:55.340]   Like what embassies have?
[01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:56.340]   Yeah.
[01:19:56.340 --> 01:19:57.340]   Yeah.
[01:19:57.340 --> 01:20:04.940]   No, no, senior Lumia engineer and Nokia's camera expert Ari Parton and just left Microsoft.
[01:20:04.940 --> 01:20:06.020]   He's gone to work for Apple.
[01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:08.660]   Actually, it happened right after the show last week.
[01:20:08.660 --> 01:20:11.300]   He's the pure view camera expert.
[01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:13.660]   Yeah, the resampling stuff.
[01:20:13.660 --> 01:20:16.900]   That's a mate because I'm doing a right now.
[01:20:16.900 --> 01:20:18.060]   That's a huge one.
[01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:23.260]   I'm really to add to the answer from the last one of the previous questions.
[01:20:23.260 --> 01:20:27.700]   One of the things that could really turn me back to the iPhone beyond all the other problems
[01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:29.020]   I have with it is Apple.
[01:20:29.020 --> 01:20:33.260]   If Apple does a camera that is so far beyond anything else that's been done, that would
[01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:35.740]   be a real big temptation for me.
[01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:39.660]   And what Nokia has done with this pure review technology is just amazing.
[01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:43.340]   Even beyond 40 megapixel images, which is really just almost like the negative that
[01:20:43.340 --> 01:20:45.020]   they use to make a better image from.
[01:20:45.020 --> 01:20:47.980]   I'm in the middle of posting a series of I think eight different.
[01:20:47.980 --> 01:20:52.100]   It's a test photos that I shot with eight different imaging devices.
[01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:54.940]   One of them is the Lumia 1020.
[01:20:54.940 --> 01:21:01.500]   Not set to 40 megapixels, but the down sampled 5 megapixel version that spits out.
[01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:06.660]   And it is kicking butt in a blind taste test of people who just see greater detail, greater
[01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:08.660]   sharpness, less noise.
[01:21:08.660 --> 01:21:09.980]   It's making some beautiful pictures.
[01:21:09.980 --> 01:21:14.540]   And if Apple can get access to that mojo or at least that line of thinking that a Nokia
[01:21:14.540 --> 01:21:17.100]   executive has about how to do digital imaging.
[01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:21.100]   Man, you start off with the greatest one of the two greatest cameras in the world and
[01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:25.980]   it could absolutely take it to the next orbit.
[01:21:25.980 --> 01:21:26.980]   We take a break.
[01:21:26.980 --> 01:21:28.580]   We'll come back with your picks of the week.
[01:21:28.580 --> 01:21:29.980]   Gentlemen, start your engines.
[01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:37.380]   But first a word from our friends at squarespace.com, the web hosting site that we love so very
[01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:38.380]   much.
[01:21:38.380 --> 01:21:42.620]   The best hosting plus the best software combines to give you the best website anywhere.
[01:21:42.620 --> 01:21:46.940]   If you haven't tried Squarespace yet, you got to visit squarespace.com and click that

[01:21:54.980 --> 01:21:59.580]   on the iPad and the iPhone like the metric app, which lets you check site stats like page
[01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:05.060]   views, unique visitors, social media followers, the blog app, which makes it easy to post,
[01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:09.460]   but also monitor comments, change layouts even.
[01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:11.380]   It's also elegant, so beautifully done.
[01:22:11.380 --> 01:22:12.580]   The sites never go down.
[01:22:12.580 --> 01:22:14.380]   We use it for our inside to it blog.
[01:22:14.380 --> 01:22:20.620]   I'll tell you what, Lisa and I were talking yesterday having so much trouble with our main
[01:22:20.620 --> 01:22:21.620]   website.
[01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:24.060]   We're thinking, gosh, let's just move the whole thing of Squarespace.
[01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:26.780]   So easy to use, but also great support.
[01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:31.580]   They've got workshops, webinars online that are free, but live chat and email support 24/7,
[01:22:31.580 --> 01:22:38.020]   not from India, not from Canada, from New York City.
[01:22:38.020 --> 01:22:39.020]   Actually can it be okay?
[01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:40.020]   Because there's planes, Canadians.
[01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:43.220]   Hey, what do you want?
[01:22:43.220 --> 01:22:48.060]   No, from the offices of Squarespace in New York City, the customer help site has great
[01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:52.580]   self help articles and video workshops, and it all starts at just $8 a month and a free

[01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:12.900]   You decided to sign up.

[01:23:14.060 --> 01:23:15.060]   Use the offer code MACBRAKE.

[01:23:16.460 --> 01:23:17.460]   Yeah.
[01:23:17.460 --> 01:23:20.820]   And you'll let them know you heard about it on MacBrake Weekly.
[01:23:20.820 --> 01:23:25.660]   squarespace.com, free to try, but use the offer code MACBRAKE when you buy.
[01:23:25.660 --> 01:23:28.100]   Squarespace.com.
[01:23:28.100 --> 01:23:29.900]   Mr. Alex Lindsey.
[01:23:29.900 --> 01:23:35.580]   Oh, the, you, Efand Dunn says the Pied Piper site is a Squarespace site.
[01:23:35.580 --> 01:23:36.580]   Let's see.
[01:23:36.580 --> 01:23:37.580]   Wouldn't that be interesting?
[01:23:37.580 --> 01:23:43.620]   You know, Pied Piper is this phony company that was created for the show Silicon Valley.
[01:23:43.620 --> 01:23:46.100]   It does look like a Squarespace site.
[01:23:46.100 --> 01:23:47.100]   Wouldn't that be funny?
[01:23:47.100 --> 01:23:51.180]   It does a lot like a Squarespace site.
[01:23:51.180 --> 01:23:53.020]   That would crack me up.
[01:23:53.020 --> 01:23:56.340]   Hit escape on the site.
[01:23:56.340 --> 01:23:57.900]   What do you get if I hit escape?
[01:23:57.900 --> 01:23:58.900]   Yep.
[01:23:58.900 --> 01:24:00.100]   It is a Squarespace.
[01:24:00.100 --> 01:24:03.420]   Well, that's a pretty big endorsement.
[01:24:03.420 --> 01:24:09.260]   Yes, the guys at Silicon Valley use Squarespace for their startup.
[01:24:09.260 --> 01:24:11.140]   Chatterick.
[01:24:11.140 --> 01:24:12.540]   You nailed that one.
[01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:13.540]   Yeah.
[01:24:13.540 --> 01:24:14.540]   That is pretty cool.
[01:24:14.540 --> 01:24:15.540]   That's definitely not saying to.
[01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:16.540]   Yeah.
[01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:17.540]   Yeah.
[01:24:17.540 --> 01:24:18.540]   But you're the one who said hit escape.
[01:24:18.540 --> 01:24:19.540]   Of course, that's how you get along.
[01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:20.540]   Oh, baby.
[01:24:20.540 --> 01:24:24.260]   Oh, Alex Lindsey, your pick of the week, sir.
[01:24:24.260 --> 01:24:27.860]   So I just got this app that I, that I'm having a lot of fun with.
[01:24:27.860 --> 01:24:28.860]   Have you seen Moju?
[01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:29.860]   No.
[01:24:29.860 --> 01:24:34.300]   Moju is kind of like a vine, a little like vine.
[01:24:34.300 --> 01:24:37.700]   Moju, you, and it's an iPhone app.
[01:24:37.700 --> 01:24:41.300]   And what you can do with it is it's kind of like vine, except instead of hitting play
[01:24:41.300 --> 01:24:45.340]   and watching some little short, you actually roll your camera back and forth.
[01:24:45.340 --> 01:24:48.340]   You're not going to go see it on mine, but you move your camera back and forth.
[01:24:48.340 --> 01:24:50.980]   And as you move it, it goes through the series of frames.
[01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:55.540]   And so you can do little animations where when you move your camera, you kind of twist
[01:24:55.540 --> 01:24:56.540]   it back and forth.
[01:24:56.540 --> 01:24:58.100]   You can actually see things happening.
[01:24:58.100 --> 01:25:01.340]   You can, you know, if you get creative, you can see things going in and out.
[01:25:01.340 --> 01:25:02.340]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:25:02.340 --> 01:25:06.020]   You get little like rotations around an object where if you do it in the right direction,
[01:25:06.020 --> 01:25:10.180]   which is the opposite direction that I would expect, it looks exactly like you can, you
[01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:13.020]   can get kind of a panorama that's interactive.
[01:25:13.020 --> 01:25:14.260]   There's something about it that just a lot of fun.
[01:25:14.260 --> 01:25:17.940]   It's a little Instagram, little vine, little, but there's something about it that I find
[01:25:17.940 --> 01:25:21.820]   more enjoyable than vine for me anyway.
[01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:24.140]   And how do you, I don't understand how it works.
[01:25:24.140 --> 01:25:28.620]   You take a video and then the twist scrolls through the, is like a scrub through the video.
[01:25:28.620 --> 01:25:33.860]   Well, like vine, you, yeah, yeah, what, yeah, basically you're twisting the phone and scrubbing,
[01:25:33.860 --> 01:25:35.980]   scrubbing the photo.
[01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:39.740]   And you can then, in the same way, you can take a still and then move it and a still and
[01:25:39.740 --> 01:25:43.780]   then move it and a still to create kind of a stop motion type of thing, or you can hold
[01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:47.500]   it down and just move your camera slowly, you know, around an object to give it a, you
[01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:50.180]   know, a rotational aspect to it.
[01:25:50.180 --> 01:25:51.660]   It's just a fun little fun.
[01:25:51.660 --> 01:25:52.660]   That is nice.
[01:25:52.660 --> 01:25:56.180]   There's something, not only is it fun and you see a lot of the examples, I don't know
[01:25:56.180 --> 01:26:00.020]   why, but I also just really enjoy the, the, the sharing.
[01:26:00.020 --> 01:26:01.780]   I usually don't like the whole sharing process.
[01:26:01.780 --> 01:26:04.700]   I don't like, I don't like the fact that you build applications around sharing.
[01:26:04.700 --> 01:26:05.700]   It makes me crazy.
[01:26:05.700 --> 01:26:09.420]   You know, I just want to just do it and play with it and call it a day.
[01:26:09.420 --> 01:26:12.700]   But there's something about it of everyone's playing with it right now, all these little
[01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:13.700]   tests.
[01:26:13.700 --> 01:26:16.940]   There's this, like, this little voyeur, you're jumping into someone's world about what
[01:26:16.940 --> 01:26:20.860]   they thought was interesting to, to shoot and a lot of times it's their cup or whatever.
[01:26:20.860 --> 01:26:24.660]   But it's a, from a social perspective, I also find it very interesting.
[01:26:24.660 --> 01:26:26.620]   So, you know, it's free.
[01:26:26.620 --> 01:26:30.420]   So it's really easy to go download and test if you're, if you're interested, but Moju
[01:26:30.420 --> 01:26:32.420]   M O J U.
[01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:38.900]   I'm now see, to answer your question, that's what it would take to get me back to an iPhone.
[01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:39.900]   That's really cool.
[01:26:39.900 --> 01:26:43.580]   But there's no, and there is no, I'm almost positive that's, you couldn't do that on the
[01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:45.100]   internet because that's using the apples.
[01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:46.100]   Well, I don't know.
[01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:47.100]   Maybe you could do it on the internet.
[01:26:47.100 --> 01:26:48.100]   I don't know.
[01:26:48.100 --> 01:26:49.660]   I don't know if it's available on the internet, but it's not.
[01:26:49.660 --> 01:26:54.420]   But I, but I'm wondering if they, yeah, that might be something that needs the apple hardware
[01:26:54.420 --> 01:26:55.420]   to do.
[01:26:55.420 --> 01:26:56.420]   Core motion.
[01:26:56.420 --> 01:26:57.420]   Yeah.
[01:26:57.420 --> 01:26:58.420]   Good pick.
[01:26:58.420 --> 01:26:59.420]   Thank you, Alex.
[01:26:59.420 --> 01:27:00.980]   Mr. Renee Richie, your pick of the week.
[01:27:00.980 --> 01:27:01.980]   I have two.
[01:27:01.980 --> 01:27:05.780]   The first one is in honor of Alex and I'll gladly defer to him if he knows much more about
[01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:08.660]   than I do, but it's teleprompt plus three.
[01:27:08.660 --> 01:27:12.340]   It's the new version of teleprompt plus, sorry, teleprompt plus.
[01:27:12.340 --> 01:27:16.620]   It's a whole new app because Apple doesn't allow paid upgrades and it's a very big upgrade.
[01:27:16.620 --> 01:27:21.900]   I use it when we do prerecorded video or segments where I need a large amount of text in front
[01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:25.900]   of me and after remember the details and I can't hold it all in my brain, but it's just
[01:27:25.900 --> 01:27:31.540]   the best teleprompter app I have found for the iPad to date and it's a good update.
[01:27:31.540 --> 01:27:33.060]   And that's, that's for the iPad.
[01:27:33.060 --> 01:27:34.060]   Yes.
[01:27:34.060 --> 01:27:35.060]   That's not what we use.
[01:27:35.060 --> 01:27:36.060]   Yeah, iPhones well now.
[01:27:36.060 --> 01:27:38.060]   We use something else because we use it on the desktop, I guess.
[01:27:38.060 --> 01:27:39.060]   Yeah.
[01:27:39.060 --> 01:27:41.100]   On a desktop, I think we use prompter pro, which is a.
[01:27:41.100 --> 01:27:42.540]   That's kind of everybody uses that.
[01:27:42.540 --> 01:27:43.540]   Yeah.
[01:27:43.540 --> 01:27:47.580]   That's and but that's on the app store as well, but it's a lot more expensive to it.
[01:27:47.580 --> 01:27:48.580]   Right.
[01:27:48.580 --> 01:27:49.580]   A hundred bucks or something like that.
[01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:50.580]   Well, it's a process.
[01:27:50.580 --> 01:27:53.860]   But the prompter plus I think is probably the best one on the iPad so far that I've seen.
[01:27:53.860 --> 01:27:54.860]   Cool.
[01:27:54.860 --> 01:27:58.580]   And the second one is the Sonos controller.
[01:27:58.580 --> 01:28:02.540]   It was not updated for a very long time, a very, very long time has been.
[01:28:02.540 --> 01:28:03.540]   Has been.
[01:28:03.540 --> 01:28:04.540]   Yeah.
[01:28:04.540 --> 01:28:08.060]   Yeah, the updated for iOS seven functionality early on, but it's finally been updated for
[01:28:08.060 --> 01:28:09.300]   iOS seven design.
[01:28:09.300 --> 01:28:10.300]   Beautiful.
[01:28:10.300 --> 01:28:13.540]   They still stubbornly will not add airplay functionality.
[01:28:13.540 --> 01:28:16.700]   So I want to just keep complaining about that for as long as I possibly can.
[01:28:16.700 --> 01:28:18.140]   But the app redesign is here.
[01:28:18.140 --> 01:28:19.980]   It's beautiful for anyone who is.
[01:28:19.980 --> 01:28:22.340]   Why they don't do airplay because they're selling a hardware.
[01:28:22.340 --> 01:28:23.340]   Yeah.
[01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:24.340]   That's their business.
[01:28:24.340 --> 01:28:25.820]   It's easy to airplay to their hardware.
[01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:28.740]   I mean, I would just love to be able to sit there and watch something on my iPad and have
[01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:30.820]   it come out because I have a Sonos home theater system.
[01:28:30.820 --> 01:28:32.540]   So I have the play bar.
[01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:37.780]   I have two play threes and the play sub and it sounds terrific for a for a wireless speaker
[01:28:37.780 --> 01:28:38.780]   system.
[01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:39.780]   But I can't airplay to it.
[01:28:39.780 --> 01:28:43.580]   Another thing they've done if you have a surround like that is now if you listen to music, you
[01:28:43.580 --> 01:28:45.460]   can use the surrounds as full stereo.
[01:28:45.460 --> 01:28:46.460]   Yes.
[01:28:46.460 --> 01:28:48.460]   That's really nice too because they were flying there.
[01:28:48.460 --> 01:28:49.460]   Great.
[01:28:49.460 --> 01:28:50.700]   It's so much prettier.
[01:28:50.700 --> 01:28:51.700]   Yeah.
[01:28:51.700 --> 01:28:52.700]   It's modern.
[01:28:52.700 --> 01:28:56.580]   Yeah, I mean, I saw the press releases morning immediately downloaded it updated all my Sonos
[01:28:56.580 --> 01:28:57.580]   devices.
[01:28:57.580 --> 01:29:00.180]   I have like nine speaker systems.
[01:29:00.180 --> 01:29:02.940]   Now our eyes are as happy as our ears.
[01:29:02.940 --> 01:29:04.500]   Yay.
[01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:05.500]   That was going to be my pick.
[01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:06.740]   But you did a good.
[01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:07.740]   Oh, sorry, Leo.
[01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:09.740]   It's a good one.
[01:29:09.740 --> 01:29:13.420]   And the in our co let's wrap it up with your pick of the week.
[01:29:13.420 --> 01:29:19.420]   Really cool, really fresh release fresh to me game called black B L K and I afraid
[01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:22.340]   I can't my mirroring does not work from this device to the screen.
[01:29:22.340 --> 01:29:24.380]   So I'm going to have to show it to show it to you like this.
[01:29:24.380 --> 01:29:28.260]   Here's what happens when you like stroke the screen, you're basically creating like
[01:29:28.260 --> 01:29:32.700]   a blob of ink that will then repeat whatever line you just did.
[01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:36.540]   And your goal is to get it to hit every one of these little dots.
[01:29:36.540 --> 01:29:38.540]   Oh, another one of them.
[01:29:38.540 --> 01:29:39.540]   Oh, yeah.
[01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:43.940]   So if you were just like stroke that way, it'll get through tube that didn't get those
[01:29:43.940 --> 01:29:50.340]   to figure out, I guess that if I go to like a multi hop thing, oh, that's cool.
[01:29:50.340 --> 01:29:51.940]   Maybe we'll start bouncing.
[01:29:51.940 --> 01:29:58.900]   And then on on higher levels, they introduce things like these black dots where if you
[01:29:58.900 --> 01:30:02.780]   fire if your line hits one of these black dots, it simply disappears.
[01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:08.220]   So now I have to figure out how to make your little animated line bounce around and hit
[01:30:08.220 --> 01:30:12.060]   the dots while still avoiding that black dot.
[01:30:12.060 --> 01:30:16.420]   It really is something you have to play with in order to appreciate exactly how it works.
[01:30:16.420 --> 01:30:20.220]   But the game mechanics here is so are so cool.
[01:30:20.220 --> 01:30:21.660]   And it's almost meditate.
[01:30:21.660 --> 01:30:22.660]   There you go.
[01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:28.980]   Yeah, by all meditative and on layer on later levels, you find yourself trying to figure
[01:30:28.980 --> 01:30:32.060]   out, okay, was this are they joking here?
[01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:37.900]   Is there any way whatsoever to actually clear this level?
[01:30:37.900 --> 01:30:42.580]   Is there there'll be more black dots and they'll be a little bit more complicated.
[01:30:42.580 --> 01:30:45.460]   And sometimes it's actually a lot simpler than you think it is.
[01:30:45.460 --> 01:30:51.300]   I just bought it like this morning and I've been like playing it like I want it.
[01:30:51.300 --> 01:30:53.460]   B L E K. It's a two 90.
[01:30:53.460 --> 01:30:54.460]   I think it's two 90.
[01:30:54.460 --> 01:30:55.460]   I'm sorry.
[01:30:55.460 --> 01:30:57.620]   It's 99 cents on sale from its normal price.
[01:30:57.620 --> 01:30:59.900]   I think for the next couple days, whatever.
[01:30:59.900 --> 01:31:01.460]   Oh, I'm buying it right now.
[01:31:01.460 --> 01:31:03.180]   Yeah, again, I love these.
[01:31:03.180 --> 01:31:04.820]   This is exactly the sort of game that's up my alley.
[01:31:04.820 --> 01:31:09.460]   I don't like I don't like these like games that take months and hours and hours and hours
[01:31:09.460 --> 01:31:14.220]   to get through a long story or getting you to master different weapons techniques.
[01:31:14.220 --> 01:31:19.380]   I really like these these ones you can dip into spend a minute playing it spend 20 minutes
[01:31:19.380 --> 01:31:21.660]   playing it or intend to spend a minute playing.
[01:31:21.660 --> 01:31:25.420]   But then it's 45 minutes later and now you're late for your dinner date.
[01:31:25.420 --> 01:31:27.580]   Like I love it.
[01:31:27.580 --> 01:31:32.020]   What the L E K and I'm downloading it right now.
[01:31:32.020 --> 01:31:34.380]   Hey folks, that wraps it up for a Mac break weekly.
[01:31:34.380 --> 01:31:35.380]   You know what?
[01:31:35.380 --> 01:31:38.620]   For a day where there was very little Mac news, we had a lot to talk about.
[01:31:38.620 --> 01:31:40.540]   Should never worry about that.
[01:31:40.540 --> 01:31:42.300]   Thank you, Andy and I go Chicago Sun times.
[01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:43.460]   Always a pleasure.
[01:31:43.460 --> 01:31:45.620]   Always a slightly.
[01:31:45.620 --> 01:31:47.580]   I don't think you catch Andy at five by five.
[01:31:47.580 --> 01:31:49.740]   TV where Andy's a knock goes on.
[01:31:49.740 --> 01:31:52.860]   Well, that is but also he reads his old columns.
[01:31:52.860 --> 01:31:53.860]   Exactly.
[01:31:53.860 --> 01:32:00.300]   I put I put on the cardigan, put the dog by the fire and we have a nice chat.
[01:32:00.300 --> 01:32:02.220]   Remember remember the Bernoulli cartridge.
[01:32:02.220 --> 01:32:05.820]   What is my review of the new 40 megabyte Bernoulli cartridge.
[01:32:05.820 --> 01:32:08.900]   Well, that'd be actually fun to go back to a stupid product.
[01:32:08.900 --> 01:32:15.100]   No one will ever have 40 megabytes even with pictures being up to 640 by 480 dots.
[01:32:15.100 --> 01:32:19.180]   Oh, well, how young and foolish we were back then.
[01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:20.180]   Right scrap.
[01:32:20.180 --> 01:32:26.820]   Thanks to Alex Lindsey for joining us all the way from the White House in Washington, DC.
[01:32:26.820 --> 01:32:28.860]   Actually, that's the capital.
[01:32:28.860 --> 01:32:30.500]   You're at the Capitol today.
[01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:31.500]   I am.
[01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:34.020]   I'm in somewhere in DC.
[01:32:34.020 --> 01:32:36.580]   But I'll be in Rwanda next week.
[01:32:36.580 --> 01:32:37.580]   So wow.
[01:32:37.580 --> 01:32:38.540]   I'll be coming in from there.
[01:32:38.540 --> 01:32:39.540]   We should be good.
[01:32:39.540 --> 01:32:41.020]   So I'll be there.
[01:32:41.020 --> 01:32:43.980]   And then I think either Tanzania or Uganda the week after that.
[01:32:43.980 --> 01:32:48.060]   So we'll figure out if I'm able to connect from those places.
[01:32:48.060 --> 01:32:50.060]   We had a great class by the way.
[01:32:50.060 --> 01:32:54.860]   Last week, a green screen class, so if people want to check it out, they can just, best
[01:32:54.860 --> 01:32:57.620]   thing to do is go back to my Twitter feed because it's not very far up.
[01:32:57.620 --> 01:33:01.500]   I didn't tweet that much or you can just go to YouTube and just search for me and you'll
[01:33:01.500 --> 01:33:02.500]   see the green screen class.
[01:33:02.500 --> 01:33:05.740]   So a little experiment in interactive, you know, using the question system that we were
[01:33:05.740 --> 01:33:11.100]   using for this as well as the class in Rwanda as well as a bunch of a lot of cameras in
[01:33:11.100 --> 01:33:12.100]   our studio.
[01:33:12.100 --> 01:33:15.140]   So if you want to see us experimenting with the next generation of what we plan to do
[01:33:15.140 --> 01:33:18.420]   for the Pixel Core, definitely check it out.
[01:33:18.420 --> 01:33:21.180]   You'll find me playing black for the rest of my life.
[01:33:21.180 --> 01:33:22.740]   This is very fun.
[01:33:22.740 --> 01:33:23.740]   Wow.
[01:33:23.740 --> 01:33:25.740]   I love this game.
[01:33:25.740 --> 01:33:34.100]   Oh, you're the hero rats.

[01:33:38.540 --> 01:33:40.620]   What else is up with you at imore?
[01:33:40.620 --> 01:33:44.860]   I wasn't doing enough podcast, so I just launched another one yesterday with my good friend, Dave
[01:33:44.860 --> 01:33:46.500]   Wiscus of the unprofessional fame.
[01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:50.360]   It's called the TV show and we talked about the previous week's television.
[01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:51.800]   Sounds great.
[01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:52.800]   What's not to love?
[01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:53.800]   Spoiler alert.
[01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:56.660]   You talk about Game of Thrones?
[01:33:56.660 --> 01:34:01.340]   We talked about Game of Thrones, Mad Men, Arrow, Shield.
[01:34:01.340 --> 01:34:08.900]   You know what I'm currently becoming a fan of is this new show on Showtime, Penny Dreadful.
[01:34:08.900 --> 01:34:09.900]   I've heard about it.
[01:34:09.900 --> 01:34:10.900]   I've not tried it yet.
[01:34:10.900 --> 01:34:11.900]   You've got to watch it.
[01:34:11.900 --> 01:34:12.900]   It's creepy.
[01:34:12.900 --> 01:34:15.940]   That was what my mom used to call the small books, the Penny Dreadfuls.
[01:34:15.940 --> 01:34:19.060]   And so far they've got, I've only seen the first one, but the last one last night was
[01:34:19.060 --> 01:34:22.900]   the second word Sunday was the second one, but they've already got vampires in Frankenstein.
[01:34:22.900 --> 01:34:26.320]   So it can only get better from here.
[01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:27.320]   Thank you all for being here.
