[00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.760]   We've got plenty of other things to talk about,
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.600]   including the new title, Music Service,
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.000]   and how that might affect Apple's beats.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.240]   Alex Lindsey has a unique take on that one.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.040]   Adam Anks joins us from tidbits.
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.480]   We'll talk about the new Steve Jobs biography,
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.880]   becoming Steve Jobs and what he thinks of that.
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.240]   Alan Alex Lindsey, Andy Inako, and Adam Anks.

[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.440]   Somebody said we should call it Apple Break Weekly.
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.200]   That doesn't roll off the tongue, quite as well.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.440]   We'll just stick with Mac Break Weekly,
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.120]   but you understand it's everything.
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.560]   Andy and I go as here from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.640]   Hello, Andrew.
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.040]   Hello, Liam.
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.320]   Mr. Alex Lindsey from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.480]   and the Pixel Core.
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.000]   Hey.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.320]   Nice to see you.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.120]   And joining us this week is Renee Ritchie.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.080]   He is an ooh for the ooh conference in Ireland.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.520]   Mr. Adam Anxton of tidbits fame.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.760]   Hello, Adam.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.000]   Good to be here, Leo.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.320]   Up where the penguins go.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.280]   Yeah, well, let me tell you, it's been penguin weather
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.880]   for a while here.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.280]   I'm multiplying.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.720]   You've got three now, I can see.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.320]   Oh, you haven't been begun to see the collection.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.640]   Is there Popper's penguins?
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.880]   Yes.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.400]   I've got a copy of that, too.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.840]   Yes.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.040]   Does your penguin realize that he's not very well camouflaged
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.320]   behind that green bush?
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.080]   Penguins are a little silly about green.
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.480]   They don't really see it because it's not one of those things
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.800]   that their eyes are evolved.
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.160]   Wow.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.400]   I never thought of that.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.560]   There's not a lot of gray up there, is there?
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.200]   Wow.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.520]   He also knows that the angst eye system is based on movement.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.520]   So if he just remains perfectly still,
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.160]   exactly, I will not be able to see him
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.760]   and think of him as a praise creature.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.400]   Yes.
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.240]   Yeah, there's slightly related to ostriches that way.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.400]   It's all the flightless bird approach.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.720]   Right.
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.920]   Just don't get him cornered.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:20.280]   Almost.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.360]   Don't get him cornered.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.120]   I'm going to get a Baltimore Oreo fan in the studio today.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.040]   And his t-shirt says this is Birdland.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.520]   I like it.
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.480]   I like it.
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.040]   That was high school for me.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.600]   Well, yeah.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.560]   Are you the Oreos?
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.000]   All right.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.040]   Cal Ripken, that era.
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.360]   Well, that was a great era.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.200]   I was just saying, you know, just couldn't after that,
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.320]   just couldn't stay in touch.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.880]   Yeah.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.920]   Well, here we are once again.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.280]   And we're counting down to the Apple Watch only 11 days.
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.480]   Till the orders.
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.840]   And of course, we're learning more and more about the process
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.920]   and how people who have $17,000 to spend
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.280]   will get to jump the line as they should.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.120]   Speaking for the Plutox Plutox, Plutox, are we Plutox?
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.960]   What are we?
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.120]   I think it was probably different.
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.720]   It's different.
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.200]   Plutox.
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.400]   Plutocracy and Plutox are not related.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.320]   No.
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.000]   The Plutocrats.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.280]   Can-- I think that's correct.
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.160]   The Plutocrats can jump--
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.080]   The Plutox no longer a planet, remember.
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.080]   Oh, man.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.080]   The dwarf star contingent.
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.200]   No, or not dwarf stars either.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.120]   Heavenly bodies.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.400]   Anyway, you can jump the line.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.800]   I don't think there's much to say.
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.160]   Hey, now that we've had a week to digest becoming Steve Jobs.
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:42.520]   Do we have any thoughts?
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.080]   I know that Renee and Andy were reading it.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.560]   I'm reading it.
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.760]   I'm only in chapter three, so I can't really comment.
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.240]   Alex and Adam, have you--
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.720]   dipped into the new bag or something?
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.280]   I have not.
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.680]   However, I did just, of course, the next best thing,
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.480]   which was edited Michael Cohen's book review for Ted Bits.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.240]   Oh, what did Michael think?
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.480]   He actually did a really interesting thing.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.440]   He compared it to the Isaac Sing book.
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.080]   And basically noted that the whole controversy about which
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.320]   one is sort of more accurate or anything like that
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.120]   is just not really-- it's missing the point--
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.240]   that they're two completely different books.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.040]   The Isaac Sing book Jobs is really
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.040]   designed to be a biography.
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.720]   That's what Isaac Sing does.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.080]   And it is complete.
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.600]   It talks to a lot of people.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.160]   It gets all the sides of Jobs as Steve Jobs himself wanted.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.720]   Now, becoming Steve Jobs book is a very different sort of book.
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.160]   Michael compares it actually to the classic genre
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.040]   of the hero's journey that it is trying
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.240]   to follow some of the events in Steve Jobs's career
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.640]   to show how he gets to where he ends up
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.920]   and takes lessons from that along the way.
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.160]   So it's sort of by definition more positive
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.160]   because it's not trying to be a complete biography.
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.320]   It's just saying, here's the trajectory
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.920]   this guy took in ending up where he was.
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.000]   It's turning out to be a Roarzak test for Apple lovers
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.680]   and haters, actually.
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.640]   Johnny Ives-- Johnny Ives hates the Isaac Sing book.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:22.280]   He said, I can't regard it more lowly.
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.400]   And then I'm reading Dan Gilmore's piece in Slate.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.600]   And Dan hastens to mention that he
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.080]   used to be an Apple computer fan but no longer
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.640]   as if that somehow germane.
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:39.080]   I have to say, only three chapters in--
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.000]   I haven't heard anything I haven't heard already.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.480]   And I feel like you could read either one
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.640]   and get a fairly good picture of Steve.
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:50.120]   I don't feel like the Isaac Sing book was bad.
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.920]   And I don't think becoming Steve Jobs is fine.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.440]   But I also feel like I've read this now 18 million times.
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.800]   And I don't know if--
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.800]   And one of the things that as you look at these books that
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.400]   have come out and you look at the articles
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:07.280]   and you look at the articles also about--
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.560]   Tim as well, I think that one of the things that you--
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:15.280]   it feels like Steve Jobs was perfect to get Apple to where
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:15.680]   it was.
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.680]   Yeah, no, that's not true.
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.200]   We know that, yeah.
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.680]   But it also feels like Apple--
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.200]   in a lot of ways, I feel like Apple's
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.680]   doing a lot of the right things now in a way
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.000]   that I don't know if Steve Jobs would have.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Tim Cook is doing things when it comes to philanthropy
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.960]   and outreach and standing up for political things.
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.760]   And also just the way he interacts with employees
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.480]   and the culture and all of those things
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.280]   are the things you do when you're a larger company.
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:45.640]   It's that whole revolutionary versus effective management.
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.160]   I think Steve Jobs created a lot of these things.
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.360]   But it does feel like there's a transition here
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.640]   that I actually think is pretty healthy.
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.800]   I think a lot of people thought that what would happen after Steve.
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.280]   But I think that Tim Cook's doing a pretty good job
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:00.360]   of moving that to a more mature growing company.
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.360]   Maybe that'll mean a slow decline, I don't know.
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.720]   But I think it's good in a lot of ways what he's doing.
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.720]   One of the things I've been fascinated to see
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.640]   is just how many interviews with Steve Jobs and Johnny
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.760]   I've just-- they just keep coming.
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.600]   And we were joking on our staff list
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.080]   that he's going to start giving interviews
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.040]   to high school newspapers.
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.520]   I mean--
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.080]   Just--
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.360]   Yeah, well, considering this is a guy
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.440]   who's been avoiding any press for years, for decades.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.160]   Yeah.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.680]   And just in general, I mean, Apple, certainly before,
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.760]   was very careful about letting people talk
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.680]   to any of the executives.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:37.240]   And Jobs very seldom did any kind of public events.
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:42.480]   So to see Tim Cook doing them over and over and over again.
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.160]   On the one hand, I think it's very positive.
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.360]   But it's certainly a big change.
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.600]   Yeah.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.240]   It's interesting.
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:53.160]   I mean, it shows that what Steve did was not unique.
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.960]   But of course, Steve handpicked Tim Cook and trained him
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.160]   and created the company that Tim runs.
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.600]   But Tim's running quite well now.
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.920]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:06.600]   And also, as-- you can't say this often enough,
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:11.880]   that Apple is an evolutionary environment in which
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.720]   you will not succeed to the level of that level of management,
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.880]   unless you are simpatico with all of their values
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.280]   and all of their principles.
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.080]   And here, I'm mostly talking about their thoughts
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.680]   about the role of technology, what good design is,
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:24.920]   and what their role should--
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.000]   what the relationship is between a maker of technology
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.680]   and a consumer technology should be.
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.520]   So you're really not going to get one of those Mavericks
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.840]   who lasts for 10 years and gets promoted
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.400]   to a senior vice presidency if they're the person who say,
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.600]   oh my god, Johnny, this is the dumbest thing you've ever done
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:39.800]   ever.
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.680]   Who the hell would ever want to buy something like this?
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:48.000]   It's not because they have a legacy of yes people.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.560]   It's because everybody tends to work together.
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.160]   It's like you don't join a baseball team
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.400]   because you want to play basketball.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.880]   And Apple, sometimes it's a problem with Microsoft
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.600]   and Google and other companies.
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.080]   Apple is a baseball team filled with people who
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.160]   want to just play baseball.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.520]   Well, they're playing very well.
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:09.960]   Superstars, Cal Ripken, juniors of the technology world.
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.720]   If they were baseball, they'd be the Yankees
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:12.880]   and we would all hate them.
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.600]   Interesting book, though.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:22.320]   And I'm not-- does your reviewer like it?
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.040]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.560]   I think Michael does like it.
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.440]   He says he just keeps coming back.
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.040]   It's just so different from the other book
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:35.320]   and the basic thrust that Isaacson had a lot of access
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.800]   to jobs and exclusive interviews and things like that.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.360]   But the other guy--
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:40.880]   Right.
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:55.320]   --
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.240]   so that he interacted with Jobs' family informally
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.160]   and things like that.
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.120]   Well, as we pointed out last week,
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.000]   he was also more technical.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.640]   So Isaacson's-- the failure a lot of people
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.640]   felt of Isaacson's book was he just--
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.160]   he didn't understand technology enough
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.440]   to ask the right questions, which is, I'm sure,
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.960]   exactly why Jobs picked him.
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.440]   Well, the other thing that Michael points out
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:25.280]   is Isaacson's book comes out right after Steve Jobs dies.
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.320]   And so no one had a chance to see it beforehand.
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:32.400]   And they pushed it out to capitalize on the big news--
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.160]   probably the right publishing decision.
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.880]   But as a result, everyone close to him
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.080]   was somewhat blindsided by it.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.400]   They hadn't had a chance to see the early drafts,
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.480]   like they might have had Steve lived another six months.
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:47.560]   Right.
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:51.120]   And also, it's entirely plausible that Steve's opinion
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.960]   would have possibly changed the book, probably not.
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.560]   But he certainly would have talked to his friends and family
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.120]   about why it did what it did and whether or not
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.200]   that was what he wanted.
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.640]   Yeah.
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:02.800]   You know, I'm enjoying it.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.880]   But-- and I'm an Apple fanatic, and I still--
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:09.520]   I feel like, OK, I've read so many books on Steve Jobs now.
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.160]   It's hard to find a new anecdote.
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.600]   Plus, I-- over time, I've met many of the people
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.760]   mentioned in the book.
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.960]   I heard those anecdotes from them.
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:22.600]   I mean, I just feel like it's not a must read.
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.480]   But it does give you a new angle on it, I guess.
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.440]   I just think that no one biography
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.840]   is going to give you the whole story on any individual.
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:33.200]   But this is-- if I were to recommend one book on Steve Jobs,
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.240]   it would be this one.
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.240]   And partly for the reason that you mentioned,
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.760]   I have heard a lot of these stories
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.800]   from people who-- directly from people who either worked
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.400]   with Steve or worked with people who
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.280]   worked with Steve on a regular basis.
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.000]   And this is the first biography where, when I hear those stories,
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.160]   again, it tracks very much with the experience
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:52.880]   that these people were sharing with me.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.800]   Whereas not that every single--
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.640]   not that even of the majority of the stories I read in the Isak's
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.240]   book had that sort of experience with me.
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.840]   But when it did happen, like, oh, that really kind of isn't
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.960]   the way that this person told me that story.
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:09.800]   And when you hear the same story from two or three people,
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.320]   both of whom were either in the room,
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.520]   were talking to people 10 minutes afterward,
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.240]   you know that probably that printed version is not--
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.240]   it's factual, but it's not true, so to speak.
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:21.520]   I came away with one little tidbit which I enjoyed,
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.960]   which was that in the entire lifecycle of the Apple II
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:30.520]   computer from the late-- what, '78 through 1993,
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:34.280]   they sold a total of 6 million, which is how many iPhones are
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:35.440]   sold every week.
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.440]   Yeah.
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.280]   So I thought that was quite interesting.
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:44.720]   They only sold something like 130,000 Apple 3s.
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.560]   So the Apple III was quite a flop.
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.160]   Yeah, well, that's not surprising.
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.680]   It was a kid when the Apple III was coming out.
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:52.840]   And we went from being extremely excited
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.640]   about what the follow-up is going to be to the Apple II
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.600]   to universally, like, wow, that really
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.760]   is what we're getting after with the--
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.880]   It's not too true.
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:07.440]   I'd have to go to the Blackberry Playbook or the HP's tablet.
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.080]   First, iPad tablet II, a product that
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:14.000]   landed with such an audible thud on the ground as the Apple
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:14.920]   III.
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.480]   It was not anything anybody wanted.
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:21.040]   And it did not, in any way, improve upon or replace
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.680]   the item that people already had.
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.560]   It was amazing.
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.080]   Now, it will be interesting to see
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.400]   if there's a change in printing.
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.680]   Michael did note that there's a number of minor trivial errors
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:33.120]   in the Slender book.
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:37.560]   The Apple I did not have a 6,800 processor, but a 6,502.
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.280]   Do they say 6,800, really?
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:39.800]   Yeah.
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:40.280]   Wow.
[00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:41.960]   6,800, not 68,000.
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:42.720]   Yeah, no.
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:43.400]   I think--
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:43.920]   Yeah.
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:44.240]   Yeah.
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:48.160]   And then he calls the first Macintosh ivory, not beige,
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:52.240]   and claims the iPad II had a flash, which did not.
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.200]   So there's a number of little things that probably
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.040]   could have been fixed in Mac Tracker.
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:56.560]   Yeah.
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:57.800]   So it's odd.
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.880]   And there's a couple of those are kind of interesting,
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:03.760]   like especially the with the processor.
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.600]   Because the interesting story is that it's
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.760]   the arrival of the 6,502 processor
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:11.000]   that enabled all of these little home-brute computers
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   to be happy.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.560]   And just the same way that now Intel will release a mobility
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.040]   enabled very high power processor.
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.600]   And now suddenly you're seeing little tablets that
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.400]   could run desktop apps.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.760]   It's-- there are mistakes here and there.
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:27.320]   And I think a second edition is going to be a must-buy
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.400]   for anybody who bought the first one.
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.920]   It is available and audible.
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.320]   That's how I've been reading it.
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:34.960]   I feel I have to apologize for not having finished it.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.240]   But you did, Andy.
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.840]   Did you finish it?
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:40.040]   I got to the end of it just over the weekend.
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:40.600]   Yeah.
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.760]   I should have buckled down and read more.
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.360]   It's a very readable book.
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.880]   And also you're not missing out by it.
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:47.880]   No, I enjoy listening to it.
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:48.880]   Yeah.
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:51.160]   Yeah.
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:51.880]   Let's take a break.
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.880]   We'll talk about title versus beats.
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:59.800]   We'll also talk about lawsuits.
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.000]   And I watches.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.080]   Apple watches.
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.280]   Ah.
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:06.680]   How many months-- and we're still not saying the right word.
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:07.680]   I know.
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.600]   I've trained myself to say Apple Watch,
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.800]   but I cannot say Apple Edition Watch.
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.480]   No, is it Apple Watch Edition?
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:15.080]   How do I say the steel one on a watch?
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.840]   This is such a big mistake.
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:18.760]   The way they named this thing.
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:20.840]   Comcast says, I don't know.
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.360]   We never talked to them.
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:25.440]   And Tim Cook says, I'm giving away all my money.
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.600]   We'll tell you where to line up.
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:27.800]   First.
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:28.920]   Pass it along.
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:29.920]   Dibs.
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.600]   Dibs.
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:35.040]   And we'll report on why Miracad is dying
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.200]   and taking US tech journalism with it.
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.280]   [LAUGHS]
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:45.640]   Our show today brought to you by LegalZoom.com.
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.640]   It's a National Start Your Business Month.
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:50.880]   Actually, the very last day of National Start Your Business
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.680]   Month at LegalZoom, which just means it's a great time
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.400]   to start the business you've always dreamed of.
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.240]   Or if you have a business and you haven't put it
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:59.800]   out of proper legal footing to do so.
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.520]   Now LegalZoom's not a law firm.
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:06.320]   They help you get your business done at your direction.
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:08.400]   They can also connect you with an independent attorney.
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:12.000]   So if you have questions, it's a great place to go as well.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.080]   Now's a great time.
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:15.640]   There's never been a better time to start a business.
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.320]   And LegalZoom.com makes it easy.
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.160]   It made it easy for me 10 years ago.
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:24.120]   We are now at the 10th anniversary of the LLC I formed
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:25.720]   to start Twitch.
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:28.440]   They've been giving advice for the last decade,
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:32.160]   a million business owners, just like you and me.
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.680]   If you need advice for your business, no problem.
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.000]   LegalZoom isn't a law firm.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.520]   But they have built a network of trusted attorneys
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:42.080]   to provide the guidance you need for your specific situation.
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.080]   And here's the best part.
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.680]   During National Start Your Business Month,
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.760]   LegalZoom is offering an attorney consultation
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:49.920]   for only $50.
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.360]   If you're unsure about the best way to start,
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.160]   if you already run a business, you need some advice
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.560]   this offer is for you.
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:55.920]   Get legal advice for your business,
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:59.800]   no further obligation, a low one time cost of $50.
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.680]   Wow.
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.720]   My attorney picks up the phone at $70.
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.640]   Go to LegalZoom.com today to find out more
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.320]   attorney consultations are provided by independent attorneys
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.640]   available in most states.
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.640]   Get the legal help you need for your business
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:16.560]   at LegalZoom.com offer code MBW in the referral box
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:18.120]   and you'll save even more.
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:19.400]   That's LegalZoom.com.

[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.520]   Even more.
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:29.000]   Tim Cook says I'm giving it all away.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.400]   The article in Fortune Magazine says
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:38.280]   he's worth about $785 million.
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:42.360]   He's going to pay for his 10-year-old nephews college
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:47.400]   education and then whatever's left, he will give away.
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:51.840]   This is in the tradition of Warren Buffett and Bill Gates,
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:54.600]   Mark Zuckerberg, who have all committed to giving it
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.600]   at least half their worth away.
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:01.000]   It's called the Giving Pledge.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.520]   I don't-- actually, Tim Cook's not on that list,
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:07.000]   but it's in that same spirit.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.640]   We think that's a little bit longer, though,
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.920]   because his nephew isn't going to go to college
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.440]   for under eight years.
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:15.600]   And the way college costs are going, $785 million
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.680]   might not be as much as it seems like.
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.000]   Just say it.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.960]   Also, if I knew I was getting that deal,
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:24.400]   I would say, hey, guess what, Uncle?
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.320]   NASA is agreed to let me do a semester at sea
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.200]   in the International Space Station.
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.920]   That'll be $40 million.
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:32.720]   Hey, if I have anything left in my kid's college fund
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.520]   after their eight, nine, 10 years in college,
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:39.160]   I promise to give that all away as well.
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:42.280]   You have my word on it.
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:45.560]   I think I'm running out already to your sin.
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.480]   But that is a pretty cool proposition, though.
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.240]   When you think about what you could do
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:51.920]   if you have tens of millions of dollars to disperse,
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.600]   and it seems as though the least satisfying thing imaginable
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:58.960]   would be to simply let it be your children or your relatives
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.160]   in the problem after you die.
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.120]   The idea of sitting there and thinking,
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:06.040]   what problem do I want to solve forever for some city
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:06.920]   or some institution?
[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.680]   The idea that I'm going to put $30 million
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.600]   into an endowment fund so that this library
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:15.880]   or this educational system is always funded so long
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:19.320]   as they don't screw things up, like try to launch a startup
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:20.160]   or something like that.
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.640]   - I'm just saying, if you wanted to give away
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:25.080]   your entire Justice League action figure collection,
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:28.880]   not hand it off to your kids, I know somebody had taken.
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.800]   - That would be roughly my half minute worth,
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.240]   so that would be a great benefit.
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.760]   (laughing)
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:38.000]   - Tim Cook told Fortune he already has started donating money
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.080]   quietly, but he wants to develop a more systematic approach
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:43.440]   to philanthropy, and that's exactly what Bill Gates said.
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:46.280]   Bill Gates, before he started being a philanthropist,
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:48.080]   while he was still running Microsoft,
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:49.880]   was often asked, you're the richest man in the world,
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:50.760]   why aren't you giving more away?
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:53.560]   He says, 'cause I don't have the time to do it right.
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.920]   When the minute he retired, he started the Gates Foundation
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:58.760]   with Melinda, his wife, and now they are giving it all.
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:01.640]   What, or most of it, I think he wants to give 95% of it away.
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:04.680]   I think that's great, more power to him.
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.800]   What are you gonna do with $785 million,
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.400]   especially if you don't have kids,
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:11.760]   buy a library or something?
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.880]   No, you make it do something.
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.520]   - Yeah, again, 100.
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:19.240]   I've always thought that not on that kind of grand scale,
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.800]   but how many times do you open up a newspaper
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.680]   or open up a newsfeed and see that, oh, well,
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:26.880]   some church or some library had a snow roof collapse
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.800]   and it's gonna cost them $7,000 to fix it,
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.560]   and they're not really sure where it's gonna come from.
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:33.200]   The ability to sit your desk and sit, done, here's a check.
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.560]   You're done. - Yeah, wouldn't that be nice?
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.280]   - Problem solved, you're gonna worry about this
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:38.600]   for three or four months, nope, here we go, check, done.
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:41.920]   - This comes from the really good interview Adam Lachinsky
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:46.920]   did in "Fortune Magazine," talking about Tim's unique style,
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:52.800]   and how he has, in fact, done very well.
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:59.560]   It's silly me, but I liken it to Joe Montana and Steve Young.
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:03.560]   As a 49ers fan, there was no greater quarterback
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:05.800]   than Joe Montana until you look at the numbers
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:08.760]   and you realize Steve Young was a greater quarterback
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.080]   than Joe Montana.
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:15.080]   This is like the successor beating the master.
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:22.880]   Stock has gone from a split adjusted $54 to $126 since jobs
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:27.880]   died, that's a market cap of $700 billion.
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:32.880]   The cash hoard has more than tripled since Steve passed
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:36.640]   to $150 billion in that despite the fact that Apple's
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:40.640]   already spent almost $100 million in buybacks and dividends.
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:43.320]   Something Jobs said we will never do.
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.480]   (laughing)
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:48.000]   $38 billion of merchandise sold in China,
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.320]   a market that was nonexistent when Steve had been
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.800]   left the company.
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.320]   Tim's done a great job and what's interesting,
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:00.800]   he's taken I think Apple into a new area
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.640]   with the watch into fashion.
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:05.320]   - Time for me to be seen.
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.120]   - Well, we'll see how that works, yeah.
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:10.000]   - Well, what was the term I was looking at a
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.120]   New York Times style section and what was the term
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.080]   they were using for Apple to Webberwatch?
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.240]   Normcore.
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.280]   - What?
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:17.600]   Normcore.
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:18.440]   - Normcore.
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.720]   - Not nerdcore.
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:21.960]   - Nope, normcore, meaning that apparently
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:25.040]   it's all fashionable or the specific type of fashion
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:27.800]   that Apple Watch will be is not hardcore,
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:30.000]   not soccer, but normcore, just sort of normal.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   - For crying out loud.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.840]   - 'Cause everyone can, everyone can have it
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:34.640]   and therefore it's not real fashion.
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:37.600]   - According to Wikipedia, normcore is a unisex fashion
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:41.320]   trend characterized by unpretentious
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:43.560]   and average looking clothing.
[00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:44.400]   (laughing)
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.520]   - That's what I would say.
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:47.480]   New York Times Magazine, all over it.
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.160]   - I know nothing.
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:50.360]   - I know normcore.
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:52.920]   - I reminded that I know absolutely nothing
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:54.840]   'cause now there is like, what,
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:57.920]   this isn't very stylish or fashionable or whatever.
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.240]   There's absolutely no trend represented by this.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.600]   We have to call no trend a trend itself.
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:03.760]   There you go.
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:04.600]   Here you go.
[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.720]   - This is a picture of two people,
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:09.640]   one man, one woman dressed in normcore.
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:12.440]   This is also, this is also in Wikipedia.
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:13.840]   - Got a great dress on that.
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:17.520]   - Note, there's space available for an Apple Watch there.
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.360]   - Oh, good heavens.
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.840]   Well, first of all, you don't button the top button.
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:23.680]   - That's fine.
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:24.520]   What is that?
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:25.360]   That's Canadian normcore.
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:26.880]   I think he's from Canada.
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:29.760]   - I'm just saying, it seems as though this writer
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.520]   wanted to say that Apple has come up
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:33.200]   with a really boring watch design
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:34.960]   but they don't wanna fend the Apple
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:37.800]   because they still haven't seen the review hardware yet.
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.640]   (laughing)
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:42.200]   - I don't wanna know who posed for this normcore picture.
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.040]   (laughing)
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:45.640]   - Can he like, Achie's really?
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:46.760]   - Yeah, I didn't even know they make those.
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:50.440]   Actually, those, they're just acid washed jeans.
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.160]   - Well, they're not pleated, so he's okay.
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.200]   They're flat front cack.
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.560]   - Flat front.
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:55.880]   There's something in his pocket though,
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:57.280]   that's really a drawing me eye.
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.320]   - Maybe he's holding like that dark iPad
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:02.240]   but he looks like he's ready to be taken
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.480]   into the spaceship by his doomsday cult.
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:07.000]   (laughing)
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.400]   It's the perfectly white sneakers
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.640]   that are the giveaway, isn't it?
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:12.280]   - Yeah, it's the tapering to the sneakers
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.880]   that really sets that off.
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:16.360]   - Yeah, there's something about those legs.
[00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.120]   (laughing)
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.440]   - Really?
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:22.440]   - And all I have to do now is just show this picture
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:24.320]   and say now in three styles.
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:27.000]   (laughing)
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   - What was the model casting call for that photo though?
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.960]   We're looking for a man whose average height,
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.960]   not particularly attractive, not particularly ugly,
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.520]   the sort of person you walk past
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:41.120]   and take no notice of whatsoever.
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.480]   - I like how he's looking off to the side.
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.200]   (laughing)
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.920]   - Is this where I should stand right here?
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:51.920]   - I don't think the person there was any casting for this.
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:53.960]   I think this is just some random photo.
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:56.760]   - Well, it has to be watching, just going,
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.480]   why are you making so much fun?
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:02.120]   - It's from Rosco, whatever that is.
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:03.720]   - Is it stock photo?
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:05.440]   - No, it can't be 'cause it has to be,
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.760]   it's uploaded by a guy named Rosco.
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:07.600]   It has to be--
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.480]   - See, I just, I'll just create a comment.
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:10.680]   - This is actually a good lesson.
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:13.600]   Notice that the woman is smiling nicely.
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.800]   She seems like very friendly and very approachable.
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:19.920]   And therefore, we're not even thinking about her clothing
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:22.040]   or making fun of her, but we're making fun of the guy.
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:26.240]   Not the man, but the man's close 'cause that's such an odd,
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.240]   that's an odd face.
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:28.080]   - That's an odd, odd, odd face.
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:30.240]   - That's an odd, special expression I'm saying.
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:32.600]   - It's a why am I standing here, face?
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.000]   I don't understand.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:34.840]   - I think he's about to say,
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:36.960]   "Life is like a box of chocolate."
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:40.240]   - If my peer review were not in 24 hours,
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.400]   I would not have agreed to this.
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.480]   - That's not a lot of what I thought.
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.000]   You have my stapler.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.400]   I was told I would get my stapler if you let me,
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.240]   if I did this.
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:50.440]   - Although Lieutenant Dangle cosplay,
[00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:52.760]   he would be like right up there at the top.
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:56.320]   All right, enough making fun of these poor people.
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.000]   - Oh, not making fun of the people,
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.640]   bring fun of the photo and--
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:01.280]   - This is from the Norm Corps,
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:05.480]   Norm Corps article in Wikipedia.
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:08.960]   The word first appeared in a webcomic,
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:13.960]   Templar Arizona was later employed by K-hole,
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:16.200]   which believe it or not, it's the worst name ever.
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.320]   It's a trend forecasting group.
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:19.160]   - Oh geez.
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:23.080]   - Why would you name your company K-hole?
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:26.040]   That's terrible.
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:31.280]   The word, the word lest you think we're making this up
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:36.280]   was named runner up for neologism of the year in 2014
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:39.120]   by the Oxford University Press.
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:40.280]   - I don't even know what that means.
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:42.240]   - I've never heard the word Norm Corps,
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.560]   but it was runner up.
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:48.640]   A neologism is a new word, a new made up word.
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:50.240]   - The dictionary people always vote on though,
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:53.360]   so it's actually quite fun to hear them debating
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:56.600]   what the realism of the year is gonna be each year.
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.400]   But I did not realize that Norm Corps is gonna be running.
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:01.440]   - Wow, so the watch is Norm Corps,
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.320]   I don't know if the watch,
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.920]   it's the watch Norm Corps really?
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:06.760]   The time says so it must be.
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:08.880]   - I was gonna say, the problem is the fashion
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:11.280]   used to say so then that's hard to argue.
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:15.240]   - In all seriousness, it does seem like the sort of thing
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:19.200]   where they realize that a watch is a very unique
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:22.680]   and particular sort of appeal to individual people.
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:25.640]   You can't find one design that is unique,
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:27.040]   that everybody's gonna enjoy,
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:28.200]   or enough people are gonna enjoy that
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.760]   it will do what Apple wants it to do.
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:33.880]   So you have to come up with the Jimmy Fallon style design,
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:37.120]   which I mean that is an insult towards the watch
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:39.640]   of Jimmy Fallon, but someone who is very, very palatable
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:41.520]   to a very, very wide range of people.
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:43.480]   'Cause if the David Letterman style
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:44.480]   is gonna turn off a lot of people.
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:45.880]   - That's a good point, yeah.
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:49.320]   - Leno is more Norm Corps than Fallon,
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:51.760]   maybe Fallon's a little more useful.
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:55.080]   - Well, Leno is Fallon's Letterman.
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.920]   It's like Leno is edgy compared to Fallon.
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:58.760]   - Really, wow.
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:00.560]   - Which is why he has such a great audience.
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:03.160]   Like he does stuff that the most people
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:04.320]   are going to really enjoy.
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:05.960]   It's not because this audience is stupid,
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:08.760]   it's because it is a very, very open big tent.
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.320]   So that's my-- - Our next 2020
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:14.360]   in our chat room says that Apple is becoming mainstream.
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:15.760]   - Oh, it's becoming is.
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:16.840]   - It's as if it is.
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:18.680]   - It is while it's on. - It's certainly here
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:20.160]   in the West Coast it is.
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:22.640]   I need to disabuse-- - It's the largest company
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:24.920]   in the world, I would call that mainstream.
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:26.760]   (laughing)
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:31.760]   - That's not really, that measure is by its stock value.
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:33.880]   - Most valuable company in the world.
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:35.840]   - Yeah, I stock value that in the price.
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:38.040]   - But let's do that. - That would be,
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.600]   that would be, okay, maybe that's not the definition,
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:43.280]   but it's the smoke that would price towards five.
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.920]   - And also keep in mind that we're also,
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:49.320]   the Apple brand is always in like the top three
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:51.960]   or five of brands in the world.
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:54.960]   So they're not missing out on,
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:58.240]   it's not like we're talking Gazprom being
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.320]   the most valuable company.
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:01.680]   And who knows what Gazprom is?
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.440]   - Was the former most valuable company?
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.440]   - Yeah, yeah, no, that's who Apple took over from.
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:09.040]   I mean, I don't know exactly how Gazprom is run.
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.240]   There's Russians involved in oil,
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.840]   so we don't wanna go there, but--
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:15.920]   - You can't go wrong with fossil fuels.
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:20.360]   So Apple has spent a teeny-weeny, tiny teeny-weeny bit
[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:22.800]   of its cash reserves on a database company
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:25.680]   called FoundationDB.
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:27.600]   Why?
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.360]   It's a no SQL.
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:34.360]   It's a no SQL database, which is a very fashionable right now.
[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:40.800]   It's probably for use on the net.
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:43.760]   - Yeah, it looks like it's for their backend.
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:46.520]   So they're not, you know, and I think that one of the upsets
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:48.600]   that has been connected to this and some of their other
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:50.560]   purchases around this area is that they're closing it up
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:52.400]   and there's people that were actually using it.
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.360]   And there's a high probability they're not gonna support it.
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:55.360]   So they're not gonna wanna flip it.
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:56.200]   - Yeah, they're gonna wanna flip it.
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.200]   - They're gonna wanna flip the website down, yeah.
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.640]   - Right, and so there's a lot of developers
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:00.440]   who were using it for their own thing that think
[00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:02.520]   that it's all gonna be taken away and they're not,
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:04.880]   you know, now they've built up a lot of infrastructure
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:09.720]   around it, so there is some, some upset related to this.
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:14.720]   - The motto for FoundationDB, I think this is Normcore.
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:17.080]   No SQL, yes acid.
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:21.760]   - I mostly like the fact that it can do 14.4 million
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:23.240]   random writes per second.
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:25.720]   - Wow, and I'll bet you the guy in that photo
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:26.920]   knows exactly what that means.
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:29.400]   - Oh, I hate it.
[00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:30.560]   I really hate it.
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:34.920]   I know I'm not, no acid.
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:38.840]   - We don't know what Apple's gonna do with it.
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:40.680]   We don't know what they paid for it,
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.840]   although they had raised 22.7 million dollars.
[00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:44.680]   - If the level Apple buys things also,
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:48.120]   they very well may be buying some level of the hardware,
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:49.960]   but really buying the people.
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:51.080]   - Yeah. - You know, that they--
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:52.240]   - Could be an acquire, yeah.
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:54.080]   - Right, you know, it's just like we need these people
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:56.800]   to make iCloud sing, so, you know,
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:58.960]   let's just buy the whole thing.
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:00.440]   - Well, and sometimes I think it comes down to Apple's
[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.880]   using something already, and then they find that it's so
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:04.360]   integral to what they're doing, they might as well
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:06.880]   just absorb it so that it doesn't go somewhere else.
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:08.560]   Someone doesn't buy it, take it away from them,
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:11.000]   'cause it's become too much part of their infrastructure.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.960]   - Yeah, that happens a lot, not only that,
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:15.360]   but not only do we wanna make sure that this is a reliable
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:19.120]   resource for us forever, but also sometimes more often
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:20.160]   with components than anything else,
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:22.880]   that we don't want anybody else to have access to this either
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:24.360]   'cause we feel as though we can make this
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:26.320]   into a real strategic advantage for us.
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:28.520]   - Yep.
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:31.360]   - An acquisition that Apple made a while ago,
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:36.360]   the Beats acquisition is now facing perhaps some competition
[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:41.200]   from a title, I watched this morning,
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:44.200]   with growing surprise and amusement,
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:47.360]   the title announcement, they had a lot of stars,
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:49.240]   I'm trying to find the video of it.
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:54.320]   Of course, Jay-Z was there, his buddy Kanye was there,
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:57.120]   Beyonce was there, Madonna was there, Daph Punk was there,
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:59.560]   I mean everybody came out on the stage,
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:02.080]   they had a lot of artists, there's Arcade Fire.
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:05.840]   Let me get you up ahead.
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:07.480]   - It's like award ceremony, except it's a--
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:08.840]   - Exactly, look at this.
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.080]   - Complete with a clear podium.
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:12.320]   - Look, there's dead mice on the stage,
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.720]   mouse, one mouse, one dead mouse.
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:19.760]   So the idea, then they all weirdly signed this piece
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:23.000]   of paper which we didn't know what they were signing.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.440]   It wasn't really clear there's Rihanna signing that,
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:27.440]   she's gonna hand off the pen to Usher.
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:33.360]   It's a taunting and the last one to survive wins $8,000.
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:35.280]   So title's been around for a while,
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:38.240]   what are they signing, the declaration of artist independence
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:40.080]   and look a little thumbprint for Musher?
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:43.020]   - And I have to admit that the scheming side of me
[00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:45.640]   wonders whether what this really is
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:47.560]   is a play to get bought by Apple.
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:48.800]   So, I mean, you know, this new thing is--
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:50.120]   - No.
[00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:51.360]   - These guys are all, wait, wait, just hold on,
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:53.600]   these guys are all getting a percentage of this company.
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:56.640]   They're in a very uphill battle for this,
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:00.240]   but they do represent a core number of people
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:02.680]   that Apple would be very interested in for beats
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:05.920]   and probably be a lot less expensive than beats to acquire.
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:08.280]   So if they were remotely successful,
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:10.600]   it would be easy for Apple to just kind of absorb this
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:12.120]   into what they're already doing.
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:15.000]   - I think they could just laugh and let them move on.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.240]   The real question is whether they'll get artist exclusives.
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:18.840]   These guys are signing something,
[00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:20.720]   but I doubt very much they're saying,
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:22.200]   "Oh yeah, we're gonna make sure our albums
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:23.600]   only appear on title now."
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:26.360]   Titling is $10 for a very similar service to beats
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.920]   or Spotify.
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:31.960]   $20 though, if you want the CD quality music,
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:32.800]   kind of like--
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:35.360]   - I'm not sure if anybody around can hear anymore.
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.320]   - You know, I have title on my Sonos
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:40.360]   as well as all the other things,
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:42.240]   including a lot of high res music
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:43.400]   that I could play directly.
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:46.520]   On the Sonos anyway, I can't tell the difference.
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:49.800]   - It sounds, you know, CD quality sounds exactly
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.880]   like whatever else I'm getting.
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:55.160]   - It was a claim somewhere that title was going to get
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:57.680]   early exclusive to new albums.
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:59.320]   So it wasn't gonna be exclusive exclusive,
[00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:01.160]   but you'd get it for the first month or whatever.
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:03.720]   - That's where Madonna's doing with her knee on the table.
[00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:07.320]   She's like, "I won't give you exclusive."
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:08.800]   Here's Nicki Minaj.
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:12.680]   It's, they have some very well-established artists.
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:15.200]   I don't see Taylor Swift in that lineup.
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.920]   - Look at Nicki Minaj signing like a normal person.
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:19.120]   - Yeah, how dare she?
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:22.000]   - Well, my favorite though is Dad's Punk.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.200]   - I'm still trying to figure out the Madonna
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:24.040]   humping the table.
[00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:26.280]   - I don't understand what that was all about at all.
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:27.880]   - Is that like, you know, that's the only,
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:32.200]   for some legal tax reasons she has to give it a knee print?
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:35.000]   It's not legal unless the booby-sport.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.200]   - I have a feeling that she knows that
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:38.240]   if everyone's taking photos,
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:39.440]   that'll be the photo everybody uses it.
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:40.280]   - Yeah, she's right.
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:41.280]   That's true.
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:42.600]   You're absolutely right.
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:43.440]   That's brilliant.
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:48.280]   So the question is, is there a ruin?
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:50.080]   Really, the question is related to Beats
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:53.240]   because Spotify really owns this market.
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:56.160]   Pandora Spotify owned the market.
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.800]   And most of these others are, you know,
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:00.840]   10th of the size of that.
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:04.320]   Beats was at purchase by Apple.
[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:05.640]   We don't even know any number since then,
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:08.000]   a quarter of a million users compared to spot,
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.640]   a paid users compared to Spotify's 10 million paid users.
[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:14.880]   So, I mean, one 40th the size.
[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:16.480]   On the other hand, I have to say Apple
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:19.080]   with its marketing clout and its brand name
[00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:23.480]   and iTunes label and I could perhaps push it forward.
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:25.400]   - 400 million credit cards.
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:27.280]   - You know, I think that that's over,
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:29.640]   I think that the value that is overstated.
[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:32.320]   Amazon also has everybody's credit card.
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:34.000]   And it's not so hard.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.200]   - But I think that Apple already sell more than anyone else
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.040]   into this industry.
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:39.600]   - They are selling a lot of people.
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.320]   - Yeah, downloads, yeah.
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:43.440]   - Right, so I think that they're definitely
[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:44.520]   in a prime position to do this.
[00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:46.880]   And I think that Apple has the money to do a lot
[00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:48.360]   of the exclusives that we talked about.
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:50.760]   So they can incentivize a lot of artists.
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:54.040]   Some of the artists that were signing this for title,
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:56.040]   Beyonce did an early exclusive.
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.360]   I think that Apple can be looking at many, many more
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:00.600]   of those opportunities.
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.480]   And I have a feeling, if you look at what they already did
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:07.480]   with HBO, that they're gonna use some of that largesse
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:11.240]   to kind of move things in their direction as they launch.
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:12.640]   I mean, obviously they've tried to move it
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:15.880]   to a lower price point, which it doesn't sound
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:17.400]   like it's been successful.
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:20.160]   But I think that exclusives and a lot of those other things
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:21.600]   will hopefully sweeten the pot.
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:23.320]   - Well, and that's, you know, because title is,
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:25.160]   quote, artist-owned, I mean, it's owned by Jay Z
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:27.440]   who spent $56 million to acquire it.
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.960]   The impression that they gave, whether it's true or not,
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:34.120]   was that the other artists would have a stake in this as well.
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:37.360]   And really what it was is a statement by these musicians
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:41.920]   anyway, that they're not thrilled with technology.
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:45.720]   - Like they said, very specifically, music is about art,
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:49.880]   not technology, which I think may be underestimated,
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:53.000]   the importance of delivery systems and listings.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.240]   - It's about the pays per plays that they get
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:56.640]   through all the streaming services.
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:59.200]   And knowing that they can't convince billions
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:02.560]   of consumers worldwide to suddenly want to buy physical media
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:05.800]   or even downloads anymore.
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:10.520]   And so they just gotta figure out a way to convert
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:15.160]   from wheels to skis, if that makes any sense.
[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:16.000]   - Is there a shot?
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.520]   - I don't know, I mean, if they can really,
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:21.400]   if they're just doing a streaming service
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:22.720]   that only has their content,
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:24.200]   it just seems like it's,
[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:26.760]   I don't understand how they can succeed with this.
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:28.560]   If Alex says this is a ploy to,
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:30.080]   we're going to have our own company
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:31.640]   and someone's going to be smart enough a year
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:33.760]   from now to buy us and get all of our content,
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:36.200]   that seems like a smart move that I hadn't considered before.
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:39.360]   But part of their press is all about how we're not just
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:41.240]   going to be a place where you can get our albums.
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:43.080]   We're also going to have exclusive content.
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:46.280]   And with this kind of top drawer,
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:49.040]   people with people of audiences that are this big,
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:50.480]   I don't know, maybe they can make a go of it.
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:54.400]   But if it really is just, we want a version of Spotify
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.800]   in which we get more money per play,
[00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:57.880]   I just don't see how this can work,
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:59.760]   but again, I'm not a business reporter.
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:00.600]   - If you look at the,
[00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:02.400]   I think that one of the arguments could be is that
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:05.880]   if you look at just the sales of these artists,
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:08.080]   that number is probably larger,
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:10.520]   a significantly larger than $56 million a year.
[00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:12.720]   I mean, there's definitely some opportunities
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:14.960]   if they decided, for instance, to right now,
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:17.640]   all of their content's tied up with the copyright holders
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:20.520]   and typically that sometimes it's not them.
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:25.520]   But if they started publishing directly to this service,
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:27.960]   it means that they would have a service
[00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:30.280]   and they'd have a platform on which these artists
[00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:32.480]   can now make all the money.
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:35.520]   These are not artists that need the record companies anymore.
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:37.760]   And this may be what they're doing is actually separating
[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:38.600]   from the record companies,
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:40.480]   or this may be the first step of them separating
[00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:42.480]   from the record companies completely and saying,
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:44.480]   "We got the money, we've got the studios,
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:47.440]   we've got everything, the PR, we've got the names,
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:51.240]   we don't really need to have the record companies involved
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:52.360]   at all, so this may be less than all.
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:53.200]   - That would be interesting.
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:55.880]   - It's more about artists starting to take over
[00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:58.440]   their own building a collective.
[00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:01.080]   - That's like United Artists in the film industry
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:01.920]   back in the 20s.
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:05.240]   - Look at what that went for, Charlie Chaplin and Mary.
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:06.480]   - Mary Pickford and Rhett.
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:08.720]   - It'd be interesting to see what happens.
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:12.120]   Who will they sign will be the first person to sign
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:14.400]   outside of this initial event?
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.640]   And how big do you have to be before they will allow you
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:17.480]   into this collective?
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:20.120]   And what happens when they're slicing the pie up 100 ways?
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:21.480]   - That's to me more important.
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:23.840]   These guys have made it, they don't need anything.
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:25.800]   What about young and up-coming artists?
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:27.720]   Where do they go?
[00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:29.360]   Is this gonna be the home for them?
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:31.080]   Here's what Madonna had to say.
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:32.320]   Are you getting my audio?
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:33.320]   Let me play this.
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:38.320]   This was the general tenor of the conversation.
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:41.280]   - It's about putting art back into the forefront.
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:44.120]   It's about bringing humanity back to being an artist,
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:47.120]   not technology, art, human art.
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:48.280]   There they came from the art.
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:49.280]   - Where the artists come from?
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:52.440]   - It really almost feels like an anti-technology
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:53.840]   point of view here.
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:55.480]   It's about humans not technology.
[00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:57.840]   It's about art, not technology.
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:00.240]   They're obviously very much stung by what's happened
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:03.560]   to their business, to the record industry.
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:05.120]   But I don't wanna blame them for that.
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:05.960]   I don't wanna get them for that.
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:06.800]   - How is it about technology?
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:07.640]   - I played the record playables.
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:08.480]   - But how is it not about technology?
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:10.360]   How is it about humans and art?
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:12.200]   I don't see what the difference is.
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:14.280]   If it's just exclusive, if it's business deals,
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:16.040]   who gives a darn?
[00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:18.280]   - Well, and I would point out that you can be a human
[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:19.960]   and play your music in your bedroom,
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:22.840]   but with that technology, nobody's gonna hear it.
[00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:23.960]   So,
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:24.800]   - So good luck.
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:25.640]   - So good luck, Madonna.
[00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:27.760]   - I mean, they are using the technology to,
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:29.160]   you know, they're using the technology
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:30.840]   to make it more human, I guess.
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:31.840]   But I guess--
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:32.680]   - But how?
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:33.520]   - Right, that's just it.
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:34.360]   - They're just saying.
[00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:35.200]   - But they have control.
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:36.040]   I mean, I think that,
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:37.840]   so the big thing is that they're,
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:39.200]   I think that there's an opportunity,
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:41.040]   and I don't know if this is what they're thinking,
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:43.600]   but from my vantage point,
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:45.200]   having been in this business,
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:48.160]   the artists have very little control.
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:50.480]   The artists make a very small percentage
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:52.160]   of the total revenue.
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:54.960]   What they can do with this is we're not printing CDs anymore.
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:56.080]   You don't need the factories.
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:58.200]   You don't need all the other things that are there.
[00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:01.200]   Radio doesn't really mean as much to them as it would,
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:02.880]   and people would still play their stuff on the radio
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:04.480]   even without PR.
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:07.040]   I mean, I think that if you look at Peter Gabriel's making
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:08.600]   as much money now as he was before,
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:09.880]   and we barely hear about him anymore,
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:10.840]   but he's selling directly.
[00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:11.880]   He makes every penny.
[00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:13.280]   - Well, that's why these people should,
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:14.560]   they shouldn't be going,
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:15.560]   I hate technologies.
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:16.400]   They should be saying,
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:17.520]   I hate record labels.
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:21.600]   It's about us independently reaching out to our fans
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:23.840]   and eliminating the middleman.
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:26.280]   The technology enables that.
[00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:27.920]   - Yeah, and I think that they look at,
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:29.240]   I think when they're thinking of technology,
[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:30.080]   they're thinking of,
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:32.160]   I mean, I think saying they hate the record labels
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:34.480]   is a, you know, that's war.
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:38.160]   So, you know, I think that would be a declaration.
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:40.000]   - Right, but I think that the thing is,
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:40.840]   is that they have,
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:42.720]   I think the argument that could be happening there
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:43.920]   is that we're gonna all get together.
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:45.160]   We're gonna do exclusives together.
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:49.000]   That synergy between the handful of groups that are there
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.280]   will attract others that are high profile.
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:53.120]   But as you bring in and start to nurture,
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:54.480]   a lot of them already have record,
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:55.640]   you know, a lot of those guys
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:57.240]   that have their own little record labels
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:58.640]   that they've worked on and so on and so forth.
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:01.240]   As you start to curate more people into it,
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:03.960]   then the other advantage for these first guys
[00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:05.200]   is that they're gonna make money
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:06.040]   a little bit of, you know,
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:09.760]   a little bit of a percentage on all the newbies coming in.
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:12.160]   You know, they may be giving their newbies more money.
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:14.160]   - They just wanna take over-risk record labels,
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:15.280]   is what you're saying.
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:16.880]   - That may, that very well.
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:19.040]   I mean, I think that they may be saying it softly
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:20.600]   because, you know, they're kind of moving
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:22.040]   at, you know, sneaking up on that horse.
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:23.880]   But, but I think that,
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:26.000]   but they, I think that that may be what they're doing here.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.800]   This is maybe less of a play like,
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:30.360]   'cause one of the things Jay-Z said is I don't have to be,
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:32.240]   everyone doesn't have to lose for me to win.
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:35.240]   Like, and he's right if that's the model he's going after.
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:36.320]   If he's going after,
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:38.480]   they're gonna be a publisher, essentially,
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:40.080]   you know, for their own music.
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:41.800]   - That would be cool.
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:43.200]   - Yeah, 'cause the thing is,
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:47.640]   is that very few of them could do it right by themselves.
[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:50.760]   You know, there's an added audience factor
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:53.160]   by having this kind of wide range of, you know,
[00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:54.000]   wide group.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.520]   And, you know, Jay-Z's a pretty good business person.
[00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:59.160]   So I think that he's probably figured that kind of stuff out.
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:02.160]   And at $56 million of a purchase to get it off the ground,
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:04.360]   it's not, you know, these guys are gonna,
[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:06.800]   that group can generate an enormous amount of revenue.
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:10.080]   And so, I think by itself, it could make sense.
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:11.680]   I still think that it also positions them
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:14.440]   if they chose to, if it wasn't super successful to sell,
[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:17.480]   that whole exclusivity to Apple, if it wanted to.
[00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:19.800]   'Cause I think Apple is probably going to be pretty aggressive
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:22.040]   once it starts going down this path.
[00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:24.000]   They've proven that they're willing to spend $3 billion
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.120]   on headphones, you know, and a service.
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:27.760]   You know, the service I think was more important to them.
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:29.160]   - I wish they'd been more clear, but, you know,
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:33.360]   if they were saying as the top artists in the industry,
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:36.840]   we're gonna eliminate the record labels
[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:39.880]   because technology enables us to distribute directly
[00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:42.640]   to the audience and have the audience pay us directly.
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:45.080]   I think everybody, see, one of the things,
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:47.280]   I mean, people are saying these guys are brands,
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:50.960]   they have the clout to do this, at least initially.
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:54.320]   But what they really need to do is to embrace technology
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:56.840]   and say that's what's making it possible for us
[00:44:56.840 --> 00:45:01.840]   to go beyond this feudal system called the record industry
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:03.680]   that's been going on for 50 years.
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:05.480]   It's time to eliminate that.
[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:07.800]   - And then what they'll do is create another feudal system.
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:10.000]   I mean, you know, that's how this is all going to come up.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.600]   - And that's why I'm curious where the independent artist,
[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:16.640]   the up and coming artist, what role does that person have in this?
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:19.160]   By the way, Bob Lefzitz, who writes the Lefzitz letter,
[00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:22.320]   which is the kind of the crusty old curmudgeon
[00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:25.440]   of the music industry, is completely skeptical.
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:29.400]   And he sees this as an anti-piracy move.
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:34.040]   Well, actually he sees it as a money thing.
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:35.680]   Well, of course it is.
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:38.520]   But he says they don't have a chance against the deep pockets
[00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:40.920]   of Spotify and Apple,
[00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:47.200]   warring incumbents like Deezer, which is a very big outside the US.
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:51.280]   He says, "First and foremost, you've got to pay for the title
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:53.320]   and therefore it's dead on arrival,
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:56.640]   just like Apple's new music service because people are cheap."
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:58.680]   (laughs)
[00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:01.080]   Now I don't think this is true, but this is what Lefzitz says,
[00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:03.400]   "They love their money more than their favorite artist.
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:04.480]   Never forget it."
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:07.480]   Then the kind of person who pledges devotion to title artists
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:10.280]   is the same kind of person who's home alone broke,
[00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:13.440]   waiting for parents to put cash in their debit card.
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:17.320]   Now if title had a free tier, oh, but wait, it doesn't,
[00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:19.520]   it can't afford to lose that much money.
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:21.880]   It's not in it for the long haul.
[00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:24.480]   He says, "In fact, no one in music has been about the long haul
[00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:26.080]   since the turn of the century."
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:28.240]   Cash in.
[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:32.800]   Well, I think that the issue is that if these artists decided
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:35.440]   they were going to hold up either do it exclusively on their own
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:38.440]   for a certain period of time or hold up the content altogether
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:40.480]   and this is the only place that you can get it,
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:42.800]   they have a fan base that's large enough and be willing,
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:45.000]   and especially if the fan base knows that that money
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.520]   is now going back to the artist directly
[00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:48.480]   and they're getting a higher percentage,
[00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:50.720]   most of their fans would prefer to buy it from the idea.
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:51.560]   I agree.
[00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:52.400]   That was my thing.
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:54.320]   I think that that's, I think that,
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:55.880]   I don't think that, I think it's a little bit
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:58.240]   of a cynical view of that, because I do think people
[00:46:58.240 --> 00:46:59.920]   are willing to pay money for music.
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:02.800]   I mean, I don't think that, I think we got to a point
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:04.160]   because we were paying too much.
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:06.760]   I mean, I think this was a huge conversation in the '90s.
[00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:09.960]   A lot of us were saying, $16 is too much for a CD
[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:11.520]   when it costs less to produce the CD
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:13.600]   than it costs to produce the cassette.
[00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:17.160]   And so the thing is, is that we all knew it was nuts
[00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:19.480]   in the early '90s that this wasn't gonna,
[00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:22.600]   and so people just got tired of being screwed.
[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:25.520]   And so, which is what a CD and a DVD is.
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:27.680]   It's just, it's a public screw.
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:29.760]   And so the thing is, is that that's the,
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:31.800]   but anyway, I think that people,
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:33.000]   that's why they wanted to get it free
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.360]   because they were tired of what was being served to them.
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:39.200]   - So let's take a different look at this.
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:41.200]   The service I use is RDO.
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:44.040]   Mostly 'cause I like the client better than others I've seen.
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:45.880]   But one of the things that I've found interesting
[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:49.960]   about how I end up listening to music
[00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:52.000]   is that it's really quite different.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.440]   That most of the stuff that I've heard on RDO,
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:56.360]   I wouldn't buy.
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:58.040]   You know, that I like listening to it,
[00:47:58.040 --> 00:47:58.880]   but it was like listening to it
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:01.160]   in sort of the radio context.
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:06.000]   And being exposed to the vast, vast titles count
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.920]   that's signed in on the site, like RDO,
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:10.720]   I think they have 30,000 tracks or something like that,
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:15.720]   means that I'm all the less likely to wanna buy music
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:18.400]   because it feels like there's so much out there
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:20.000]   that I could want.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.800]   Whereas in the, back in the day, when pre-internet,
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:28.080]   you didn't know that there were 30,000 tracks out there
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:30.000]   that you could get in quite the same way.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.840]   You just, it was too hard to find that.
[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:35.680]   And so what we're being presented with all these services
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:37.840]   is kind of infinity of music.
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:41.440]   And it's almost gotta be a subscription thing
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:43.840]   because you just can't do that any other way.
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:45.200]   And then once you get in the subscription thing,
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:48.360]   then you get into the, how do you attract people?
[00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:51.480]   And so I think not having a free approach
[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:54.480]   to get people in the door is gonna be really tough.
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:56.080]   - Well, I think there were, there's 15 million people
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:59.120]   who bought into, according to Spotify's last,
[00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:00.360]   I think quarterly or whatever,
[00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:01.600]   there's 15 million people that have bought
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:03.120]   into Spotify paying 10 bucks a month.
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:05.800]   And I think, I am my own subscription.
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:07.040]   My wife has her subscription.
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:08.960]   And the thing is, is that I, my whole thing is,
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:10.400]   is that I just like the convenience of being able to--
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:12.200]   - Why don't you have one subscription that you share?
[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:13.920]   Why do you have separate subscriptions?
[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:14.760]   - No, I don't know.
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:15.960]   I do this how it got added.
[00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:18.080]   - No, it's, someone drives me crazy about Google music.
[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:21.520]   - Google music is attached to your Google account.
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:22.840]   You can't share it.
[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:25.280]   - Music is an interesting one though,
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:28.120]   because you may not have exactly the same kinds of tastes.
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:30.480]   - Yeah, but with Spotify, who cares?
[00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:32.480]   - Well, because as soon as you start--
[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:34.400]   - I'm not sure if I'm saying to you my playlists.
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:37.440]   - Well, she should be playlists that say, you know,
[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:39.120]   this is Alex's and playlists that say,
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:40.320]   this is Carlita's.
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:43.400]   What do you need two accounts for?
[00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:44.960]   - I don't, you know, it just, she said,
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:47.800]   I told her to set one up and I didn't, you know,
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:48.880]   I didn't want to share.
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:50.280]   I think it was most of that.
[00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:51.560]   I was willing to pay 10 more dollars a month.
[00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:53.800]   - It drives me crazy, 'cause I want to share my Google music,
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:55.760]   which I like, that's the one I use.
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:58.440]   And I can't, 'cause it would be giving away the keys
[00:49:58.440 --> 00:49:59.480]   to my Google account.
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:01.640]   - But the funny thing is, is that I'm perfectly fine
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:03.800]   with, I make a playlist and I'll share it with Carlita.
[00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:05.240]   And then she opens it up on hers and boom,
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:06.400]   she's able to listen to it.
[00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:10.400]   And I don't, again, I wouldn't want to have
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:11.880]   someone kind of digging through it all.
[00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:14.760]   So I have like 200 playlists in there.
[00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:16.720]   So it's all kinds of different things.
[00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:17.920]   - Why don't these artists go home
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:19.400]   and write compelling music?
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:20.720]   (laughing)
[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:22.080]   He says, "And get off my lawn."
[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:24.280]   - He says, "Great artists are lousy businessmen.
[00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:26.080]   "There are exceptions, but they are rare."
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:27.080]   And that is really true.
[00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:29.880]   That's really why the music industry is so futile,
[00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:31.440]   'cause the artists just go, "I don't know, man,
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:34.720]   "let me just make my music and I'll sign that."
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:38.880]   And so we'll see, but I don't feel like JZ
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:41.640]   or anybody else is gonna be able to drive title to success,
[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:44.720]   particularly, it says, "Spotify's already dominant
[00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:46.040]   "and Pandora's already dominant
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:48.240]   "and Apple's coming on strong with beats."
[00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:50.840]   - But I think as a boutique, they could make a lot of money.
[00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:52.240]   I mean, when we say a boutique,
[00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:54.240]   they could still make hundreds of millions of dollars,
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:56.440]   just with the group that they already have.
[00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:58.600]   So they don't necessarily need, if they play that right,
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:00.040]   and JZ is a pretty good business person.
[00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:02.960]   And if they play the angle that they have right,
[00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:04.640]   even if they didn't grow a lot,
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:07.360]   it doesn't mean that they wouldn't necessarily make money.
[00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:09.080]   I think that it may not ever be anything
[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:13.040]   that would go up against Spotify or what beats
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:15.040]   or whatever that's gonna be called,
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:16.400]   but I think that it doesn't mean
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:18.240]   that it wouldn't necessarily be profitable.
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:21.480]   So I think that they may be looking at it slightly differently
[00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:23.200]   than trying to be world domination.
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:25.600]   And maybe this boutique where you get all these cool things
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:27.680]   and it's a very small vertical,
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:29.920]   but that vertical with those artists
[00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:32.360]   is still worth probably half a billion dollars a year.
[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:33.480]   - Let's switch gears a little bit.
[00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:35.480]   What should that be do with Beats?
[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:37.840]   We're getting close, I think sometime this year,
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:40.480]   iOS 8.4 will come out, right?
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:43.920]   That'll be the Beats version of iOS.
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:46.800]   What's gonna make Beats steel,
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:48.400]   which they have to do to succeed, right?
[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:50.080]   Or maybe not, steel clients,
[00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:52.600]   steel customers from Spotify and Pandora.
[00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:54.120]   Do they have to do that?
[00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:55.120]   - I think they'll do exclusives.
[00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:56.400]   I mean, I think that'll be one of the big things
[00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:57.240]   that they'll do.
[00:51:57.240 --> 00:51:59.000]   - This might make it tough now.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.560]   This takes out a group of people that they probably--
[00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:03.920]   - My Taylor Swift is untitled by the way.
[00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:05.200]   Is this signatory?
[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:06.040]   I found out.
[00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:07.720]   The title of the chair have told me.
[00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:10.560]   So if title sweeps up all the exclusives,
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:12.600]   that's gonna put Apple in a tough position.
[00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:13.760]   - Unless they buy them.
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:15.280]   - Yeah, maybe they will.
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:17.400]   - Yeah, but I think it does make it more difficult.
[00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:19.280]   I think that Jay Z may have decided,
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:21.160]   I mean, the reason that I think that the timing
[00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:22.920]   is interesting for title as compared to being
[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:26.280]   a purchase option for Apple is that it happened
[00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:27.880]   right after Beats.
[00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:28.840]   I believe it happened.
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:33.280]   He bought title right after the Beats acquisition.
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:34.720]   It was like very, very close.
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:37.160]   Like someone was doing the math.
[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:38.880]   He said he'd been working on it for a long time,
[00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:41.840]   but it seemed like it moved very quickly
[00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:43.720]   right around that period of time.
[00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:48.200]   So, but yeah, 'cause it could be very profitable
[00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:49.120]   for everyone involved.
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:51.280]   That whole group, it would be very profitable
[00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:53.040]   if Apple bought them for $2 billion
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:55.320]   after them all just signing something,
[00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:58.000]   which is that could be a possibility as well.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.720]   - Yeah, I think that all Apple needs to do
[00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:04.440]   to make Beats succeed is to have it pre-installed
[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:07.000]   on every iOS device that they ship,
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:08.040]   which is gonna happen.
[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:12.200]   We belittle how big a feature the idea
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:15.640]   of not having to pick something is to most consumers.
[00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:18.640]   And which is not to say that the Beats is gonna be better
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:19.880]   than Spotify or anything else,
[00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:22.080]   but if you have something that out of the box,
[00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:23.680]   this has a subscription music service
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:25.740]   that you will almost certainly try out
[00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:27.200]   for the first 30 days.
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:28.920]   So long as it's not terrible,
[00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:32.040]   and so long as there isn't a huge signature feature
[00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:33.720]   that Spotify can challenge it with,
[00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:37.240]   I think that that's gonna just by default sign up most,
[00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:40.760]   excuse me, not most, but a big enough chunk of iOS users
[00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:43.080]   that to make this a significant thing for them.
[00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:44.960]   - Google Maps is better than Apple Maps,
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:48.800]   but 60 some percent of the users still use Apple Maps.
[00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:50.720]   Because it's what's built into the system.
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:51.840]   - Right, they just don't know.
[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:53.600]   I have to say, I mean, you're kind of thinking
[00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:55.640]   about how I use audio.
[00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:59.960]   There are a few niggles about it here and there,
[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:02.960]   but basically it's one of those situations
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:07.280]   where it's a very simple solution in a lot of ways.
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:10.680]   It's not looking for bells and whistles for most people.
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:13.400]   So I think Andy's right that it's just,
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:16.440]   it's all about getting out there in front of people
[00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:19.520]   and being really, really easy to try.
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:21.080]   - The more I think about it, Alex,
[00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:22.720]   the more I think you're right,
[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:25.760]   that this whole title thing is a play to get bought.
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:29.320]   And to create a bidding war between Facebook,
[00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:31.000]   Microsoft and Apple,
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:34.560]   get it up to half a billion and then get out.
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:38.560]   - And that would basically be JZ leveraging
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:40.520]   50-60 million into a billion dollars,
[00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:41.720]   probably of his value.
[00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:43.920]   And that's not a bad business move.
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:46.440]   He'll do it 20X in a year.
[00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:48.120]   - That's a great pitch, Minto.
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:49.400]   As old as a tell Tim Cook that,
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:51.120]   hey, you know what Madonna could be dry-humping
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:52.560]   a table on the Apple campus.
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:54.800]   (laughing)
[00:54:54.800 --> 00:55:02.400]   - Is it too late or is it so easy to switch that,
[00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:05.640]   see I feel some loyalty to the system that I'm using.
[00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:07.680]   I used to use Spotify and I switched to Google Music,
[00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:11.680]   but so for those of you like Adam and you use RDO
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:15.400]   and Alex use Spotify, is it too late?
[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:16.800]   - Well, here's thing for me,
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:19.960]   I think for me it would be importing my playlist
[00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:21.360]   would be important to finding some way
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:22.200]   that you're gonna be able to play.
[00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:23.880]   - That's probably easy, right?
[00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:25.160]   - Yeah, I don't think that's gonna be too hard
[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:27.120]   'cause I think it's kind of web-based at the moment.
[00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:29.920]   But I think that it would be getting my playlist,
[00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:31.880]   knowing that that's gonna be easy to get into,
[00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:33.080]   into beats would be important
[00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:35.080]   'cause that would be a significant thing
[00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:35.920]   that would keep me from being able to.
[00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:37.680]   - That would be the only friction really.
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:39.200]   How about you Adam?
[00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:40.520]   - Well, see, I'm different.
[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:43.080]   I don't actually make any playlists at all.
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:46.880]   And what I do is I mark things as favorites
[00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:48.520]   and then I can play what do they call it?
[00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:49.360]   - Oh, what do they call it?
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:51.720]   - Adam FM, so that it plays just my entire,
[00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:53.880]   randomizes from my entire set of favorites.
[00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:57.000]   And so that actually would be very hard to replicate
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:58.920]   because I would have to just go through the list and say,
[00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:01.200]   "Oh, look, here's this random artist who I've never heard
[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:03.280]   of before, who's music I liked when I followed
[00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:05.960]   the little trail of is like so-and-so."
[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:10.200]   And then go through and like them again or whatever on beats,
[00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:11.400]   however they do that.
[00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:12.440]   - That's a good point.
[00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:13.800]   That would be tough.
[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:14.840]   And I've actually thought about that
[00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:18.160]   if there's sort of any way to export that concept of,
[00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:22.400]   what is my collection of music look like?
[00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:23.520]   - Well, if you're smart, Artio,
[00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:25.200]   you should immediately start pushing the idea
[00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:29.280]   that you curate and customize based on your listening habits
[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:31.200]   and that the more you listen,
[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:33.840]   the better we get something like that.
[00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:37.000]   Pandora has also a similar thing
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.520]   because if you've created Pandora stations,
[00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:40.120]   I have dozens.
[00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:42.680]   You probably won't be able to import those.
[00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:43.720]   - Well, and those are often,
[00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:45.400]   I mean, unless the Pandora stations you've created are--
[00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:46.720]   - They're artist focused, I know.
[00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:47.800]   - Well, right, that's just it.
[00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:50.080]   So it's like, "Oh, this is the JZ station."
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:51.520]   - Yeah, but you curate it with thumbs up,
[00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:52.560]   thumbs down of repurability.
[00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:54.560]   - Well, and see, here's an interesting question.
[00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:57.440]   The thumbs up, thumbs down stuff is actually pretty subtle
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:57:00.400]   and like I had to look into this in Artio recently
[00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:04.360]   because what Artio does is that thumbs up says,
[00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:06.360]   "Play me more like this."
[00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:09.920]   Thumbs down says, "Never play this particular song
[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:12.480]   "again," which seems to me to be wrong
[00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:14.040]   because if I put this in a favor,
[00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:17.400]   I'm just not feeling like listening to that song right now
[00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:18.600]   or in this context,
[00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:20.200]   thumbs down is totally the wrong thing to do.
[00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:22.200]   Turns out skip is the right thing to do there,
[00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:24.040]   but this is stuff that you don't know.
[00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:26.880]   And so what I would like to have is like to be able to curate,
[00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:28.920]   as you say, a station where I could say,
[00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:30.720]   "Yeah, it is my JZ station."
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:34.000]   I wouldn't because I actually have no idea who JZ is.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.600]   But I like the JZ songs, but look,
[00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:38.600]   I said I favor this album, but this one song,
[00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:42.160]   not feeling it today, so don't play stuff like this today.
[00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:44.000]   But reset it maybe in part for my next session
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:45.640]   or something like that.
[00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:47.120]   There's a lot of possibilities there
[00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:50.640]   that become tricky to work through appropriately
[00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:51.640]   for different people.
[00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:52.960]   - Here's an interesting blog post,
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:54.760]   Sam Mateo and our chatroom pass this along
[00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:57.160]   from the music industry blog,
[00:57:57.160 --> 00:57:59.640]   says that really title,
[00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:02.880]   the idea is to become Netflix for music.
[00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:07.320]   It's a next generation label.
[00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:09.320]   In fact, and he makes a good point,
[00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:12.760]   if you created title originals as Netflix has created,
[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:15.240]   Netflix originals from these big artists
[00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:19.040]   or signing new artists, if a few of them became hot,
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:21.300]   man, you could have something of value there.
[00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:26.880]   Title is creating an aspirational premium streaming brand.
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:29.240]   - It's title edition, it's gonna be cool.
[00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:30.080]   (laughing)
[00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:32.560]   - It wants to be the HBO of streaming music.
[00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:36.680]   It's an exclusive first streaming release window for artists.
[00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:39.760]   - That would be great,
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:41.840]   'cause then I could ignore them entirely.
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:44.680]   - Yeah, those artists, I don't really, yeah.
[00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:46.880]   - Just don't need that.
[00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:49.800]   Then again, I don't, I find Netflix watching TV shows
[00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:51.760]   on Netflix three years later to be great too.
[00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:57.100]   - 80% of subscription fees go back to rights owners.
[00:58:57.100 --> 00:59:00.960]   But doubling the subscription price
[00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:02.720]   only means artists are getting paid
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:05.280]   in double cent increments rather than single cents.
[00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:06.120]   It's a good point.
[00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:08.440]   I don't know who writes this,
[00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:12.040]   but the music industry blog with a counter example.
[00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:15.640]   I actually feel like there's a chance for beats
[00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:18.880]   because I, first of all, it's gonna be on all my devices,
[00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:22.320]   my iDevices, and I'm kind of thinking,
[00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:23.680]   maybe I should try it out.
[00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:26.800]   So maybe there's a shot,
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:28.440]   I mean, there will be a window of opportunity,
[00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:29.280]   wouldn't there be?
[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:30.640]   - But aren't you using Android phones?
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:32.480]   I mean, what if it's not on the phone
[00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:33.480]   or it's not in your car or--
[00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:35.040]   - If Apple makes it only iOS,
[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:36.160]   you're gonna have a problem, right?
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:39.000]   - Right, and let's face it, will they do that?
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.360]   - Well, there's a beats Android app now.
[00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:42.840]   - There is, precisely, there is now,
[00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:44.240]   but would they keep that going?
[00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:45.840]   I mean, they certainly don't seem to have been pushing
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:49.560]   the windows development side of their other apps as much.
[00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:50.400]   - Interesting.
[00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:53.640]   I think it'll be interesting to see how they use curation,
[00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:57.000]   and see what curation means to them,
[00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:58.480]   as they start to move that forward,
[00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:00.920]   because I think that there's still a real,
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:03.840]   I think there's an opportunity to somehow find a way
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:06.000]   to enumerate the curators.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.360]   You know, like, I'm sure that they're actually
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:08.200]   getting some small percentage.
[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:09.480]   - They could have these, they could,
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:12.280]   they could call them like jockeys or something.
[01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:13.680]   There's a word with jockey in it,
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:16.000]   somewhere I'm sure we could use.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.560]   - Well, but I think that, I think the thing is,
[01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:19.720]   is that there's definitely,
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:22.160]   there's definitely tastemakers that I think that,
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.800]   but what we need to do is figure out a way
[01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:26.160]   that they're actually making a little bit of money too,
[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:28.000]   on the fact that they're building a following.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.640]   You know, so, you know, if you look at it again,
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:31.560]   I think I've said this before in a show,
[01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:35.760]   but like a guy like Mike Holleran from 91x in San Diego,
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:38.120]   is, you know, all of us, when I was a music director,
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:39.640]   all of us just watched what he did.
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:40.640]   You know, and the thing is,
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:42.320]   as I would listen to any playlist he built,
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:44.360]   because it'd be the perfect, you know,
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:47.280]   slightly to the, you know, alternative,
[01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:50.200]   but still somewhat mainstream, you know, playlist.
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:54.160]   You know, and he's had 25 years to develop that skill,
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:56.040]   you know, and our 30 years to develop that skill.
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:57.600]   And I think that there's certain people that,
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:59.040]   but the thing is, he's on the air,
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:00.120]   or other people that are on the air.
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:02.800]   I think of all these DJs that people like to listen to,
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:05.040]   who might have some control over their programming,
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:06.640]   which only happens every once in a while now.
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:09.920]   - Apple did hire a BBC Radio One DJ, right?
[01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:11.200]   - Right, so the idea is,
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:13.280]   - So they have that idea.
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:15.480]   - Yeah, so finding the right people on the right vertical
[01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:18.040]   is a great person that can curate jazz,
[01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:19.120]   and they'd probably go after,
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:20.960]   probably guys in Sirius,
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:23.600]   and, you know, 'cause they have a lot more control as well,
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:25.120]   over those things, so that you could listen
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:27.520]   to that DJ's choices.
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:28.600]   I think that could be interesting,
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:30.960]   but I do think that they were able to open it further up,
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:32.000]   not just these, you know,
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.720]   but look at ways to kind of do a, you know,
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:38.720]   grassroots, you know, there are individuals
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:39.760]   that people would start following,
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:42.240]   much like they're following people on YouTube,
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:44.560]   or Meerkat, or whatever,
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:47.200]   that are, you know, Meerkat for the moment.
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:49.480]   (laughing)
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:50.680]   - Periscope, Periscope.
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:52.240]   - Ian Thompson,
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:54.480]   - The difficulty of the rights for the register says
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:57.760]   that this guy, Zane Lowe, is exactly what you want,
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:01.160]   which is a DJ who discovers new stuff,
[01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:03.400]   people trust his curation,
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:06.040]   and he was very encouraged by the fact
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:09.360]   that Apple's hired Zane Lowe, the BBC Radio 1 DJ.
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:10.640]   That's the kind of person you need.
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:12.440]   - Well, it's like a, it's like a,
[01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:15.280]   it's like a, you remember Rock Over The One thing,
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:17.000]   it was like Ram Dean, you know?
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.240]   - Go ahead, Andy.
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:19.680]   - No, not just that, but I mean,
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:21.360]   just the idea that,
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:25.200]   if they really just leveraged their song catalog,
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:27.600]   simply as raw material that could be expressed,
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:31.560]   in any way that anybody with any sort of an agenda
[01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:34.080]   can then promote, that's, I think, the key to success.
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:34.960]   I mean, I was listening to,
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:37.720]   first time I listened to RDO in a long time,
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:41.640]   I realized that the cast members of the TV show Archer
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:45.400]   had created an RDO station in which the actors themselves
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:48.680]   and the characters they portray are recommending songs
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:50.240]   and introducing them on RDO,
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:52.320]   and that brought me into RDO.
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:54.080]   And that's not something that's probably
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:57.560]   would have been conceived when they're setting up Spotify.
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:02:59.600]   Just like curation, as Alex says,
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:01.200]   if you have someone that you absolutely trust,
[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:03.640]   if there's someone who's taste I really, really like,
[01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:05.160]   and they tweet out a link to a book,
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:06.560]   I'm not necessarily buying that book,
[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:07.800]   but I'm definitely gonna check out
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:09.920]   why he or she is recommending it.
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:11.440]   The only real limitation though,
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:14.960]   is if the actual creators are only making a penny,
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:17.320]   you know, per play, how much money is left
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:19.480]   for someone who is assisting in the curation?
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:20.800]   Like if there's someone,
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:22.160]   this works great for YouTube,
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:25.440]   where you can just create a YouTube channel
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:26.560]   of just gameplay videos
[01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:28.720]   and just keep creating immense amounts of content
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:31.000]   every single day and make a really good living that way.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.800]   But that's because all that stuff is supported
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:36.680]   by an outside source of money, namely the advertising.
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:38.760]   So it's a complex metric.
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:39.880]   - So here's an interesting thought.
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:43.040]   What if anyone could be, you know,
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:45.840]   a playlist jockey as it were,
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:48.120]   and it would be, you know,
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:50.200]   in essence, a competitive situation
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:52.320]   where the better your playlists were,
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:53.760]   the more people subscribed to them,
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:54.800]   the more you'd earn,
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:57.600]   and the more, you know, presumably you'd rise in the ranking
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:59.640]   so that it was in essence a crowd sourcing thing.
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:03.120]   So you could also find the people who thought like you
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:04.040]   in terms of--
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:05.520]   - Well, I mean, you basically,
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:08.240]   if you just took 5% of the, you know,
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:10.120]   let's say 5% of the total pot
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:12.840]   and then split it on among the people making playlists,
[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:15.400]   basically the person who's got the highest percentage
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:17.000]   of those playlists is making the highest percentage,
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.080]   you know, whatever percentage of the total play--
[01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:19.920]   - Precisely.
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:20.760]   - the players are being played,
[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:22.080]   that they're in a playlist,
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:23.200]   they're getting that percentage.
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:24.800]   - And that would be easy.
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:26.760]   - It doesn't necessarily need to be one of those things
[01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:28.240]   where you can make a mint at this,
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:29.080]   it may just be what,
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:29.920]   'cause I mean, let's face it,
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:31.560]   you might just have this as your hobby,
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:34.120]   you might really like doing it after your day job,
[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:36.400]   you know, working on no SQL databases.
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:41.000]   - Hmm, there are people who for free stream Meerkat
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:41.840]   all the time,
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:44.840]   just trying to get to be number two on that Meerkat list.
[01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:45.680]   (laughing)
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:47.480]   They just, no money at all.
[01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:48.600]   - They just wanna be,
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:50.800]   have the title of I was the last person to stream,
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:53.160]   something like Meerkat before it got shut down
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:55.120]   for lack of operational funds.
[01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:57.840]   - But no, they got plenty of money, I think.
[01:04:57.840 --> 01:05:00.360]   They just got 12 million, right?
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:03.760]   So sad to say they'll be around for a while.
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:05.600]   (laughing)
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:06.440]   I shouldn't say that.
[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:07.280]   - Actually, like Meerkat,
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:08.120]   we interviewed the--
[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:08.960]   - If they're smart,
[01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:11.080]   they're not buying a lot of ping pong tables
[01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:12.320]   or air on chairs.
[01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:13.160]   - They are smart.
[01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:13.800]   We interviewed Ben Rubin,
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:16.600]   who started Meerkat on triangulation on money,
[01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:18.720]   and I was impressed by how smart he was.
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:20.960]   And Meerkat was an experiment,
[01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:22.240]   so it's kind of an interesting story.
[01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:24.360]   He had, they had created it before,
[01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:26.960]   they had created a company called Yevo,
[01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:28.360]   which did live streaming,
[01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:30.640]   and it wasn't getting traction.
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:32.560]   So they decided, as a group,
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:33.400]   they laid off people,
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:34.640]   so they had more runway,
[01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:35.800]   and they decided as a group,
[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:37.240]   we're just gonna try different things
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:38.320]   to see what works.
[01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:39.800]   We're gonna experiment,
[01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:41.240]   to see what works in this space,
[01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:42.080]   and it just happened.
[01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:43.720]   The first experiment was Meerkat,
[01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:44.640]   and it did hit.
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:48.480]   But it may have hit temporarily,
[01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:49.760]   but that doesn't matter.
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:51.080]   - Well, and let's face it,
[01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:52.520]   I mean, the temporary part,
[01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:55.120]   maybe because Twitter cut them off at the knees.
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:55.960]   - Well, he said,
[01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:56.800]   and I agree with him,
[01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:58.360]   it doesn't, it's not great,
[01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:00.920]   but not having the knowledge graph doesn't,
[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:01.880]   you still can tweet,
[01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:03.280]   you can still all of that stuff.
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:04.120]   And he also said,
[01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:05.960]   and by the way, there's also Facebook and Google,
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:08.840]   there's lots of other places you can use social media.
[01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:10.640]   And, you know, Periscope,
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:11.480]   is that what you mean?
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:12.760]   Maybe just releasing Periscope
[01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:14.000]   might've cut them off at the knees.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.640]   - Well, more, more that Twitter,
[01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:17.320]   Twitter, they're accessed to the social graph.
[01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:18.160]   - They're so, the knowledge graph.
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:20.080]   - And then releases Periscope,
[01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:21.600]   which, you know, I don't think,
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:22.880]   I don't think Twitter, you know,
[01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:25.080]   sort of released Periscope to kill Miracat specifically,
[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:26.520]   I think they were in parallel.
[01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:27.600]   But at the same time,
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:29.080]   they're cutting off the social graph
[01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:30.760]   right before releasing Periscope
[01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:32.760]   does feel a little underhanded.
[01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:33.600]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:35.440]   - Well, and it definitely felt like,
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:36.560]   Miracat was,
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:38.520]   Twitter was kind of moving at its own pace,
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:41.560]   and Miracat was suddenly getting ahead of that pace
[01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:43.920]   that they were trying to work out with Periscope.
[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:44.760]   So they kind of,
[01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:46.680]   it just felt like they kind of wanted to slow them down
[01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:50.080]   before they lost, you know, positive control of that.
[01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:51.000]   You know, that's what it felt like.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.640]   And I think that the problem with all of these,
[01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:54.360]   I mean, well, the problem with Miracat specifically was
[01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:57.120]   that you already had Twitter who had already,
[01:06:57.120 --> 01:07:00.480]   I guess, reportedly spent $100 million on Periscope.
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:01.320]   - Right.
[01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:03.360]   - And then you have, I mean, Facebook could build this
[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:07.280]   in a heartbeat, you know, to do this.
[01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:08.920]   And so there's not, you know,
[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:11.440]   it's just hard to know what would be really unique
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:13.600]   other than being able to build an audience very quickly,
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:14.720]   which Miracat was starting at,
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:18.160]   but I don't think, I actually think that I looked at it,
[01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:19.520]   kind of, I didn't know how successful it'd be,
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:21.760]   mostly because I was being successful at it.
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:22.600]   - Right.
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:23.440]   - And I wasn't doing very much.
[01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:24.280]   I wasn't doing very much.
[01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:25.440]   I was like, you know, I was in Rwanda,
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:26.840]   putting it on the dashboard of my car,
[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:28.760]   and I was in number eight for a while, you know?
[01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:30.880]   And I was like, and I kept on waiting for other people,
[01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.320]   you know, a whole bunch of other people to come up,
[01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:33.920]   but then it just didn't feel like there was that many.
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:36.160]   - Was it last week that we made that our app,
[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:38.080]   oh no, it was two weeks ago.
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:40.720]   - It was the Apple event, three weeks ago.
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:41.560]   - Or three weeks ago.
[01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:43.880]   - We were all mirror-cating each other.
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:44.720]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:45.960]   I have time flies.
[01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:48.480]   (laughing)
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:50.440]   - You saw the boy genius.
[01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:54.000]   You saw the article in boy genius report talking about
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.560]   how really it's the tech journalists
[01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:58.560]   that made Miracat a hit,
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:00.440]   and there really is nothing there.
[01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:01.720]   Nobody uses it.
[01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:04.800]   Miracat, what did they say?
[01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:05.640]   Oh, I gotta find it,
[01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:07.080]   because it was a great headline.
[01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:10.960]   I read it earlier, but now I have lost it here.
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:11.880]   - There it is.
[01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:14.800]   - Miracat is dying, and it's taking US tech journalism
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:15.640]   with it.
[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:16.480]   - Okay, okay.
[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:18.960]   (laughing)
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:21.600]   - I've written obviously by a guy outside the US.
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:24.720]   (laughing)
[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:26.640]   A tech journalist outside the US.
[01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:28.480]   - I don't know.
[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:30.360]   - Yeah, I don't know that's exactly fair.
[01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:33.080]   I mean, our job is sometimes too,
[01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:35.440]   I would agree if someone was saying, oh, we're not picking
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:36.280]   the series.
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:38.640]   - Well, no, again, if you're saying that, oh, my goodness,
[01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:41.680]   Miracat is gonna be a disruptive force,
[01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:45.200]   and 'cause Apple doesn't have a streaming service there doomed.
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:46.560]   As opposed to, hey, this is kinda cool.
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:48.840]   Hey, look, it's really easy, and hey, look,
[01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:51.320]   I'm in a car, and here's me driving my car
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:52.560]   with this app.
[01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:54.400]   - I don't feel like our job is to pick winners.
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:55.640]   It's something just to talk about.
[01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:56.480]   - Exactly, right.
[01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:58.040]   - That's something that I get very tired of.
[01:08:58.040 --> 01:08:58.880]   - Yeah.
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:02.080]   - And also, we actually wrote about Miracat in tidbits
[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:05.680]   one week, and then almost immediately periscope comes out.
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:07.160]   And as Josh centers,
[01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:10.680]   who is doing the articles, said that periscopes big win
[01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:13.240]   in some ways was that it launches on the day
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:15.520]   that there's that horrible explosion in New York City.
[01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:17.960]   And so he's actually seeing footage of this
[01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:20.520]   before any news crews are on the ground.
[01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:22.520]   That's sort of showing the promise
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:24.480]   of some of these kinds of things.
[01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:27.080]   - You know, it showed the promise and also the failure
[01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:31.400]   because I was watching, I think it was Mashable's stream,
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:33.920]   and the entire thing that it was the entire stream
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:35.440]   and I wanted it for like 20 minutes was,
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:37.320]   okay, I'm on the roof of our building.
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:39.320]   And there's a, wow, something that's,
[01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:41.800]   I see a big plume of smoke and it's,
[01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:43.800]   I see a lot of news. - You just do, yes.
[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:45.800]   - And of course, you can see like the chat
[01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:49.240]   from other people and the person who's on site,
[01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:50.600]   so to speak, and she always said,
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:52.920]   well, I don't know whether it was like an explosion
[01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:54.800]   or a fire and in response to the pills,
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:56.320]   oh, well, CNBC is reporting this.
[01:09:56.320 --> 01:10:00.840]   So, well, actually I was on CNN and CNN is reporting this.
[01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:03.400]   Like, so there's a difference between like being there
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:04.400]   with an active camera
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:07.400]   and actually having the ability to do reporting.
[01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:09.720]   - I will say though. - They're both valuable,
[01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:11.560]   but it's like, okay, let's not say
[01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:13.680]   that this is killing actual journalism.
[01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:14.920]   It's a kill for journalism.
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:16.560]   You still have to bring journalism to it.
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:18.400]   - I think there also is one of those things
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:20.960]   where this is the speeding up of the journalistic world.
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:23.320]   And in fact, when Josh told me about it,
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:25.120]   I did a Google News search to find out
[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:26.280]   what the hell he was talking about.
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:27.960]   I was like, the explosion in New York City,
[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:29.960]   I was just like terrorists or something.
[01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:34.360]   And there was, I found one Google News article
[01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:37.040]   about it, about eight down.
[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:40.720]   That that was how little it was covered at that point in time.
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:42.640]   And yet he was seeing video of that.
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:45.920]   So in fact, Mashable was coming in late
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:49.280]   when the stuff that he was seeing was really right on the spot.
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:50.560]   I was actually shocked that there were people
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:52.520]   who had downloaded this app already,
[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:54.440]   'cause it had just launched that day.
[01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:57.040]   So again, not that this is gonna solve everything,
[01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:58.720]   but I think that you wanna talk about
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:02.440]   the Rodney King videos, they're gonna show up on Periscope.
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:04.120]   And people are gonna be doing this stuff.
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:07.400]   They're just gonna hit that record button and stream it live.
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:09.240]   - I'm glad it's out there.
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:12.000]   I just hope that we're smart enough as a society
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.640]   to understand that here is live video stream
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:16.760]   without any reporting behind it,
[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:19.800]   as opposed to, no, this was somebody decided
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:22.160]   to deep fry a turkey and it's not that,
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:25.040]   please don't start canceling flights to places
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:26.440]   because someone didn't understand that
[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:28.040]   you shouldn't do this on a roof deck.
[01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:29.560]   (laughs)
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:31.720]   - Well, because you can't save meerkats,
[01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:34.440]   they feel like, or Periscopes after 24 hours.
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:38.200]   - Both of them can be saved to your local device.
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:40.320]   - Right, and so I guess you could repost it.
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:42.120]   Although the saving in Meerkat, maybe they fixed it,
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:43.640]   was all wonky.
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:47.280]   - God help if they have to store everything.
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:48.800]   - No, I think that was a smart move.
[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:51.720]   Why waste money on storing and forwarding it?
[01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:54.400]   And I think it appealed to certain category people
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:57.440]   like the Snapchat stuff does that, well, it's ephemeral.
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:01.520]   So I'm willing to do stuff like look at my refrigerator.
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:03.960]   - Well, I think also for me, when I was experimenting with it,
[01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:07.120]   I think that I do a lot of production that's live.
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:11.000]   And, but every time I decide I wanna do a live stream,
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.120]   in my head is I'm thinking about the record
[01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:15.040]   and I'm thinking about the quality and everything else
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:16.000]   with Meerkat, I was like,
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.160]   I'm just gonna turn my phone on.
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:18.440]   I'm not even recording this.
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:20.280]   You know, like I'm just gonna like just experience
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:21.600]   that moment, you know, on it.
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:23.360]   And I kind of like the fact that I couldn't record.
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:25.600]   And with Periscope, I haven't even turned it on yet
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:26.800]   'cause I'm like, oh, it's gonna record.
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:27.880]   And then I have to figure out what I'm gonna do
[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:28.720]   with the record.
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:31.040]   And I'm not sure if I really want it.
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:32.360]   (laughing)
[01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:34.640]   - I tried Periscope, I tried Periscope
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:36.080]   the day it came out also.
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:37.680]   I was at Cornell's Dragon Day,
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:39.680]   where the architecture students built a huge dragon
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:40.960]   and parade around campus.
[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:43.920]   And it was actually one of those things where it was,
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:46.320]   I was struck at how hard it was actually
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:47.720]   because it's not one of those events
[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:49.400]   that things are necessarily happening
[01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:50.800]   when you think they're happening.
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:52.200]   So you kind of point your phone at it
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:54.640]   and you're sitting there going, okay, we could,
[01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:55.760]   something could go on now.
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:57.720]   We're all just standing here, you know,
[01:12:57.720 --> 01:12:58.600]   but I don't wanna stop it
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:00.520]   because then something's gonna happen as soon as I stop it.
[01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:02.800]   And, you know, so it wasn't very exciting
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:04.640]   until, you know, four minutes later
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:06.040]   when they actually a dragon started moving.
[01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:06.880]   So.
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:07.720]   (sniffing)
[01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:09.040]   - Right.
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:10.400]   Very interesting.
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:12.280]   It's a very valuable thing, this thing called editing.
[01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:14.160]   Compressing time editing.
[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:15.440]   (laughing)
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:16.960]   (sniffing)
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:18.320]   Ah, sigh.
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:20.160]   (laughing)
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:21.560]   - Let's see, anything else?
[01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:24.440]   Oh, let's talk about Comcast, Apple.
[01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:28.840]   Comcast, I'm sorry, NBC Universal,
[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:30.520]   also known as cable town.
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:32.880]   - Sure, hard work, nothing, consider it.
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:35.880]   - NBC, we even mentioned this,
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:40.880]   is was apparently not in the rumored part of the deal
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:45.040]   that Apple was making with television providers.
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:51.440]   The FCC, of course, is examining Comcast's
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:54.040]   Time Warner acquisition.
[01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:56.640]   And there's a filing from a company
[01:13:56.640 --> 01:14:01.240]   or a group, a coalition called StopmegaComcast
[01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:03.760]   that said, quote, "Comcast may be withholding
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:06.720]   affiliated NBC Universal content
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:08.080]   in an effort to thwart the entry
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:10.280]   of potential new video competitors
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:12.400]   citing that Wall Street Journal report that we cited
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:14.320]   that said Apple wasn't talking to NBC
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:17.120]   because of a quote falling out between Apple and NBC,
[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:18.880]   parent company Comcast.
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:21.400]   So Comcast responds saying,
[01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:24.440]   "Hey, Apple never even approached us.
[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:27.600]   It's not that we're not talking to them, they never asked."
[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:29.440]   - You know, I've called Comcast before
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:30.880]   and it takes so long,
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:33.360]   they've got to go through the Philippines.
[01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:34.200]   You know--
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:35.520]   - It might be called, that's what happened.
[01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:38.480]   Apple called them, but the call just got lost.
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:39.880]   - Somewhere.
[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:41.520]   - I am helping you in the front.
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:43.000]   - Yeah, I know, it's not,
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.960]   who knows what's really?
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:47.840]   - I think the easiest way to get some adoption
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:49.760]   in a lot of these things, especially for Apple,
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:52.200]   you know, I think they may not trust Comcast
[01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:54.560]   to be able to be quiet, to not be able to, you know,
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:56.080]   not see it as a competition.
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:58.200]   So, you know, Comcast in general might keep Apple
[01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:00.960]   from talking to NBC just because they don't wanna let
[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:03.480]   the cat out of the bag, but I also think that, you know,
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:06.240]   the typical way to get that Apple in the past has done this
[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:10.080]   is you get early adopters and then you beat the late adopters
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:11.200]   with the early adopters.
[01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:12.040]   - Right, right.
[01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:13.360]   - You know, and I think--
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:14.960]   - Adam, you've been reporting for years
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:16.640]   that Apple was talking with first Comcast,
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:19.040]   then with Time Warner, I mean, that Apple's really
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:21.520]   been trying to get Comcast to come to the table.
[01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:23.840]   Maybe not about this specifically,
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:25.680]   but maybe they just gave through up their hands
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:26.520]   instead of having a time of the--
[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:28.680]   - I think originally '90s.
[01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:30.120]   - Yeah, I think originally Apple had been trying
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:33.600]   to get cable just to pass through to the Apple TV
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:36.440]   or to some device, and I think that was shot down
[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:37.280]   pretty quickly. - Right, yeah.
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:38.880]   - And so I think that this is,
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:40.440]   they're at now they're doing something different,
[01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:43.960]   which they may have decided that Comcast isn't worth talking to.
[01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:45.960]   - Yeah, but also there's an argument to be made
[01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:49.600]   that maybe Apple isn't worth Comcast or Verizon's
[01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:51.520]   or any of these other cable providers' time.
[01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:55.400]   If Apple, if the rumors that Apple's gonna open up
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:57.280]   the platform, the Apple TV platform
[01:15:57.280 --> 01:15:59.800]   to third party apps is true, why bother?
[01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:01.920]   Why not just simply use that as a way
[01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:03.120]   to leverage your Fios customer?
[01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:03.960]   And guess what?
[01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:07.360]   We now you can get the Apple TV Fios app
[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:09.200]   and get every single channel you subscribe to
[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:10.680]   so long as you're on your home network,
[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:14.160]   and we'll even give you access to limited remote viewing
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:15.000]   directly from Fios.
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.160]   That's what the app on the phone does,
[01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:19.360]   and it works very, very well.
[01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:21.400]   - Well, I think the other, of course, the danger on that
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:23.240]   is that, of course, the Fios may work
[01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:25.600]   and the Comcast may work, but also every network
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:28.400]   is gonna build their own app that's gonna go on to this thing.
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:30.480]   And it's going to be, the question is,
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:33.280]   do they actually need the cable company anymore?
[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:36.040]   And that could happen pretty quickly if the apps open up.
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:38.040]   - It's happening already, I think.
[01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:40.280]   - Yeah, when you've got Squirrel TV, who needs more?
[01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:41.920]   I mean, yeah.
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:44.800]   - Yeah, I mean, Roku is fascinating
[01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:46.840]   because they're the things you can get officially
[01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:49.320]   through the channel store, including third party apps,
[01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:52.920]   but then you can go to, it is an open platform.
[01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:55.120]   So long as you have a web page that has,
[01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:57.320]   here is a link to how to get this device
[01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:00.080]   and then match it onto your Roku device.
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:02.800]   There are just channels for the weirdest stuff.
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:05.760]   There are about 1.2 million religious channels.
[01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:07.760]   There is a channel for just, you know,
[01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:10.040]   Westerns in which nobody wears a hat,
[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:11.680]   because some of you have a collection of movies
[01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:13.120]   in which their Westerns are known
[01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:15.920]   and wears a hat, and hey, let's have a Roku channel for it.
[01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:18.920]   And so it's demented, but it's part of the,
[01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:20.960]   wonderful experience of having a TV
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:22.800]   that works the way you want it to.
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:25.200]   - There are, you're right, literally thousands
[01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:26.240]   of Roku channels.
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:28.320]   I used to, I think it's gone now,
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:30.320]   referred to a third party website
[01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:32.880]   that had a list of them, and it was well over 2,000 channels.
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:36.080]   - Yeah, and every time I felt myself being pulled back
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:38.280]   to my Apple TV for a certain reason,
[01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:40.360]   I totally missed their podcast app,
[01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:42.000]   'cause man, that is exactly the way
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.400]   to implement that on a TV set.
[01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:46.120]   Then I remember, oh, well, maybe it's just,
[01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:47.160]   maybe there's an app like that,
[01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:48.400]   but it's just not in the Roku store.
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:51.480]   And within 20 minutes, I found an app that was pretty much
[01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:53.360]   just as good as the Apple TV version,
[01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:55.600]   and there, another reason to switch back to Apple TV
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:56.560]   is where it went away.
[01:17:56.560 --> 01:17:58.480]   - I have to say, I'm not happy about Tivo,
[01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:01.840]   which is a clobbered podcasters in their latest update,
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:03.080]   and we're getting a lot of email.
[01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:05.760]   A lot of you watched on Tivo, I did not know that.
[01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:06.840]   I did know you could do that.
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:09.360]   I'm a Romeo Pro user myself.
[01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:11.240]   And I always thought it was a little interesting
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:14.480]   that Tivo allowed you to create season passes for podcasts
[01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:15.720]   and watch them or listen to them.
[01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:17.480]   I guess watch them.
[01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:18.920]   But they've turned that off,
[01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:21.000]   and then they have a new way of doing things,
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.720]   which apparently has broken it entirely.
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:26.320]   So if you're watching and saying, where'd it go?
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:27.560]   We know.
[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:28.680]   Wasn't us.
[01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:30.240]   Tivo did something, and we're talking to him,
[01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:31.960]   trying to convince him to go back.
[01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:36.560]   I admit it, I am a flawed human being.
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:38.840]   I wanna be the first to say this.
[01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:42.080]   I tried to wait until April 10th.
[01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:45.040]   I'm here 11 days from now to buy the new MacBook.
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:47.160]   Couldn't do it.
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:49.720]   Ended up buying a 13 inch MacBook Pro.
[01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:51.400]   Is there something wrong with me?
[01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:53.200]   Yeah.
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:55.000]   (laughing)
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.720]   I think you're capable of counting to one.
[01:18:57.720 --> 01:19:00.680]   And when you counted the number of ports,
[01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:01.520]   you said, you know what?
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:03.800]   I think I'd much rather have the new processor
[01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:05.040]   and the new Touch Force track back.
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:05.880]   Well, that's exactly.
[01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:06.720]   It's gonna be very nicely.
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:10.120]   And I felt like the 13 inch is,
[01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:13.520]   of course it's gonna be heavier and thicker,
[01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:15.520]   but it also is gonna be faster.
[01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:17.560]   More was considered less about ports,
[01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:20.480]   although that's an issue, but more about speed.
[01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:21.640]   Yeah, that's a question.
[01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:25.200]   It's a very special Mac for a very special kind of buyer.
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:27.520]   There are people for whom that extra size,
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:30.000]   that slimmed down size is really the thing
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.680]   they want most of all, and they're willing.
[01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:34.760]   And the way they use a mobile Mac is such that
[01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:36.360]   the mobility processor isn't an issue,
[01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:37.800]   and the lack of ports isn't an issue.
[01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:40.920]   It is not a Volkswagen Mac by any stretch of the imagination.
[01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:43.480]   This is why I like the new MacBook
[01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:46.160]   because it is in addition to the Mac line
[01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:48.000]   as opposed to a replacement for anything
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.920]   that already is there.
[01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:51.840]   And yet they did improve the MacBook Pro
[01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:53.240]   and I think the 13 inch.
[01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:57.000]   And I ended up putting an i7 and 16 gigs around.
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.840]   I don't know, I just felt like,
[01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:01.600]   well, if I'm not gonna go with a slow, thin light guy,
[01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:03.080]   maybe I'll just go all the other way,
[01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:04.200]   the other way completely.
[01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:05.840]   Yeah, that's a very sweet package now.
[01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:09.480]   It was always a really, really nice MacBook
[01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:10.400]   with a couple of misgivings,
[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:12.320]   but a really, really nice premium machine.
[01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:16.120]   And now, oh boy, when I got my hands on it for the first time,
[01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:18.040]   I had to remind myself, Andy,
[01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:20.200]   you just bought a new MacBook,
[01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:22.200]   last, last winter, it's still perfect.
[01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:24.280]   You haven't even spilled anything into the keyboard yet.
[01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:26.640]   I know this isn't a reason for you to spill something
[01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:28.960]   into the keyboard, it's a perfectly good MacBook you own.
[01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:30.760]   Well, this is a mid to the one I'm using,
[01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:33.160]   just so you know, mid 2012.
[01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:35.680]   So I held off three years.
[01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:38.160]   I know, I mean, you probably should hold off four or five
[01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:41.120]   'cause it's perfectly good, but it's a 15.
[01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:43.800]   And some idiot has put comic book keycaps on the thing
[01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:45.680]   and I can't figure out how to use it.
[01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:49.760]   So, that idiot being me, you saw.
[01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:50.960]   It's a good reason, yeah.
[01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:53.360]   It's all messed up, it's got Punisher
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:55.440]   where the P should be and stuff like that.
[01:20:55.440 --> 01:20:58.440]   I could just peel it.
[01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:00.680]   Running anti-virus, I had to throw that right away.
[01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:01.680]   I'd buy two more.
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:02.680]   (laughs)
[01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:05.360]   Anyway, it's supposed to come later this week.
[01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:07.040]   I'll have it for next week's Mac Break Weekly.
[01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:07.880]   We'll do a little review.
[01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:10.240]   And I'm actually very interested in the trackpad,
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:12.120]   the force trackpad.
[01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:13.120]   - Have you tried it yet?
[01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:14.240]   - No.
[01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:16.640]   You haven't, oh my God, it is amazing.
[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:19.160]   So you went over to the Apple store just to see, yeah.
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:20.760]   - Yeah, I made a special trip out only
[01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:22.240]   just to check out the trackpad.
[01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:25.840]   And I had, I checked it out, then I went back home
[01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:28.600]   and I had a conversation with some people I know at Apple
[01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:32.040]   that was one of these really stupid conversations
[01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:34.800]   I often have to have to make sure I understand something
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:37.200]   where I had to ask four times in a row,
[01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:40.160]   there is not a mechanical button underneath this trackpad.
[01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:44.200]   No, but there isn't even like some foam
[01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:46.920]   between the glass and the body so I can feel us in some,
[01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:48.680]   no, like so there is absolutely,
[01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:51.480]   so if I were to unplug this thing,
[01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:54.880]   spin down the battery completely and then press down,
[01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:57.440]   I would not feel any mechanical situation,
[01:21:57.440 --> 01:21:58.840]   no, that's absolutely correct.
[01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:00.840]   And only when I asked those three questions
[01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:03.760]   was I willing to believe there was nothing mechanical
[01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:04.720]   in that trackpad.
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:06.640]   It was just, you're gonna like it.
[01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:09.600]   It's good, your book 90 minutes of your day
[01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:11.360]   to just like pressing it then.
[01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:12.440]   (laughing)
[01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:15.600]   - Wow, well, I can hear a, I can feel a half press
[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:17.840]   and now I can feel a full press, oh my God,
[01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:20.480]   cancel lunch, I gotta do this for more.
[01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:22.920]   - So Andy, I got a question for you.
[01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:27.920]   Why, which actions are force click actions and why?
[01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:31.040]   How do they distinguish between, what, I mean,
[01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:34.080]   what is the logical difference between a force click action
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:37.680]   and a right click action or a control click action?
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:40.880]   What do you mean for enhanced, for what they got right now,
[01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:43.600]   the only stuff that I've seen that actually works is
[01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:45.640]   like a fast forward button that says no,
[01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:48.280]   go really fast forward as opposed to just--
[01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:50.680]   - There's stuff like look up in dictionary or, you know,
[01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:52.800]   you force click on a address and it pops up.
[01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:55.960]   But I'm trying to figure out, from the usability standpoint,
[01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:59.240]   what distinguishes those from just what you'd pick up
[01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:01.040]   from a control, from a control click?
[01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:02.440]   And that's what I don't understand yet.
[01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:05.120]   I haven't, I mean, I haven't tried one personally yet either.
[01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:06.800]   - It's a brand new language
[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:09.960]   and people are gonna figure out how to express that language.
[01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:12.000]   I can think of different ways that I would use it
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.880]   for instance on a watch or on a multi-touch display.
[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:17.640]   I would love to see if this is a feature of the next iPhone.
[01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:21.320]   I'd love to see iOS have the ability to have sort
[01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:25.280]   of a contextual click, meaning that if I simply rest my finger
[01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:29.200]   on the screen on top of control, I'll get a little bubble
[01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:30.560]   that says here's what this button does
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:34.080]   and it will understand that I have not actually pressed it down yet.
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:36.520]   If the answer is we don't know yet, it's gonna--
[01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:41.200]   But the mere fact that they've managed to,
[01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:43.080]   they've done away with the clicky button,
[01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:44.600]   which I really, really liked,
[01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:46.200]   while leaving behind the thing I liked
[01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:47.200]   about having a clicky button,
[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:50.240]   which is the ability to actually have tactile feedback
[01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:51.400]   that I've pressed something.
[01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:55.000]   And also the knowledge that the fact that I happen to like
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:58.680]   tap my finger on the glass idly or accidentally doesn't mean
[01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:00.560]   that now my mouse pointer has moved
[01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:02.720]   and I've deleted a paragraph and didn't mean to delete.
[01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:03.960]   That was a big, big relief.
[01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:05.880]   I was very, very worried when Mark Herman
[01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:09.320]   wrote his spoiler, his investigation
[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:11.560]   about what the next MacBook was gonna be like,
[01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:13.640]   because I could definitely see Apple making
[01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:15.480]   that kind of choice saying, you know what?
[01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:19.400]   We can make it microscopically thinner if we don't make it,
[01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:21.520]   if we make this a completely multi-touch surface,
[01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:22.640]   we don't put a button.
[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:24.480]   And yes, it'll, it's a bad decision
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:26.080]   and it'll make this thing more awful,
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:28.240]   but oh my God, that fraction of a millimeter, okay, no,
[01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:30.200]   I know that they would feel as though
[01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:31.760]   that is legitimately in all ways
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:33.400]   of an improvement on the thing that went before,
[01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:35.600]   but it would not be a good experience for me
[01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:37.680]   and really this is all about me.
[01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:40.320]   And finding out that they actually replaced it
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:42.360]   with something that gave me what I like,
[01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:45.120]   but also makes it a better experience is a pretty cool thing.
[01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:46.600]   I'm very excited about the MacBook.
[01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:49.200]   - So can they put this thing in the iPhone?
[01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:50.720]   - There's been some discussion about this.
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:53.280]   They put it inside the watch where it can,
[01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:55.120]   they can figure that out.
[01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:56.800]   Whether they can do that on a,
[01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:59.320]   I don't have really great sources on this.
[01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:01.000]   I've been talking to a couple of people
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.720]   who academically feel as though getting it to work
[01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:08.080]   on a trackpad without a screen on it is easy,
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:10.600]   getting, excuse me, nominally easy,
[01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:14.120]   getting to work on a multi-touch screen display
[01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:17.240]   the size of a watch is also not terribly difficult,
[01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:19.520]   but getting it to work on something the size of a phone
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:24.120]   or the size of an iPad would be a larger engineering problem.
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:29.720]   - Let's take a break, come back with your picks of the week.
[01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:33.720]   - Actually, I meant to say I'm a flood human being.
[01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:36.320]   I bought a Galaxy S6 Edge,
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:39.440]   but that's a story for another day.
[01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:42.400]   - You are a creature of desire.
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:44.960]   - Ever thought you were a filio.
[01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:47.160]   - Instant gratification.
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:49.360]   - There's a bumper sticker I wish I had that said
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:52.360]   I'm just a great big bag of wants and desires
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:53.840]   or wants and needs,
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:56.280]   and that's kind of the true story here.
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:25:58.720]   No, I have to because I have to talk about it
[01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:00.720]   and tell you whether you should buy it.
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:04.360]   - That's my story and I'm sticking to it.
[01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:08.480]   - Our show today brought to you by Trunk Club.
[01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:10.800]   Actually, this has been a great thing for me.
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:13.640]   Have you maybe you've noticed a little bit of an upgrade
[01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:16.840]   in the old Leo that you've seen in the past?
[01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:18.760]   I do not like to shop.
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:20.880]   Now, clearly I like to shop.
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:22.160]   I like to buy gadgets.
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:23.600]   I like to buy laptops.
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:25.040]   I like to buy tools.
[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:26.400]   I don't like to shop,
[01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:29.600]   and I think I'm not alone in this for clothes, right guys?
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:30.720]   No one wants to shop.
[01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:32.560]   And that's why we look so crappy.
[01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:35.440]   We don't look as good as we could
[01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:36.720]   because we don't want to shop.
[01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:38.240]   We want to wear t-shirts and jeans.
[01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:39.520]   Thank you very much.
[01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:41.920]   But maybe it's time to upgrade.
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:42.760]   How you look?
[01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:45.280]   People do judge you by the way you dress.
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:46.120]   And you know what?
[01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:47.320]   I got a way that's very easy.
[01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:49.320]   It requires no shopping.
[01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:51.400]   It's called Trunk Club.
[01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:52.240]   You're busy.
[01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:53.080]   I know you want to look your best.
[01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:55.000]   Nobody wants to spend time at the mall.
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.080]   But Trunk Club makes it easy.
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:26:58.680]   You get your own personal stylist,
[01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:00.680]   mine's named Robin, you can't have her.
[01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:01.680]   She's all mine.
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:02.880]   She's wonderful.
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:04.400]   Actually, she probably does have other clients,
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:06.400]   but I don't want to hear about it.
[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:08.480]   Robin and I spent about half an hour on the phone.
[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:10.680]   I told her about myself,
[01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:11.560]   then I'm a little preppy.
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:14.400]   I like the button downs, kind of chunky.
[01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:15.240]   She didn't mock me.
[01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:16.760]   She didn't laugh at me.
[01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:19.240]   She asked me what kind of brands I liked.
[01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:22.760]   She told me that wife beater's not a brand, okay?
[01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:26.520]   But once we worked that out,
[01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:29.600]   she then put up a webpage with a lot of suggestions,
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:31.680]   kind of like a hot or not thing.
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:32.840]   Guys, you're gonna love this and you go,
[01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:34.440]   I like that, don't like that, don't like that.
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:35.740]   Then she puts together a trunk.
[01:27:35.740 --> 01:27:37.600]   This is so cool.
[01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:41.720]   My trunk arrived inside, beautifully tied together
[01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:44.180]   with little sisal string and stuff,
[01:27:44.180 --> 01:27:48.320]   was shirts, sweaters, shoes, really nice stuff.
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:49.160]   Here's the beauty part.
[01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:51.600]   I have spent nothing at this point.
[01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:52.760]   Zero.
[01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:55.280]   I have 10 days to look at what's in the trunk.
[01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:57.680]   Keep what I like, return the rest.
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:28:00.800]   I've paid nothing for postage, nothing for the stylist.
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:02.880]   Then when it arrives back, they say,
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:05.640]   see what I kept and they charge me only for that.
[01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:08.560]   Trunk club, it's free to join, shipping is free,
[01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:11.040]   returns are free, there's no minimum purchase

[01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:17.320]   You only get a trunk when you say, I want another trunk.
[01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:18.640]   So I got an email from Robin, she said,
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:20.920]   well, I saw what you liked, I saw what you didn't like.
[01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:22.440]   Let me know when you want me to send you a trunk.
[01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:24.320]   We'll refine this as we go.
[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:25.760]   I love this.
[01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:27.240]   I know you don't like to shop guys,
[01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:29.520]   but I also know there's something nice about
[01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:30.560]   looking a little bit sharp.
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:34.280]   trunkclub.com/twit.

[01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:54.120]   Great clothes.
[01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:58.960]   I thank Robin for upgrading my image,
[01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:01.760]   just a little teeny, rainy bit.
[01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:04.920]   Let's get some pics out of Mankst, what do you got for us?
[01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:06.560]   - Well, this is gonna be a little unusual,
[01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:07.600]   but hey, I like to--
[01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:08.720]   - Why not?
[01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:10.440]   - Break it up a little bit.
[01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:15.040]   This is a website that you can find there called webscorer.com.
[01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:20.080]   And webscorer is a focused on races,
[01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:21.920]   of any sort, and this is something I've been getting
[01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:23.760]   into more and more timing races.
[01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:26.200]   So it's not just a website to handle registration.
[01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:29.880]   So if you're doing a fundraising 5K or something like that,
[01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:33.680]   they also have an app, runs an iOS and Android.
[01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:37.200]   And it integrates perfectly with the registration site,
[01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:39.520]   you can download all your entrance,
[01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:41.920]   shoot the gun off and then start timing finishers
[01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:43.200]   as they come in.
[01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:46.360]   It's a really, really nicely designed system,
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:49.160]   company's doing a lot of stuff to improve it.
[01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:52.280]   And speaking as someone who's done a ton of these things
[01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:56.000]   over the years, I'm just amazed at how flexible
[01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:57.880]   you can set up your races.
[01:29:57.880 --> 01:30:00.040]   I was like, oh, we're gonna charge one rate, one fee
[01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:03.480]   for people under 18 and one people for people over 18
[01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:06.240]   and the right fee's gonna go up 10 days beforehand
[01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:08.360]   and blah, blah, blah, all this sort of stuff,
[01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:09.600]   they can handle it.
[01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:13.520]   So it's a really well designed website and app,
[01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:15.080]   recommended highly for anyone who's looking
[01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:17.880]   to time and event of any sort.
[01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:19.960]   Wow, WebScore Pro.
[01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:23.400]   Web, it's at webScore.com.
[01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:25.960]   - Yeah, the app is free.
[01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:28.280]   You can sign up for the site for free.
[01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:31.520]   If you do wanna pay for the pro version,
[01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:33.800]   get some more features and then if you use it
[01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:37.400]   for registration, you pay a buck plus pay palfis
[01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:39.560]   per registrant, which is actually lower
[01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:42.000]   than almost every other registration site out there.
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.160]   So good site, good app.
[01:30:45.160 --> 01:30:47.040]   You get results immediately,
[01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:49.200]   which for again, those people who are running races,
[01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:52.280]   you don't wanna wait a week for them to type it all in.
[01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:54.280]   - I didn't realize that there was even competition
[01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:55.120]   in this field.
[01:30:55.120 --> 01:30:56.200]   - Oh, there's a lot.
[01:30:56.200 --> 01:30:57.040]   - I had no idea.
[01:30:57.040 --> 01:30:59.080]   Well, of course I don't spend much time running.
[01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:00.120]   Are you a runner, Adam?
[01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:01.720]   Is that your sports?
[01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:03.080]   - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:04.600]   I do all that stuff.
[01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:06.400]   - Yeah, awesome.
[01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:09.600]   Alex Lindsey from Pittsburgh PA.
[01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:14.600]   - So I had a request, someone asked about how to,
[01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:18.880]   what I use for forwarding slides, for presentations.
[01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:21.440]   And so, you know, a lot of people,
[01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:23.640]   you can go to Radio Shack and buy those little
[01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:27.560]   infrared things that only work about half the time.
[01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:30.840]   And so I thought I'd show the industrial version of that.
[01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:33.440]   So let me see if, and I have this new system,
[01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:35.760]   I'm gonna try to experiment with just once I get here.
[01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:36.840]   So this is the company here.
[01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:39.840]   This is a DCAN and as you can see that they,
[01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:42.480]   they make speaker timers and--
[01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:44.160]   - Is this coming from you?
[01:31:44.920 --> 01:31:46.480]   - This screenshot? - This is coming from me.
[01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:47.520]   - Yes, from me. - Are you doing
[01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:48.920]   illustrating?
[01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:49.760]   - I am.
[01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:51.520]   - God, you're such a show off.
[01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:53.400]   - So anyway, so the--
[01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:55.200]   - This is coming over Skype, this looks,
[01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:56.720]   I mean, I can't believe this looks better
[01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:58.200]   than our screenshots.
[01:31:58.200 --> 01:32:02.240]   - Well, so anyway, so the, so if you,
[01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:04.040]   if you look at it now, the QLights are the what,
[01:32:04.040 --> 01:32:04.880]   or what I'm actually using.
[01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:05.720]   - Do you wanna use me or CAD,
[01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:07.320]   just give the whole thing up.
[01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:08.320]   - Exactly.
[01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:12.440]   So the, so anyway, but the cool thing about it,
[01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:13.960]   if you look at it actually physically here,
[01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:16.400]   this is the, this is kind of the care.
[01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:17.320]   - Oh my God.
[01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:18.160]   - So--
[01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:20.480]   - You're just trying to show up Creme Cam 3000,
[01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:24.560]   the future of, this is the new, this is the new Cam.
[01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:27.920]   So, 'cause, so this is the, this is the controller.
[01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:30.400]   Now this will go about 300 feet
[01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:33.000]   without really any trouble at all.
[01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.120]   And it's very simple to use.
[01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:36.920]   You can even get one that doesn't have a back
[01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:39.000]   to really protect speakers from themselves.
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.040]   So now the problem with it is,
[01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:42.600]   is that you don't give them a lot of control.
[01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:45.480]   And so instead of having them go directly to the computer,
[01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:47.200]   you actually go to this.
[01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:51.480]   So, so this here is, if you look at this,
[01:32:51.480 --> 01:32:54.360]   what you have is, you can decide that it's a master or slave.
[01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:56.360]   That means it could follow another one.
[01:32:56.360 --> 01:32:58.200]   You know, so you could actually put these together
[01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:00.200]   to run a bunch of computers at one time.
[01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:01.240]   You can give it sound.
[01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:03.800]   So if I turn the sound up like this,
[01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:05.640]   you'll see it and watch, see the little,
[01:33:05.640 --> 01:33:08.440]   I don't know if you can hear that or not through my,
[01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:11.640]   my thing, but, but basically what that's designed for
[01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:16.640]   is if you, if you want someone to go forward,
[01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:19.320]   you can actually have them do that without having the,
[01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:23.320]   the person who's up stage actually run their own presentation,
[01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:24.560]   which is very useful.
[01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:26.200]   And of course, you can turn this light up and down.
[01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:28.760]   And so you can see that it's USB,
[01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:31.440]   and you can actually connect this to two computers at one time.
[01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:33.520]   So, and the reason that that's useful is the,
[01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:36.440]   obviously what happens a lot of times in presentations,
[01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:38.560]   is that, is that you,
[01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:41.320]   what happens in the presentations,
[01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:45.000]   is that you have a primary and a backup presentation
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:46.040]   that's running to stage,
[01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:48.480]   so that we can switch back and forth with one of them crashes.
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:50.080]   So anyway, that's some, that's it.
[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:51.720]   Do you like my little system, Leo?
[01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:53.720]   - What are you doing with it?
[01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:54.560]   - What?
[01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:55.720]   - What are you doing there?
[01:33:55.720 --> 01:33:58.560]   This is how I, oh, what am I doing to do that?
[01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:02.240]   - Well, I'm impressed because, first of all, it's on Skype.
[01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:04.680]   And it looks like you're, you have better quality
[01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:05.960]   than we have in studio.
[01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:07.680]   (laughing)
[01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:08.680]   So that's number one.
[01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:11.040]   How much bandwidth are you throwing at it?
[01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:16.040]   - Well, I have the, so my office has about 300 down and,
[01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:18.200]   - Wow.
[01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:19.200]   - So it's, it's,
[01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:20.800]   - Okay, that's explains it.
[01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:21.960]   - So that's interesting.
[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:24.480]   So Skype will use, I mean, there must be a limit
[01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:26.240]   to how much Skype will use on this.
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:29.400]   But it's using enough to give us beautiful images.
[01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:30.320]   - Now, the other thing is,
[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:32.320]   is that this is the new Skype TX box.
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:33.840]   So this is, - Oh.
[01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:37.240]   - Yeah, so this is a straight SDI into a Skype TX,
[01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:38.240]   you know, one U.
[01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:43.160]   - So this is a company that Microsoft acquired
[01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:45.880]   that was doing this kind of dedicated Skype hardware.
[01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:47.040]   What is it called?
[01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:48.040]   - It was called Cat-n-Miles.
[01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:48.960]   - Cat-n-Miles.
[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:51.360]   - We looked at it was really expensive.
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:52.680]   - It is.
[01:34:52.680 --> 01:34:54.940]   (laughing)
[01:34:54.940 --> 01:35:00.120]   But what my frustration was,
[01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:03.120]   I was tired of trying to emulate a webcam.
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:05.320]   You know, like this constant process
[01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:08.120]   of trying to trick Skype into knowing what it was at.
[01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:10.560]   And I have too many clients and too many other things
[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:12.080]   that wanted to use Skype that I just,
[01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:13.800]   I needed to have a solution for it.
[01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:15.600]   And what I have here is something
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:16.800]   that we're working on for classes.
[01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:19.240]   So this is a, you know, the, I don't know,
[01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:21.200]   - I wouldn't even see, I wouldn't even need this studio
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:23.240]   if I had this at the house.
[01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:24.720]   - You should see the rest of it.
[01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:25.800]   Next week when I'm on,
[01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:29.800]   I'll have the other camera system set up.
[01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:31.880]   It's just not, it just came in in the mail.
[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:34.880]   And I'll be able to, I can actually show the system
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:38.160]   'cause there's a, it's a science project right now.
[01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:40.720]   I have to rewire it 'cause Sam actually,
[01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:42.280]   Sam Squires came out and built it.
[01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:44.560]   And then I tore half of it apart to get this Skype.
[01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:47.000]   - So what do you use for a switcher?
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.200]   - I'm using a couple switchers.
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:53.080]   There's a, so there's the ATEM,
[01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:55.640]   I have a two ME and a television studio.
[01:35:55.640 --> 01:35:58.880]   So these are, and so one of them is just letting me go back
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:01.240]   and forth between these sources like this.
[01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:03.680]   And then the other one is once I get to this source,
[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:06.280]   I have another one that is controlled by some control.
[01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:07.720]   - Quick chase, throw it at a change.
[01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:08.880]   - This is like a transition.
[01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:10.120]   At least we could do that.
[01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:11.160]   - Starweb. - Yeah.
[01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:12.960]   - Starweb. - These are three different sources
[01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:13.800]   that I can bring in.
[01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:14.880]   - I can't believe how good this is.
[01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:16.560]   You know how hard it was at, yeah,
[01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:17.760]   you can't do that, can you?
[01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:19.400]   (laughing)
[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:20.960]   - No, I can't, I can't do that.
[01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:22.920]   - Yeah, not yet, not yet, but now that I've seen it,
[01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:24.240]   I don't know.
[01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:27.040]   - We spent, oh yeah, can't do that, can you?
[01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:29.440]   We spent so much money at tech TV and so much time
[01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:30.640]   and so much effort.
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:33.200]   You remember this, shooting screens,
[01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:34.040]   because there was no,
[01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:35.680]   (laughing)
[01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:36.760]   - I remember it.
[01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:40.040]   - There was no way, and so we actually had a camera operator
[01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:43.640]   with the expensive camera pointed at a screen.
[01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:44.600]   And you had to be very careful
[01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:46.160]   by pulling the focus in and out
[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:49.440]   because it would moray like crazy and remember that.
[01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:50.280]   Now you just go like,
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:52.280]   - Yeah, well, I push a button here and--
[01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:53.400]   - Well, and I don't have to--
[01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:54.920]   - And you can tell us straight.
[01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:56.960]   - I don't have, yeah, well, yeah, and that's just, yeah.
[01:36:56.960 --> 01:37:00.200]   So the, and I can't do zoom-ins on the screens,
[01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:01.040]   I just haven't set up TV.
[01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:02.120]   - I'm just going home right now
[01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:04.520]   and I'm gonna buy whatever you have.
[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:06.520]   And I'm going home.
[01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:11.200]   We're gonna close the studio and I'm just gonna go home.
[01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:15.160]   - Alex, be ready for a package to arrive from Petaluma.
[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:17.400]   It's gonna be about a sign about this big reading,
[01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:18.400]   "Twit East."
[01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:19.880]   (laughing)
[01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:20.920]   - I am so impressed.
[01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:22.560]   That is really amazing what you're doing there.
[01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:23.640]   That's really great.
[01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:24.560]   - That's really great.
[01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:25.400]   - We're just having some fun.
[01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:26.800]   - I'm just teasing it.
[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:29.360]   You know, it's funny because we're spending a lot of time
[01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:33.080]   last week talking about the Freedom of Information Act
[01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:36.760]   that the Wall Street Journal got from the FTC
[01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:39.320]   and the smoking gun about a, you know, Google Monopoly
[01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:40.320]   and one of the things the journal,
[01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:41.160]   it really was a hit piece,
[01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:43.920]   it turns out by Rupert Murdoch's Wall Street Journal.
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:46.160]   One of the things the journal said is Google
[01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:47.960]   got a free pass from the FTC
[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:51.720]   'cause they visited the White House 230 times
[01:37:51.720 --> 01:37:52.960]   during the Obama administration.
[01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:54.440]   And then Google's response is,
[01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:57.800]   "Yeah, Alex was Alex Lindsey, that wasn't us."
[01:37:57.800 --> 01:37:59.200]   (laughing)
[01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:02.240]   It was all the, it was the hangouts after the,
[01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:03.440]   and it was all you.
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:07.480]   How many times did you visit the White House?
[01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:10.240]   - 20 or 30 probably over that period of time.
[01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:11.760]   So it's so likely. - Were you lobbying
[01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:13.600]   the president during that?
[01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:16.200]   - I know, no, I didn't talk to the president ever.
[01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:18.640]   So it was-- - So you could take 30
[01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:21.200]   off of that number 'cause it was Alex.
[01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:23.440]   - Goin' in, I had to laugh 'cause it was like,
[01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:26.040]   well no, because we had crews come in
[01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:27.200]   after the State of the Union
[01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:29.720]   because they were doing a Google Hangout.
[01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:32.880]   And of course the crew, is it wrong to say this?
[01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:34.560]   Is it a secret? - No, no, it's not.
[01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:35.560]   I'm allowed to talk about it.
[01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:37.960]   - Okay, so-- - The crew was Pixelcore
[01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:41.900]   and Alex doing what he just did in Pittsburgh in DC.
[01:38:41.900 --> 01:38:43.760]   - Yes.
[01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:45.440]   - Well, not this complicated, the one,
[01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:46.840]   this is a little bit of a--
[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:48.840]   - Yeah, but your setup is superior
[01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:50.760]   to the one you brought to the White House?
[01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:53.520]   - Well, it has different sets of features.
[01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:55.840]   So the one, you know, the, we actually--
[01:38:55.840 --> 01:38:58.760]   I guess President Obama doesn't really need a illustrator.
[01:38:58.760 --> 01:38:59.880]   - Well, not yet.
[01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:00.720]   So anyway-- - Boom!
[01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:02.680]   - But the-- - Boom!
[01:39:02.680 --> 01:39:04.400]   Wow! - Yeah.
[01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:06.480]   - What are you using for a illustrator?
[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:07.640]   - Just a whack-um tablet.
[01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:09.880]   - Oh, that's neat, I didn't know you could do that.
[01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:13.200]   - Yeah, yeah, well, it's a bunch of movie magic
[01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:15.280]   once we have the whack-um tablet to make it do that.
[01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:16.840]   - Oh, we were talking about the show me this.
[01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:18.040]   This was something you-- - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:19.360]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - You're talking about this.
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:22.040]   - It's been refined over time. - So impressive.
[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:25.760]   - So it's, but it's, but we, you know,
[01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:27.480]   I started building this whole thing because I was,
[01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:29.880]   I was trying to, you know, figure out how to teach classes
[01:39:29.880 --> 01:39:31.720]   in Rwanda from at Aluma.
[01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:33.680]   And now it's gotten to the point where I was trying to explain
[01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:35.320]   to someone, they wanted me to speak at a convention,
[01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:37.280]   and I was like, "Okay, I can really do this from my office."
[01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:38.880]   And they were like, "Well, I would really like you to be there."
[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:41.040]   I'm like, "No, no, really, it's better if I do it from my office."
[01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:43.120]   - Yeah, no, like I-- - It's like, I have more tools.
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:44.600]   - Okay. - It will be more interesting.
[01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:46.120]   - And you look just like you're here.
[01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:48.720]   I mean, you look better than you're here than if you were here.
[01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:51.560]   - Yeah, so anyway, so it's, it's, it's-- - That's nice.
[01:39:51.560 --> 01:40:00.480]   - This is what I do in my spare time, you know.
[01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:02.280]   - And I'm being a little facetious because I kind of,
[01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:04.320]   I mean, you showed me much of this stuff.
[01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:06.280]   It just always blows me away. How good you look?
[01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:08.200]   - Why, thank you. - Yeah.
[01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:11.920]   - My God, my God, man, you know, beautiful.
[01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:15.120]   - It's just a, it's just a, it's just a, what camera?
[01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:16.480]   - That is the big advantage.
[01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:19.200]   Oh, this is just a little, this is an XF 105.
[01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:21.400]   This is a, you know, Canon XF 105 with an SDI out.
[01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:22.640]   - Yeah, it's a camcorder.
[01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:24.200]   I mean, it's a little bit bigger than a regular camcorder,
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:25.040]   but it's, it's not much better.
[01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:27.640]   - It's a $3,000 camcorder. - You know?
[01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:32.000]   - I'm just saying. - But the, well, and, well,
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:35.240]   the problem more than your USB Logitech.
[01:40:35.240 --> 01:40:36.560]   - Yes, yes. - Yes.
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:38.440]   - Although sometimes I don't know if it looks that much better.
[01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:40.920]   I mean, I think that the, like, I like the look of the,
[01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:42.000]   of the Cisco one.
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.400]   - I could see the dead fly on the wall behind you.
[01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:45.960]   It looks better, trust me.
[01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:48.760]   - That's, that's actually coffee.
[01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:50.240]   - So you see-- - It's coffee.
[01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:52.560]   - Yeah, I dropped a cup.
[01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:53.560]   It's all over the wall.
[01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:55.000]   So it's, I'll clean that up.
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.240]   - You've had me actually rubbing our screen
[01:40:57.240 --> 01:40:59.120]   'cause I thought it was, I thought it was on our,
[01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:00.120]   it was so real.
[01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:00.960]   (laughing)
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:03.120]   It's like, oh, what is that schmutz on the screen?
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:05.920]   (laughing)
[01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:07.440]   - So, thank you, Alex Lindsay.
[01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:08.440]   - Thank you. - Pick some core.
[01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:09.600]   - Is there, you can't do that.
[01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:10.720]   - Okay, yeah. - Nice.
[01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:11.560]   I cannot. - No.
[01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:12.400]   - I cannot do that.
[01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:13.320]   - Not yet. - No.
[01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:15.240]   - Not yet. - Spend a million dollars.
[01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:16.760]   You'll be able to do that.
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:18.560]   - Uh-huh. - That is awesome.
[01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:21.760]   - I'm gonna, I'm gonna get a tricaster
[01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:24.840]   and do that for every, every transition.
[01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:25.680]   - Yeah.
[01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:28.760]   (laughing)
[01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:32.360]   - Andy and I, the Creme Cam 3000 is, is, put to shame,
[01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:33.520]   I'm sorry.
[01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:34.360]   - Well, well, what?
[01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:35.200]   (laughing)
[01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:38.200]   I need to talk to my game, so here's my little co-host,
[01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:39.040]   Suckso.
[01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:42.440]   What do we have to show people today Sucks away?
[01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:44.840]   (laughing)
[01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:48.600]   See, I'm feeling good for her because I had this plan
[01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:50.760]   that if I wanna show something from the iPad,
[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:52.680]   I can just put this monitor right here
[01:41:52.680 --> 01:41:55.480]   and then just like rotate Creme Cam 3000 to face it.
[01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:56.600]   - Yeah. - But then I thought
[01:41:56.600 --> 01:41:58.680]   that I had an HDMI cable already plugged in,
[01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:00.840]   but I didn't and I can't find one.
[01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:02.560]   What I will do is that the only thing I did
[01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:04.720]   with those fancy schmancy is that I actually,
[01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:09.480]   and his audio goes in. - Oh yeah.
[01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:11.360]   - Oh jeez.
[01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:12.680]   - I know, I replaced the cable with,
[01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:15.440]   see, if you have an audio cable plugged into the iPad,
[01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:17.280]   so you can hear the awful off,
[01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:19.080]   from this thing that you do.
[01:42:19.080 --> 01:42:21.800]   - Okay, don't touch anything, Andy, it's falling apart
[01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:22.720]   as we speak.
[01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:24.960]   (laughing)
[01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:34.200]   I'm just gonna go home now.
[01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:38.400]   - I know, I have ordered her placement cable from Amazon.
[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:42.040]   Maybe I just moved a Pittsburgh.
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:47.360]   Anyway, so here's a fun little activity thing
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:49.600]   that's free from Autodesk called Tinker Play.
[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:53.760]   And what it is for is for actually designing cool
[01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:57.360]   3D action figures in the virtual reality space
[01:42:57.360 --> 01:43:00.360]   of where you are, you get this sort of kit of parts.
[01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:04.000]   It is like Tinker Toys that you can just select from
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:05.600]   and like snap together.
[01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:09.880]   So there's a torso, now I can sort of look for,
[01:43:09.880 --> 01:43:14.880]   it's hard to do upside down, but now you can look for a head,
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.840]   so let's put a head on there.
[01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:18.680]   Oops, come on.
[01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:22.600]   - Come on, you're being mean.
[01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:23.440]   - There we go.
[01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:27.920]   Oh, what an exciting demo this is.
[01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:29.440]   (laughing)
[01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:33.000]   Okay, but they can put parts together
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:34.600]   and then snap together.
[01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:36.400]   - Oh, they snap, that's neat, that's nice.
[01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:38.440]   - I've got a head on an arm there,
[01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:40.600]   and you can rotate it around and see what it looks like
[01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:43.040]   from different angles and decide that maybe
[01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:45.640]   this should go over here.
[01:43:45.640 --> 01:43:46.480]   - Wow.
[01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:49.000]   - Or this maybe needs another head up top here.
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.240]   - You can still need Lego anymore, do they?
[01:43:51.240 --> 01:43:54.120]   - Yeah, and you can pose it the way you like,
[01:43:54.120 --> 01:43:55.680]   you can make it look more like a robot
[01:43:55.680 --> 01:43:59.360]   or more like a knight or more like whatever it is
[01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:01.480]   you actually want it to look like.
[01:44:01.480 --> 01:44:03.960]   And the other cool thing about it is that
[01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:06.240]   once you have like the model that you can play with it
[01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:10.000]   just as a model thing, but when you're done playing
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.560]   with it as a model, you can then just like send it
[01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:15.840]   to a 3D printer and have them print this toy.
[01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:18.440]   So as a free thing, that's just a cool thing
[01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:20.760]   to just like throw parts together.
[01:44:20.760 --> 01:44:23.640]   I mean, there are other models that are kind of
[01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:25.880]   more complicated there and they got all kinds
[01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:28.920]   of different parts like you make really, really weird,
[01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:29.920]   weird creatures.
[01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:33.600]   It's a fun thing to play with especially for free
[01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:36.680]   and the idea that you can then like go to your UPS store
[01:44:36.680 --> 01:44:40.480]   or because your mom or your dad still can't justify
[01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:42.840]   the 1500 dollars they spent on the thin thing maker
[01:44:42.840 --> 01:44:44.800]   that they surprised they're supposed with.
[01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:48.320]   They can print out this toy right in their own living room.
[01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:49.800]   So it's a lot of fun.
[01:44:49.800 --> 01:44:53.960]   It works on just about anything, works on iPads, iPhones
[01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:57.440]   and they have to figure out how to do actual
[01:44:57.440 --> 01:44:58.560]   Windows phone support.
[01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:02.080]   So they got a few dollars for that there.
[01:45:02.080 --> 01:45:04.600]   That's nice, that's really cool.
[01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:06.080]   Yeah, it's a fun toy.
[01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:08.400]   It was a little bit difficult for me to figure out
[01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:10.760]   how to use it before I realized that, oh,
[01:45:10.760 --> 01:45:13.160]   it's the first thing that you have to learn how to do
[01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:18.160]   is make sure that you know that you can't just put things
[01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:20.880]   just by anywhere there are balls and there are sockets
[01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:22.480]   and that's how these things work.
[01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:26.240]   Can you then send it to a 3D printer and a great one?
[01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:27.080]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:30.840]   So it'll not only send it to a 3D printer,
[01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:34.760]   but it will also organize the print intelligently
[01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:38.200]   so that if you really do want this to be a color print,
[01:45:38.200 --> 01:45:41.080]   all the parts of the same color are grouped together.
[01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:43.800]   They're also grouped in a nice tight little bundle
[01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:48.120]   so that the printhead is not skidding all the way over the plate
[01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:48.920]   in order to make it work.
[01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:51.440]   So it's just a very, very tight confined place.
[01:45:51.440 --> 01:45:53.160]   It might be the most expensive action figure
[01:45:53.160 --> 01:45:55.320]   you ever have ever settled,
[01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:57.120]   but like I said, it's fun to play with.
[01:45:57.120 --> 01:45:58.840]   It really is neat.
[01:45:58.840 --> 01:46:00.360]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:02.840]   Alex, you have anything to compete with that?
[01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:04.320]   No, no, not at all.
[01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:06.360]   Well, yes, of course you do, but that's all right.
[01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:07.960]   It's nice of you to pretend.
[01:46:07.960 --> 01:46:10.280]   Do they import new models?
[01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:11.920]   I mean, can someone build models for this?
[01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:15.160]   Is it a platform or is it just the stuff that they give you?
[01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:18.840]   They actually, this actually works with a larger system
[01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:20.640]   that Autodesk bought.
[01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:22.800]   So there is actually a,
[01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:26.040]   I'm trying to see if I still have that tab open
[01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:28.600]   when I was rereading about this.
[01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:31.400]   There is a company that they bought that,
[01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:34.160]   here it is, it's a TinkerCAD
[01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:36.880]   that is sort of a desktop version of this
[01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:38.920]   that can be used to build just about anything.
[01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:41.560]   So this will work with TinkerCAD projects.
[01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:42.840]   I don't think it works the other way around.
[01:46:42.840 --> 01:46:45.360]   I don't think you can design a 3D part
[01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:46.720]   and then import it into this.
[01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:49.160]   This is really like an action figure construction set,
[01:46:49.160 --> 01:46:51.480]   but again, robots, knights, they got,
[01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:53.440]   you can make wings, you can make,
[01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:56.760]   you got swords, you can even rip off an arm,
[01:46:56.760 --> 01:47:00.080]   tell this creature who's boss, make sure that, you know.
[01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:02.080]   And you don't have to,
[01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:03.720]   it doesn't have to be an Autodesk 3D printer,
[01:47:03.720 --> 01:47:04.680]   it could be any 3D printer.
[01:47:04.680 --> 01:47:07.160]   It's just gonna export.
[01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:08.960]   - It just exports standard files.
[01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:12.360]   So anything that does a regular nib file,
[01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:14.080]   we'll work with this.
[01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:16.000]   - Right, very cool.
[01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.040]   My son will go crazy, so I might have to,
[01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:20.680]   might have to get that.
[01:47:20.680 --> 01:47:22.080]   - I just get that.
[01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:23.800]   - Even upside down, it's just,
[01:47:23.800 --> 01:47:28.800]   it's a good time waster in that you just like to pose things
[01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:33.640]   and, you know, do CSI like recreations of,
[01:47:33.640 --> 01:47:35.760]   okay, here's how the body I think fell.
[01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:38.880]   - Well, it's interesting 'cause it's not only connecting
[01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:40.240]   everything, but it's building, you know,
[01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:43.120]   in what we would call an inverse cinematic chain.
[01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:46.880]   - Right, right, so it's, it's not,
[01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:50.240]   it takes a few minutes to figure out how what you're doing,
[01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:52.240]   interacts with the model that you're making,
[01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:54.680]   but like I said, it's just fun to interact with
[01:47:54.680 --> 01:47:56.960]   a 3D sculpture this way instead of tactile way.
[01:47:56.960 --> 01:48:00.040]   That's one of the great things about like tablets for 3D,
[01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:01.840]   with the ability to simply actually,
[01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:04.320]   wish that we're, I wish there were a dent right here
[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:06.520]   and be able to sort of like put your finger right there
[01:48:06.520 --> 01:48:07.360]   and dent it.
[01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:08.680]   Maybe that's another thing we're gonna be able to use
[01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:11.400]   Force Touch with in the near future.
[01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:16.080]   - Neat, little rubber bullets.
[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:23.840]   - That is, tell us the name again
[01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:25.480]   so I can download it real quick.
[01:48:25.480 --> 01:48:27.080]   How much does it cost, too?
[01:48:27.080 --> 01:48:28.680]   - It is absolutely free.
[01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:29.520]   - Tinker to.
[01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:32.240]   - It's called Tinker Toy and you can get it
[01:48:32.240 --> 01:48:35.400]   for pretty much any mobile device that you have.
[01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:36.360]   'Cause it's on the App Store,
[01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:40.640]   if you go to 123dapp.com and then slash Tinker Play,
[01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:42.240]   I'm sorry, not Tinker Toy, it's Tinker Play.
[01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:43.560]   - Tinker Play, I'm sorry.
[01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:45.880]   - 123dapp.com/tinkerplay.
[01:48:45.880 --> 01:48:52.480]   - We know, you know that we're a Squarespace fans here
[01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:54.960]   and but you know, you also may know that I'm spending
[01:48:54.960 --> 01:48:57.280]   a little bit of money on a new website for twit.tv,
[01:48:57.280 --> 01:49:02.000]   somewhere in between the idea of a Squarespace site
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:05.880]   or a WordPress site and a quarter of a million dollar
[01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:08.240]   custom built site, there must be something.
[01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:09.760]   I have you guys heard about this.
[01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:13.160]   I just saw an ad for it and I don't know anything about it.
[01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:15.240]   It's called The Grid.
[01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:19.680]   It's an artificial intelligence designed website builder.
[01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:21.920]   So you don't actually worry about templates
[01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:24.120]   or anything, you just upload stuff
[01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:29.440]   and then it does color correction, it lays it out.
[01:49:29.440 --> 01:49:32.600]   If it's video, it does something different with it,
[01:49:32.600 --> 01:49:36.280]   it does face detection and spark crops, your stuff.
[01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:40.200]   This is a crazy idea and I looked into the people behind it
[01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:44.320]   and it's some pretty serious folks.
[01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:46.680]   So I'm just curious what you think of this.
[01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:48.760]   - Can I feed it 5,000 tidbits articles?
[01:49:48.760 --> 01:49:49.960]   - You know, I'm wondering, you know,
[01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:52.560]   you spent a lot of time creating tidbits, right?
[01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:53.960]   - I said, I need a new website
[01:49:53.960 --> 01:49:55.520]   like I would not believe that.
[01:49:55.520 --> 01:49:57.960]   - I know and it's really expensive to do.
[01:49:57.960 --> 01:50:00.360]   - And designers, tell me a story.
[01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:03.120]   - This is not out yet, it's gonna come out later
[01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:06.240]   in the spring but you could sign up to be,
[01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:09.240]   I guess, an early beta tester.
[01:50:09.240 --> 01:50:11.720]   I'm just curious if anybody knows anything about it.
[01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:14.280]   Some pretty heavy duty folks.
[01:50:14.280 --> 01:50:16.280]   - With spacesuit helmets on it.
[01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:19.720]   - I mean, they're in space, they're cosmonauts.
[01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:21.400]   - We know that they're serious that they've got.
[01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:22.520]   - Yeah, right.
[01:50:22.520 --> 01:50:24.800]   - So I don't know, I just, maybe I'll sign up
[01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:28.120]   and I'll give you some feedback on it.
[01:50:28.120 --> 01:50:29.920]   I just was curious if you guys, I mean,
[01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:34.920]   some co-founders, a guy did Google AdSense.
[01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:38.480]   The other founders, a creator of Grid Style Sheets
[01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:41.240]   and a partner at D4, which is a big interactive agency.
[01:50:41.240 --> 01:50:43.920]   I think it's very intriguing anyway.
[01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:47.120]   Hearing a little bit of buzz about this,
[01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:49.840]   it's called thegrid.io.
[01:50:51.560 --> 01:50:54.000]   - Hmm, artificial intelligence.
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.560]   I don't think we could use this for Twit
[01:50:56.560 --> 01:50:57.960]   and you probably couldn't use it for tidbits,
[01:50:57.960 --> 01:50:59.680]   you probably need something.
[01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:02.480]   - As long as you'd be handing your entire company
[01:51:02.480 --> 01:51:05.200]   over to an AI, which might not be a good idea.
[01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:06.720]   - What could possibly go wrong?
[01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:07.720]   - Shit.
[01:51:07.720 --> 01:51:09.920]   - You know what, here's the one thing I really do like
[01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:13.040]   about this, the data that you upload to them
[01:51:13.040 --> 01:51:14.800]   is put on GitHub so you can access it
[01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:16.400]   and download it and take it back.
[01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:20.120]   You know, you're not, they have an export feature
[01:51:20.120 --> 01:51:21.280]   that's pretty clever.
[01:51:22.280 --> 01:51:23.680]   So.
[01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:27.080]   - But you're right, this is Skynet for websites, right?
[01:51:27.080 --> 01:51:28.800]   (laughing)
[01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:30.960]   If all of a sudden you see, oh, this is cool,
[01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:33.160]   if you sign up early, you get a key chain
[01:51:33.160 --> 01:51:35.840]   with an NFC tag and all you have to do is, you know,
[01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:38.440]   tell people here, just swipe my key chain
[01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:41.200]   and they'll go right to your website.
[01:51:41.200 --> 01:51:43.040]   - You have to give them your keys in other words.
[01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:43.880]   - Ah!
[01:51:43.880 --> 01:51:45.720]   (laughing)
[01:51:45.720 --> 01:51:48.720]   I bet Alex is signing up for it right now.
[01:51:48.720 --> 01:51:49.640]   - I definitely wanna try it.
[01:51:49.640 --> 01:51:52.360]   - Yeah, isn't it an intriguing idea?
[01:51:52.360 --> 01:51:53.720]   - Yeah.
[01:51:53.720 --> 01:51:55.680]   - Why should we have to design it?
[01:51:55.680 --> 01:51:57.280]   Why shouldn't it just, you know,
[01:51:57.280 --> 01:51:58.800]   - I mean, you know, I have a feeling for someone
[01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:00.280]   who just wants to throw some ideas up, I think,
[01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:02.280]   when you don't have a specific idea of how it's going.
[01:52:02.280 --> 01:52:05.280]   - Yeah, well that's me right there, in a nutshell.
[01:52:05.280 --> 01:52:06.840]   - In a nutshell.
[01:52:06.840 --> 01:52:12.360]   - Ladies and gentlemen, I think we are done for the day,
[01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:14.680]   but I wanna thank our panel and especially Adam Anks
[01:52:14.680 --> 01:52:16.000]   for making some time.
[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.600]   He's so busy all the time doing tidbits,
[01:52:18.600 --> 01:52:21.080]   I don't know how he finds time to do anything else.
[01:52:21.080 --> 01:52:24.840]   Tidsbits, which is literally the longest running
[01:52:24.840 --> 01:52:27.520]   Apple news, Apple fan site.
[01:52:27.520 --> 01:52:30.960]   - But let's not get ahead of ourselves two more weeks.
[01:52:30.960 --> 01:52:31.800]   - What?
[01:52:31.800 --> 01:52:33.120]   - 25 years comes in two more weeks.
[01:52:33.120 --> 01:52:34.720]   - Oh my God, you know, we're still doing it
[01:52:34.720 --> 01:52:35.560]   with the anniversary. - And then we'll be
[01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:36.400]   particularly old us.
[01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:38.800]   - I can't imagine, I can't imagine 25 years doing this.
[01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:40.120]   - Yeah, I need to connect honestly.
[01:52:40.120 --> 01:52:41.880]   - Yeah, that's pretty impressive.
[01:52:41.880 --> 01:52:44.720]   - I think brain damage set in several decades ago,
[01:52:44.720 --> 01:52:46.400]   so luckily I don't remember it.
[01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:50.120]   - Well, and I read it every single week.
[01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:51.640]   I mean, it's just religious,
[01:52:51.640 --> 01:52:53.160]   although I haven't read the review yet
[01:52:53.160 --> 01:52:54.160]   of the book of jobs.
[01:52:54.160 --> 01:52:56.360]   - That just came out this morning.
[01:52:56.360 --> 01:52:57.800]   So you're-- - Oh, I have a good excuse.
[01:52:57.800 --> 01:52:59.720]   - I write it, yeah.
[01:52:59.720 --> 01:53:01.560]   - A lot of people, it's actually really interesting.
[01:53:01.560 --> 01:53:04.120]   Most people still read tidbits in email weekly.
[01:53:04.120 --> 01:53:05.280]   - That's how I read it, I get it in email.
[01:53:05.280 --> 01:53:06.680]   - I mean, obviously we have the website,
[01:53:06.680 --> 01:53:07.800]   but you know, if you got the email,
[01:53:07.800 --> 01:53:10.440]   email just shows up on Tuesday morning, you read it.
[01:53:10.440 --> 01:53:12.720]   - And it's text, I like text.
[01:53:12.720 --> 01:53:14.640]   Who needs HTML?
[01:53:14.640 --> 01:53:15.920]   - I can read text.
[01:53:15.920 --> 01:53:18.840]   - So good stuff. - Just for it.
[01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:19.800]   - Good stuff.
[01:53:19.800 --> 01:53:24.920]   Tidbits, T-I-D-B-I-T-S.com.
[01:53:24.920 --> 01:53:26.560]   If you're weekly and it's free,
[01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:31.240]   although you should become a tidbits member and support them.
[01:53:31.240 --> 01:53:32.680]   - And if you do that, you get to read
[01:53:32.680 --> 01:53:35.120]   Joe Kistel's Take Control of Security for Mac users,
[01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:37.440]   which we are serializing right now,
[01:53:37.440 --> 01:53:39.000]   chapter by chapter one week.
[01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:40.880]   - I have to read that.
[01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:41.640]   - Good stuff.
[01:53:41.640 --> 01:53:44.720]   Alex Lindsey, he is the master of video.
[01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:47.720]   You can learn a lot from Alex at pixelcore.com.
[01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:50.680]   But best thing to do, follow him on Twitter @AlexLindsayly,
[01:53:50.680 --> 01:53:54.000]   N-D-S-A-Y, 'cause you tweet, don't you Alex,
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:55.640]   whenever you're about to do anything public.
[01:53:55.640 --> 01:53:58.080]   - I do, I tweet and I tweet meerkats.
[01:53:58.080 --> 01:54:00.040]   I'll probably start playing with Periscope.
[01:54:00.040 --> 01:54:02.360]   Some people will see random stuff that,
[01:54:02.360 --> 01:54:05.320]   and I'm starting to get into a spherical video
[01:54:05.320 --> 01:54:08.640]   for goggles, for gearball.
[01:54:08.640 --> 01:54:09.720]   - VR.
[01:54:09.720 --> 01:54:11.560]   - Yeah, so, so anyway, we've been doing,
[01:54:11.560 --> 01:54:13.400]   we've been doing some experiments in that area,
[01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:15.320]   so I'll probably show some behind the scenes of that.
[01:54:15.320 --> 01:54:17.360]   - I'm very intrigued by all of that.
[01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:18.560]   - I got one, I got a rig, hold on.
[01:54:18.560 --> 01:54:19.400]   - Were you gonna ask you this?
[01:54:19.400 --> 01:54:20.480]   - Oh my God.
[01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:21.320]   - Yeah.
[01:54:21.320 --> 01:54:22.160]   - Oh my God, just get it.
[01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:23.480]   - I tried to knock that at the other day.
[01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:26.120]   - So this is what I've been asking, and oh, see?
[01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:27.440]   This is what I've been asking.
[01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:30.360]   And nobody talks about this Facebook at the FA conference,
[01:54:30.360 --> 01:54:32.320]   spent an hour showing optical illusions.
[01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:37.120]   All I wanted to know is what do I need to do VR?
[01:54:37.120 --> 01:54:38.920]   That's it, huh?
[01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:41.920]   - Well, if you wanna capture the VR,
[01:54:41.920 --> 01:54:44.880]   - Well, what I'd like to do is offer you the chance
[01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:48.080]   to sit on the panel, you know?
[01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:51.520]   So you can look around and be a part of the show.
[01:54:51.520 --> 01:54:52.800]   - Yeah, we can, I can talk to you about that.
[01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:53.720]   I can, I can--
[01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:55.960]   - I would love to do a VR version of Mac break week.
[01:54:55.960 --> 01:54:59.480]   Remember we did the first headphone,
[01:54:59.480 --> 01:55:00.840]   Dolby headphone version of it,
[01:55:00.840 --> 01:55:03.480]   so you could hear it in space where everybody was.
[01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:05.160]   - Should we do that next week?
[01:55:05.160 --> 01:55:06.680]   - You wanna do it, but you'd have to have,
[01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:09.360]   could you work with a gear VR?
[01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:11.880]   Nobody has a wireless Rift, or very few.
[01:55:11.880 --> 01:55:13.760]   - I gotta figure out whether we can--
[01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:16.600]   - So what is that?
[01:55:16.600 --> 01:55:19.680]   - Like six disposable cameras taped together, what is that?
[01:55:19.680 --> 01:55:22.880]   - This is six GoPros.
[01:55:22.880 --> 01:55:26.440]   - Oh, did you make that yourself, or did somebody sell that?
[01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:31.200]   - Someone sells a version of it, this one was printed.
[01:55:31.200 --> 01:55:32.040]   Not by me, but--
[01:55:32.040 --> 01:55:34.200]   - Wait a minute, did you say printed?
[01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:35.040]   - Yeah, it's printed.
[01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:37.080]   - Oh my God, Alex Lindsay lives in the future, we're just--
[01:55:37.080 --> 01:55:38.680]   - Just not very--
[01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:39.520]   - It wasn't me.
[01:55:39.520 --> 01:55:40.680]   (laughing)
[01:55:40.680 --> 01:55:41.520]   - But the,
[01:55:41.520 --> 01:55:43.920]   anyway, I'm gonna go with it.
[01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:44.760]   - Printed?
[01:55:44.760 --> 01:55:48.560]   Do you have a replicator?
[01:55:48.560 --> 01:55:53.560]   - We have lots of 3D printers, but I didn't print that one.
[01:55:53.560 --> 01:55:56.240]   But the, I'm getting a, we're getting a,
[01:55:56.240 --> 01:55:57.480]   what is it, the Form 1, I guess,
[01:55:57.480 --> 01:55:58.760]   which is the stereo lithography,
[01:55:58.760 --> 01:56:00.640]   because it'll be a little stronger than that.
[01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:03.280]   - So I would love to, just, I mean, it's not that,
[01:56:03.280 --> 01:56:05.040]   first of all, I was curious how big is it?
[01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:06.800]   So it's not that big.
[01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:08.120]   - It can't be, because the problem is,
[01:56:08.120 --> 01:56:09.760]   is that the lenses can't get too far.
[01:56:09.760 --> 01:56:10.600]   - Yeah, it can't be too big,
[01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:12.960]   'cause then you couldn't do porn, VR porn.
[01:56:12.960 --> 01:56:14.600]   But then, but what I was thinking is,
[01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:17.040]   we could put it right here, like next to me,
[01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:18.360]   I could put a place at the table.
[01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:19.760]   - You probably want to be a little further away
[01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:21.240]   for a variety of technical reasons, but--
[01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:22.840]   - And then you could be in the show,
[01:56:22.840 --> 01:56:24.680]   you wouldn't have to come sit here.
[01:56:24.680 --> 01:56:27.840]   I mean, people do come, thank you for being here.
[01:56:27.840 --> 01:56:29.920]   Email tickets at TwiP.tv, but you could just,
[01:56:29.920 --> 01:56:31.760]   but then we can have a version that people could look
[01:56:31.760 --> 01:56:34.560]   in their gear, I mean, how many gear VRs are there out there,
[01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:36.640]   though, probably not that many.
[01:56:36.640 --> 01:56:37.840]   - No, but I think that they're gonna,
[01:56:37.840 --> 01:56:39.080]   you can get them now on Best Buy.
[01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:43.280]   - Samsung should subsidize this to sell the damn thing.
[01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:44.680]   - Make it cardboard compatible.
[01:56:44.680 --> 01:56:46.320]   - Oh, would it work with cardboard?
[01:56:46.320 --> 01:56:49.080]   - Might be, I have to think about it.
[01:56:49.080 --> 01:56:53.240]   But the, yeah, my daughter calls the gear VR,
[01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:56.760]   we have one boss, and she calls it the thing
[01:56:56.760 --> 01:56:59.360]   that makes you go to another place that you can't see your feet.
[01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:00.920]   - You can't see your feet.
[01:57:00.920 --> 01:57:04.080]   She's like, I wanna wear the, can I wear the things
[01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:05.400]   that make you go to another world
[01:57:05.400 --> 01:57:06.440]   but you can't see your feet.
[01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:10.520]   - Your daughter is so lucky, she's growing up in a world
[01:57:10.520 --> 01:57:12.880]   that is so different from the one you and I have.
[01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:15.520]   - They only get, they only get 10 minutes at a time,
[01:57:15.520 --> 01:57:16.960]   like 10 minutes in the evening to play with it,
[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:18.480]   'cause I don't know what it'll do to their eyesight.
[01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:19.560]   - Yeah, you're right.
[01:57:19.560 --> 01:57:20.920]   Do they irp up ever?
[01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:22.920]   - No, no, they're fine with it.
[01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:24.280]   - 'Cause I'm about to.
[01:57:24.280 --> 01:57:27.040]   (laughing)
[01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:29.000]   - Well, you know, I would love to do that.
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:30.760]   I think we could do that.
[01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:32.280]   - There would be an audience of 100.
[01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:33.520]   I mean, it wouldn't be a lot of people,
[01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:35.000]   but it'd be kinda cool.
[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:35.840]   - Well, let me think about it.
[01:57:35.840 --> 01:57:36.960]   - Let's talk about it.
[01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:38.480]   We could talk offline.
[01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:39.800]   - Yes.
[01:57:39.800 --> 01:57:40.640]   - Yeah.
[01:57:40.640 --> 01:57:43.880]   You call me Daphte Leo, that's right.
[01:57:43.880 --> 01:57:46.600]   (laughing)
[01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:48.000]   - Hey, thank you for being here, Alex.
[01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:48.840]   We appreciate it.
[01:57:48.840 --> 01:57:51.880]   Andy Inako, Chicago Sun Times.
[01:57:51.880 --> 01:57:55.360]   He lives in the past.
[01:57:55.360 --> 01:57:57.520]   - But it's a good place when you're Andy Inako.
[01:57:57.520 --> 01:57:58.360]   It's a good place.
[01:57:58.360 --> 01:58:00.960]   - Okay, I don't have the magic ball of camera,
[01:58:00.960 --> 01:58:02.040]   but I can buy.
[01:58:02.040 --> 01:58:03.720]   (laughing)
[01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:05.400]   - You've got pixels in the background.
[01:58:05.400 --> 01:58:07.120]   (laughing)
[01:58:07.120 --> 01:58:08.320]   - I can only, I can only,
[01:58:08.320 --> 01:58:11.320]   I can only record four great graphics from my background.
[01:58:11.320 --> 01:58:12.560]   Sorry, Alex.
[01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:15.320]   (laughing)
[01:58:15.320 --> 01:58:16.160]   - You guys are great.
[01:58:16.160 --> 01:58:17.680]   It's always fun doing this show.
[01:58:17.680 --> 01:58:20.320]   As some of these who's just in the chat room,
[01:58:20.320 --> 01:58:21.360]   just realized we haven't,
[01:58:21.360 --> 01:58:22.960]   we've spent two hours and we haven't talked about
[01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:24.800]   the Apple Watch.
[01:58:24.800 --> 01:58:26.320]   - Yes, excellent.
[01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:28.240]   - Well, play. - Nice job, hey?
[01:58:28.240 --> 01:58:29.080]   - Yes.
[01:58:29.080 --> 01:58:30.800]   - Well, believe me in about three weeks is gonna be,
[01:58:30.800 --> 01:58:32.240]   it's all we're gonna be talking about.
[01:58:32.240 --> 01:58:34.000]   So you might as well,
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:35.360]   I just will enjoy this.
[01:58:35.360 --> 01:58:37.280]   - We're all gonna be sitting here like this on the show.
[01:58:37.280 --> 01:58:38.120]   - Yeah, I'm sorry.
[01:58:38.120 --> 01:58:40.640]   I can't talk now, I'm in the Apple watching.
[01:58:40.640 --> 01:58:43.640]   (laughing)
[01:58:43.640 --> 01:58:45.880]   - That'd be great because once we're doing the show like this,
[01:58:45.880 --> 01:58:47.960]   it doesn't matter if like the audio gets out of sync
[01:58:47.960 --> 01:58:48.800]   with the video.
[01:58:48.800 --> 01:58:50.360]   It'd be like, "Touch cargo."
[01:58:50.360 --> 01:58:52.320]   (laughing)
[01:58:52.320 --> 01:58:53.760]   As a matter of fact, if we could just like record
[01:58:53.760 --> 01:58:55.920]   like a six second loop of us like this,
[01:58:55.920 --> 01:58:58.240]   then another six second loop of us like.
[01:58:58.240 --> 01:59:00.560]   - The problem is gonna be getting it to be the right angle.
[01:59:00.560 --> 01:59:03.920]   You're gonna be like, "Oh my God, I can't turn it right."
[01:59:03.920 --> 01:59:07.160]   - Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:59:07.160 --> 01:59:08.600]   we do this show 11 a.m. Pacific,
[01:59:08.600 --> 01:59:12.280]   2 p.m. Eastern time, 1800 UTC every Tuesday
[01:59:12.280 --> 01:59:13.680]   at the Twit Brick House.
[01:59:13.680 --> 01:59:15.920]   If you'd care to visit email tickets at Twit.tv,
[01:59:15.920 --> 01:59:16.760]   we'd love to see you.
[01:59:16.760 --> 01:59:18.560]   It's always fun to have a studio audience.
[01:59:18.560 --> 01:59:19.920]   It's funny, there were like a hundred people here
[01:59:19.920 --> 01:59:22.760]   when I got here, a class from,
[01:59:22.760 --> 01:59:25.720]   it was a Sonoma State or Santa Rosa Junior College,
[01:59:25.720 --> 01:59:31.600]   St. SRJC, and the minute I got here, they left, they ran.
[01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:34.320]   So they could've learned something from Alex Lindsay
[01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:36.240]   next time stick around, okay?
[01:59:36.240 --> 01:59:39.800]   Meanwhile, you must get back to work 'cause guess what?
[01:59:39.800 --> 01:59:42.160]   Break time is over.
[01:59:42.160 --> 01:59:45.160]   (mimics guitar)
[01:59:45.160 --> 01:59:47.740]   (upbeat music)
[01:59:47.740 --> 01:59:50.320]   (upbeat music)
[01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:57.100]   - I wish there were something in here.
[01:59:57.100 --> 01:59:59.340]   (laughing)
[01:59:59.340 --> 02:00:02.660]   - Oh shit, I'm so sorry.
[02:00:02.660 --> 02:00:04.500]   Actually, that's better, isn't it?
[02:00:04.500 --> 02:00:05.340]   - You can't get a pump cart.
[02:00:05.340 --> 02:00:06.700]   - Can you see my eyes?
[02:00:06.700 --> 02:00:08.700]   - There's a character, there's a character for some show
[02:00:08.700 --> 02:00:09.700]   that would look just like that.
[02:00:09.700 --> 02:00:11.020]   It's like bugger.
[02:00:11.020 --> 02:00:13.180]   - It works with villain,
[02:00:13.180 --> 02:00:14.340]   I think villain Batman.
[02:00:14.340 --> 02:00:16.740]   - It works with the bow tie, doesn't it?
[02:00:16.740 --> 02:00:17.580]   - Yes.
[02:00:17.580 --> 02:00:18.420]   - Mm-hmm.
[02:00:18.420 --> 02:00:20.660]   (laughing)
[02:00:20.660 --> 02:00:23.980]   - I'm norm court.
[02:00:23.980 --> 02:00:25.060]   Nice to meet you.
[02:00:25.060 --> 02:00:27.060]   Totally norm court.
[02:00:27.060 --> 02:00:28.460]   - Yeah, it's very norm court.
