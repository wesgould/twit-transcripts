[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.040]   Is here hello Andrew? Hello?
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.400]   The whole how are you today new hat when you were out here? I like it
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:21.400]   Exactly. It's mostly it's mostly there to to inspire at home conversations like do you go to Pixar? Oh, oh, yes
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.760]   I went as a matter of act. Yes. Do they have a company store there or do you?
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.520]   Somebody have to just give it to you
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.280]   No, they have a kick butt company store that has
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.240]   You can't you can't just show up you do have to be like you have to have you have to have a visitor's badge
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.120]   You have to have business there, but it's not just like really cool hats
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.160]   But they also have these clothes and open a pins
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.800]   I bought this like sort of it looks like just a very very like rainbow colored like little flower like beautiful little metal pin
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.320]   That it took me a few seconds realizing. Oh my god. That's for that's that's from inside out
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.960]   That's oh, that's that's the badge that he was wearing that big man. Oh, it's hard not to buy everything right?
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.960]   Yeah, exactly it was
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.760]   Especially because yeah, it's like I did some damage to the old diners club card that that day
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.960]   Also here from Montreal a man who knows has spent money on merch before
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.480]   Renee Richie I'm more doc. Oh
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.400]   So much much a lot of it all merch all the time like behind him. Oh, oh, yeah
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:31.640]   Yes, no exactly. It's an Apple stun gun. Oh, you're showing any the pen you bought
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.560]   Yeah, I wonder where you got that
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.240]   It's so loopy. I'm just happy that I'm not a small little box because of Amazon Leo
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.960]   That's just my only they come in a great box. You saved the box. I love that box
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.800]   It's right now. Yeah, it's round and so these are the retro retro fit pens that
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.240]   That Andy recommended last week and apparently all of us were influenced last week
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:58.560]   Both Renee and I bought a retro I found the silver one
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.680]   I'm gonna match your I yeah, you can get them to match your space gray. Oh, you got more than one
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.320]   Yeah, there's no
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.800]   But that's interesting. So I didn't think of the save in the box. You saved the box and now it's a pen holder. Yes
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.080]   Dumb I'm dumb. I just keep all the boxes as this evidence. I'm a recycle
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:23.880]   So I just was checking I went to the website is it down right now calm and it's down
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.560]   I get a big white screen
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.400]   And there's a reason is it down right now is down
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.000]   It's using Amazon s3 s3 is the
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.720]   Storage and it stands for SS. What is it secure?
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.000]   It's super simple store simple simple storage something like that. Yeah, except it's not working
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.440]   Do you remember this happened a couple years ago and it turned out that their chatter protocol that reported on the status of the servers wasn't checked
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:57.280]   So one error took the entire network. It's always the explanations for these things that are almost fascinating to me
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.440]   It's really fun if you do the hashtag
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.360]   Outage there's lots of fun memes going on right now
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.920]   But what you really learn is how much of the web relies on Amazon storage
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:15.360]   Yep, I mean last time all the pounds icons were down. I mean, let's look how far we come. Yeah, remember pounds
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:22.800]   Yeah, they were using gravatar or something. Yeah, it's not unusual for sites to store to have an image store or store
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.300]   Some assets not all assets on s3
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.360]   Because it's so it's so reliable
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.920]   Yeah, yeah
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:36.040]   Yeah, it's it's it's the application server for so much of the of the net right now
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.280]   It's the hidden success of Amazon
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:46.720]   So let's just just to recap just Jeff Bezos controls the keys to the entire internet and he has his own private space fleet
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.720]   I suggest we be really nice to him for a whole bunch of good reasons. It isn't by the way just
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.000]   Amazon and
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.280]   Here this is Apple system says apparently Apple uses a good goodly number of tools from s3 because I'm seeing a number of
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.080]   issues with
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.280]   FaceTime photos
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.320]   Apple IDs issues and I suspect these are related. Yeah, iCloud is on AWS and on Asia
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.900]   I mean they they take bandwidth okay, so yeah, that's so that means that they're not that's not a red button
[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.960]   It's an issue button because you'll see some slowdowns on the app store on iCloud backup
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:27.040]   Mac App Store I work for iCloud iCloud Drive iCloud notes iCloud web app
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.000]   Amazon video for Apple TV is not affected
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.680]   And Skype seems to be okay. That's what we're using right now
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.960]   But if you're and I don't we use AWS as
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.400]   We use their cloud front service
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:47.360]   For load balancing, but I don't think we use s3 for anything cloud front not cloud flare
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.200]   front
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:56.000]   Not cloud flare. I think it's cloud cloud front. I could fuse it too. Twitter is not down although
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:03.560]   Some of the images on Twitter may well be a disappeared. Yeah. Wow. That's too bad because although if it were down
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.200]   We wouldn't be able to see everybody whine about everything being down
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:13.800]   I'm glad it's down. I mean I'm glad how bad Twitter is doing. It's always the place where you complain about every other service, right?
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:18.320]   Yeah, it's you know, we need Twitter if only for
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.000]   This kind of stuff, right? Yeah, yeah
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:29.120]   This is it's somebody called it the dial tone of the internet. It is it is it is what you know, it carries
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.080]   It carries everything
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.960]   And it's how you stay in touch with what's going on
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:39.720]   Increased error rates finally the Amazon web services dashboard is showing
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:44.120]   The issue as a high error rate with s3 and us east one
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.680]   So they're obviously working on that and
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:54.360]   But about Jiffy as long as Jiffy is up, I feel like the internet can continue. Yeah
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:59.120]   We are so reliant on the internet now in so many ways
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:04.440]   It's really there's no animated gift to show me how I should feel when the internet is down when animated
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:11.680]   Are they on messages that in check? I don't know but I'm paranoid now that the Batman scratching his chin is suddenly gonna
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.960]   I tell me yeah
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:18.600]   Well, that's why like when you sometimes see like people on Instagram make fun of hey, who's this loser?
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:19.440]   Who's got a page?
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.120]   It's just still got a page or hey, dude
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.480]   It's not
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:29.400]   1994 anymore and you have to comment back. Yeah, that person is probably a doctor or an emergency responder because they still
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:36.800]   Pager networks that don't get cluttered up with yeah, they don't go down the the end for the emergency as you do yourself
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.800]   know the emergency infrastructure is
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:43.200]   Shortwave and ham radio is because they can they can come in with a truck and build
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:51.480]   Infrastructure for everybody so yeah, you have to you always have to have two sticks and a and some dry tinder just in case everything goes completely south
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:55.840]   All right. Well, that was kind of an unexpected
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:01.560]   Emergency news we're reporting here and by the time you hear this podcast of course
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:08.160]   It won't be back up and we hope we hope if it's not that's that's significant Jeff is out there. He's pushing
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.640]   You're in Washington give my hand
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:17.440]   My hair's on fire for another reason though, and I can blame I think I'm gonna blame the Wall Street Journal
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:22.400]   For this particular hair on fire incident. They had a story today
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:29.780]   About the next iPhone all the leaks right and this is from anniversary iPhone. Yeah from Takashi
[00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:32.160]   Mochizuki and
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:37.200]   You know, it's the all the things you've read all long curved OLED screen, you know
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:42.720]   blah blah blah super sensitive and then you get to the last paragraph and
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:50.800]   Wait a minute. They said people familiar with apples plans, which probably is Apple right?
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:56.960]   I'm didn't talk to them. Well, but I think in the past at least the Wall Street Journal has been the place that Apple drops these bombs
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.560]   He's a you suspect that it's a let's it's a test flag. Yeah
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:04.320]   Apple would introduce other updates including a USB
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.440]   port for the power cord and other peripheral
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:14.800]   Devices instead of the companies here. It says original lightning connector. Well, it's not that original. It's only been around since 2010
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:18.960]   The models would also do away with the physical home button. Yeah, we heard that
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:22.640]   Uh, is this credible Renee USB-C port?
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:28.640]   Yeah, so we talked about this last time and Apple was using lightning because USB-C just simply wasn't ready in time Apple got
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:34.000]   The advantage using lightning for years before USB-C was ratified and shipped and Apple could control whatever they want
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.760]   If there was a new sort of like an HDMI 8 came along Apple could very quickly add that
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:43.600]   So but they will switch in the instant if they have some compelling reason to Apple's not about chipsets or about feature sets
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.240]   So it's just what can what will help them sell iPhones?
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:52.400]   So if it comes to a point where there's a technology they want to introduce that lightning just can't handle and that might be throughput for
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.640]   Augmented reality for example
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:11:00.720]   They will switch because it is an implementation detail what port they use for them and as they go to wireless charging everything else
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:04.000]   It sort of abstracts a lot of the pain away. So I think it's absolutely credible
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.960]   It just depends if the feature set that warrants the changes already
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:12.400]   And the pain that Apple thinks users and they will experience their will be a advantage
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:18.480]   There will be a howl. There's a howl anyway for them not using it last year. I mean people were so upset they didn't switch to USB-C last year
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:22.560]   It's like 50 50 six and five. Well, I think people like us tech
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:27.680]   You know enthusiasts probably have some USB-C devices certainly if you have a new Mac
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:34.720]   Even a MacBook from two years ago. You have some USB-C cables and stuff and on all the new Android phones are USB-C
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:39.200]   But how much did we spend on the 30 pin the lightning upgrade?
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:45.040]   Yeah, and how much now we have to throw out all that stuff Andy and it's a bigger connector too. So there's a lot of downsides
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.560]   Well, actually there are very few downsides. It does everything the lightning does
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:54.720]   It's ubiquitous people don't have to necessarily charge the licensing fees for the MFI program to implement it
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:59.520]   It's going to be the lingua franca for hardware accessories for mobile devices
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:03.200]   It can charge devices as well as being charged by other devices
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:08.800]   And as far as you know apple giving to giving it to the user users right in the neck
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.440]   You don't buy an apple product without assuming that at some point i'm going to get into the neck
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.200]   and so
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:20.640]   And so it's it's just a fact of life and I I myself thought it was kind of
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:26.000]   Not not unexpected but a little unfortunate that apple jumped the gun by introducing lightning again
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.520]   There was a port that never did anything that wasn't proposed by usbc
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:34.320]   Yeah, it's too bad that uh, they were that the standards committee was was dragging their feet
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:42.720]   but they in the past when micro usb was being ratified there it was other companies were able to introduce a
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:50.800]   connector that was whatever happens is definitely going to be compatible with future micro usb devices if it was necessarily certified
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.800]   So apple, I think they jumped the gun
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:58.800]   Not knowing that it's not i have to switch to a new connector every five years. That's not too bad
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.880]   That's probably going to be a new
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:07.680]   A few new a few new charging cables and for me speaking selfishly if that means that finally I don't have to carry
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:13.520]   What i don't to carry n plus one as many different kinds of kinds of cable when i travel
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:17.040]   I'm looking forward to it usb c is wonderful. It's a little bit thicker
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:22.480]   But again, you're kind of demented if you're worried about making things like a half a millimeter thicker
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:29.040]   Uh, I just think it's nothing but upside after you swallow the the discomfort of having to buy new cables
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:32.640]   Until they get to micro usb c that's what you get in two years
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:36.880]   I mean usb usb is a continuum. We've gone through so many over the last few years
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:40.720]   It gives you a few years at most you know last year when apple took out the headphone
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:45.600]   Cable I said oh, that's a shame because that's going to slow down their adoption of usb c
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:50.080]   It will mean people they'll be selling you a lightning head headphones, which they are
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:54.880]   They'll be selling a lot of adapters, which they are and then suddenly those adapters
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:57.920]   Are a year later?
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:04.880]   How much do you love those headphones of yours? Now you have to have
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:10.320]   Now you have to plug it into a lightning adapter then plug it into a usb c adapter
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:14.080]   Oh, I forgot plus their old light their old-fashioned studio headphones. So you have a
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.800]   studio headphone to one eighth
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.760]   Jack adapter. So basically you've got this much connector
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:26.320]   I just bought the uh the dock for the lightning dock. That was that's great. That's 50 bucks
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:32.320]   It's not going to be a big deal because the apple community and thereby mainstream media is about to discover oil ed burn-in on a phone
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.320]   So we'll have so many games
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:40.240]   I should to be fair. I have many old headphones and none of them have burn-in
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:45.280]   Some do like apple watch burns. I mean every technology has its ups and downs. Yes. I have okay
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:50.400]   And we'll get all the usb c cable follies that android phones have been through
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:57.040]   Fun time I do I love that it's an open standard that you won't that you know that that means that a thousand
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:00.400]   You know flowers will bloom a thousand devices will bloom
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:05.760]   But I feel I mean I go to hotels where there's a clock radio with a 30 pin dock
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:12.240]   Okay, but frankly the last thing I want to do is plug anything that's been used by
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:17.840]   I don't I'm the guy who like even like makes a wrapper for the remote control out of like the ice
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:22.800]   The ice ice tub bag. So I don't have to touch that. I'm not going to put my phone in a dock
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:26.720]   That's I have not sterilized or figured out what's going in and out of there
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:32.080]   Actually, it was probably it was probably fairly safe with a 30 pin adapter, but once you get to usb
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:36.640]   Absolutely should not connect. I don't all it's in all seriousness
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:41.680]   You don't know what's at the other end of that you can you can have data slippers that are just trying to find
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.880]   Whatever information they can find at the other end of that
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.200]   But there's there are a lot of good possibilities there
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:53.040]   I would love to see at least for the mac books and for the ipads if they if they do switch to usb c
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:58.000]   The ability to use the bat use that battery not as a device to be charged
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   But as a device that can charge other devices
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:05.120]   On my some of my other usb c devices I can simply say that I happen to have two phones on me
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:09.040]   One is my real phone and has a sim in it. The other is just something i was walking around with
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:13.600]   So I can actually like siphon electrons out of one tank and put them into the other just by tapping
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:18.720]   Tapping a notification saying please use this as a charger or not a charged device
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:25.120]   There's also just before we get too excited there's a school of thought that thinks the wall street journal because people get all this information
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:29.600]   But they never quite know what to make of it and there's some people are suggesting that this could be talking about the other end
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:34.400]   The lightning connector because famously iphone 7 ship with a lightning to usb a
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:39.360]   So iphone 8 could ship with lightning to usb c and that would be lightning in the iphone
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:44.720]   Sorry, that would be usb c with the iphone. So it sounds like this is pretty this is I mean it is the wall street journal
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:49.040]   So that makes it credible on on the that's face a bit alone
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:51.040]   But it sounds like this is actually
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:56.240]   You think this is actually gonna happen would it happen on at all three of the new iphone usb c for power though
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.240]   Leo that doesn't say in the actual phone
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:05.200]   I I would simply oh wait a minute. Oh, thank you for clarifying. That's exactly right
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.240]   So well, it says port though
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.680]   It says port doesn't say cave
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:15.920]   I'm just hedging because some people can hear things and then all of a sudden it's they've swapped out the lightning to usb a cable for a lightning to usb c cable
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.360]   We're upset again, right?
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:22.720]   But that this says port so i'm gonna I mean you might they may have heard wrong
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.200]   But that doesn't make any sense
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:30.640]   Um, and and you know, they're gonna get a lot of heat, but you know courage. Yeah
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:38.880]   A ball street journal rumor is a rumor, but it's a it's a it's high on the spectrum of rumors
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:41.920]   It's not that's not quite quality yet, but it's better than me
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:47.040]   Ching quote. Well, it means it does it does mean that they had to whoever wrote that had to convince
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:50.880]   A bunch of people and a couple of lawyers that whenever information they have is good
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.960]   Which meant that it could still be faulty it could still be
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:59.760]   Misinterpreted data, but it doesn't mean that hey, I just I was on I was on a plane and some guy was showing off a phone
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.360]   He said that he was a a glass manufacturer from korea
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:08.400]   And he said that this is definitely the new phone and yeah, so that's like ant man my cousin sister's friend
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:12.560]   It was on no names and am I right in saying I've always assumed this
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:18.400]   At least for the last few years that uh when apple wants to float a rumor or wants to you know
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:22.880]   They've done this in the past when they've got an upcoming event to warn people they're not going to announce something
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:30.080]   They leak it to the journal a journal says anonymous sources or people in this case people familiar with apples plans
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.560]   Which sounds to me like apple?
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:37.200]   This is this may well be as you said initially eddie a trial balloon from apple
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.720]   Or at least kind of a warning also be an argument
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:45.840]   It calls to be someone who wants this done and is using this as a way to further their agenda by getting up public saying see see look
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.920]   Look at people are supporting it. I want to win this argument
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:52.720]   Gonna be smart enough not to fall for that or you think oh, oh, I see somebody from within apple
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:58.240]   Yeah, because apple has apple has the same arguments internally that we have on the outside and people win and lose those arguments all the time
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:02.400]   I uh, I'm getting a little surprised if that were the case
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:09.840]   Only because oh my goodness. You talked about a career limiting move talking to a member of the press about apple plans without
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:16.720]   Without like someone from apple pr standing behind you with with the remote control to that chip
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:21.600]   They implanted in your brain. I had drinks with sam seaborn last night and he yeah
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:26.080]   All right, I so all right, so wow
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.480]   Um, wow
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:32.000]   Christina Warren at least it happened before the show. I mean, that's the good thing. Yeah, right
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.720]   We'd have something to talk about next week
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:40.240]   Christina, uh, oh I got actually the the story from Christina Warren. Oh look at this gizmodo is broken too
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:42.800]   uh, uh
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:48.080]   Because she was saying if this happens i'm gonna be both upset and happy right and I guess that's kind of
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.800]   kind of the story from all of us
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:56.000]   This wall street journal iphone 8 rumor is absolutely insane. She says it's insane
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.960]   Uh and her the last paragraph
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:03.280]   I have invested a not insignificant amount of money in uh lightning
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:07.440]   accessories and cables if the next iphone really does have a usb c port
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:13.040]   I'm just going to have to laugh and then cry. I mean her rose gold beats headphones. What are we gonna do?
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:18.160]   I love it that one of the great things about wearing for gizmodo is that you can you can cuss if you want to
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:21.680]   You she I would have to say I would just call
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:28.400]   Bull spit on the immediately she can use the actual word. Yeah, I think I don't think I think though
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.880]   Maybe there's it is more credible than then Christina
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:33.760]   gives it credit for
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:39.360]   Um, and we've you know rumors. It's we're six months out at least from anything so
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:44.880]   Um and the lightning team worked on usbc. It's not a foreign technology. Oh, that's interesting. Okay
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:50.080]   You know an apple was actually we should remember an early adopter of usb c
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.720]   Uh with a macbook two years ago
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:57.600]   Somebody with some people would claim too early because we had to have one google engineer vet every cable for us on amazon
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:58.720]   Yeah
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:05.280]   Uh, so well, okay. I would I for one would welcome it because I do have but I but I acknowledge that i'm not the normal person
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:09.360]   I mean normal person has all apple right I have enough uh usb c
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.080]   phones that I have docs and
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:15.920]   Cheaper by the way a lot cheaper than the $50 apple dock
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:21.200]   I have ecosystem though because all the magic accessories charged over lightning the remote charges over lighting the
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:28.240]   Oh, yeah, right even yeah for my apple. Oh man pencil pencil. Yep. Oh my god
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:33.600]   But again, so you with with other companies you would and I don't mean that this is a dig
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:38.960]   With other companies who would say that that would be of oh, let's take two steps back and make sure we really want to do this
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.120]   with apple. It's like
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:48.480]   That's it those by those by adapters and do we get it with the new ipads in the spring or do they hold it off and have the iphone and then the ipads
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.200]   Are still on lightning? I mean, uh so many interesting well
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:58.800]   I mean if you know you're gonna do it you pull the bandaid off right? Yeah, I hope you spoil it for the iphone. I mean, I don't know
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:05.280]   Let's take a break and we're gonna talk more about what apple's doing in fact. We've got some mac news

[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.960]   Especially for my mom. It's not like she's a day trader
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.440]   She's
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:01.440]   So anyway, yeah
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:04.880]   Does she have any problem repatriating money from from Ireland? No, she doesn't have
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:07.440]   $200 billion, you know
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:11.120]   You they're grumpy. She's been using the Dutch sandwich, but not the Irish turnaround
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.080]   during a q&a session at
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:18.240]   Tuesday shareholder meeting at the campus
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.120]   Tim cook told investors
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:29.040]   Apple is still very much focused on its professional customers and here's here's the uh, here's the pull quote
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:37.520]   You'll see us do more in the pro area the pro area is very important to us the creative area is very important to us in particular
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:44.800]   So this is with regard to mac apple watch. Oh, but really come on prose creatives apple watch
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:45.680]   I don't think so
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:48.880]   Sir watch pro you've heard your personal services and ipad
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:53.040]   But I think really if you're talking pro if you're talking creatives, you're talking mac
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:58.240]   Mac pro is now 1,100 days for that a refresh
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:02.880]   Three almost four years at this point at this point
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:05.920]   Tim is and put up her shut up mode. It's like it's nice
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:09.040]   I hear that you're making noises with your mouth, which is nice
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:16.800]   You're using the words pro in there, which is also nice, but after three years after like
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:22.560]   Discontinuing models that are popular after making really controversial and downright odd
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:27.600]   Choices about projects that you cancel even though they are really wonderful pro apps
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:31.200]   And other projects that you totally pivot
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:36.560]   At least 110 degrees away from what at least most people would instinctively think of as pro
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:41.120]   Again, I I need something more at this point than saying. Oh, we believe free
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:46.800]   We think that we think that la la land has a brilliant future as an Oscar contender. It's like yeah, fine. Okay
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:49.520]   No, that's really true because so many
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:53.840]   I'm not saying I don't believe him. I'm saying that I will that's right now. That's just okay
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:28:00.880]   I write down that he has said this good. I don't that doesn't mean anything to me until he's actually on stage holding up something that
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:09.040]   That the design that design people said my god. This is so ugly. This is this is it's so practical and functional
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:15.120]   That's what I'll believe that he's expected when you see it mode. I mean you got people like Trey wrackliff
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:18.480]   Writing apple is dead to me. I'm switching to windows
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:21.760]   You know one of our favorite photographers good friend of the network
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:26.160]   I wonder people gonna wait people not not pros give up at some point
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:29.520]   You know Trey end up buying a desktop replacement
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:33.600]   You know $5,000 MSI laptop. I mean a big honkin
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:37.840]   laptop because he's a photographer. He needs
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:42.800]   It's not a problem for him to carry stuff around because the things he carries around makes him money
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:47.680]   What he needs is the stuff that suited to his knees. So he's not willing to listen to you say about how
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:54.800]   exceptional this new flat keyboard is and how by removing these ports they've refined the again
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:59.040]   I've got a job. I put time and money in I get money out
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:02.320]   This is a very simple equation and the variable of apple
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:05.840]   We need to remove from this equation if we're gonna keep in profit. Yep
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:08.240]   Uh
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:15.120]   And you can't get an any apple mac with a rainbow light up keyboard. So no there's there's that
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.560]   Yeah
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:21.520]   You can put the hue light strips on and use home kit you turn them on and on this this remember you were saying
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:26.800]   The dis apple design team would say how ugly this johnny. I would literally throw up
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:33.760]   If apple released something with a rainbow key or he was given he was given that poor design team member crap about a rust colored
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:38.880]   Uh clock in an apple watch blocks in that 60 minutes. They that looks like a dorm room carpet
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:42.080]   Yes
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:44.480]   That looks like the biggest strip. Oh wait a minute
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:50.000]   I I sent some joy in this refined it and kill it immediately
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:57.360]   I tell you enjoy it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Do not impose your joy on the user. Let them discover their own joy now admittedly
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:00.960]   photographers have the luxury of using photoshop and lightroom
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:04.640]   And you know most of the tools that they use are cross-platforms. So
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:08.000]   It's not a big deal if I guess if you're all in on final cut
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.560]   You'd kind of really be waiting for a mac pro
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:16.160]   Although what we did and I bet you a lot of pros have done is we we just bit the bullet and we trained everybody in premiere
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:19.920]   And and move to a del workstation
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:24.000]   Yeah, that's that's the vulnerability and also they they drove a lot of professionals
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.640]   photographers away from aperture by saying we don't care about aperture. We're not gonna upgrade it
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:34.800]   So I would have been happy to use i'm not a pro but I would have been happy to use aperture forever because I thought it was great
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:38.400]   I only switched to lightroom because I had to and then that sort of got me
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:44.880]   A few years ago. There was there a bunch of things that got me thinking that I don't want to be locked into using apple
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:51.920]   standards apple only standards unless I think that there's a really good compelling reason for them to be better than
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:31:00.080]   a competing notes app for instance and for my personal needs I found very few solutions that really required an apple
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:05.520]   Solution then when you come down to now it's down to a piece of hardware that i'm using that can run
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:13.120]   Multi-platform things and standards that are available in any platform becomes how good is this piece of hardware for my particular needs
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:18.400]   And all you got to do is change that one thing that this user needs and then they're suddenly saying, okay
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.880]   I can't use this anymore. I'll walk out
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:25.440]   I'll walk out of the apple store with next for 500 dollars in my pocket and I'll just see what's
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:30.880]   I'll see what's going on. It's seers. I think they got some great gateway laptops using the new Pentium for processor
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:33.920]   isn't it?
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:36.560]   apple is
[00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:39.840]   It's official now. I'm gonna open its apple park
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:42.480]   in april
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:47.200]   And start moving in employees although that's gonna take six months to move 12,000 employees
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:50.240]   Well, you rent the u-haul and you got to make a bunch of trips
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:57.680]   Why does it take so long a lot of apple friends are gonna be suddenly out of town that weekend for very good reason
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:59.680]   They don't have pizza and beer
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:04.000]   I guess they're not I mean they're gonna continue to work on it through the summer
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.640]   So I think it might take that long because it's not done like as they finish offices. They'll move people in
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:14.960]   I mean they could do it all in one day if they wanted to obviously. Yeah, also uh, so
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:21.680]   In honor of steve's birthday last friday, he would have turned 62. They have announced that they're naming
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:26.720]   the new theater the steve jobs theater, which I think is wonderful
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:34.000]   And uh, because I mean nobody was nobody was better at those those performances and steve jobs nobody ever will he stage
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.320]   Yeah, the stage is his
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:39.760]   1,000 seat seat on a tournament that's a lot bigger than the current
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:46.640]   Uh auditorium at one infinite loop. That's a what about half town hall town hall. Yeah, like two yeah a couple hundred couple hundred
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:52.880]   Uh, it'll be uh, you know, they have this entryway, which is this amazing glass cylinder
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:56.320]   Wow, and then you go downstairs
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:00.160]   Underground you can see the top of the escalators over here on the right
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:04.800]   Uh and the left actually and you go downstairs into the underground auditorium
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:11.840]   That will be something to see. I don't know when they'll hope what the event will be that they will uh open that but uh,
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:13.920]   That'll probably
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:17.200]   I'm thinking the new iphone. So september, yeah, yeah
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:20.080]   Maybe march
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:23.040]   Aren't the sun later this year so yeah, I'm thinking september
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:25.600]   Yeah, well, it's they're definitely gonna
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:29.280]   Get all the value they can out of this uh, this unveiling. There's there's gonna be
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:33.280]   60 minutes is going to get a whole segment to themselves. Someone's gonna get the exclusive
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:37.680]   Uh, probably it's architectural digest is probably gonna get someone to
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:42.480]   Get get the old wet plate view cameras out to get the get the good photos of it
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:47.360]   Uh, this is it really is a statement of everything that apple believes in that this is how we build up
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:52.720]   This is how we build the campus and we build the campus with the same care and thought that we've used to build our phones
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.720]   Which is probably true. Yeah
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:34:00.480]   Um, it's it's gonna be beautiful. I will apple park have us bc I mean, that's the big
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:10.080]   Uh, so we're gonna charge by the way they did the you know, there was the implication that there would be a spring event and this is well here
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:12.080]   We are it's march tomorrow
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:16.400]   Um, do you think there'll be an announcement of an event this next day?
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:21.360]   Out of the last several three of them were the first week of march and one the last year is one was the
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:26.720]   The 21st of march the last week of march so they have they have time if they want to hit that window just a few weeks
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:29.920]   Away
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:36.320]   It's hard to it's hard to imagine something that's really really big that they must announce in the next month though
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:41.040]   It's feels like if it's if they do have an event in late march or early april
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:45.280]   It's going to be sort of a catchall one where it's here is our new here is a new
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:52.960]   Here is the new ipad with a new screen size and some other performance enhancements here is an iphone in a new color here is
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:55.280]   Uh, some tweaks to the
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:35:01.040]   MacBook line, which is not a redesign but we put new chips in it or here is here is oh and by the oh and by the way
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.280]   If you take the exit that goes through the alley
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:09.600]   We do have a few mac minis in there that we promise you have a slightly slightly faster thunderbolt ports in it
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:13.760]   Uh, it doesn't seem like there's sort of anything on the horizon that seems like wow
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:15.840]   This is the thank god it didn't buy x
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:21.520]   In in november because the really good one is coming out now and well i agree on max but uh
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:24.160]   a new ipad
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:28.880]   10.5 inch ipad pro would probably be a pretty big deal to announce yeah
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:33.440]   It's it's weird i'm glad to see them throwing
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:38.400]   This is this is how you this is how apple demonstrates their faith in a product
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:41.680]   We've been seeing sales numbers on the ipad be very very flat
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:45.920]   But nonetheless the fact that they keep coming up with new ideas they're not saying that okay
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:48.320]   Well, I guess the market has spoken and they don't want an ipad
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:53.600]   They're saying well if we're not selling as many as we thought maybe it's because they want something that's more
[00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:56.080]   Pack but still has a big screen size
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:36:00.160]   So let's try to make something that has the form factor of the classic 9.7 inch ipad
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:01.760]   But has no bezel in it
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:08.160]   So it has the larger screen that people associate with the ipad pro or let's come up with a mac mini that is more uh,
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:13.600]   Has has more protein in it and it can really be an alternative this is four or five hundred
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:20.240]   iPad can be an alternative to they four or five hundred dollar windows 10 notebook or or convertible
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:27.040]   So that's apple definitely has lots of faith in the in the ipad and that's why they demonstrated by actually chipping product
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:35.280]   Here by the way, uh, thanks to gardener in our chat room is the service the event log for
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:38.160]   Amazon's s3 just an update on this
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:42.000]   Uh, these are the the opens mean there's opens that open error
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.160]   tickets so
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:48.880]   Uh elastic beanstalk workmail ses elastic file system s3 operational issue
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:53.360]   That's probably the one that's really affecting a lot of people. This is us east one
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:58.960]   See to his fix. He's too. He's not fixed. Not fixed. Well, they closed something that was known out with this old
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:03.600]   Uh, these are all the february 28th ones. These are the these are the open tickets
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:10.320]   Um, it really is widespread. It's not just s3. It's all over the all over. I am just wait to find out what happened
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:16.800]   Yeah, our site is up, but we're probably I would guess most of our servers on west not east so maybe
[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:19.440]   Maybe that's why
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:26.560]   Um, here's some good news for peep. We we we've talked on this show and others about the issue of a fingerprint reader versus
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:29.360]   a password and how a password
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:32.320]   Seems to potentially protect you better
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:35.600]   Uh due to your right against self-incriminate
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:40.400]   Encrimination the fifth amendment. It's uh, it courts have often held that uh
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:46.400]   Giving up a fingerprint is no different than you know giving up a fingerprint when you're arrested or a hair
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:51.760]   Sample for a dna. It's not self-incrimination and police can reasonably ask for that
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:57.280]   But giving up a password is something you know something in your brain and historically that's been protected
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:01.120]   Um, here's some here's some good news a judge has
[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:07.360]   That i don't know if you remember we talked about this, uh, but the government was asking for a warrant
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:11.840]   Uh that would allow them to go in
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:15.600]   To a premise and force everyone in the premise
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:19.120]   To provide their fingerprint and unlock their phone
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:25.680]   And a judge is now in chicago has denied their, uh, request to do that
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:28.960]   This was part of a child pornography investigation
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:33.520]   And we don't have a lot of information because the uh much of it's sealed
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:36.560]   But this from ours technica according to the judge's opinion
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:39.280]   forced fingerprint
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:41.280]   Is part of a broader government strategy
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:50.640]   Likely, uh to combat the prevalence of encrypted devices. So this is something they're going to want to do more of in fact last year
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:55.440]   Uh federal investigators sought similar permission in a case in southern, california
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:39:01.680]   14 page order, which was published february 16th, but is just now kind of circulating
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:07.120]   Uh judge m david wiseman wrote that while investigators did have probable cause to search a home
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:09.760]   quote these limitations
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:17.760]   Do impact the ability of the government to seek the extraordinary authority related to compelling individuals to provide their fingerprints to unlock an apple electronic
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:20.400]   Uh device
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:25.120]   So, uh, that's probably good news by the way the judge is a former fbi special agent
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:30.880]   So the court finds a warrant does not establish sufficient probable cause to compel any person who happens to be at the subject
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:34.800]   Premises at the time of the search to give his fingerprint. He's pretty you're protected
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:42.160]   Doesn't change the difference between a fingerprint and a password, but it does mean that uh, you can't get a mass warrant at least
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.760]   Yeah, in this case
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:48.160]   We've we've missing a lot of these things like we're they need to get a warrant then you'd have a name on the ward for instance
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:53.360]   So there will be a john doe warrant where they there's an agreement that we will give you we will put the name on the warrant
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:58.720]   When we find out who was there uh, and we will basically retroactively file it and sometimes it's been upheld
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:04.000]   Sometimes it's it depends on how far up the up the chain you want to fight it. It's still something that's being tested out
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:06.480]   uh, and it's
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:09.600]   It's you also have uh trying to get around it
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:16.160]   Kind of differently by using very specific language by saying I need to see your phone
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:20.160]   Which is not them saying I you you you are you are
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:24.960]   Basically, it's not saying you have the you do not have the legal right to
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:28.160]   Refuse to give me your phone if I say I need to see your phone
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:32.080]   That feels like a command they hand it over and then as soon as you willingly hand it over
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:34.640]   That's it. No warrant. It's clean. So it's
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:41.520]   There's a lot of this sort of stuff going on uh by by law enforcement that's do that's doing their job
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:44.320]   And they're trying to do their job as best they can using the tools that they feel
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:48.400]   Are available to them, but that means that citizens have to be super on their guard
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:53.680]   I have to I have to say that I haven't to I'm not I don't have any international travel coming up soon
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:55.200]   but
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:41:00.000]   It really is making me think about what happens when I try to get back into the country and
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:07.040]   If I am asked for I need to unlock your phone or I need the password to your to your twitter account
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:10.880]   What do I do? I probably think that the first thing I do is I make sure that
[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:14.880]   Uh, I uh, I turn off my phone when I when I get off my plane
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:18.720]   So that I don't have to provide a fingerprint that has to be a password
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:20.160]   but I
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:25.600]   It's not it's not unreasonable that I will be spending anybody who says no could be spending two or three hours
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:28.240]   At least at the very least two or three hours in an office
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:31.280]   While they while you you basically
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:36.000]   Convince these people that yes, I am willing to sit here and do nothing
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.880]   Until you say that I'm but we're I'm not being charged with anything and you're and you're letting me go now
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:44.720]   So it's it's tough. You have to know your rights now more than ever. It's an interesting
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:47.280]   for law enforcement because of course
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:53.120]   Uh, if they can't go in and say all right every freeze and put your finger on your phone and unlock it
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:56.320]   then people can just turn their phone off
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:00.880]   Or you know, uh, do something so that the the fingerprint doesn't work anymore
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:05.840]   And so I think that the reason you're looking you're seeing these mass warrants is what that's what they want to do is they want to
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:12.720]   Kind of compel people not to lock their you know kind of freeze in place. Otherwise it gets very difficult to get in there
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:16.240]   They are demanding at the border. They are demanding pins as we know
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:23.120]   Uh, we've heard some cases of people being asked, but then all sorts of extra legal things seem to be happening including asking
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:25.120]   Papers on a domestic flight
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:31.280]   That's the weird thing now is that like again like the used to be we had to think way to the courts figured out the legality all of all this
[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:36.320]   But in the last few months we've seen that what the courts decide and what law enforcement actually does have become two very different things
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:41.040]   And as someone who travels a lot, there's just we're I was talking about this with a friend who's an info sec
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:46.480]   There's no good solution. Some people say just mail your phone, but mail a subject to search at that the border and to
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:48.880]   Uh, duty and other fees
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:54.160]   You can't just put on different accounts. You can't just turn it off because they won't let you go through security with an off phone because it could be a bomb
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:55.840]   They can force you to turn it back on
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:56.880]   Uh, you know
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:43:00.160]   If you wipe something and then lie to them it's often the cover up that gets you in trouble
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:04.960]   Not not the actual thing that you're doing so if you lie and say that the phone is in a different state than it is
[00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:09.440]   You're lying to a federal officer. That's a good point. Yeah, that's worse than you know just the truth
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:16.400]   ACL use saying if they ask for your pen or you ask for a password call the ace say no and call the ACL you
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:21.280]   You're within your legal rights, but as you point out Andy they can detain you for a period of time
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:26.640]   Uh, and if you do decide well, I don't have time to sit here and cool my heels. There's nothing on my phone
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:31.040]   They very likely will unlock it and and take everything that's on it
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:35.040]   And I think that's going to be in the long run the more interesting court case
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:38.080]   You know the the fifth amendment protects you against
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:40.800]   self incriminating testimony
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:45.840]   Test you can't be forced to testify against yourself and the courts up to now have held that
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:48.560]   testimony is speech
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:53.680]   That and that's why they can get your fingerprint. They can get your hair you can they could be forced to blow into a
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:58.960]   Breathalyzer. Yeah, you can you'll incriminate yourself by blowing, but it's not protected by the fifth amendment
[00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:04.160]   It's that it's the fifth amendment is protected by something that is inside your brain that you know that other people don't
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:07.920]   They can't force you to say something you can't be forced to testify against
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:12.240]   However, I got fingerprint is a physical object a key to a safe as a physical object that can
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:18.800]   That's uh, they're also using that to think that well, what if we decide what if we say that the encryption key for this document is
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:24.960]   The equivalent of a physical key to a safe then yeah, it's it's a mess and everybody's
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:27.520]   It's gonna be a big big fight before it's this
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:32.640]   Because what's changed is you know, that's one thing to say give me your breath or hair or fingerprint
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:34.880]   But your phone contains
[00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:40.320]   Your life everything everything and so also privilege is important your phone has more information about your life
[00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:46.800]   doesn't know as much as my and your wife can't testify against you, but your phone absolutely could and that's a legal area that we haven't
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:49.920]   Explored and also as Alex would point out if he was here
[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:55.120]   There's a lot of companies you work at that if anyone takes your device you just have to leave it because you can never trust that device again
[00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:59.200]   Well, that's the other side of it. They take it into a different room. They don't know what they've done with done to it
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:01.680]   So this is why no key is brilliant in
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:08.960]   Rereleasing its 33 10 candy bar phone. They announced it this week at the mobile world congress of 51 dollar
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:11.440]   Phone that doesn't do data
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:16.960]   Doesn't have a fingerprint lock either, but what the hell it's just you know, this is going to be the
[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:21.840]   This this I imagine they're going to sell a few of these phones for people traveling
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:24.480]   Into and out of the us
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:28.160]   It makes my life so much difficult like I can run I can do everything if i'm going to a trade show
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:32.080]   I can do everything on my phone. I can't do anything on a flip phone. I mean, it's just right
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:35.120]   Yeah, but that's a place make
[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:39.280]   Oh blackberry
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:46.800]   I'm sorry. I'm sorry that it's getting as much that phone's getting as much flak as it does because it is quietly brilliant for a few reasons
[00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:50.400]   Number one for for us in the United States there again
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:55.440]   There are people who have clothes that have very very small pockets. So they want a functional phone that can receive text
[00:45:55.440 --> 00:46:01.280]   They want or end or they want a phone that will last for days on battery as opposed to hours on battery
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:06.880]   But what people who make really who make fun of it are missing the point that once you see that this
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:11.280]   Doesn't use high speed data and it has an FM radio when it that in itself
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:14.480]   Tells the entire story about who they're making this phone for
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:18.800]   FM you're talking about like people in india who want to listen to the cricket
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:26.000]   And people who are who are using their using their phones in areas that don't have high speed data or they have high speed data
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.840]   But data costs a fortune and you don't want to use it so that you use your devices
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:32.480]   Inside a coffee shop or someplace with public Wi-Fi
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:39.200]   So this is not necessary if it doesn't make sense if it seems foolish for somebody in the united states who has a very united states
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:41.360]   centric view of the world
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:44.400]   Then it makes perfect sense for somebody who has
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:50.720]   For whom $50 is a good amount of money to spend on a phone that has all the features that are relevant to them and they're part of the world
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:54.240]   So i'm glad to see this sort of diversity and yeah
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:59.280]   I'd be I'd be interested in for 50 bucks having this in my in my drawer somewhere
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:05.120]   For those times when again, I want to take a very very very light communicator with me
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:09.520]   It has an mp3 player enough storage that I can actually put put like a
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:13.520]   2002 ipods worth of music on it. So i'm probably good
[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:17.600]   uh
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:21.440]   We mentioned didn't we mention I think we mentioned this last
[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:26.080]   Uh last week, but I get but it's been getting a lot of press the birchear Hathaway steak
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:30.320]   Yeah in apple more than doubled his uh his uh holdings
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:33.680]   Warren buffered more than doubled his holdings
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:36.400]   Uh, oh a little before they like him maybe
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:39.200]   Warren Warren keeps wanting to talk shut up Warren
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:45.920]   Uh, uh, um, he made some money on it. What do we say is it would be like seven billion dollars in the last month
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:47.040]   I mean just
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:53.280]   I mean he did invest a little bit to get that return didn't yeah, you have to have a billion to make a billion. Okay. I'll acknowledge that
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:58.640]   How much what is the stake? Uh, they about two and a half percent
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:02.240]   Uh of apple
[00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:06.960]   That's one of one of birchear Hathaway's largest holdings second only to coca cola
[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:10.560]   They own 17 billion dollars with the apple stock
[00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:15.440]   He uh buffet was talking CNBC. He said he up to stake
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:18.480]   because of the consumer retention
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:22.160]   That apple has managed the lock-in and
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:25.280]   Tim Cook's smart capital deployment strategy
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:28.000]   apple strikes me as having
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.640]   Here, well, let's play it now. We could play it. Go ahead and talk
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:34.640]   I ask people about products all the time when I take my great grandchildren to dairy queen
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:37.040]   They bring a long friend sometimes. They've all got it
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:41.680]   I like the way Warren does research. He takes his grandkids to great gring. It's very cool
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:45.360]   I also I completely believe that Warren buffet takes his kids
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:47.360]   Absolutely. You know he does
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:50.080]   Yonzo, why not?
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:52.480]   And you know, I I ask them what they do with it
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:56.080]   How whether they live without it and when they try to do it and what they're going to do with it
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:58.960]   And of course I see when I come to the furniture mark that people
[00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:02.800]   Uh, had this incredible stickiness up with the product
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.560]   I mean if if they bring in
[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:11.920]   An iPhone they buy a new iPhone. I mean that uh, uh, it just has that quality that it gets built into their lives
[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:15.120]   Now that doesn't mean something can't come along that will disrupt it
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:16.320]   but the
[00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:18.800]   The the continuity of the product
[00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:23.520]   Is huge and the degree to which their lives center around it is huge
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:28.560]   Don't you think that the Warren buff is actually one of those aliens from men in black that like he'll take his hair
[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:32.880]   Because there's no way this sweet genial old great grandpa
[00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:35.920]   Doing his research at dq
[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:41.360]   Could have made himself one of the richest people in the world
[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:45.840]   This there's some this is all a cover. That's why no one else does it leo
[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:49.520]   They can't believe the strategy is that symbol go to dairy queen and invest a little bit of money
[00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:51.680]   You could be warm up
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:53.680]   The scuttle button method
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:56.720]   This again you get
[00:49:56.720 --> 00:50:04.560]   What a what a radical concept the idea that you don't just let people like write reports and show you
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:09.760]   Tables and figures you go out into the world to see if this report that the data you're seeing
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:14.480]   Jives with the actual world that you seem to live in right now. It's like oh man
[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:20.960]   It's gotta be it's gotta be so bad to be a billionaire in the same time in the same world as Warren buffett
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:25.440]   Because buffett is a great billionaire. He is a wonderful billionaire
[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:29.040]   It really makes you feel like any buddy could do it right anybody
[00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:36.160]   It's like he's he's entitled if if he posted a picture on instagram of him like kiteboarding with a naked supermodel on his back
[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:40.720]   No, say that's fair. He completely deserves that I would do the same thing
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:43.920]   I figure I think truthfully
[00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:46.880]   That this is like he's the front man
[00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:52.560]   But really somewhere deep beneath the the earth in omohana, brassica
[00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:56.800]   There's a 400 000 seabearfoot computer driven facility
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:51:05.600]   That has there's collecting more satellite data and and financial data and is churning it up to give it because there's no how could
[00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:08.160]   I went to darik
[00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:12.960]   So
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:20.000]   Warren buffett is kind of like the what we send the the maras opportunity rover to go out Mars and explore and send information back
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:26.720]   I would be very very impressed by any a lay intelligence that chose a rover as as impressive as Warren buffett to roam the earth
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:29.200]   interfere positively. That's
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:33.040]   Look at this though. He doesn't look at the phone. He carries. He's not probably spent
[00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:39.360]   He doesn't carry an iPhone a little before the election maybe because we were you got to love this guy
[00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:43.520]   20 billion dollars. You're just counting the billions in your head as you said you're doing well
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:46.240]   I was yeah. Yeah, I quit when I got to 20
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:48.960]   That's how much you invested in apple
[00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:54.320]   Why now again is there a reason for this or is it just you look at individual stocks that you wanted to own and you bought them
[00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:57.600]   I absolutely look at individual stocks. It has nothing to do with the federal reserve
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:00.320]   It has nothing to do with the election. He's a coke zero-breaker
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:04.640]   It does have it would have something to do with interest rates if they did something extraordinary
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:06.320]   uh
[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:09.440]   It hasn't had because they haven't been they haven't changed that much but
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:16.320]   There just were a couple of things I wanted to do and uh, and we had the money and I like investing
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:23.120]   And I wouldn't much rather have that 20 billion in these companies and I don't look at it as being in stocks
[00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:27.120]   I look at it as being in businesses. It's just a small pieces of businesses
[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:31.600]   And I would so much rather than have that than have the money and treasury bills, which is my alternate
[00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:35.360]   I don't know he's bullish
[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:37.360]   He's bullish on america
[00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:39.680]   Uh, wow
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:43.120]   He bought 120 million in j- in january
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:47.600]   Before apple's earnings were announced he bought 120 million apple shares
[00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:50.720]   And he said why when they asked why he said because I liked it
[00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:56.240]   Made my money the old fashioned
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:00.640]   I wish I could there's a there's a frame in here where he holds up his phone and it's one of these
[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:04.160]   It is one of these old flip phones might as well be one of them nokias
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:10.800]   Well, yeah, because he said rich people don't need iPhones. They have people that's true. They probably don't even need phones
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:14.960]   Mr grandkids might want to go to dairie queen. Yeah, right? Yeah, exactly
[00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:19.120]   apple
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:24.160]   Is it does he have the call to like turn to his grandkids like did you have any of your news for god?
[00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:26.160]   Because all like all they got are on my wall
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:30.560]   Very oh run tell me about that. Maybe I should buy an intent. Oh tomorrow
[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:34.240]   I'm not I'm not freaking grandpa's not very cash fluid today every
[00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:39.680]   What's not every day at at noon he goes home from the office to his home in which it's uh
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:47.200]   I'm sorry omaha and uh and has a bowl of camels tomato soup and a grilled cheese sandwich the guys uh, he's living the dream
[00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:49.280]   He's living the dream
[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:53.520]   That's why you want to ask
[00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:59.600]   More tomato soup a grilled cheese sandwich and 20 million 20 billion dollars to throw around on one investment
[00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:03.360]   That's all I want. I'm a simple man. He cooks the soup on burning money. I mean
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:08.240]   Oh lord
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:15.040]   Uh, let's take a break. We'll come back with more rene richy from my more dot com andi and not go from the chicago sun times

[00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:17.680]   Mac break
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:25.920]   It's a really good idea like to actually be wearing pants because then the loan officer knows you're the kind of sharpie who can afford pants
[00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:28.080]   You're taking it seriously
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:30.480]   I can't even afford pants officer
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:39.600]   Apple has filed interestingly coincidentally a 14 point appeal against the 14 billion dollar tax edict handed down
[00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:42.160]   By the european commission
[00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:47.920]   Point per billion. Yeah, actually we said this we did this last week. Yeah. Yeah, just
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:52.400]   I don't I don't I still don't understand it. So I still have nothing to say
[00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:55.600]   uh apple has patented
[00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:58.800]   A new technique for avatar creation something we all need
[00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:05.920]   Places digital versions of you and messages and facetime and again, I will emphasize a patent is meaningless
[00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:14.560]   So there was I mean there's a rumor that there was supposed to be a feature in ios 10 messages that would sort of emojified people
[00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:17.520]   But that the results were not scary
[00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:19.920]   They wanted to shift yet
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:26.000]   So I mean, I don't I don't have a doubt that they're working on fun stuff like this for you know craig segment and wwc 2017
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:32.160]   But I will see how far I want look at the put a canadian hat on this person. I I wonder what that's all about
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:35.360]   Do you think this is apple canada did this?
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:40.160]   Well, they have a lot of flying with the engineers from waterloo had to go somewhere leo
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:41.440]   Yep
[00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:43.440]   Yep, I was a blackberry guy
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.480]   According to analyst minchi quo
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:49.520]   the iPhone 8's front camera
[00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:54.560]   Will have the capability with to do math 3d mapping
[00:57:54.560 --> 00:58:01.760]   Uh the part of the augmented reality thing, you know, like google's tango service, which is in some of its devices
[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:04.480]   So, uh, you know, you could have a 3d head
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:07.200]   That's too. Well, you know what I bet you anything
[00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:11.440]   I mean the technology exists to do it. I bet you anything that it was just too creepy
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:16.320]   So someone went to the trouble of making a simulation that projects a holographic universe into 3d
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:19.040]   Just so that we can project ourselves back down into 2d
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:21.040]   This is why i love to call it
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:23.040]   so much
[00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:24.080]   Uh
[00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:30.320]   Keyboard problems for some 2016 macbook pro owners you'd give this much credence. I haven't had any problem
[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:36.960]   I mean like a small percentage of our customers are affected by this problem translates into a lot of customers at apple scale so
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:38.480]   Uh
[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:45.520]   Non-functional keys strange high-pitched sounds coming out of the keys keys with a non-uniform feel I you know
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:49.520]   That's that's that's I think I think they pitched that as a feature that keyboard
[00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:53.440]   Let's let's hear the non-uniform feel and the high-pitched squeal is coming from me
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:59.360]   Here's the hype you only hear the highest pitch squeal. Let's see if you can hear it
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:05.760]   Ooh
[00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:07.360]   The coil and again
[00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:09.360]   So the first one is just the shift key
[00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:14.320]   And then he presses the caps like now remember the caps like has a light in it. So there's some electronics in there
[00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:19.680]   Ooh, that's painful that is the shouty button the shouty button. Yeah
[00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:23.200]   That's good physical interface
[00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:27.280]   I did like the um, well apple apple last week ships iOS 10.2
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:29.440]   Oh, they talked about iOS 10.2.1
[00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:35.440]   Which helped fix the shutdown problem that some people were having with iphone six and iphone six s and I like the method that they use
[00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:41.440]   Because they didn't understand the problem. So in 10.2. They put code in that would take more diagnostics and then they realized
[00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:47.120]   Yeah, they realized that what was happening was as batteries were aging and batteries aged at a different rate depending on how you use it
[00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:51.600]   The more you recharge it the more cycles it goes through if you let it get really really hot or really really cold
[00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:55.760]   It can damage a battery and prematurely age it but what was happening is that we have all these really
[00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:58.720]   The the a series chipsets are super powerful
[00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:05.440]   But we have things like portrait mode and things like really advanced photo filters like may to and prism that really hit those processors
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:07.520]   And if it spiked if it wasn't just a normal
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:12.960]   Ramp up, but if it actually spiked it could panic the battery into shutting down because it thought it was an issue that it
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:14.960]   That it you know a more serious issue than it was
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:20.320]   So they adjusted some things and software to minimize that and they're still I think they said it's solved 60 to 40
[01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:27.360]   60 to 80 depending on which generation phone you had but they rolled that out as a software fix and i'm hoping as they go through these things
[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:30.000]   They're they're better able to do that they hear about a problem
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.800]   They diagnose it they roll out of fix they go on to the next one because to me that's it just a clever approach these things
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:37.600]   here's a good news for uh
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:40.480]   uh swift lovers at some uh
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:47.440]   You know you always looking for people using swift the latest mac ransome ware is written in napples swift language
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:49.360]   Uh by what?
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:56.160]   According to mac world appears to be an inexperienced developer judging from the many mistakes made in its implementation
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:01:01.200]   You will pay me here is my hand bropping it well in the fun. It's a funny thing
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:07.840]   It's ransome ware but if you get bit by it don't don't expect to pay anybody anything because you can't recover your files because it's so poorly written
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:13.120]   It generates uh one encryption key for all file stores the files and encrypted zip archives
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:18.640]   But apparently there's no way to communicate with an external server. So the encryption key is never sent to the attacker
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:21.600]   So you can't send it back to you
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:25.040]   So don't bother to pay the ransom the customer service
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:33.840]   Shuzz I am like I forgot to add that last little bit of code. This was discovered by any virus researchers at eset
[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:39.120]   Uh, it is a second ransome ware program. This one you'd have to really work hard to get it
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:43.200]   It poses as a cracking tool for commercial software
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:48.960]   Like adobe premiere pro and microsoft office and it's being distributed on bit torrent webs and baton sites
[01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:53.600]   So you know what if you if you download that program you deserve to get bit
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:57.600]   Yeah, you know, you don't you don't like any fellow human being to suffer
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:02.400]   But on every single platform these the most of the vectors for getting infected even on windows
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:07.760]   Even on android is you went to a pirate went to a source of pirated software or something that you should have paid for but didn't
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:10.880]   Uh or your someplace to that yeah, so that's
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:17.520]   By the way the researchers are monitoring the bitcoin wallet address used by the attacker and they haven't seen any payments
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:25.200]   So on top of everything else their social media game is not on point. They really have to work on this
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:31.280]   I mean this you got a youtube channel or something just you know get some zaz in the you get those millennials
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:34.640]   I don't even think this shows a vulnerability
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:40.800]   Unmaked touch because you know you have to download and run a program install and run a bad program that doesn't have a
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:42.800]   Yeah, you know, it's not
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:47.280]   There's there's there's there's being a victim of a of malware viruses
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:51.200]   And then there's going to grand central station and licking all the escalator handrails. I mean there's
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:03:03.840]   The platform right ios 10 is now installed on almost 80 percent of all apple mobile devices. That's in five months
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:07.440]   Wow, that is really really remarkable
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:13.120]   16 of all the devices are still using ios 9
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:20.800]   And 5 percent or even earlier those are probably devices too will do upgrade. I would guess yeah. Yeah. Yeah, everything's timed out before then
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:26.160]   So, you know in all likelihood everybody who can get ios 10 has
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:29.120]   So well done
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:36.320]   Well done. That's a very good thing for everybody and I guess we'll see at wwdc. We'll they'll start talking about ios 11
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:39.280]   11 goes to 11
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:45.360]   Uh, gotta use that tagline. Is it shiller or is it petariggy? But who's gonna use it goes to it this year?
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:48.560]   I sure harry shearer gets his check though
[01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:55.440]   Nobody is paying these people for everything there all the music they've done and everything i like uh and harry shearer's twitter
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:59.680]   He i see if i can find it. He says i uh oh i gotta show you
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:05.920]   I just got an alert that apple's uploaded a new ipad pro commercial to leo. Oh, well, we'll play it. Of course you know, you know us
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:10.560]   Um, let me see if i can find here. We'll say that their spinal tap is suing
[01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:18.960]   suing the the companies again because yeah after in 30 years they the the studio claims that the they are owed $44
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:26.800]   In profits and licensing and they said i think that's move the decimal point several spots to the right smell
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:29.600]   11 spots 11 spots to the right
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:31.520]   harry shearer's twitter bio
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:33.520]   Derek smalls he wrote this
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:42.000]   Burns smithers the show podcast and broadcast ebook oj by the sea now at amazon i like it Derek smalls he wrote this
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.600]   uh apple according to
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:49.760]   A report from trend force
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:57.280]   Production volume trend force says production volume for the uh next iphone
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:06.240]   apple is ramping up by an increasing 6 to get to 100 at least 100 million units
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:16.720]   Oh, i'm sorry. No, I got it wrong the report claims a production volume of all iphone devices for 2017 is projected to hit 230 million
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:20.320]   That's the 6 annual increase. Wow
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:24.000]   Is that the super cycle to 6 make a super cycle? We'll have to wait and see
[01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:30.160]   I like the west guy or the west better there. They're my favorite for the great lakes trend force trend force
[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:34.240]   Uh, yeah, what these are analysts right there. Oh, they're just making stuff up
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:40.640]   It's our windows fallen. It's going to be the biggest phone on the planet. Yeah, it's somebody said that right? Yeah, that's a famous
[01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:42.640]   IDC or somebody was IDC
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:48.080]   Uh, the iOS 10 point 2.1 did fix
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:50.320]   according to apple
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:55.200]   Some of those uh iphone success shutdown issues in fact apple says 80 improvement
[01:05:55.200 --> 01:06:02.400]   Some iphone six success six plus and six s plus devices
[01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:08.240]   Uh, you know showed more battery life than it was actually left and they would just like die at 60
[01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:11.440]   That was the power spike. I was describing earlier. Yeah
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:18.000]   And apparently that's been fixed in software by 10.2.1. They put out the new beta yesterday
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.360]   Did you dare I said we would ask you a grenade. Did you download it and install it?
[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:26.400]   I did I downloaded it. I forgot to install it, but then I woke up and it had installed itself nice of it
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:29.040]   There is a convenience
[01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:32.160]   Yeah, I think I don't know if I mentioned this on the last show or not
[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:37.600]   But I was I was out having lunch with georgia and we saw that a game of thrones the concert was here because an ad popped up
[01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:41.280]   An instagram so I just tapped on it that I talked about this and it and it just let me scan it immediately
[01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:42.480]   Wow
[01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:45.680]   So I didn't have my credit card information because it was a random website
[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:48.960]   But ios the series suggestion thing popped up scanned card
[01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:50.560]   So I tapped that button held up my credit card
[01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:54.880]   It scanned it and then autofilled the address and the telephone number and I just hit a button and said it
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:07:01.120]   That is awesome. I think you did mention that. Yeah, that's really that's the kind of stuff that I like that they're doing. That's convenience, isn't it?
[01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:05.920]   Um
[01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:08.480]   KGI Ming Chi Kuo once again
[01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:14.560]   Apples, uh, oh, this is the 3d sensing phone. Where do we mention we mentioned that yeah, um
[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:15.760]   Um
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:19.360]   Apple rumored to eliminate 32 gigabyte tier with the iPhone 8
[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:24.560]   Starting at 64 gigabytes. They kind of began that trend last year eliminating the 8 gigabyte phone
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:27.440]   It's also getting expensive to get low amounts of
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:32.800]   Assess these torch. I think this is good. I don't know if it's true, but I would it's not a bad thing
[01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:39.040]   Contradictory report sites five apple wireless charging teams
[01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:43.360]   the one who's contradictory on iPhone 8
[01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:51.440]   What I don't even understand this headline from uh apple insider new report highlights apples involvement with wireless
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:54.080]   She with chi blah blah blah
[01:07:54.080 --> 01:08:00.880]   Real story is the picture of seah without her like with her face completely. That's not seah. That's my that's the dancer, right?
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:05.280]   I don't know. I don't know. Yeah, because you know because she was singing and then at the event tim took
[01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:09.920]   Uh, I forget her name now. She was the judge honestly they could get it took her around to show her everything
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:12.800]   And then she'll come report back to see us. Yes
[01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:17.760]   So seah is like the dread pirate Roberts. They just like swept swap the big bow in the wig
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:22.000]   I think she's like the enterprise and I forget her name is at mia is the shuttlecraft
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:26.720]   Tell me have you ever considered a career in international super popdom?
[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:32.240]   But i'll tell you that tim cook is really good at giving demos because he always brings the musical guest out afterwards
[01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:35.520]   He grabs a product from marketing and he does like a full run through of it
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:36.800]   And he does it well
[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:39.920]   And it's always funny because you talk to marketing from some companies and I won't name them
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:41.520]   But I've talked to many
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:45.040]   Mobile and tech companies and their marketing people barely seem to know what products they have
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:46.960]   It's actually and they read it
[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:51.200]   Yeah, and these guys they just rattle off as if they were an engineer just come off the line to talk to you at that
[01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:54.640]   I have it's it's it's your name is absolutely right
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:59.920]   I have had like I've had talks with a pretty high level like product product managers
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:02.000]   I've been working on this for two or three years
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.480]   And so I would ask hey, but so if that if that feature works this way
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:12.160]   Then wouldn't be possible to do a bc and then like they kind of blink and then he and like an engineer
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:17.200]   Someone like huddle over wow that you can do it that way awesome like okay
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:21.280]   I'm glad i was able to train you on your own product
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:27.360]   It feels though there yeah you feel so tim's been using and using his phone for for weeks and months right well he has
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:29.040]   I guarantee you
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:30.240]   by the way
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:31.840]   chat room says
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:33.840]   shuttle name galleleo
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:37.680]   And they are five and galleo said it you said it right leo
[01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:42.880]   The average you how much did you spend on iphone apps?
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:47.200]   Last year how many apps did you download the average user in the us
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:50.960]   Spent $40 on apps and downloaded 33 of them
[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:56.160]   I bought the holiday bundles and pokemon go out and you want to think about how much I I've always spiked this year
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:59.600]   That seems yeah, that does seem low
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:03.360]   Because people like read they just get a product and they dump it yeah
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:07.040]   Um
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:10.000]   It's not a paying economy the app economy anymore
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:15.680]   iPhone 7 plus explodes but one right
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:21.120]   Yeah, and then every every phone has a hue feel that go off right not only that but it's it's there
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:27.280]   The the better technology. It's just if anything happens the battery even the best made phone can just ignite
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:30.880]   So that's not a big deal. It's when it's when you have lots and lots of them going up
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:37.600]   It's when again the it's when the faa decides to make it a rule make it illegal for a plane to take off before you tell the entire
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:41.280]   All the power pastor list that their phone sucks. That's when you got a problem
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:44.160]   Yeah, oh what I meant all I meant is that if you go back
[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:48.880]   You'll find any like an instance or two of almost any generation iphone or almost any phone is sold in mass
[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:53.920]   Chronic many manufacturers because the laws of averages is a dictate that there's one or two bad ones or they get dropped like any
[01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:57.600]   Set or something happens to the battery and they go off but it's when you have a a problem that rises
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:00.400]   But on this peon it's typical anomaly that you have a concern
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:05.520]   Yeah, this is the video from the arizona teen of her phone smoking
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:09.280]   And uh wow that's that's pretty bad
[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:15.200]   Yeah, but what was she recording with if her phone was a coniting? Oh good question
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:17.360]   Your boyfriend's boyfriend's spending the night
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:20.160]   Yeah, I think she said she grabbed her boyfriend's phone and
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:26.560]   Oh, she's in trouble. I wouldn't have my face right over that. I would
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:28.080]   I
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:31.520]   Be using the wonderful digital zoom feature of the samsung galaxy s7
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:36.400]   At least hold the phone at arms length ironically you shot that with a note seven
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:43.440]   Uh, let's see. I'm just looking through making sure we get everything in here. Uh,
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:46.080]   Google has added
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:49.040]   MacBook touch bar support for a chrome
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.240]   It's in the canary channel right now, which is the you know, they're kind of very early beta channel
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:57.120]   But that means it'll be on its way. I don't you know, I mean
[01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:03.120]   Yep, and the microsoft's office suite even though they demoed in it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's in the early I figure what they call it
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:07.200]   They're rings. They have several rings like being like rings for the different. Yeah, uh
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:09.520]   I can't unring
[01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:14.560]   I just all the only time I ever am aware of the touch bars when I hit it by accident something pops up that I don't want
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:20.000]   Striped you kind of want better rejection on that. They've gotten really good rejection on the other products and just need better rejection on that
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.800]   Is that a thing if I frick if I switch and I forget to disable it. It just series me all the time
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:31.680]   Yeah, my my friend Neil in the chat and twitter told me uh, show me how to you just drag it out of the toolbar in the customization
[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:36.400]   But you gotta have some stuff there the one I I still have there's the magnifying glass spotlight
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:39.600]   And I spotlight and that's the worst thing to pop up by the way
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:44.160]   You're halfway through typing your password and you realize half of the password is in a spotlight
[01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:47.920]   Field that's better than twitter Leo. You don't want to be tweeting your passwords true
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:51.280]   Can happen
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:57.920]   Colorware will paint your air pods if you want only a hundred six thirty bucks more, but they do look pretty
[01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:01.920]   The kind of that there's the jet black version. Yeah
[01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:09.120]   That's it's easier to see the earwax on a darker earbud or on a lighter one depends on the color of your earwax
[01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:12.000]   Yeah, it depends on the level of pollution in your city. I mean there's so many facts
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:14.960]   Well, wait a minute now
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:20.720]   Yeah, I don't know if I want to get this guy is your wax have a natural color or does it absorb color from the environment
[01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:23.600]   Is it nature or is it nurture?
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:26.400]   That's I don't even I'm sorry
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:30.080]   All I want to know is I would spend that money if you could get them like blood red
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:34.720]   So it looks like you're enjoying your metal so much. There's blood dripping from your ear
[01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:39.520]   You can you a you product blood red colorware has uh, how many colors a lot of them
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:42.240]   Uh, not just black
[01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:45.600]   They've been doing this stuff for years. They're really good at it. I'm really tempted
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:48.320]   So do you send them yours or do you just buy them from them?
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:51.280]   I've we've done both over the years
[01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:56.560]   Uh, I think you it's you're often easier and and sometimes less expensive not to have the ship in both ways
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:14:01.840]   I would love to have customized air pods that is a little bit pricey
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:06.160]   Apparently colorware is running on amazon s3
[01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:11.120]   Is is there any price? It's style. How do you put a price deck on style leo?
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:13.520]   Uh, it's a little bit and also
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:19.040]   Triple it's it's going to be if apple does come with the like super exclusive deluxe
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:21.280]   Sex ceramic foam for more than a thousand dollars
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:24.320]   And if they have the the the the iphone edition line for instance
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:27.280]   It would be interesting to see accessory makers step up and say well
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:32.160]   If there are people who are willing to spend an extra four hundred dollars for the same phone but the ceramic case
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:38.640]   Why not actually produce real rose gold earbuds instead of instead of being a charity item?
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:43.760]   There are gonna be people who are saying wagon won't we just do a $300 mark up by putting our own style brand on them
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:48.560]   It opens the door to a whole lot of uh different ways of putting flair and flash onto things
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:53.760]   Look at these. They're so pretty. They are oh man. This is very
[01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:58.560]   I have to I have to say that I don't I don't think that the that the white air pods are ugly
[01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:00.880]   I just think that they
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:02.960]   For something that calls attention to itself
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:09.760]   It's a weird shape to have dangling out of your ears, but if you have a really beautiful color like that
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:13.040]   It's almost feels like a almost like a fashion accessory
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:15.840]   I'd be much more student putting like a royal blue
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:18.240]   Like a purple set of air pods in my ears
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:24.080]   So they're sold out so you have to send in yours and that's means you're gonna lose them for a couple three weeks
[01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:26.560]   Even do the box
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:30.320]   Oh wow, oh wow, I know yeah, and you could have two different colors for the box
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:33.760]   Yeah, and they they'll leave them. They even resell screen. They're left in the right
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:38.640]   I think that's I would love to see a video how they everything they do to make it look like a stock
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:42.160]   Ship product here. I'm I john. I said how you dad?
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:47.680]   So um, so you say the color wears good. They do they do a good job. So this would be worth doing
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:52.640]   This would be so worth doing look how pretty oh, they don't do the inside though. So you have a white
[01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:54.720]   inside
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:59.520]   Like a tuxedo like a little tuxedo the two tone is nice two tone. Oh is that pretty?
[01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:02.480]   Oh your pod cufflinks. That's a great idea. You're right
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:08.640]   Place to a place to talk like secret service. Just lift your arm up and
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:15.760]   Listen to the every time you wipe your every time you wipe your nose though you're you're telling syria to do something
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:25.920]   Uh treasure trove. This is good. I like this treasure trove of apple internal memos discovered in a thrift store
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:29.360]   in a thrift store it was up in uh
[01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:32.560]   Seattle's good will
[01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:40.560]   A redditor saw a cache of internal memos progress reports and legal pad scribbles from 1979 and 1980
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:43.440]   Apparently they belong to jack mcdonald
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:47.040]   Who was the manager of system software for the apple two and the apple three
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:51.520]   Which by the way the documents referred to by the code name sarah
[01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:57.280]   Uh, I guess uh, I don't know what happened. How how did they get?
[01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:58.880]   in the
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:02.480]   This is a place you read it for finding all this stuff. Yeah, it's amazing
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:05.200]   I wish as three were up because we could read these
[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:09.440]   I read them. I read them over the weekend. They're really cool
[01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:17.440]   It's it's the entire development practically from start to finish of apple trying to figuring out how to do copy protection on apple two software
[01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:19.440]   This is when apple apple
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:26.000]   Software stopped started be software started be stopping something that you just simply share with people and started being commercial
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:30.720]   commercial stuff and they're trying to figure out. Okay, so how what do we do about this? Do we
[01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:34.240]   Let let we do it. We just like have independent
[01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:41.280]   Developers create their own systems or do we create our own system that is absolutely certified that will definitely work with our stuff
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:43.520]   And we add on to our business
[01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:49.200]   People will people companies will come to us and we will and we will basically they send us a master. We will send them back
[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:55.840]   Uh a disc that if they duplicate it will have a special software that will duplicate mass duplicators for them
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:18:00.320]   And they're going back and forth over all kinds of different solutions and it was uh, uh,
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:10.000]   Wiggins wiggle and uh was who had two different solutions? Uh, one was uh, was this was really really clever. He noticed that
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.480]   uh every
[01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:18.720]   Every nibble had some unused bits in it on the disc that was just for
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:25.280]   They they were just weren't being used. We just who we thought what if we actually use those four bits to have like a code
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:27.680]   Because the ordinary operating system
[01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:33.680]   Ignores them because they're not important, but our version of the operating system where our protected disc will look for them to make sure it's there
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:38.720]   And so there though every bit of data being written will essentially have a piece of copy protection on it
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:42.080]   Uh, and meanwhile they're they're looking at like a visi calx
[01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:48.160]   a copy protection scheme and uh the pros and cons and i think at one point we emailed back. Yeah
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:55.200]   In regards to visi calf scheme, uh, I broke it in an hour and 15 minutes. So take that as a
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:19:01.520]   For what it is, but you do see all the back and forth you see handwritten notes from meetings you see the formal notes
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:08.080]   You see the uh requisition forms for here is the project we want to do here's how many how many people were going to need here are the risks
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:09.920]   Uh
[01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:13.520]   Yeah, it's it's really interesting and there's there's something to go to steve jobs
[01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:18.800]   There's some that go to other people you've heard of people that you haven't heard from even in 1979 1980
[01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:24.080]   You see that apple had become a real company. This is really fast. This is the kind of stuff man
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:25.120]   I wish
[01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:31.680]   There's after you know a certain statute of limitations runs out or you know everybody involved has passed away or something
[01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:34.800]   This would this stuff should be somehow made public
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:39.760]   Uh, five really good ones like yeah, yes, d will fire that bozo
[01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:43.280]   But could you please narrow down which of the 12 people you called the bozo today that you want to
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:50.320]   Yeah, but I mean still fascinating I agree with any just reading about their attempts to come up with a copy protection scheme that
[01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:54.480]   Kind of balances the need of consumers with their need to protect the software
[01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:57.680]   Um, and you know they it's really interesting
[01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:02.960]   It's really here's the software experts dick houston anti-hertzfeld and randy wiggington
[01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:10.320]   Should it's a good scheme should be at least an hour and for a copying the disc
[01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:13.760]   Uh, just really I just this is fascinating just
[01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:19.280]   Just fascinating stuff. I love seeing this stuff here's even some handwritten notes and
[01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:25.360]   So it was a specific it sounds like most of this trove and all of which by the way has been scanned in is
[01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:30.160]   Available as a pdf. Yeah, uh, so if you really want to look at it
[01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:34.000]   I recommend it. It's fascinating particularly if you're on an airplane
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:38.000]   It just to look through here is the it's all in chronological order
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:42.560]   So you get to see well the bat what the arguments are with the back and forth star with the well
[01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:48.640]   Let's let's go back a step and figure out exactly what our goals are because at some point someone had to be lectured on okay. Look here is
[01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:51.840]   There is a point at which somebody is going to steal the software
[01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:57.360]   So it's stupid for us to try to uh for us to try to inconvenience our users and everybody to try to make that happen
[01:20:57.360 --> 01:21:01.920]   We're just trying to delay the people who are going to uh, we're going to do it casually
[01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:09.280]   Um, but yeah, it is great reading. I don't I downloaded it as soon as I saw it thinking that there might be some people who might want to take this down
[01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:12.240]   So i'm going to actually save this locally. Uh, the chris espanosa
[01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:16.640]   Found it uh found the link to it pretty quickly and
[01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:21.200]   Added some notes. I think uh on his own twitter feed and said hey if you guys what if you have the originals
[01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:24.080]   I would love to have it for the computer museum because it is again
[01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:30.000]   It's documented history think think about all the great stories about uh about the apollo program that come out when
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:34.800]   It's 30 years after and all these engineers are in their 60s 70s and 80s
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:39.120]   And they have all these stories that they want to make sure don't die with them
[01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:45.120]   And they also have like papers and documents and stickers and things that that they want to show people
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:49.200]   And that's when you really appreciate the full story about this engineering achievement
[01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:55.040]   So i'm just hoping that I don't want i don't want apple technology to feel like well, there's this magical land
[01:21:55.040 --> 01:22:00.560]   There was this magical ring ring shaped palace from which the magic appears like no
[01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:04.080]   There are a lot of people who fought really really hard there the the word
[01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:10.720]   Butjack was was was was it was uttered in in anger about the decision to move this port from here to there
[01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:18.400]   And but by the time there was a a public demonstration everybody was on the same page. Yes, really really neat stuff
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:20.160]   um
[01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:25.200]   I think what I think they got was to comment on it as well. So again, he he developed one of the two
[01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:27.840]   two schemes under consideration. Yeah
[01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:33.840]   Really interesting because he wrote he wrote the he created the controller. He was like mr. Discoporing system. Yeah
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:38.480]   Yeah, but I think uh
[01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:40.880]   It sounds like
[01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:43.040]   uh
[01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:49.200]   Oh, no, they they haven't yet got so gizmodo reached out to was for more information, but I guess he they haven't got him to coming in
[01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:52.080]   Fascinating fascinating discovery
[01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:55.600]   What a find. Yeah, you know what i'm gonna save this too
[01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:58.720]   Yes, because it's it's it's
[01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:01.600]   I would you know, I'd guess what happened is a somebody uh
[01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:04.240]   Somebody uh
[01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:10.320]   Saved all of these memos into one folder that somehow got packed in a box that was somehow brought to good will
[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:12.800]   Yeah
[01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:19.920]   Think about think about every over the over the previous decades all of the great stuff that wound up in a landfill
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:24.480]   Including like original apple one development development boards
[01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:31.200]   Every scrap and notes that went into uh into the mac before this stuff was under triple double secret lockdown
[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:36.880]   Yeah, I was I was a dumpster diver when I was a kid in the technology belt to here in boston
[01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:44.080]   And the things that I would find were just really really cool. I felt like I was being I felt like I was I was an ecological
[01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:48.480]   Recycler by taking these things out of like polaroids trash and digital's trash
[01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:52.560]   Uh, and it just bottles the mind to think of what you could do with the time machine
[01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:56.320]   A pair of pair coveralls and like a part-time job
[01:23:56.320 --> 01:24:01.440]   Riding riding a garbage truck in san hose in the late 70s early 80s
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:05.680]   you may remember the uh iconic picture of
[01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:08.320]   uh, steve jobs, uh
[01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:10.880]   looking at uh
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:13.040]   Uh, actually this is I'm gonna get the full picture here
[01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:17.200]   uh looking at the camera and with his arms folded on top of a
[01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:22.800]   uh, a mac and tosh is a very famous time magazine cover when uh steve passed
[01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:26.080]   Uh, you can now uh get the watch
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:29.040]   Seiko has decided to do a limited run
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:34.480]   Of steve jobs watches from that portrait they'll only be sold in japan
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:38.640]   But I bet you there'll be a few collectors who will go there. This was the chariot series
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:46.000]   It was uh the watch that steve was wearing in the 1984 norman sif portrait that was on the cover of a time
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:51.200]   He's sitting, you know, there it is. Yeah, uh with his mac and tosh and his legs crossed
[01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:54.320]   It the original watch was auctioned
[01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:58.320]   A year ago for $42,500
[01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:03.120]   Man, that's kind of uh, this is kind of tempting they're gonna sell
[01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:07.600]   Uh, 1,982 units with a white face another 300 in black
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:10.080]   The cost about $180
[01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:15.680]   But again exclusive to the japanese market, but you you could turtle neck is extra turtle neck not included
[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:21.520]   Yeah, I was just thinking about every time I click into instagram and like dan benjamin
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:25.760]   Five out of every six photos is of a different like seiko watch
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:31.840]   Uh mark a warm end all the different like really cool watches he has and and tweet then and post about it's like I
[01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:34.160]   I'm wondering who wants
[01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:39.200]   I think that there are a lot of people in our community who are more interested in being the first to have one of these watches
[01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:44.240]   Then they are to be with the first to have the iphone eight or the new hover car that's coming out in january
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:50.400]   Uh
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:52.560]   Oh, we wanted to see the um
[01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:56.720]   The new what is it ipad commercial ipad pro. Yeah ipad pro
[01:25:56.720 --> 01:26:00.160]   It's another one of those I got a tweet here and i'll tell you how the world can be better if you just switch from a pz
[01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:07.040]   I want to know what it is. Uh, where do you go apple dot com slash youtube dot com slash apple? Oh, yeah
[01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:12.400]   That's good. Can I say that they're not having commercial saying this is why you should switch from a windows machine to a mac
[01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:18.080]   Yeah, mac has a smaller marketing button. Oh, isn't it it's interesting, isn't it?
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:24.960]   What am I getting here youtube on tv? There is caring there there is visibly demonstrably caring
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:32.000]   And then not i'm not saying not caring but not at least being a little bit more quiet about how much you care in so much as you
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:35.440]   Don't want to show any public signs whatsoever that you care
[01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:38.480]   That that is that is your basic
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:43.760]   Right there. I don't know. I think they might have had one touch park. Is this is this the one with the printer?
[01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:46.320]   Yes, yes, here we go
[01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:49.600]   I mean, let me give you the audio so we can enjoy it together
[01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:54.560]   When you're printing personal things at work and you have to run to the printer before anyone else does
[01:26:55.040 --> 01:27:00.080]   Don't print with ipad pro and apple pencil. You can just sign and send off that secret new job offer
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:03.120]   New job. I'm not looking for a new job. I'm very happy here
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:06.480]   That's funny. It's cute
[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:12.800]   Yeah, it's even and you get the point which is you don't have to print documents. You could just
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:16.240]   Sign them on your ipad and email them
[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:23.360]   Which would be which would be a wonderful point if not for the fact that windows machines are basically usually touch devices and often come with pens
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:25.440]   but hey again
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:30.640]   Well, it's funny because I had this conversation with my mom because she went she switched to everything to online banking
[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:34.000]   But then she was still print off a copy of everything that she got online
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.640]   You know it went she went paperless, but for safety's sake
[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:38.160]   She had to print out a copy
[01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:42.000]   Yeah, we just sat down and went through everything and now she's much better at a digital workflow
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.360]   But it was it was a hurdle
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:47.200]   I think holding that thing in your hands and just getting used to it is part of that that shift
[01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:52.080]   So maybe you've heard that it's a lot of hard work making iPhones
[01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:57.200]   That's some of the employees at Fox Conner not so happy doing it. Well, I got I got something
[01:27:57.200 --> 01:27:59.600]   Uh, I got to differ with you apparently
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:05.040]   Fox con workers who have been asked to shift to assembling other phones
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:08.160]   quit
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:12.480]   They'd rather leave then deal with a lower pay and the lower safety precautions
[01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:15.600]   When building goods from companies other than apple
[01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:24.160]   So there that's really comes from I you know to apple's credit that comes from apple's insistence
[01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:28.720]   that uh, you know if if you're going to be building apple products you better be
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:32.240]   Taking care of those workers at least better than you do the rest of them
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:34.560]   so
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:36.560]   so there
[01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:37.920]   Take that
[01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:42.560]   Take that let's take a break and come back because you know what I'd like to get next
[01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:45.520]   Your picks of the week my friends
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:49.280]   But I'm going to pick something that I really like
[01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:54.640]   Something I like so much I interact with it for hours every single day
[01:28:54.640 --> 01:29:03.040]   Up to eight hours every single day sometimes nine if it's a weekend my cast per mattress my cast per mattress
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:05.920]   Casper is the pioneer
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:08.560]   They were the first to say you know
[01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:11.680]   All it took was you know, they walked
[01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:14.160]   You guys who started Casper they walk into a mattress store
[01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:19.760]   They look at the mattress store they look at the markup and they know how much it costs to make those mattresses and they're thinking
[01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:22.240]   This is a business ripe
[01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:24.640]   ripe for disruption
[01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:28.960]   So they started making the mattresses themselves and selling them directly to you for a fraction of the cost
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:33.440]   No showroom saves them a lot of money eliminates that middleman markup
[01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:37.360]   But then they thought well, we got a problem. We don't have resellers. We don't have showrooms
[01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:43.200]   Yeah, that's great for the consumer for the price, but don't consumers want to sleep on the mattresses first
[01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:45.520]   So they said I know how we solve this
[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:50.320]   They can sleep on the mattress first they can sleep on it for a hundred days a hundred nights
[01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:57.680]   And return it for every penny back if they're not happy. That's right. You have a hundred nights to try out a cast per mattress
[01:29:57.680 --> 01:30:04.000]   Casper is obsessively engineered made with supportive memory foams for a sleep surface with
[01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:08.800]   Just the right sink just the right bounce. It's breathable. It sleeps cool
[01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:13.920]   It helps you regulate your temperature through the night and it lasts a long long time
[01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:16.720]   Got it got my son through college
[01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:19.440]   You can buy it online completely risk-free
[01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:24.960]   In fact, we just ordered a Casper for my daughter who just moved into her first adult apartment
[01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:28.080]   And uh, I gave her the IKEA bed
[01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:33.600]   That we had in the guest room with the IKEA mattress. She said dad. This is horrible. I said don't worry
[01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:38.560]   Look for a box on your doorstep. It's a brand new Casper queen
[01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:46.000]   And that's the beauty of it comes in such a compact box. It's really easy to get up. She's on the second floor get upstairs get into the house
[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:49.520]   Casper understands the importance of trying out a mattress
[01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:54.080]   So they give you free delivery and painless returns within a hundred day period
[01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:56.560]   So you don't have to lie down in the showroom
[01:30:56.560 --> 01:31:01.920]   And absolutely it's absolutely true if you've ever done it and I know I have many times
[01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:06.160]   That's how I chose this bad mattress for my daughter. It doesn't matter what it feels like in the showroom
[01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:08.160]   That's not what it's going to be like in your house
[01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:10.720]   Casper free shipping free returns
[01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:15.200]   US and Canada get a Casper mattress today and you'll save a
[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:21.360]   $50 on your mattress purchase when you go to Casper dot com slash mac break and enter the promo code mac break

[01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:35.280]   Everybody sleeping on Casper mattresses. They're just that comfortable. I know there's a
[01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:40.320]   There's initial hurdle. I get email from people all the time who say I bought a Casper and I love it
[01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:45.440]   And I know there's that like I don't know should it but it really it's it's really easy to return it
[01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:48.320]   I hear I don't know anyone has returned it, but it's really easy to return it
[01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:54.800]   So you shouldn't be reluctant to try it out and you will save mine money here. So great. Yeah, they're awesome. Oh great
[01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:56.720]   uh
[01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:58.720]   Okay
[01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:03.440]   Who wants to start? Why don't we let and he's he's written his in so oh
[01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:10.080]   Public shaming public shaming he wins andy you're the good boy today
[01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:15.920]   What is your well the week? Uh the raspberry pi organization. I one of the top five
[01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:21.920]   Greatest companies innovative companies really interesting companies doing things today. Uh, they today
[01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:25.760]   They just released this which is the rasp movers in the red
[01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:32.160]   You have this. Yeah. Yeah, this is the I have an advanced version of this. This is the raspberry pi w
[01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:34.880]   which is the
[01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:40.720]   Let me just say this is this is a single core computer running linux
[01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:46.000]   Uh that has uh usb it has wireless bluetooth. It has wi-fi
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:50.000]   It has a camera connector and it also has hdmi out
[01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:55.040]   directly from the board itself. It's powered by any
[01:32:55.680 --> 01:32:59.680]   Uh, any micro usb connector power including battery
[01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:05.040]   It also has a gpi oh header so that you can wire in switches sensors
[01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:10.240]   Uh, anything power anything you want 10 bucks 10 freaking bucks
[01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:15.840]   For what you can run a desktop operating system that runs the chrome browser uh chromium browser on
[01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:18.720]   Uh, it is so cool
[01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:24.240]   Uh, it's uh, it's everything that I usually rant about the raspberry pi is also true of this
[01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:29.520]   It's not as powerful as the main, uh, raspberry pi three, uh that came out last year
[01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:34.800]   Uh, but it adds the by adding wireless to the raspberry pi zero
[01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:36.160]   It
[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:40.000]   Takes away a little bit of the complexity you had to add to the raspberry pi
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.560]   Zero in order to make it a little bit more useful
[01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:45.360]   So essentially I can put it inside this is that they also commissioned
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:49.200]   Designers come up this really cool like little like stick a gum sort of case for it
[01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:51.040]   But the idea is that you can just basically
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:55.920]   Install whenever operating system you want or even a media server onto this little card
[01:33:55.920 --> 01:34:00.240]   And then just put this in your bag and so anytime you need a desktop computer
[01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:03.760]   You can just uh actually have this running you can even run it
[01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:09.280]   Uh, uh, run vnc on it so that you can just anytime you need like on your ipad
[01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:16.320]   Something akin to a desktop operating system that can take sd cards use hard drives connect to servers anything
[01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:19.680]   You can just plug this into like your battery your phone battery
[01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:24.960]   Uh charger, uh, and then just basically connect to it over wi-fi vi vnc and have a
[01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:32.800]   Perfect like, uh, debian, uh, debian linux desktop running in a window on your ipad or you can decide to
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:35.520]   uh, take your
[01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:38.560]   Take your walley action figure
[01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:45.360]   Install this board inside and by running wires from this gpi-o to the basic circuitry inside
[01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:48.640]   Inside eve make it a network addressable
[01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:55.360]   Network controllable version of this doll or if you wanted to take an old camera and turn it into a like a
[01:34:55.360 --> 01:35:01.120]   1950s Kodak brownie camera and turned it into a brand new digital camera
[01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:05.920]   You could hollow out the insides put this in a camera inside it and create your own software for it
[01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:10.640]   Or if you wanted to have a weather station, you can just put this 10 freaking bucks
[01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:15.840]   So basically put it outside put it underneath a flower pot with a little with a couple of wires sticking out of it
[01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:21.280]   That will have temperature sensors on it and now you can basically pull this little device that's running 24/7
[01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:26.080]   Doing nothing but finding weather data and posting it to a little web server that's running on itself
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:30.160]   There's so many things you can do with it. You just buy this and have it and you play with it
[01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:35.920]   I'm going to tell you that uh, it's uh, these things go as soon as they introduce a brand new product
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:40.640]   You can't buy them anywhere. They already sold out their first their first shipments today
[01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:42.640]   Uh, and there's a long long waitlist
[01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:47.760]   The only way you can buy one is if you buy like a packet the company that's putting this together with like you get cables
[01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:50.720]   You get breadboards and stuff for $90 instead of just the $10 thing
[01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:55.440]   It has been all I can do to not like wire this into a couple of different projects
[01:35:55.440 --> 01:35:58.960]   Because this is the only one I have and it's the only one I'm going to have for several weeks
[01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:06.960]   Uh, it's like the amount of creativity the amount of excitement that uh, no other computer has created this level of like
[01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:10.640]   Oh my god, all the things I can do with this all the things I didn't want to do with the computer before
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:13.440]   But now I want to do this. Uh, I've been created with the raspberry pie
[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:20.400]   Soch and they just keep finding ways to make this the raspberry pie more and more awesome to more and more people
[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:24.880]   Make it more and more affordable. This is 10 freaking dollars. Just buy it
[01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:28.960]   You'll have fun. Does that include the case because I really like the uh, the little case
[01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:34.960]   The case is pretty awesome. Um, it's uh, that doesn't include the case the case is extra actually I don't know what the case
[01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:37.920]   Case goes or but not that sweet. Yeah, exactly
[01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:42.880]   Put it back there, but yeah, it also it has the great thing is that the case comes with the
[01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:45.440]   the case comes with uh
[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:47.760]   Like a whole bunch of different sets of cutouts. So this is
[01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:52.960]   This is what you would have it if you were trying to run it as a media server. It's like pretty much tied up
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:37:00.480]   It has cutouts for all the different ports in there. Uh, they also have uh, a version that has a cutout for the camera lens
[01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:03.680]   If you're putting it with putting together with uh, the pie
[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:09.600]   The standard like a raspberry pie camera, uh, and uh, they also have one that has the gpi
[01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:14.320]   Oh header cutout. So if you want to basically plug a ribbon cable into it, that'll work great too
[01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:19.680]   So again as soon as as it was I felt as though it would be wrong
[01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:24.800]   Because I had advanced knowledge of like who was going to be selling it and when it was going to be available
[01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:27.680]   I was like, what if I just stay up and just have
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:33.280]   Have bookmarks to all five of these stores open and order one from each of these stores
[01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:38.720]   I decided that that's probably not in this not in the cooperative spirit of the raspberry pie community
[01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:40.880]   But oh boy did I want to?
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:46.240]   10 bucks go to raspberry pie.org for more information that also has lists of the stores that have it again
[01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:51.840]   Uh, you'll today if you want one you will be happily joining a bunch of mailing lists
[01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:55.360]   Of of stores that will email you when this becomes available
[01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:58.640]   Uh, but it will probably be a month or so before it's easy to get one
[01:37:58.640 --> 01:38:03.600]   Yeah, but good news is they've gotten pretty good at cranking up production over time and so
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:07.680]   Yeah, uh, yeah, this is that's a 10 dollars raspary pie
[01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:10.640]   This is the zero, but this is the zero with it
[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:15.120]   With wi-fi and bluetooth, uh, and so the zero which was five bucks
[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:19.520]   10 bucks 10 bucks for really a full fledged pc
[01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:22.560]   Full french full fledged desktop computer
[01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:27.440]   That's the the raspberry pie three like the big one that costs all of 35 dollars and oh my god
[01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:31.360]   It's the size of a pack of cigarettes if you can believe such a thing that one's big enough you can really
[01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:35.680]   Basically do anything with it. You could do with your phone. It can run a media server
[01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:42.080]   Uh, it can play like hd video onto onto a big screen. This is somewhat more limited. It will do
[01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:47.280]   Running doing work processing running decent web pages. It'll do that
[01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:52.800]   Maybe it's not as good for again playing hd video, uh on a hotel hotel tv
[01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:54.480]   Uh, but
[01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:58.480]   10 bucks that means you buy it you play with it and then you find out everything you can do with it
[01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:06.320]   Because you have a great brain and great creativity and there's a type of technology and a type of computer that only you can conceive
[01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:08.960]   And only you can build and for 10 bucks you can build it yourself
[01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:13.040]   Uh, and I want to thank father robert who I guess uh, knows somebody
[01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:18.080]   At raspary pie because this is his raspberry pie zero w
[01:39:18.080 --> 01:39:23.680]   Uh, but i'm sure that means that we'll be seeing some projects based on on know how in the near future
[01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:26.400]   You have a pick of the week mr. Renee ritchie
[01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:30.880]   I do I do so, um, I as you know, I've been or as people fans of the show
[01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:36.640]   No, I've been using the apple watch edition the ceramic one lately and I picked up the woven nylon band in
[01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:42.560]   I love the way they named this color. It didn't call it blue or brown or anything. They called it toasted coffee with caramel
[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:45.200]   And it's oh lord
[01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:47.520]   It's well, so I guess with the with and I was making this joke
[01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:51.360]   But I guess with the ceramic it's sort of like a latte which is why I have an affinity for it because it's about like
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:56.080]   The lovely white topping and then you have the band on it and it's just I really like the look
[01:39:56.080 --> 01:39:58.800]   And what I noticed is if you see the watch face in that picture
[01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:04.160]   It it really looks like it's been coordinated. That's the orange color with the dot simple
[01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:10.080]   Um numerals watch face and it really like they take this whole coordination thing to the next level
[01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:14.560]   Because you have you have watchOS and the watch and the band sort of all working together
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:17.440]   And I just posted my review for the apple watch edition
[01:40:17.440 --> 01:40:20.560]   I put it up on i'm more earlier today and I talked to a bunch of people in the industry
[01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:26.000]   Which is a bunch of questions because ceramic watches aren't new and I wanted to sort of figure out if apple was doing anything new with them
[01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:28.320]   And a couple of things john edwards who's uh
[01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:34.000]   A watchmaker in Ottawa was kind enough to spend some time with me describing it and he was talking about you know like ceramics can vary
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:37.120]   They're really really hard. They're harder than the stainless steel watches
[01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:41.440]   He thinks you'll have years and years and years of years and years of use out of this, you know without without scratching it
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:46.880]   But they've they've known to be brittle like if you drop them they can crack they can chip those sorts of things
[01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:51.600]   But he said it looks like the ceramic apple is using is sort of robust and tries to stop that
[01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:55.040]   But also the shape of the apple watch the way that they've done the curves
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:57.120]   And they've done this sort of bullet pellet design
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:03.440]   Metamizes the kinds of areas where he's used to seeing those uh those sorts of chips and cracks in traditional watches
[01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:07.120]   Which have sharper edges and uh rounder or square forms
[01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:11.440]   And he said like if you didn't know any better you think that apple might have had ceramics in mind when they designed this shape
[01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:15.520]   Because it's sort of the best way to do it if you are looking at materials like ceramics
[01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:20.240]   Uh, which I found to be fascinating. Uh, so all in all i'm super happy with this
[01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:24.000]   My big my big regret is that apple does not give you a way to change the lugs
[01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:26.640]   I found some third-party ceramic lugs on amazon
[01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:29.520]   I'm gonna try out and that might be a future pick if they work out
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:34.320]   But just the ability to swap out those lugs so that you can have the huge variety of stainless steel bands
[01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:38.880]   But have them actually match the casing of the ceramic watch. I think would be really cool very nice
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:43.760]   I got a little tip. I just cheap like 50 bucks. Yeah, the truth the watch is not cheap
[01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:49.040]   No, but the bands. Yeah once the once you pay for the watch the bands are around the bands are nothing
[01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:52.800]   Yeah, but I you know I didn't really like the idea of a white watch at first
[01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:56.400]   But it is true that the band then becomes the color accent and it really is kind of nice
[01:41:56.400 --> 01:42:02.320]   You can mix and match and do some interesting the black millinets looks great. It looks like james bonds tuxedo. Oh, I'll have to try that
[01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:06.160]   I'll have to try that. Hey a tip from a
[01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:07.840]   listener
[01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:09.840]   I'm don here on twitter
[01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:13.760]   He said here's a nice new feature at macrumers.com
[01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:19.600]   If you scroll down to the very bottom of the page on macrumers, you'll be given at the very bottom
[01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:27.360]   I have to make it big so you can see it you'll be given some view choices mobile version fixed fluid and a new fluid hd
[01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:29.920]   which fills you know the
[01:42:29.920 --> 01:42:31.920]   Screen
[01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:35.760]   Wraps around and really is a very nice layout. I don't know if they're experimenting
[01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:40.640]   With something but it's a really a pretty layout for macrumer. So don't thank you
[01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:47.760]   Uh for that tip because this is a site. Obviously we all spend a lot of time on not as much on all kid was a savvy individual
[01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:54.800]   Yes, but not as much as I spent on i'mor.com. That's where you find rene richie who is also very fluid
[01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:59.440]   He is uh, he oh he's got his review up of the ceramic edition
[01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:04.240]   See your boss should let you have that a little sooner. I know he said he was going to do the review
[01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:09.040]   But he got super busy with his crack very non-super busy. I got super busy. Yeah, yeah
[01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:15.040]   That's the canada by the way the white with the red sport band is the canada now you gosh
[01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:19.840]   You just you know you make me want more bands. I have to say i've come around a little bit on the uh apple watch
[01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:24.480]   Because i'm doing a lot of fitness stuff and there is no other watch and i've tried them all i just got a
[01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:27.520]   Samsung gear has three frontier
[01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:30.000]   There's no other watch that does
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:33.520]   Heart rate as well as the apple watch at least for me and my skin type
[01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:38.400]   And uh, it's you know, I just keep coming back to it. It unlocks my mac
[01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:44.800]   If you get like share activity sharing alerts and you keep sending back hamburgers fries pizza stuff like that
[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:47.680]   Your friends get kind of angry at you donuts
[01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:50.800]   Yes, i've been doing that and i got donuts
[01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:53.360]   I got i got snarky clayton clayton morris
[01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:57.680]   I want some more friends though. It's only you and megan are my friends. I need
[01:43:57.680 --> 01:43:58.720]   Yeah, too
[01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:04.720]   I gotta get some more friends because that is something really that really works is that competition and rene is the worst person ever
[01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:07.760]   Is a friend because he feels his rings every damn day i
[01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:11.920]   Couple time i want i want that perfect month and i actually fell asleep
[01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:15.840]   I was so tired i fell asleep without finishing the workout and i woke up there's nothing i can do
[01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:18.240]   Uh
[01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:20.240]   They try to give us month damn it
[01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:28.000]   I'm more dot com follow rene's activities there in his podcast too some great ones including the newer apple talk podcast jason snells on
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.560]   uh this week
[01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:33.920]   I am this week's episode we recorded yesterday. It's big block of cheese day
[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:38.000]   So we just got a bunch of reader questions the more outlandish the better and we tried to work our way through them
[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.400]   Which day what day was big block of cheese day? I missed it
[01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:44.960]   Well, we just did it as a homage. I don't know if it was probably not the proper andrew jacks in day, but
[01:44:44.960 --> 01:44:51.840]   Do you think given that uh president trump is such a fan of jacks and then he'll bring the big block of cheese day back
[01:44:51.840 --> 01:44:56.640]   I always thought it was apocryphal. Was it a literal big block of cheese could people actually go in and sustain themselves?
[01:44:56.640 --> 01:44:58.640]   I don't think he's large. Yes, it would lie
[01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:02.480]   There was a there was a big there was a huge block of cheese
[01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:08.240]   Although it wasn't like as legendary as that there was so somebody somebody donated a huge
[01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:11.760]   I looked huge huge huge block of cheese that was too bit
[01:45:11.760 --> 01:45:15.440]   That was too big for the white house to deal with and so it was look we're leaving this outside
[01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:19.920]   For either the vermin or for the public go go have it the
[01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:24.000]   Apparently is a a fictional
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.800]   uh somewhat fictional story
[01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:33.600]   Fictional big block of cheese way better than it was it wasn't quite as big as a horse as that it was as the illustration indicated yes
[01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:36.160]   according to a jacks in a historian
[01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:39.760]   Uh jacks and didn't think he should be guided by public opinion
[01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:45.680]   So offered the cheese to the public not so much in a spirit of open conversation as in one of desperation
[01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:51.600]   Nor was he the first chief executive to receive an enormous cheese as a gesture of the relationship between the president
[01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:57.040]   And the people the big block of cheese was more than anything else perhaps just as it is today a political tool
[01:45:57.040 --> 01:46:02.960]   Ernest and cynical in equal measures. So there is as soon as west constant joined the union you got a big block
[01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:07.680]   It is a big block there was a big block of it was it was spike cheese. Yeah
[01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:10.800]   So a dairy farmer
[01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:16.000]   Colonel thomas meacham sandy creek new york in 1835 to flaunt his cheese making ingenuity
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.800]   This is from the atlantic he created 10 cheeses
[01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:25.040]   The biggest of these four feet in diameter and two feet tall weighed 1400 pounds
[01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:29.200]   He delivered it to andrew jacks in and on a schooner bound for dc
[01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:35.040]   Wearing a belt that according to a dispatch from the utica newspaper got up with much taste presenting
[01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:40.960]   A fine bust of the president surrounded by a chain of 24 states united and linked together
[01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:47.440]   So he also sent two 750 pound wheels of cheddar to martin van buren
[01:46:47.440 --> 01:46:50.160]   so
[01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:54.880]   There is there was a 14 foot block of cheese. All I got him was a 50 dollar
[01:46:55.280 --> 01:47:02.320]   Retunes gift card now. I feel kind of like an idiot and we missed it because it was uh, it was a january. I think 29th
[01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:05.440]   So we uh, we missed it by a month
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:08.240]   Well in kennedy they have to later harvest
[01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:09.680]   Yes
