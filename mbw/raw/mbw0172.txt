[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   the Macintosh computers, iPods, iPhones, the Zoom, no, not the Zoom.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Everything, I make that joke every time.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Everything except the Zoom.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, the great Andy Inako is here.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Let me press the right button.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   There he is from Snowden, Massachusetts.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Oh, oh.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Yes.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Now we're just getting ready to team up the horses.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   We need to repurvision once again.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Lord, it must be over.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   It must be over.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   We're down to peeling down wallpaper for the starch-based glue that's holding into the walls,
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   but we're a plucky people.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Leo will survive.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Did you get two or one?
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   We got one and a half.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Around here, we got about 16 to 18 inches.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Holy cow.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Yeah, I'm at the age where I define snowfall by the amount of inches that have to fall
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   before I call my neighbor's kid to come over and do it for me.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   And where's that line?
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   I called the neighbor's kid.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   They have a lovely gas-powered snow-throwing machine.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   I swear to God, the night before, I got the shovels out, I got my snow gear out.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   I spent a good 10 minutes staring out my front window in my pajamas,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   listening to the sound of that gas engine and thinking, "You know what?
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   I have $40.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   I'm going to make another $40 very quickly."
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Oh, wow.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   It seems like this is a problem with a very ready solution to the satisfaction of both of the parties involved in this transaction.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Well, I'm glad you made it out of the snow-born hell you were in.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Here also, Mr. Alex Lindsey, who knows nothing from snow.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   He's back from Pittsburgh.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   I was in D.C.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Oh, you were in D.C.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Did you get stranded?
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   I drove to a dollar's airport on Saturday afternoon.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   It was the most exciting drive I've ever made.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   I've been a cab or?
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   No, I drove.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   And as I was going sideways, down '95, towards a fuel tanker that was parked in front of me, I thought,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   "Well, this was really a bad idea."
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   But fortunately, I caught up.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   This last thought is he slides under the tanker.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   This was a bad idea.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Probably getting that done that for four hours from Baltimore to IAD.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   So it was exciting.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   I got a good heavy dose of the snow, of the weather.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   It was definitely an experience to be had.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   I posted some of that to my Twitter thing.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   I posted photos of cars strewn.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   I'll have to look at that.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   It was quite a thing.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   That's fun.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   It's an adventure.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   I kept on telling myself that because it was an adventure every moment.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   I only lost like a day.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   That's not so bad.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   You did miss our Christmas party.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   I know I feel bad about that.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Well, Mr. Great party.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   But Carly became with Malachi and Isabel and Lizzie.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   I know.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   She was wonderful.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   So glad she came.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Also with this, not feeling well.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   He's a little under the weather, but he's very, he's plucky.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   The plucky Paul Kent from Mackerel Expo.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Hey, Paul.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Hey, I'm plucky.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   I have no weather, no weather tales about here in Silicon Valley.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   The sun is out.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Everything's nice, but high-endy.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Do you have a cold, Paul?
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Is that what's laying you low?
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   I woke up a little funky today and as the day went on, it, you know, continued to get a little bit
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   weirder.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   So I actually am going to take it easy the rest of the day to make sure that I can get through
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   the holiday.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.800]   It might just be we've been just going so hard making all these good things happen for
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.800]   Mackerel.
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.800]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.800]   I mean, you don't get much time off between now and February when Mackerel takes off.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.080]   You, you, the funny thing is, remember, for the past 25 years, Mackerel has been the first
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.400]   week or second week of January.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.640]   So this is luxury time for us.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.600]   You feel like, oh, it's not that bad.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.600]   That's right.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.600]   So how is the planning coming along?
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.600]   We're really excited.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.100]   The show is coming together fantastically.
[00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:58.800]   It's going to be a very interesting show between the product viewing experience for attendees
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.800]   on the show floor.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.360]   We've got great participation from a wide variety of exhibitors.
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.200]   Everything from big companies like HP, Microsoft, IBM signed on the other day.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.200]   Oh, that's great.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.200]   Yeah, sure.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.560]   You know, microphones and headphones that they've signed on for a while.
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.240]   Big companies that distribute a lot of kind of useful utilities like Dr. Bot and other
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.240]   world computing are involved with us.
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.680]   So we're excited about the big companies and we're excited about the amazing small developers
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.560]   that make up a large part of our market.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.480]   So people like Rogue and Miebuh, Boink Software, Mac Speech.
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.800]   So there's going to be a lot of great things for people to see at the show.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.080]   Because Apple has dropped out, this will be the first Mac world without Apple giving a
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.840]   big keynote and having a, will they have a booth?
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.840]   No, they have a booth.
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:45.840]   Wow.
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.440]   No, they have a couple speakers participating with us though.
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.720]   So Sal Segoin, have you had Sal on the show?
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.760]   We know Sal very well.
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:52.760]   We love it.
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.200]   So Sal will be talking about Apple's script and we have a couple more that we're working
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.760]   on with Apple as well.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.760]   So you know, they kind of have a couple of fingers in the show this year and we're personally
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:02.760]   on.
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:03.760]   I mean, we have a lot to offer people.
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:23.560]   I mean, the Mac community gets together at Mac
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:29.520]   World, and I know that he's working on some song things, so the things that he's been
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.240]   famous for, the song parodies.
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.000]   And David kind of, you know, approaches these things.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.720]   He works in his message about what's going on in the marketplace without beating you
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.720]   over the head with it.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.720]   No, he always makes it fun.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:40.720]   Yeah.
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.720]   Yeah.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.720]   Exactly.
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.960]   So it's a very Mac world like presentation that you learn a little bit, you laugh a
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.360]   little bit, you learn about what's going on in the tech industry as a whole and the
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.920]   Apple marketplace in particular, and that's what David will do.
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:55.920]   That's going to be fun.
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.720]   And then I'm taking over Mac World Live from David.
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:04.520]   Yeah, I think when we talked about this, you know, last year at the show.
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:09.640]   So the first thing is, you know, you were such a proponent of maintaining that we as
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.280]   a technology community still need a physical meeting place.
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.280]   You know, where you can.
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.320]   That was my thought is that who cares about Apple?
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.960]   We've got to have somewhere to get together.
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.120]   That's what these conferences really become about.
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.040]   In general, even something as big as CES, it's a social event.
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.160]   It's about getting together more than it is about learning about stuff.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.160]   Although you have a great conference track.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.160]   We do have a great conference.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.960]   And I think it's all these things that are put together.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:35.080]   You know, the conferences provide a lot of professional development for people, learning
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:40.720]   for photographers, for Mac power users, for IT professionals, all these types of people
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.760]   have things to do in our conferences.
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:46.360]   And then there's things in the show floor that people can come to at no charge once they're
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.880]   into the show.
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.480]   There's a lot of podcasts that are going to be going live.
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:54.000]   Alex, actually everybody who's here today is involved with the show in some way.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.680]   You know, Andy is going to be not only doing a presentation about a year living without
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.680]   media.
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.280]   He's also going to be doing.
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.640]   When are you going to do that, Andy?
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.640]   Next month?
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:08.960]   No, no, I spent all of 2009 not buying any physical media of any kind.
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.960]   Oh, wow.
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:10.960]   That's right.
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:11.960]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:12.960]   See, it was so well.
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.000]   Well, how well I did.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   You only have any.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.560]   Does it you only have one more week?
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.920]   Are you going to go crazy January 1st?
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:23.160]   I've been going to my local comic shop every Wednesday or every Thursday, like clockwork,
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.240]   because it's one of the social things I do.
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:30.120]   So on Wednesday for the last time, I will leave and say nothing for me today.
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.120]   Thank you.
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:36.680]   As I've been doing every week and next week, I already have the cash set aside.
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.120]   I'm going to bring a basket.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.320]   I'm going to be making other.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.960]   I already know all the trade paperbacks I'm going to buy that I missed.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.000]   All the comics that I missed.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.480]   This is you got to end your talk.
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:51.000]   Do this whole talk about a year without media and the end of talk with the shopping list
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.160]   that you have January 1st.
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:57.840]   I have a wearable video camera that I intend to be wearing while I'm shopping.
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.840]   Just to document.
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.080]   It's okay.
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:06.160]   Just in case the grandkids ever asked, grandpa, did you ever spend more than $900 at a comic
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.320]   book shop?
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.240]   Well, lad, there wasn't that one.
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:13.720]   There was one day, I saved it up all year, but there's something that's delicious about
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:14.720]   that.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:15.720]   That'll be a fun presentation.
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.800]   John Gruber has been added to the list of the presentations.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:19.800]   Gruber's great.
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.800]   I love his stuff.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:21.800]   Yeah.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.360]   John's been added and also David Bienney because I don't know if you're aware, this is the
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.880]   20th anniversary of Photoshop.
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:32.080]   So David, who's well known in the graphic world, he'll be doing some really cool stuff.
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:35.240]   He'll be actually showing a demonstration of Photoshop 1.
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.240]   Oh, great.
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:41.640]   I just want to say for the record that David's actually a good friend of mine and he taught
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:42.640]   me Photoshop.
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:50.320]   Wow, my first Photoshop training was at, I think, Seabolt in 1992 or 1993.
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.520]   Then I went to a Photoshop 3.0 seminar with David Bienney.
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.720]   He is very entertaining.
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:00.560]   I mean, I think he hasn't been at Macworld for a few years and it's really great to have
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.560]   him back.
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.480]   He's just so much fun to watch.
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:07.000]   He's definitely one of the pioneers in the world.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.600]   That's kind of indicative of the type of faculty that we have at the show.
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.680]   So we have really interesting feature presentations that are open to everybody.
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.320]   We're really excited about yours, Leo.
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.520]   I mean, I think...
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.520]   I got some announcements to make.
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:20.520]   Let's hear them.
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:21.920]   If you'd like me to make them.
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:22.920]   Please.
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:23.920]   We've been booking people.
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:24.920]   We're very excited.
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:28.080]   Roger McGwin, who is the founder of the Birds, is going to be performing.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.600]   He's going to bring his...
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:34.120]   He invented a 12 or 14 string guitar that he plays.
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.120]   He's incredible.
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.320]   He's just wonderful musicians, so he'll be performing for us.
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:42.440]   We've got a band called Warp 11 that is a Star Trek band with the famous Kiki stock
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.000]   hammer as the front woman.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.400]   And believe me, if you've never seen Kiki in "Pleather," you must attend for that alone.
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.280]   She'll be the house band.
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:56.200]   We also have very excited Adam Savage of Mythbusters is going to come and blow something
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.200]   up.
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.200]   I didn't tell you about that.
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.200]   Did I, Paul?
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.200]   He's going to blow something up.
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.800]   No, it just keeps getting better.
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:04.880]   Roger McGwin is the hero.
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.800]   I'm a guitar player and Roger McGinn is the hero of mine.
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:08.800]   That's amazing.
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.080]   And then, yeah, he's a legend.
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.720]   He's rocking a whole fame, right?
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.720]   Yes, exactly.
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:17.280]   And I knew that David's such a musician and always does his great song parodies.
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.800]   And really, he made "Mac World Live" a great entertainment show.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.360]   So I knew that I had to replace that music.
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:28.240]   So we've got two musical acts and we're going to have some comedy acts unannounced at this
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.640]   point, but we're working on them.
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.320]   And I'm just going to sit back and let them take the reins.
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.920]   It's going to be a fun variety show.
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:39.000]   But all of them are Mac fanatics and that's what makes it really fun.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   And this is exactly what I'd hoped for what I asked you to do this is like Mac World Live
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.840]   should be a celebration of the Mac market, should be a celebration of technology.
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.520]   And so it sounds like you've got great people.
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.960]   I can't believe you got Roger McGwin.
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.920]   Roger jumped at it.
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:53.920]   That's great.
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.480]   Yeah, he was very excited to do it.
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.480]   He's a great guy.
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.280]   He's really, I really like Roger a lot.
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.280]   Yeah.
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.280]   It's great.
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.280]   Yeah.
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:02.280]   So we're pretty excited that we're going to get to do this.
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:03.280]   We'll broadcast it.
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:08.920]   It's very kind because usually in a conference, the conference is worried about people not
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.360]   coming to the event.
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.960]   So they say, you can't stream this live, but you've been very generous, Paul.
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:17.200]   And we will be for those who can't come to Mac World, you absolutely must come to Mac
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.200]   World.
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:21.800]   But if you can't make it to San Francisco February 9th through 13th, we will be streaming Mac
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:22.800]   World Live.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.600]   We're not going to stream the whole conference, but we'll stream our portion of it.
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.280]   So tell us what we're talking about your session.
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.000]   Can we do a little giveaway in the spirit of Christmas here?
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   I'd love to.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   That sounds great.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   All right.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.200]   Well, how about this?
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:44.480]   The first 100 listeners who go to MacWorldExpo.com and register for a free exhibit only pass
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:47.640]   with the code Leo, L-E-O.
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:54.160]   100 people and of those 100 people who come, we're going to pick 10 out of those first
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.520]   100 and give them a pass to the full conference.
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.280]   Oh, that's $1,500 worth.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:04.640]   And not only that, we're going to save 10 spots right in the front row for these people
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.640]   to come and enjoy Mac World Live at Leo Laporte.
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:07.640]   That's great.
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:08.640]   Maybe we'll...
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:09.640]   You know what?
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:10.640]   You know what?
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:11.640]   You know what?
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:12.640]   You know what?
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:13.640]   Paul, maybe we could put...
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:14.640]   Because when I did the...
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:17.120]   I went to the grand old opera, and I'll never forget this in Nashville.
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.960]   And they have seats at the back of the stage.
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:23.480]   Like the old minstrel shows did, they would have seats back at the stage.
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:26.480]   Maybe we could get those 10 people actually on the stage behind us.
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.480]   You're cool with it.
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.480]   I'm cool with it.
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.480]   I love that idea.
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.480]   I love that idea.
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.480]   I like it.
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.080]   So we'll give those 10 people some extra special.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.080]   Love it.
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.080]   Perfect.
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:39.080]   So not only this, so we got 100 free passes to the exhibit floor and to see all the feature
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:43.480]   presentations and that's David, that's Leo, that's Kevin Smith, the filmmaker.
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.480]   Yeah.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.480]   So they get into all of these free presentations.
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:51.280]   But also, if anybody wants to come and come to the user's conference or IT conference,
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:54.840]   that Leo code, if you've been thinking about coming to the conference, is good for a 20%
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.760]   discount on any of our conference packages.
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:57.760]   That's really great.
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:58.760]   Very generous, Paul.
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:13:59.760]   Thank you.
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:00.760]   Oh, we're so happy to do it.
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:01.760]   We're so happy you're going to be with us.
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:05.520]   The show's going to be a blast and it's just going to be, like I said, it's a celebration
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.680]   of all things that are related to Apple products.
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.680]   Yeah.
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:09.680]   I'm excited.
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:10.680]   I really am.
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:17.440]   I'm really grateful to you and to IDG for really keeping Macworld on the front burner
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.680]   and making it a great event.
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.040]   It's got to hurt when Apple's not there.
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.040]   But you know what?
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.040]   It's really not about Apple.
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.040]   It's about us.
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:26.040]   I think it's just a great opportunity to change the focus.
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:29.280]   You know, to really focus on the users and focus on a lot of things.
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:30.280]   I'm really excited about going.
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:31.960]   I'm excited to see how it shifts.
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:38.560]   The timing is good because, to be honest, Apple's kind of annoyed a few of us this year.
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:44.440]   And this might be a good time to say, to stand up as an Apple user and say, you know, we
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.440]   are the Mac community.
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.800]   And it's not Apple.
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:48.800]   It's community.
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:49.800]   It's our community.
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:50.800]   Right.
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:51.800]   And this might be a very good time to do that.
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:55.280]   You know, in fact, in some ways, I think Apple abandoning Macworld is a way of turning
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:58.200]   its back on its community that I know you won't say that, Paul.
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.560]   So I'm not putting words in your mouth.
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.080]   Well, I think it's to be fair to Apple.
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:04.480]   And that's what I do, you know, is that, you know, they've abandoned all the conferences.
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.760]   I mean, it's not like they're picking anything out.
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:10.720]   I was really curious to see if they might show up at CES, but no, they're not.
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:11.720]   No, not CES.
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.080]   They don't want to do any of these.
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.080]   Yeah.
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.080]   Yeah.
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:18.520]   And I have to say, this is the one where this is, this is, I thought it was a strange
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:22.640]   decision because of all the conferences, this is where the faithful gather.
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:23.640]   Right.
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:27.640]   So, in San Francisco, we all get together.
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.940]   We party together, we talk together and it really isn't a developer.
[00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:34.480]   It's really important as WWDC for developers.
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:37.920]   I really think it's kind of, you know, anyway, we're going to be there and we're glad, Paul,
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.960]   that you've kept the flame burning, the torch burning.
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:41.960]   Thanks very much.
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:45.120]   And we're going to host Alex doing all sorts of things related to Mac Break Live on the
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.120]   show floor.
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:48.640]   You'll be doing this feature presentation, Andy's doing two presentations.
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.520]   He's doing the one we just mentioned.
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:54.680]   And then also we just announced that Andy is going to be bringing a friend of his, someone
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.120]   who's very well known in the webcomic space.
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:00.760]   It's got Kurt is going to be coming and Andy's going to be doing an interview with Scott
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:01.760]   Kurt.
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:02.760]   So all sorts of things.
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:03.760]   That's great.
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:04.760]   Exactly.
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:05.760]   Yeah.
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.600]   Well, and we'll definitely have more to talk about.
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:12.240]   We're going to, most of our announcements for Mac world are going to happen the week of January
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:16.560]   11th, but we're, we've got, we're going to have a booth on the, on the show floor and
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:20.520]   people are really basically going to be able to see us doing all these Mac breaks that
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:21.520]   we put out that week.
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.000]   They're going to be able to see us working on them.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.560]   So it's going to be a really fun.
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:25.560]   Yeah.
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:26.560]   You've got a really interesting setup there.
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.560]   Yeah.
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:28.560]   Yeah.
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:34.840]   If you've wanted to see how Alex does these, simply the best video production in the community,
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.040]   you can actually watch them at work.
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.040]   It's going to be really cool.
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.040]   We're really excited.
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.040]   Paul can all the best.
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.040]   I hope you feel a little bit better.
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.040]   Don't work too hard today.
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:42.320]   Take, give yourself one day off.
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.320]   All right.
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:44.320]   I'll take one.
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:45.320]   Thanks guys.
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.320]   All right.
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:51.640]   I'm Leo first, 100 people free admission to Mac world Expo 10 will be picked at random
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:56.280]   to get full conference passes and to be seated on the back in the back there.
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:17:00.000]   We're going to get you a nice high back chairs just like they have the grand old Opry to
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.480]   watch Roger Mcguynn.
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:06.360]   We'll, we'll give you a protective glasses when Adam Savage comes on stage and you'll
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:07.360]   have the best view of the house.
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.360]   It'll be a Gallagher concert.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:09.360]   We'll, yeah.
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:12.000]   We'll give you the sheet of his green show and here's your sheet.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.100]   Congratulations on being the lucky winner and you'll have the best view of Kiki stockhammer.
[00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:19.880]   So it's going to be worth well worth it just for that alone.
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:20.880]   Thank you, Paul.
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:21.880]   Feel better soon.
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:22.880]   All right.
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:23.880]   Happy holidays, everyone.
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:24.880]   Happy holidays.
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:25.880]   Paul Kat from Mac world Expo and IDGs.
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:26.880]   We're working really hard.
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:30.680]   He's the guys kept the flame alive on the Mac world Expo for the last few years.
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:34.920]   He's been working on it for years and I'm really it's, you know, I know some people say
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:39.520]   and I know Alex, you defend Apple.
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:41.880]   They don't have to make an announcement.
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:45.720]   They just need to have a big, they don't have to even buy a big booth.
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.720]   They need to be there.
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:47.820]   Well, I think they're going to be there.
[00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:49.300]   I mean, I think they're going to be in all these conferences.
[00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.500]   I just don't think it's just a matter of official capacity.
[00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:55.940]   I think a lot of it has to do with, you know, where you spend the resources and also it
[00:17:55.940 --> 00:18:00.180]   is just a, as someone who who gets scared every time I have to think about even putting
[00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:03.100]   a booth up or anything else, it is just such a huge,
[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:04.100]   Throw a party then.
[00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:05.100]   Throw a party.
[00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.100]   I'd love to see Apple throw a party.
[00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:07.100]   Apple's just throw a party.
[00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:08.100]   That's something that would be great.
[00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:09.780]   That's not a big, you know, that's not a big deal.
[00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:10.780]   Famous last words.
[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:12.620]   Hey, how much money have you give you?
[00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:17.240]   Scott Born alone has given Apple enough money to throw a massive party this year.
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:18.240]   Scott is not with us.
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.240]   His DSL crashed.
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.840]   Isn't that ironic?
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:25.440]   But we do have Andy and Iko and Alex Lindsey and we are talking Mac when all of that great
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:26.440]   stuff.
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:29.240]   We're going to get back to the Mac and just a bit with the news of the week.
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.240]   There is news, right?
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.240]   There is news.
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:32.240]   There's some news.
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.240]   There's some news.
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.240]   There's definitely, definitely, definitely news.
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.240]   Definitely news.
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.240]   Time for a whoppner.
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.240]   Actually, time for Ford Sync.
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.240]   Time for Ford Sync.
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:42.320]   I just want to mention that we are going to CES and we are bringing forwards with us.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:45.980]   They're going to give us, they're loaning us a flex which is the coolest Ford.
[00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:47.720]   Well, actually, I can't say the coolest.
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:49.220]   It's one of the coolest.
[00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:50.220]   You have the coolest Ford.
[00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:51.220]   I think I have the coolest.
[00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:53.860]   But I have definitely the coolest Ford.
[00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:54.860]   You've driven it, right?
[00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:55.860]   I haven't driven it yet.
[00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:57.860]   You want to take a ride while I do the ad?
[00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:58.860]   It's right out there.
[00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:01.820]   It's a time thing, isn't it?
[00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:04.360]   The flex is there is, I don't know what you call it.
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.140]   It's kind of a big car.
[00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.620]   It's seats like eight or nine, but it has a lot of luggage.
[00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:12.140]   What we're going to do is we're going to load it up with all our gear and drive it down.
[00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:14.080]   It has the Ford Sync in it, of course.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.280]   It has a great stereo system, leather seats.
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:20.040]   It's got a cooler slash heater unit in the middle of the back.
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:22.000]   I don't know what it's for.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.080]   It's for the Octo Mom.
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.360]   It's the Octo Mom car.
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:26.360]   It's for like a big family.
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:28.360]   For you, it's going to be the gear.
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:29.360]   But it's the gear.
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:31.240]   It's perfect for us.
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.440]   And I have a Mustang.
[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:36.880]   But the point is if you're getting a Ford or a Lincoln or a Mercury vehicle, you've
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.200]   got to check out Ford Sync.
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:43.140]   I just go to the Ford dealer and say, I want to test drive Sync.
[00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:49.460]   I bet by now there are people all over the country test driving, not the car, that sync.
[00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:51.260]   Some big announcements from Ford at CES.
[00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:52.260]   And some of them have leaked out on Engadget.
[00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:56.620]   I don't know if you've seen them, but they really want to make this a platform.
[00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:58.140]   And I don't have any special information.
[00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:01.460]   So I don't know if the Engadget stories are right or what.
[00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:06.020]   But I do know that Ford is really committed to the idea.
[00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:10.760]   I think they're the most forward looking car company ever now.
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:15.680]   And I think they need to be because they realize that the American auto industry needs to have
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:17.920]   something to hold on to.
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.360]   And for too long, we've let the Japanese automakers and the German automakers kind of
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:23.360]   take the technology lead.
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:26.880]   Ford is absolutely killing it.
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:28.040]   I mean, they're killing it.
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:32.900]   I've driven, I've played with every hands-free music system in every car.
[00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:36.180]   This is the one you want.
[00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:41.000]   And when you see what they're planning to do with it, it is very, very exciting.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   They get it.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   That's the point.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   They really get it.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   They're listening to their users.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   They're listening to us geeks.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:52.160]   I think it's always a challenge when you're putting in a consumer product like a car,
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:53.960]   a computer.
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:59.360]   And so you want to give people like us real capabilities, but you don't want to make it
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:02.600]   too complicated, especially since people are driving.
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:05.300]   They have managed to really do it right.
[00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.380]   It's completely voice controlled.
[00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:09.720]   So you never take your eyes off the road, your hands off the wheels.
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.100]   Very important for safety.
[00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:12.380]   But it's got features.
[00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:13.420]   Any geeks can adore.
[00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:15.980]   You could plug in a USB hard drive into the thing.
[00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:17.780]   It reads and indexes all the MP3s.
[00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:19.340]   And then you can call for any song by name.
[00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:23.620]   You have full access to your playlist, to your songs without touching, you know, with
[00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:25.620]   just by voice.
[00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:29.620]   You can get vehicle information reports sent on a regular basis.
[00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:35.100]   You get a special website, syncmyride.com, where all that information lives and it's
[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:37.720]   getting better all the time.
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:42.000]   Updates by the way, every, every, every sync has a USB port.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.980]   You take a USB key, you go to syncmyride.com, you get the updates, you plug it in and install
[00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:47.380]   it into the car.
[00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:53.260]   So I'm not making any promises, but these advances that Ford's making are, you're going
[00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:55.620]   to see them and you're going to start seeing them soon.
[00:21:55.620 --> 00:22:00.140]   Take myridepodcast.com if you want to know more or just go to your Ford Lincoln and Mercury
[00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:04.980]   vehicle dealer and say, I want to test drive Ford Sync and keep your eye peeled for the
[00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:05.980]   announcements.
[00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:08.420]   We're going to have, we're very fortunate.
[00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:12.780]   I think because of our relationship with Ford, but the Ford CEO is giving a major keynote
[00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:13.780]   at CES.
[00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:15.300]   We're getting him right before the keynote.
[00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:16.660]   We're going to have an interview with him.
[00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:18.620]   So we're going to get the scoop on that.
[00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:23.180]   And then later, I think Friday, we're going to talk to the guy, we're responsible for
[00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:24.900]   sync for Ford USA.
[00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:25.900]   That's awesome.
[00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:27.260]   So we're going to talk to the engineer.
[00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:31.060]   I said, they said product, I said, no, no, no, I don't want any marketing guys.
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:32.620]   I want the engineer.
[00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:35.980]   So the engineer responsible for Ford Sync is going to talk about not only what they're
[00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:39.020]   doing, but by then they'll be able to say what they plan.
[00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:40.020]   Wow.
[00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:45.380]   And I'm very, I don't, I probably shouldn't say anything because it, we'll just leave
[00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:46.580]   it for two weeks.
[00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:48.260]   You can wait two weeks.
[00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:50.180]   Let's get to the Mac news.
[00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:52.100]   By the way, works great with the iPhone and the iPod.
[00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:53.100]   Don't worry about that.
[00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:54.260]   It has a 2D piece.
[00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:58.140]   So when you get in the car, it, in the Bluetooth, when my iPhone syncs, it starts playing the
[00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:04.180]   song that I was playing or in my case, I always leave the book on tape or book on tape.
[00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:06.700]   They're just betrayed my age.
[00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:08.860]   I think I believe it's book on bits these days.
[00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:10.020]   Used to be.
[00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:11.020]   It was.
[00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:12.020]   I remember.
[00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:13.020]   Do you remember Andy?
[00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:15.900]   Did you, when you listened to books, audio books, did you ever do the cassettes?
[00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:19.140]   I had the, I had Bob and Ray on cassette.
[00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:24.700]   There was a time when the local salvage store in Boston had, there was a two year period
[00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:28.660]   in which every single Star Trek original series actor had a biography.
[00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:31.780]   Three months later, it would be remainedred at a fire sale.
[00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:36.620]   So I would be getting, I got every version of every original cast member's autobiography
[00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:40.100]   book on tape on cassette of which George Shkays was the best.
[00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:43.460]   But yeah, there's, as a matter of fact, it was going, it was really very cool.
[00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:47.380]   I was going through an old storage locker where I had, when I made the transition finally
[00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:51.300]   to digital and I stopped putting cassettes in my car, I still had the big cardboard box
[00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:55.540]   of cassettes from like the passenger footwell of the car.
[00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:58.700]   And it was a time capsule of everything I was listening to back then.
[00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:02.700]   And at least one third of those things were Bob and Ray cassettes or books on tape.
[00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:08.020]   I would get, you know, I was, I started with a company called books on tape and I would
[00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:12.820]   get, they ship you a box this big with like 20 cassettes in it.
[00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:14.740]   And you only have a month, by the way, that was the other thing.
[00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:16.500]   I like Audible because you could take as long as you want.
[00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:18.060]   You only had a month.
[00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:21.020]   And you know, frequently a cassette would be jammed or broken.
[00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:23.460]   And they, you know, they replace it, but that, you know, you, you're stopped.
[00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:24.460]   You're stuck.
[00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:28.540]   It's like, oh, no, why don't I have my book?
[00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:29.540]   And it's so funny.
[00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:30.700]   And then it was a prepaid thing.
[00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:32.300]   So you'd listen through the cassette.
[00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:36.020]   I can remember vividly the cassette sitting on my passenger seat and you go to the next
[00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:38.020]   cassette and the next cassette.
[00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:43.020]   My parents were using cassettes and CDs up until they got, I got them an iPod.
[00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:44.020]   And then Audible.
[00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:45.020]   Audible.
[00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:47.220]   Audible really has changed the whole thing.
[00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:50.860]   But that's, that's an ad for another time and another place.
[00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:51.860]   Let's get to the news.
[00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:54.780]   We put the news up on delicious.
[00:24:54.780 --> 00:25:01.100]   If you go to delicious.com/twit/mbwidies or you can even go to mbwidies.com.
[00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:03.220]   Thanks to Merlin Mann.
[00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:04.860]   And people can help us with these.
[00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:11.020]   You always feel free to just tag it and we love to get that.
[00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:12.020]   Sad news.
[00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:14.980]   Steve Jobs is not the person of the year.
[00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:15.980]   Ben Bernanke.
[00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:16.980]   Who's that?
[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:17.980]   I don't even know who that is.
[00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:21.420]   What is, who's Ben Bernanke?
[00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:22.420]   When he's home.
[00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:23.420]   What did he invent?
[00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:24.420]   What did he invent?
[00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:25.420]   What, what?
[00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:26.420]   Yeah.
[00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:27.420]   Did he bring us the personal computer?
[00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:29.460]   Did he bring us the iPhone and the iPad?
[00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:32.180]   What did Ben Bernanke do for me lately?
[00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:36.260]   On behalf of all the hosts here at Map Break Weekly, both presents are not here.
[00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:39.340]   I want to extend our sympathies collectively to Steve Jobs.
[00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:40.340]   Well, I'm sure it's inconsolable.
[00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:41.340]   It must be crying.
[00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:42.340]   I mean, crying.
[00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:44.500]   And so, so close to the holidays too.
[00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:47.340]   I mean, he's just bawling into his apple juice.
[00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:48.340]   You know that.
[00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:49.340]   You know that.
[00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:50.340]   You know that.
[00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:51.340]   Got it right.
[00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:54.020]   Into his organic, pardon me, organic vegan apple juice.
[00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:57.100]   I wonder if the Federal Reserve uses Macs or PCs.
[00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:58.980]   They don't use computers.
[00:25:58.980 --> 00:25:59.980]   Are you kidding?
[00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:01.460]   These quill pens and scroll books.
[00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:02.460]   That's the problem.
[00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:03.460]   That was the problem.
[00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:05.780]   If they'd only been using a Mac, we wouldn't have this financial problem.
[00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:12.180]   According to our accounts, this nation is $18 trillion in debt.
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.780]   Anyway, Ben Bernanke, well done.
[00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:16.500]   Time magazine person of the year.
[00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:17.860]   I don't think Steve had a shot at it.
[00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:19.700]   I think it was just they threw him in.
[00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:23.500]   Yeah, it was kind of a slow year for Steve.
[00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:27.540]   Well, I think they just threw his name out there because they wanted him to show up for
[00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:29.620]   the big award televised award ceremony.
[00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:31.980]   You know, it happens all the time.
[00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:32.980]   Yeah.
[00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:35.740]   They just wanted that picture of his face falling.
[00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:39.420]   You know, oh, I love watching that.
[00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:40.420]   That's the best part.
[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:42.420]   All five people on the screen.
[00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:45.460]   And the winner is the Oscar ghost.
[00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:46.460]   Who's going to cry?
[00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:47.460]   Who's going to cry?
[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:52.820]   And it's just these guys, these are professional actors.
[00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:55.540]   So they're very rarely slipped, but everyone's in a while.
[00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:58.420]   You have a little vibrating, vibrating right eye.
[00:26:58.420 --> 00:26:59.900]   Yeah, the quiver.
[00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:05.420]   You can't top Lauren McCall's reaction when Julie Benos beat her for best supporting
[00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:06.420]   actors.
[00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:07.420]   What did you do?
[00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:10.220]   That was about eight or nine years ago.
[00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:13.700]   And everybody knew that, OK, she's a screen legend.
[00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:17.220]   This is probably the last time she will ever be in a movie period, let alone one of which
[00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:19.700]   she could be nominated for an Oscar.
[00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:22.460]   Everyone else was wearing basically street clothes because they knew that they were not
[00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:24.740]   going up to that stage to be nominated.
[00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:27.140]   And Juliet Benos was very, very surprised.
[00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:31.580]   But Lauren McCall, you could lip read her and say, what the?
[00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:38.380]   I'm not OK.
[00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:42.980]   But you know, you totally I'm totally sympathetic.
[00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:45.420]   It's like, I agree.
[00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:46.420]   That's got to kill Juliet.
[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:48.180]   Then where is Juliet Benos now?
[00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:52.340]   She's a movie in the pantheon of stars.
[00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:54.780]   Lauren McCall, you know, out of whistle, don't you?
[00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:57.100]   You just put your lips together and blow.
[00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:58.540]   He slept with way more interesting men.
[00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:02.140]   And that's what that's what that's what should win you the best supporting actress award.
[00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:03.340]   Who did you sleep with?
[00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:08.740]   If you're like two degrees of separation from a snatra, they should just mail it to you.
[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:14.060]   Oh, it's a world gun man.
[00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:16.540]   Story number one, tapulous.
[00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:19.580]   They're doing OK on the on the app store.
[00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:23.260]   One, they claim now they're the guys who do they did the dance dance revolution.
[00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:25.180]   Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, defense.
[00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:26.180]   It was free.
[00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:27.180]   Right.
[00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:31.220]   Apparently they're selling something because tap, tap revenge.
[00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:37.980]   The makers claim a million a month in sales, a million dollars a month.
[00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:38.980]   They say they're getting 20 employees.
[00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:39.980]   They're 20 employees.
[00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:41.980]   That's a good return on your investment, the fallen fan.
[00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:44.100]   I hope they're getting stock options.
[00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:46.740]   They have 20 million installed applications.
[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:52.380]   You know, this is where you say, yeah, OK, Android, yeah, you're open.
[00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:56.180]   But can I make a million dollars a month in the Android store?
[00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:58.180]   That's exactly correct.
[00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:02.020]   That's why every time I talk to developers about the differences between developing versus
[00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:05.660]   Android versus iPhone, it's always the exact same two lines.
[00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:10.860]   I can't stand the fact that the seed so much control over my work to a faceless and sometimes
[00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:12.620]   in different organization.
[00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:16.060]   But I know that that could possibly make lots and lots of this.
[00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:21.940]   This could be the thing that makes me so much money that I just don't have that I can retire.
[00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:22.940]   I can retire.
[00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:24.900]   Or at least a good six or seven months.
[00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:25.900]   That's where the gold rush is.
[00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:26.900]   Yeah.
[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:29.300]   I mean, but we got to point out there are what?
[00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:33.980]   How many hundreds of thousands of applications and most of them probably make nothing.
[00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:38.180]   Well, it's like, and to some people would argue that it's kind of like, well, someone won
[00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:43.820]   the lottery, you know, and you can win the lottery, but it's more better chances than
[00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:44.820]   winning the lottery.
[00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:45.820]   Absolutely.
[00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:48.820]   No, no, I'm saying that for a lot of developers, I mean, you're still your chances are very
[00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:52.100]   low that you would get that.
[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:58.500]   But at the same time, I will say that they've managed it very well.
[00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:03.500]   You know, if they've managed their marketing well, they've managed their applications well.
[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:05.860]   They've done the things that they needed to do to move it forward.
[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:07.020]   What's the best tapulous game?
[00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:08.020]   I'm looking at this.
[00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:10.860]   Tap, tap, revenge classic, which is 99 cents.
[00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:13.220]   Tap, tap, revenge, which is free.
[00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:16.300]   Tap, tap, revenge three, which is 99 cents.
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:20.660]   I mean, to make a million dollars a month on a 99 cent application, well, you do the
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:21.660]   math.
[00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:22.660]   So you think about applications.
[00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:24.660]   They do have tap, tap.
[00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:26.540]   Oh, see, this is where they make money.
[00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:28.540]   Like if you want tap, tap, cold play.
[00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:29.540]   Yeah.
[00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:34.700]   See, that's they license catalogs from five bucks, nine inch nails, five bucks, Metallica,
[00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:37.060]   five bucks, Lady Gaga, five bucks.
[00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:38.460]   That must be where they're making there.
[00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:41.220]   Although you've got to figure they're paying Metallica some money.
[00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:43.460]   Yeah, but still, but this is smart.
[00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:44.460]   They give away.
[00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:47.060]   This is that freemium model that works so really well.
[00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:53.380]   You give away a free version, get people hooked and then say, hey, now you want the
[00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:54.380]   Metallica?
[00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:56.180]   I have done this.
[00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:57.860]   And it works.
[00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:02.660]   And $5 is really, I mean, offer a game to kids who are used to paying 60 bar their parents
[00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:03.860]   who are used to paying 60 bucks.
[00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:07.500]   Five bucks, well, you know, and how much money you're going to get out of that five bucks?
[00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:10.900]   Well, it's also a good example of the sort of game that can be very, very successful
[00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:15.380]   on the iPhone where they start off by, they put all their effort into creating a framework
[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:19.100]   so that they can then punch out new versions of it very, very easily and very, very quickly
[00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:23.140]   so that they're always getting turned into the new releases categories.
[00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:28.100]   Also it's the sort of app where it can be recommended very quickly and very easily.
[00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:31.940]   Thirdly, taps into people's existing fanbases.
[00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:36.100]   Every time you get, it seems like every time you hit upon a success story for the iPhone,
[00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:37.620]   it always is tied to.
[00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:40.220]   And then it got mentioned on Boeing blowing.
[00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:43.540]   And then it got, then it got, got mentioned on daring fireball and that wasn't, that
[00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:47.620]   wasn't when I started making $10,000 a week, but that was what started the ball roading
[00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:48.620]   rolling.
[00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:52.180]   So the two months later, I hit this top 10 and after hit the top 10, that's when I bought
[00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:53.180]   the boat.
[00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:57.340]   Well, and it's always, this is always a mixture of, you know, you have to have the right PR
[00:31:57.340 --> 00:32:01.740]   that's going to get you out in front of that core audience, but what's going to, in the
[00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:03.740]   end, what's going to make it work is a solid application.
[00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:08.300]   I mean, it's not going to have that, that growth and that explosion without, you know,
[00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:10.740]   creating something solid, whether it's media or applications.
[00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:14.460]   And reviews, five and a half, you know, four and a half star reviews for all of the apps.
[00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:16.820]   I mean, people love this game.
[00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:17.940]   Word of mouth is very important.
[00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:18.940]   I think you're right.
[00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:22.500]   I think they have to get a little help from outside sources because there are so many apps
[00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:25.580]   being just, you know, discovery is difficult.
[00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:26.900]   Apple probably has a lot to do with that.
[00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:32.100]   And when it features an app, that must make a huge difference as well.
[00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:38.860]   Epic has announced that they have ported Unreal Engine 3 to the iPhone and iPod touch.
[00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:41.460]   Now that's saying something.
[00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:44.140]   I mean, that is a very tough engine.
[00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:46.140]   I'm excited.
[00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:52.220]   I mean, there's a lot, there's been a lot of 3D stuff, you know, that we just see the
[00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:53.220]   glimpse of.
[00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:56.780]   It's a much more complicated style of programming.
[00:32:56.780 --> 00:33:01.100]   So it's not something that we're seeing every application doing, but when that is being incorporated
[00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:05.020]   into it, I mean, there's a lot of CPU power in the, I guess so.
[00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:07.060]   I guess that AA is pretty powerful.
[00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:11.100]   But even more important, it has better, it has really good GPU capabilities, right?
[00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:12.100]   Right.
[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:13.100]   Right.
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:14.100]   To be able to do that.
[00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:15.100]   I mean, I'm looking at this demo that they have.
[00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:16.100]   There's a video.
[00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:17.100]   Really?
[00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:18.100]   It really is pretty spectacular.
[00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:20.020]   I mean, they only show a few seconds.
[00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:21.020]   So maybe crashes after a second.
[00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:24.060]   Well, and the thing to remember is this is like, I don't remember what, I think we talked
[00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:28.660]   about this like a 450 megahertz or 500 megahertz processor.
[00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:29.660]   You're right.
[00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:31.620]   We were doing real-time games like that.
[00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:35.820]   With marathon with, you know, 70 megahertz or whatever.
[00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:36.820]   Right.
[00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:40.980]   So I think that it's definitely possible for it to run on these.
[00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:44.340]   And you keep on recycling all these things.
[00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:47.660]   That low resolution that we kind of gave up for the real time that we have now works
[00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:48.660]   great on the phone.
[00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:49.660]   Users open GL.
[00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:50.660]   Right.
[00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:51.660]   ES2.
[00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:56.900]   So that means a third generation iPod touch or third generation iPhone 3GS.
[00:33:56.900 --> 00:34:01.020]   And they say another mobile platform could be shown it next month's CES.
[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:05.260]   I'm going to think Droid because that was also a Cortex A8.
[00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:08.580]   So it has the same system on a chip.
[00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:10.060]   I don't know.
[00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:12.180]   I guess I presume OpenGL is available on that.
[00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:13.340]   So that's pretty impressive.
[00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:14.340]   Yeah.
[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:15.340]   That's pretty amazing.
[00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:18.780]   Hope it works out when they try to build games.
[00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:22.980]   I hope it's more for companies that want to build brand new first-person games for the
[00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:26.780]   iPhone as opposed to people who are trying to port games that were developed for a two
[00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:28.980]   fist control over the million things on it.
[00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:29.980]   That's the big problem, isn't it?
[00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:30.980]   The controlling it.
[00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:34.340]   I'm looking at this video and it's a little, I've been trying to play, you know, Call of
[00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:35.340]   Duty.
[00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:39.380]   There's a Call of Duty zombies level that they've ported to the iPhone.
[00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:41.540]   The controls, it's not ideal.
[00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:45.460]   Yeah, I find that the simpler games are just more, for me, more fun play.
[00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:46.460]   I much prefer to play them.
[00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:48.740]   Things like, you know, Pocket God are much more fun.
[00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:49.740]   Really.
[00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:52.300]   I just don't want to say the word of the new one that you got me hooked on.
[00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:53.300]   Really?
[00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:54.300]   You're still hooked on that?
[00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.300]   I am too.
[00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:56.300]   I can't stop.
[00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:58.060]   But it's nice to have geo defense because you don't play it all the time, right?
[00:34:58.060 --> 00:34:59.860]   You just pull it out when you've got a time.
[00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:00.860]   Standing line.
[00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:01.860]   Standing line.
[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:03.340]   It's nice to have that because it has so many levels.
[00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:05.140]   I'm almost done with the medium.
[00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:06.620]   Now I'm going to hard.
[00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:08.140]   So I'm all the way through medium.
[00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:10.220]   I can't win a hard one.
[00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:11.220]   It's tough.
[00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:12.220]   I'm stuck.
[00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:13.220]   Like I'm so close.
[00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:14.220]   I'm on the last one on the medium.
[00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:15.220]   On all of them, I'm just about to win.
[00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:16.220]   And then I like on level 30.
[00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:18.300]   And Andy's going, what the hell are you guys?
[00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:20.300]   No, no, no.
[00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:24.660]   I finally, I finally downloaded Orbital a few weeks ago.
[00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:26.100]   Oh, that sounds good.
[00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:30.460]   It is the perfect like two minute slam.
[00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:33.980]   But it turns out that every single game that I don't like on the iPhone turns out to be
[00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:37.420]   one where they over-copplicate the controls.
[00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:39.060]   You still have to design a game.
[00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:40.980]   It seems as though so that there are two.
[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:43.340]   There's a distinct area underneath your thumbs for gameplay.
[00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:45.340]   But the rest of it is just looking at the screen.
[00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:48.620]   I think you have to design the game for the platform.
[00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:49.620]   You know what's great?
[00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:52.780]   And it's still number one of the top selling games on the iPhone is Spider.
[00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:53.780]   Have you played that?
[00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:54.780]   I'm not.
[00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:55.780]   Because you're a spider.
[00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:59.060]   Your goal is to catch insects, the beautifully rendered backgrounds.
[00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:00.460]   And it's a very simple game.
[00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:07.020]   You use your finger to throw the spider to the next place so he can jump around.
[00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:09.300]   So it's very simple to jump around.
[00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:14.220]   And then if you want to throw a spin a web, you tap the spider, then flick him.
[00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:15.820]   And he can make a web.
[00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:17.060]   And of course, that's how you catch the bugs.
[00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:19.420]   It's perfect for this platform.
[00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:24.340]   And I think that's really the secret is designed for the platform.
[00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:29.020]   Apple has released new graphics firmware for the 27 inch iMacs.
[00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:31.820]   We've been talking about all the problems people are having with them.
[00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:33.860]   Flickering, corruption problems.
[00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:40.380]   Apple says it's the Radeon 4670 and 4850 video cards.
[00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:41.380]   That's one we have.
[00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:43.140]   Oh, we have the 4880.
[00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:47.580]   I can't remember which if I upgraded.
[00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:48.580]   What was it?
[00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:49.660]   What's the stock card for the 27?
[00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:51.100]   Is that the stock card?
[00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:53.140]   Anyway, they say the glitches.
[00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:57.100]   According to Mac News Network, the glitches might be why you were getting shipping delays
[00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:58.100]   for the 27.
[00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:01.300]   We talked about that last week.
[00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:04.540]   We also heard about cracked screens.
[00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:08.660]   An analyst with NPD said, you know, it's just they're selling really well.
[00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:09.660]   And it's hard.
[00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:11.900]   It's hard to, you know, they just sell it.
[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:12.900]   And Apple fan.
[00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:13.900]   Yeah.
[00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:16.460]   Hello, the problem is it's just too successful.
[00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:22.060]   But it's faster, more agile and more responsive to my needs than any 27 inch Windows machine
[00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:23.060]   with a cracked screen.
[00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:24.060]   I'm keeping it.
[00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:25.060]   I like it.
[00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:26.060]   I like it.
[00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:30.600]   Uh, jobs did win a, a, you know, kind of the consolation runner.
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:32.080]   First runner up.
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:37.300]   He has been named by the, uh, in, and what is this school?
[00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:41.240]   I N S E A D business school, insane business school.
[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:47.260]   The number one CEO, it'll be published in the Harvard business review in the next issue.
[00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:51.060]   2000 CEOs not measured by popularity or ethics.
[00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:53.180]   Oh, heaven for fed.
[00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:54.180]   No, no, no.
[00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:56.180]   It's city like ethics.
[00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:57.180]   What are you talking about?
[00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:58.180]   It is.
[00:37:58.180 --> 00:37:59.180]   Eo competition.
[00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:02.580]   But simply by their financial importance to a company and its shareholders, well, of
[00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:04.980]   course, Steve Jobs is number one on that list like that.
[00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:05.980]   Yeah.
[00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:12.340]   Well, and that's the, and I would argue that, um, their importance to the company and the
[00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:16.700]   shareholders as a single person would, I would actually say that if they're really, really
[00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:21.220]   important to their shareholders in the company, then they're actually, I would lower their
[00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:24.540]   score because they, you know, it makes the company less stable.
[00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:25.540]   True.
[00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:26.540]   Which is what we saw over the last year.
[00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:27.540]   True.
[00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:31.540]   I mean, we think that Apple would be fine, but it puts a lot of, you know, uh, fear into
[00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:36.380]   the whole system when it is so, uh, when there's a single point of failure available.
[00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:37.380]   Second place.
[00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:41.580]   Young, young, young, young, young who is a Samsung CEO.
[00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:48.000]   Third place Alexei Miller of Gazprom, the Russian gas producer, uh, Cisco's John Chambers
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.180]   is for Jeff Bezos of Amazon is number seven.
[00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:54.300]   Meg Whitman at sea, a former CEO of, uh, eBay.
[00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:55.500]   I don't think she's still a CEO.
[00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:58.300]   Is she she's running for Govna now?
[00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:02.060]   She's number eight, but she's still very important, evidently, even if she's not CEO.
[00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:06.380]   Well, I, I'd argue she's probably the one who, she, I mean, she's the one who made the stupid
[00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:11.540]   purchase of Skype for $3 billion without getting the key technology that makes Skype possible.
[00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:12.540]   I know.
[00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:15.660]   I wouldn't, I wouldn't argue that that makes her very valuable, but okay.
[00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:19.460]   And Google's Eric Schmidt, I guess they don't, you know, see, they don't rank stupid acquisitions
[00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:20.460]   in here.
[00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:21.460]   They don't put that in there.
[00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:22.460]   That's not, that's not part of the calculation.
[00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:23.820]   And Google's Eric Schmidt number nine.
[00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:29.260]   I, you know, I think because of Larry and Sergey being so involved in Google, you can't
[00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:34.300]   say Schmidt is right as key as, I mean, certainly Google is as important as Apple in the tech
[00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:38.300]   community.
[00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:40.900]   SciStar shutting down.
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:41.900]   That's it.
[00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:42.900]   It's over.
[00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:44.900]   The drama, the drama is over.
[00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:47.540]   Uh, well, maybe not, or maybe not.
[00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:49.340]   Uh, this is so confusing.
[00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:52.020]   On Friday, SciStar said it was shutting down.
[00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:55.780]   Rudy Padraza, who's the president said the shutdown would take place.
[00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:58.100]   Immediately all eight employees would be fired.
[00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:00.820]   The website down.
[00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:03.620]   This was not, by the way, a require, well, I guess it was.
[00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:05.220]   I mean, there's a permanent junction.
[00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:06.380]   I'm banning Matt clones.
[00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:09.860]   I guess there's really not much else you could do except start it.
[00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:13.220]   It tried to sell the rebel EFI, remember.
[00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:16.140]   But I, yeah.
[00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:20.300]   And then another attorney representing SciStar says, nope.
[00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:21.860]   Company's going to resume.
[00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:22.860]   We take it back.
[00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:25.860]   We're going to resume business on Saturday.
[00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:27.900]   So the first report came out Friday.
[00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:35.340]   Then on Saturday, uh, KAD Kamara, who was, uh, one of the attorneys said that Rudy was
[00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:36.340]   misquoted.
[00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:39.820]   The Mac clone producer is taking a break.
[00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:42.620]   That, that, that, that's the answer.
[00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:45.620]   I'm going to talk about the news and like a relationship with a girlfriend.
[00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:47.540]   They never want to take a break.
[00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:50.900]   I just, you know, can we just take a break for a few, a few, you know, just a little short
[00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:52.940]   break and you know, it's not you.
[00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:54.180]   It's not my house with you.
[00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:55.180]   Yeah.
[00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:57.020]   Just want to take a break.
[00:40:57.020 --> 00:41:00.460]   Um, is SciStar up?
[00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:01.940]   PSY STAR.com.
[00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:06.060]   I thought that we just, are you looking at that?
[00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:07.540]   I'm trying to get to it.
[00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:10.100]   We're just taking a little hiatus.
[00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:11.100]   We're taking a break.
[00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:16.700]   Because we know that we're going to come back and be able to make something even better.
[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:18.300]   I mean, we know.
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:19.780]   Maybe we could clone the Amiga.
[00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:20.780]   Yeah.
[00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:25.300]   Is anybody, does anybody mind if we clone the Amiga?
[00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:27.260]   Working our way up.
[00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:30.780]   No, they're still still down.
[00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:32.060]   Well, now they're slow.
[00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:33.060]   It's probably our fault.
[00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:34.060]   Yeah.
[00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:35.060]   We brought them down.
[00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:37.420]   Everybody, everybody go check SciStar.
[00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:41.180]   That has to be a tie for the worst, most thoughtless holiday gift ever.
[00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:43.660]   If they're stiff, both online stores are still open.
[00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:46.940]   Do you buy someone a SciStar clone or do you buy someone a Juju tablet?
[00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:47.940]   Yeah.
[00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:48.940]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:49.940]   Guess what?
[00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:53.260]   Oh, oh, I have the money to spend on a really awesome present for you.
[00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:56.740]   I just wanted to make sure that it was a present you would never actually receive or like in
[00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:57.740]   any way.
[00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:00.860]   Thanks for backing into my car on Thanksgiving.
[00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:04.420]   And you might get sued and you might get, you know, a cease and desist or based on the
[00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:05.420]   gift.
[00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:06.420]   Yeah.
[00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:09.340]   I don't know if this is Jermaine to Macintosh users.
[00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:12.420]   I guess it is, but it's kind of a shocker today.
[00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:15.020]   This just happened this morning, a half an hour ago.
[00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:18.060]   Microsoft lost its appeal.
[00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:24.220]   The US Accord of Appeals has upheld a verdict that claims that the XML code and Word 2003
[00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:31.100]   and 2007 violates patents by a Toronto company, I4i.
[00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:35.740]   And as of January 11th, Microsoft can no longer sell Word.
[00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:38.940]   And you can, and you can January 11th.
[00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:43.220]   As of January 11th, this, there was a temporary stay during the appeal.
[00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:45.700]   The appeal was rejected.
[00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:46.700]   Wow.
[00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:52.060]   It's, it's, it's not, it's not quite as dramatic as that from, from what I was, from what I
[00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:53.060]   was reading.
[00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:57.700]   There are two specific editions that can't, the 2003 and 2007 editions are dead.
[00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:02.700]   Or excuse me, are affected by this.
[00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:08.540]   They have to make sure they remove it from the future edition.
[00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:14.980]   You could, the, the, the, the smoking gun phrase though, in Microsoft statement is, you
[00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:19.980]   can tell that they're throwing in the towel because they're saying there was certain insignificant,
[00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:25.060]   barely used features in Microsoft Word that are that, that there are indiscretions.
[00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:28.940]   And so, we're going to do it in a way, as opposed, as opposed to we feel as though the unique
[00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:33.540]   intellectual properties, delivering value and value and promise to every one of our users.
[00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:36.260]   We're going to, on behalf of our users, we're going to defend this.
[00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:37.740]   No, it's, yeah, we're done.
[00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:41.940]   Well, they are, I mean, maybe, maybe, maybe it isn't insignificant, but they are.
[00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:50.620]   They do say they may go to the Supreme Court and either ask for an on bank rendering, or
[00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:53.940]   I'm sorry, rehearing in the court of appeals or a writ of cert.
[00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:58.780]   Oh, I've loved this, these terms, certiorari, certiorari.
[00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:01.060]   In other words, a judicial review from the Supreme Court.
[00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:05.580]   So they may, they may try to fight this, but January 11th, they will have to, you know,
[00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:08.940]   I mean, that's, I don't care if it's an insignificant little feature.
[00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:10.300]   You have to remanufacture.
[00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:11.700]   Yeah, that's a, that's a big deal.
[00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:14.340]   Well, you have all these boxes that have already been made.
[00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:16.580]   Like what do you do with everything that's already in the, in the chain?
[00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:20.500]   I mean, that's millions and millions and millions of copies that are just that are sitting at
[00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:21.500]   Best Buy.
[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:27.660]   Well, does it, does the injunction affect sales to distributors or sales from distributors
[00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:28.660]   to users?
[00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:33.380]   Well, can they, can they, are they going to be allowed to simply move existing inventory
[00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:38.140]   through, through, through the, through the pipeline or does that mean that every, that
[00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:42.380]   the black suited ninjas are going to drop in every Best Buy and every circuit city,
[00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:44.140]   do they already take care of circuit city?
[00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:46.900]   It's hard to tell them a lot of the ninjas have already been there, Andy.
[00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:49.100]   You don't have to, you no longer have to take care of circuits.
[00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:51.900]   It's an ownership bankruptcy court.
[00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:52.900]   You know, I don't know.
[00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:58.420]   I'm not, I'm not a, you know, a lawyer, the judge, Leonard Davis in the world famous U.S.
[00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:08.420]   District Court of Eastern Texas says it's an injunction banning the sales of word 2003,
[00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:11.140]   2007 and similar products.
[00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:14.660]   You know, I would imagine one of the things Microsoft would ask the court is, okay, can
[00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:22.100]   we force an up, you know, can we, can we leave the packages on sale, but have an update,
[00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:25.860]   immediate update that pulls that part out, right, or something like that?
[00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:27.420]   I mean, that's what I'd want.
[00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:30.260]   Also, this, this, the original injunction dates back to August.
[00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:35.460]   So it's possible that well, they got to stay, but it's possible if they have a reason.
[00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:36.460]   Yeah.
[00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:37.460]   Yeah.
[00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:39.860]   So if there's, if it's impossible to, those, those, those, those of you who have kids who
[00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:43.900]   are asking for a copy of word 2007 for Christmas, if they can't be, if they weren't able to
[00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:45.980]   ship them, there's your answer.
[00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:50.860]   I just, I think that's just, it has nothing to do with the Mac.
[00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:51.860]   Well, maybe it does.
[00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:54.700]   Does it have to do, does Mac office doesn't say Mac office is implicated here?
[00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:59.380]   I don't think Mac office does that Doc X format, doesn't.
[00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:03.860]   So we don't have to, we don't have to pull our Mac versions.
[00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:04.860]   Does anybody use office?
[00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:05.860]   Do you use office?
[00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:06.860]   No.
[00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:10.220]   I've, I switched over, uh, pages a lot.
[00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:11.220]   Actually.
[00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:13.660]   I switched over two years ago to, to, to, to I work.
[00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:14.660]   Yeah.
[00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:16.340]   I like pages a lot, but I mostly use Google Docs.
[00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:19.300]   When I send people, I send people stuff, what I love, I mean, the thing that I use the most
[00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:21.540]   out of pages is a little mail to.
[00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:24.180]   So I sit there and I, and I work on a document and I just go mail to and I can make it a
[00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:29.660]   PDF or a, or, or a Microsoft Word document or a paste document and just mail it to someone
[00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:31.180]   straight from the application or it's open.
[00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:34.140]   And it does a very good job of making, of reading and writing word.
[00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:37.740]   So I, I, I, I've never had a problem with annotations and everything else, but I've
[00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:39.540]   ever had other people with the word and it's, it's working.
[00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:44.460]   I get word, I get my, um, uh, advertising copy and, and micro, and doc format.
[00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:45.460]   Right.
[00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:48.180]   In fact, I think it's something that's Doc X format and I just open it in pages and it's
[00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:49.180]   fine.
[00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:51.700]   Well, and I, what we do, and a lot of times we have to rebuild people's presentations
[00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:56.380]   for video, uh, is we actually bring their PowerPoint into keynote because we can actually make
[00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:58.420]   it much nicer in keynote than any of you.
[00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:02.260]   Do you, do you, do you, are you just like the Chicago Sun times want word or no?
[00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:08.140]   No, uh, as a matter of fact, for the first eight or nine years, my editor didn't even
[00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:11.020]   want a text file attached, but he just wanted me to paste it into an email.
[00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:12.020]   Yeah.
[00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:13.020]   Because I was, they just want to see the work.
[00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:14.020]   Yeah.
[00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:17.860]   That's, that's one of the reasons why I keep, I keep loving a scrivener, uh, because it
[00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:23.420]   makes it, it keeps a complete distinction between what you're writing and then sending
[00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:26.220]   it to someplace else, uh, to have something else done with it.
[00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:29.820]   I write it in whatever format I like with all the annotations I like, with all the structure
[00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:34.100]   I like, with all the outlines I like, when it comes time to send copies to the Sun times,
[00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:35.980]   I burn, I actually use that term.
[00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:41.940]   I burn a copy and HTML format for the website, then I burn a shorter, uh, uh, RTF file, uh,
[00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:46.140]   for the editor who does the print edition all from the same file.
[00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:49.780]   It's, it's, it's such a, it's such a 2009 way of managing creative content.
[00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:50.780]   I love it.
[00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:55.420]   So, so, uh, here's, you're still using low ASCII.
[00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:57.820]   Oh, I remember using that eight bit.
[00:47:57.820 --> 00:47:58.820]   No, seven bit.
[00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:03.340]   Remember, uppercase L is also usable as a number one.
[00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:05.740]   You didn't want diacritical remarks.
[00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:08.820]   Did you, uh, seven bit ASCII?
[00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:10.260]   Boy, those were the days.
[00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:13.500]   Um, yeah, those were, but you know, that makes sense.
[00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:17.100]   And I, uh, I'm, when I wrote my book, when I wrote, I don't do it anymore.
[00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:23.020]   When I wrote books, uh, Q wanted them in word, but I think they were using revision tracking
[00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:24.020]   and word.
[00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:26.180]   I, that would be one of the few things that you really needed for.
[00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:28.180]   I just do everything in text edit.
[00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:31.660]   You know, I, uh, you know, I write everything, text edit, and then I move it to sometimes
[00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:35.580]   the pages, but I start because I just don't want everything just, I don't want any extras.
[00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:36.580]   I don't want anything.
[00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:37.500]   Well, like, I'm just trying to put text down.
[00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:41.100]   Um, well, that's why I love Google Docs and it's great to share and all that stuff.
[00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:42.100]   And I love the box.
[00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:43.100]   What is it?
[00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:44.100]   Well, get gears.
[00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:45.100]   What?
[00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:46.100]   Get gears.
[00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:47.100]   Yeah.
[00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:48.100]   Yeah.
[00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:52.100]   I just do the craziest thing is that when I build, I build lots of spreadsheets and, um,
[00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:57.060]   when I do, when I, when I do the spreadsheets, I build it in numbers and then I mail it to
[00:48:57.060 --> 00:48:59.460]   my Gmail account as an Excel file.
[00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:04.180]   And, and then I open it in Gmail and then share it on Google Docs because I need everyone
[00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:05.180]   else to be able to get it.
[00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:06.780]   I build it on Google Docs because it's too slow.
[00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:13.560]   Google Docs is like, I can build a, a, a great document in, um, about, you know, one
[00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:17.020]   tenth the time it would take me to build it in Google Docs in numbers.
[00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:20.700]   And then just, then I just get it on to Google Docs and let everyone edit it from there.
[00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:26.860]   You know, but it's a, anyway, it's our, uh, our, our, uh, business manager, our, uh,
[00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:31.140]   CEO, uh, Lisa says she refuses to use Google Docs because it's too slow.
[00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:33.260]   She, she insisted on having Excel.
[00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:34.460]   That's what makes me a little crazy.
[00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:35.540]   I couldn't get her to use numbers.
[00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:37.020]   So she's a little bit.
[00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:40.180]   Numbers numbers, numbers is to Excel.
[00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:41.180]   I don't even know how to say that.
[00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:42.700]   Well, it was what a Mac is to a PC.
[00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:47.540]   I mean, it just that it's, it is so, there are so many nice things and numbers that, you
[00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:49.660]   know, you, but that's because you like presentations.
[00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:53.780]   If you're a numbers person, lowercase numbers person, I think numbers is not great.
[00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:55.340]   I think it scales as well.
[00:49:55.340 --> 00:50:00.100]   I don't, I make lots and lots of sometimes fairly complex, um, spreadsheets, you know,
[00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:03.300]   that are very integrated and have all these pieces and everything else, but I don't do
[00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:07.260]   them at the nearly the level of a, I mean, you should see which Lisa does.
[00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:08.340]   And she really needs Excel.
[00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:09.940]   I mean, that's really, I can understand that.
[00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:12.860]   Andy, you were going to say something.
[00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:16.740]   No, I was, I was going to say that maybe this is a cultural thing, but I just have
[00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:19.500]   so many worries about everything that people can get.
[00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:24.420]   I, I, if I were to start to run my creative business through Google Docs, some, if I
[00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:29.580]   were to keep that in the cloud, where anybody who managed to find out my password might
[00:50:29.580 --> 00:50:32.740]   be able to look at everything that I'm thinking about, everything I'm planning and
[00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:36.340]   all the projects that I'm investing in, that would really just get me worried.
[00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:39.060]   I know it's my responsibility to pick strong passwords.
[00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:40.860]   It's my responsibility to keep changing them.
[00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:44.700]   But even if they were just a two week window, I'm doing a project right now that I'm
[00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:49.420]   not telling anybody about because it's so speculative, but I'm, it would just, it's,
[00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:50.820]   it's not even a financial thing.
[00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:54.580]   I just would creep me out to think I have a document that's out there.
[00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:59.460]   And if somebody knows that, that, uh, that, uh, my, my, that, that my password is
[00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:03.380]   US space and rocket center, he said, simply, comically reading the, the name of
[00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:04.500]   copy cup that was nearby.
[00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:05.700]   That is not, that was not a password.
[00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:05.940]   It's funny.
[00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:09.180]   Cause if I read the, my coffee cup, it would say Joliet prison.
[00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:11.660]   So there's a difference between you and me.
[00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:11.940]   Yeah.
[00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:13.380]   Yeah.
[00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:16.180]   And well, it's, it's tough because I'm, I'm working with somebody and probably
[00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:18.660]   the next couple of weeks is going to be the point where I'm going to have, we're
[00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:20.700]   going to have to use some sort of collaborative software.
[00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:25.900]   Uh, and I'm actually sort of inclined towards using one of eight different cloud
[00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:28.900]   services that are not Google, uh, because it tries.
[00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:31.540]   Zoho, um, I love Zoho.
[00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:34.420]   We, we use Zoho for a lot of our, a lot of our show standards.
[00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:35.780]   It's, it's a, it works with Google.
[00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:40.740]   If people are Google, Googleized, you can share Zoho, Zoho docs with Google.
[00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:44.900]   It's a, it's a, uh, it's just the creature conference of Zoho are a lot better than
[00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:45.100]   Google.
[00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:47.140]   I mean, none of them are word.
[00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:49.580]   That's a pro and a con.
[00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:56.460]   Um, moving along, this is a big story Disney, according to the Wall Street Journal,
[00:51:57.380 --> 00:52:01.380]   uh, CBS and Disney are considering, you know, Disney is obvious, but CBS, hmm,
[00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:05.740]   participating in an upcoming plan by Apple that we'd heard rumors about before to
[00:52:05.740 --> 00:52:12.340]   offer, get ready for this television subscription services over the internet.
[00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:13.820]   The proposed service.
[00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:18.900]   This is the Wall Street Journal, which Apple, in my opinion, has been using to launch
[00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:23.660]   trial balloons, leaks and hints for some time back to Steve Jobs illness.
[00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:28.500]   The proposed service by the maker of iPhones and iPod music players could in at
[00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:34.020]   least some scenarios offer access to some TV shows from a selection of some major
[00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:37.380]   US television networks for some monthly fee.
[00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:41.100]   According to people familiar with the discussions.
[00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:42.900]   Now that, now that's different from right now.
[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:46.300]   Can't, I don't understand how that's different from what I could do right now.
[00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:47.860]   I wanted, I watched, I'm watching Glee.
[00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:51.980]   Uh, and I want to watch it on iTunes.
[00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:55.260]   So I paid for a subscription when the new episode comes out.
[00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:55.980]   I get it automatically.
[00:52:55.980 --> 00:52:57.260]   How is this different from that?
[00:52:57.260 --> 00:53:01.340]   This is two to four dollars a month to watch a bunch of stuff from ABC.
[00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:05.020]   So you subscribe to CBS's entire, yeah, or some subset of it.
[00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:08.220]   If it's made, if it's created by production outside production studios, it
[00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:11.740]   would not necessarily be, which is sometimes is pretty often.
[00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:17.100]   So it really will be the in house stuff that Disney and CBS create as opposed
[00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:21.420]   to stuff created by American, for example, I think that, uh, if you were, if you,
[00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:24.540]   if it was, uh, like Law and Order, I think is produced by an outside company.
[00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:26.420]   So you wouldn't necessarily get a long order, but you can get that on.
[00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:27.620]   This is happening already.
[00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:30.140]   I mean, Rogers is doing something similar in Canada.
[00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:34.940]   Uh, uh, BBC does something similar in for free in Great Britain.
[00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:37.700]   And here in the States, if you're a Comcast subscriber, if you have both
[00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:43.860]   Comcast cable and Comcast internet, uh, they now put almost, I mean, I can
[00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:47.060]   watch, I dream of genie, everything from my dream of genie to the latest, uh,
[00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:49.260]   Glee for free on the internet.
[00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:51.100]   Now it's not a download.
[00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:52.340]   It's streaming.
[00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:53.140]   Right.
[00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:54.660]   So would this be streaming?
[00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:55.540]   Well, this might tie back.
[00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:58.500]   This might also tie back to the streaming technology that Apple just bought.
[00:53:58.500 --> 00:53:59.740]   What do they buy?
[00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:00.580]   Well, they bought the company.
[00:54:00.580 --> 00:54:01.620]   We talked about it a couple weeks ago.
[00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:02.620]   Lala.
[00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:03.060]   Yeah.
[00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:03.700]   Oh, Lala.
[00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:06.700]   Oh, I guess we, Lala is streaming is Lala streaming.
[00:54:06.700 --> 00:54:08.860]   We don't, we talked about it on the show, but is Lala streaming?
[00:54:08.860 --> 00:54:09.940]   It's music though.
[00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:10.220]   Is it?
[00:54:10.220 --> 00:54:13.460]   I mean, is that a streaming technology that they have now got access to that would
[00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:14.380]   help them with video?
[00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:14.940]   It might be.
[00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:16.660]   It might be connected.
[00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:23.060]   And it just seems like such a far off business model that could really, really work.
[00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:28.180]   If it's when I hear about it, about a subscription plan like this, I like the idea
[00:54:28.180 --> 00:54:31.660]   until I look at it further and then find out that we're all dealing with rumors
[00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:36.260]   right now and find out that it's well one network, some of its programming, not
[00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:37.220]   all of its programming.
[00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:41.260]   And I'm not going to, I'm not going to spend $15 a month to get reruns of
[00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:46.340]   according to Jim, uh, I would want, I would want to get the CB, I would want to
[00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:50.940]   get all of CBS's late, late, late programming and the Letterman and Ferguson.
[00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:52.380]   I want the big bang theory.
[00:54:52.380 --> 00:54:53.780]   I would want maybe two other shows.
[00:54:53.780 --> 00:54:57.380]   And if I can't get all of them, I would just have no interest whatsoever in that package.
[00:54:57.380 --> 00:55:02.220]   Well, but I mean, if you found that, that, that 80% of those shows were, um, were
[00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:06.420]   available or 50% of those shows were available and you were now saving the dollar 99
[00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:07.820]   that you would otherwise pay it.
[00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:11.260]   I mean, when I didn't have cable at all, because there was a, there was a couple
[00:55:11.260 --> 00:55:12.860]   five years I didn't have cable.
[00:55:12.860 --> 00:55:15.780]   Uh, I just had a budget in my head, which was my cable.
[00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:19.420]   You know, my cable bill that didn't exist, the $60 or $80 a month that I was going
[00:55:19.420 --> 00:55:20.060]   to spend on cable.
[00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:21.260]   And I just spent that on iTunes.
[00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:25.460]   I just buy the, you know, buy whatever I wanted to buy until I hit about $60, you
[00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:27.460]   know, and, um, usually I came in about that.
[00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:31.580]   I think the one thing people will respect is why is the price of their,
[00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:34.500]   their current cable subscription will look cheap.
[00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:38.620]   If they start having to subscribe to eat all a cart to each one of these, to CBS and
[00:55:38.620 --> 00:55:42.940]   ABC and CNN, they'll realize that, you know, buying it as a bundle actually makes
[00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:45.700]   more sense than they think everyone talks about wanting to subscribe all a
[00:55:45.700 --> 00:55:48.940]   cart, but if they have to make money on each subscriber, you end up in a whole
[00:55:48.940 --> 00:55:49.420]   different world.
[00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:53.300]   Truthfully, when I say all a cart, I mean show by show, not network by network.
[00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:54.260]   This is network by network.
[00:55:54.260 --> 00:55:54.380]   Yeah.
[00:55:54.380 --> 00:55:54.820]   That's what they're talking about.
[00:55:54.820 --> 00:55:58.260]   I'm much more interested in show by show because I don't want to buy all of
[00:55:58.260 --> 00:55:58.460]   CB.
[00:55:58.460 --> 00:55:58.820]   You're right.
[00:55:58.820 --> 00:56:00.060]   I don't want to buy all that crap.
[00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:00.900]   I want to buy one.
[00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:03.620]   How many shows now maybe I don't know.
[00:56:03.620 --> 00:56:08.660]   I mean, I usually don't watch more than one, maybe two shows a season that I think
[00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:10.820]   like Glee, like I think that I want to see every episode.
[00:56:10.820 --> 00:56:14.900]   I just, that's cheaper to subscribe to that to buy that from iTunes, even at 40 bucks
[00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:17.700]   for the whole season than it is to get a cable subscription.
[00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:18.380]   Maybe not.
[00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:19.300]   Yeah, I don't maybe not.
[00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:19.860]   That's up.
[00:56:19.860 --> 00:56:24.740]   Yeah, but I mean that Netflix has done such a thorough job of taking, replacing
[00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:28.700]   so much of my viewing that there's so many shows that I'm now just watching, not
[00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:31.700]   even via DVD, but actually just by Netflix streaming now.
[00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:37.300]   The top gear has just hit Netflix streaming, man versus food as it streaming.
[00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:38.660]   Mythbusters is on streaming.
[00:56:38.660 --> 00:56:41.460]   All most of my favorite shows are now available via streaming.
[00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:47.140]   I just feel as, I just feel as though once you add two layers of complexity
[00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:51.060]   to the choice, not only having to subscribe to another service and making sure
[00:56:51.060 --> 00:56:54.060]   that it has the packaging that I want, but also not making sure.
[00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:59.820]   Okay, so the big screen TV that I have that has the cable box in it, I'll have
[00:56:59.820 --> 00:57:02.980]   to have, make sure I have an Apple TV there or I'll have to have another compatible
[00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:06.300]   device there, but I won't be able to get that same programming on the device
[00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:08.340]   downstairs that has the Roku plugged into it.
[00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:12.220]   So I'll either have to swap the Roku for an Apple TV or do this.
[00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:14.700]   And there are a lot of bad things about cable television.
[00:57:14.700 --> 00:57:19.820]   You like, but you do like the fact that for a very low amount of money, you get
[00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:23.540]   a tuner that will stream all this content and you get four-ner channels of stuff
[00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:25.060]   that you can at least tolerate.
[00:57:25.060 --> 00:57:31.980]   Well, and the journal says Apple faces an uphill battle because a number of media
[00:57:31.980 --> 00:57:37.420]   companies, they include, in this case, News Corp, the famous Rupert Murdoch, via
[00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:42.940]   com, Turner, Discovery, all seem opposed to or leaning away from signing on,
[00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:47.540]   according to people familiar, NBC Universal, which Comcast now owns, well,
[00:57:47.540 --> 00:57:48.620]   they're not going to sign up.
[00:57:48.620 --> 00:57:50.140]   Comcast isn't going to let them do that.
[00:57:50.140 --> 00:57:54.580]   Well, I think that everyone is afraid of seeing Apple.
[00:57:54.580 --> 00:57:57.620]   No one wants to give Apple the ground that they got when it came when it came to music.
[00:57:57.620 --> 00:57:59.260]   They've learned you can only do that once.
[00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:03.460]   Yeah, they, you know, you know, I think they really got clear that Steve, Steve's
[00:58:03.460 --> 00:58:04.380]   pretty good at what he does.
[00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:06.740]   And if you give him enough ground to take it, he's going to take it all.
[00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:10.740]   You know, and while he probably saved the music industry to some degree, you
[00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:17.540]   know, I think that he, I think that that's the real issue is is that they don't want
[00:58:17.540 --> 00:58:18.900]   Apple to have the same dominance.
[00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:20.820]   And so they're going to make them go through a lot of groups.
[00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:26.300]   That we were very excited about with electronic publishing, where if there's one
[00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:29.100]   thing that could get every single publisher and every single distributor to band
[00:58:29.100 --> 00:58:33.500]   together, it's realizing of what the damage that Apple did to the music industry
[00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:38.140]   by in a business sense, by giving them one, creating one big gorilla that now
[00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:40.540]   everybody has to deal with for good or for bad.
[00:58:40.540 --> 00:58:44.420]   Well, now and then the music industry, I mean, the publishing industry gets out of
[00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:47.460]   that and goes into Amazon and realizes that, well, that's not an eaten.
[00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:50.060]   That was like out of the out of the frying pan into the fire.
[00:58:50.060 --> 00:58:50.460]   Yeah.
[00:58:50.460 --> 00:58:50.900]   Yeah.
[00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:50.980]   Yeah.
[00:58:50.980 --> 00:58:52.780]   But they got out of all those exclusives right.
[00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:57.180]   And right now there's there at least four different online stores where you can
[00:58:57.180 --> 00:58:58.580]   buy pretty much the same book.
[00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:02.140]   And then when you take a look at the, then when you start taking a look at, if I
[00:59:02.140 --> 00:59:08.020]   want to buy the new, the new Ted Kennedy memoir, it's, let's see, it's $24 from the
[00:59:08.020 --> 00:59:08.740]   reader store.
[00:59:08.740 --> 00:59:11.540]   It's $21 from this other store.
[00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:15.980]   And it's $9.99 for, or it's $9.99 or $15 from Amazon.
[00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:20.020]   So at least at least this competition, but now you realize why Amazon gets a
[00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:21.580]   good exclusive on some of the price.
[00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:21.820]   Right.
[00:59:21.820 --> 00:59:24.700]   Well, and also the, it's got to, it's got to terrify these publishers.
[00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:26.860]   And we talked a little bit about this in this week of media, but it's got to
[00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:30.380]   terrify these part when Stephen Covey starts doing exclusive relate, when the
[00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:33.860]   authors are now bypassing the publishers and going straight to Amazon.
[00:59:33.860 --> 00:59:37.460]   That's, you know, that's an, Apple has not gone down as a publisher as an
[00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:37.980]   author.
[00:59:37.980 --> 00:59:39.020]   That's in your interest.
[00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:39.900]   You're going to make more money.
[00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:40.820]   Absolutely.
[00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:43.700]   And you don't need the publisher anymore because there's no print, especially
[00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:43.820]   here.
[00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:44.380]   Well known.
[00:59:44.380 --> 00:59:46.260]   You know, he's, he's one of the best publishers.
[00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:47.940]   Don't market you if you're not well known.
[00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:48.980]   That's the irony of it.
[00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:52.380]   They only put marketing dollars on Danielle Steele and Steve Covey.
[00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:55.780]   They, they don't put marketing dollars on Leo LaPorte when he writes a book.
[00:59:55.780 --> 00:59:56.860]   That's up to you to market it.
[00:59:56.860 --> 00:59:57.820]   Right.
[00:59:57.820 --> 00:59:59.220]   And so you're gaining nothing.
[00:59:59.220 --> 00:59:59.740]   Exactly.
[00:59:59.740 --> 01:00:03.020]   When they start, but that's got to be, you know, you only needed them when you had
[01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:03.660]   to get on the cross.
[01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:06.060]   You only needed them when you had to get shelf space and now you don't.
[01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:06.220]   Right.
[01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:10.540]   And, and, and when Apple, one at one line that Apple has not crossed and I think
[01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:12.660]   that it, at first I didn't understand why.
[01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:16.940]   And when, when I saw the, the Covey article, I realized why was because, you
[01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:20.620]   know, if I'm a publisher, you know, man, that you're now chewing into my, you know,
[01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:25.100]   if Amazon did, did that effectively or if Apple did that effectively with lots
[01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:28.420]   of bands, it would, it would just tear the whole market in half.
[01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:32.940]   Well, and maybe that's what the television executives are thinking that the story
[01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:39.780]   in the journal says that the rumor was Apple was going to sell advertising free.
[01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:43.620]   They were going to call it the best of television for $30 a month.
[01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:49.020]   And the journal points out that US broadcast and cable networks sold $43.4
[01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:51.940]   billion in ads last year.
[01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:58.060]   So you've got to replace at 30 bucks a shot, $4.3, $43 billion.
[01:00:58.220 --> 01:00:59.420]   They ain't going to do the math.
[01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:00.100]   Right.
[01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:00.820]   They ain't going to happen.
[01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:03.900]   So, but they do have to figure this out.
[01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:05.860]   I mean, one of the other things that, well, you think it'll happen.
[01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:08.900]   And you might know, well, they got to figure out, I mean, Apple has to figure
[01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:13.460]   out and the industry has to figure it, you know, figure out how to, you know,
[01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:17.180]   well, their solution now is Hulu and each is doing their own, right?
[01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:20.020]   I mean, there's not going to be one Hulu, but you have to go to CBS.com
[01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:22.740]   to see CBS shows and the C.com NBC shows.
[01:01:22.740 --> 01:01:25.860]   And I think that one of the, one of the big, you know, gorillas in the, you know,
[01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:29.460]   in the, in the theater, so to speak, are, you know, you have YouTube
[01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:30.700]   that's going 1080p.
[01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:34.220]   Um, they're now, YouTube is talking about adding subscriptions.
[01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:35.980]   They're, they have 1080p.
[01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:38.420]   They're talking about possibly pay-per-view downloads.
[01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:41.460]   They're talking about, and they already have advertising revenue.
[01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:46.260]   I mean, that, that should scare, scare them far more than, you know, than
[01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:46.620]   app, right?
[01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:48.020]   Right.
[01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:49.700]   Anyway, we'll see.
[01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:51.300]   It's worked.
[01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:53.220]   We're clearly in a situation where things are changing.
[01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:56.260]   You know, somebody sent me this link to the Houston Chronicle.
[01:01:56.660 --> 01:02:01.900]   Laredo, Texas, which is a city of 230,000 people, no longer has a bookstore.
[01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:03.780]   I'm not surprised.
[01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:11.260]   The first big city to lose its last bookstore, um, that you have to drive
[01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:13.540]   150 miles to get to the next bookstore.
[01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:16.620]   Be Dalton closes, uh, January 16th.
[01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:18.180]   Be Dalton was not really, isn't it?
[01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:19.460]   I mean, it's not even a bookstore.
[01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:22.420]   So it is so down the middle.
[01:02:22.420 --> 01:02:23.820]   That's a coffee table bookstore.
[01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:25.860]   However, I mean, that's it.
[01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:29.900]   Now it'll be the largest city in the nation, 230,000 people without a bookstore.
[01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:32.020]   Oh, no, they got, they got Amazon.
[01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:33.260]   They got Barnes and Noble.com.
[01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:33.900]   I guess so.
[01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:36.940]   I mean, every, I mean, every time, every time I sort of going through the same thing,
[01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:40.020]   I went through a number of years ago when people, when Barnes and Noble started
[01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:44.180]   making its really big push of putting super stores, uh, and in every community.
[01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:47.940]   And people were moaning about independent bookstores, uh, folding up its
[01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:49.220]   tents, their tents and going away.
[01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:52.820]   I mean, I would be very, very, very, very, very shocked, hurt and disappointed
[01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:56.740]   and confused and be worried if the Procline Booksmith and Coolidge Corner,
[01:02:56.740 --> 01:03:01.020]   everyone under, because it's, it is, it is absolutely everything that you want in a bookstore.
[01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:04.540]   But in my community, that's not, that's not my hometown.
[01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:08.300]   In my community, every single bookstore was just such trash.
[01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:10.660]   It was a very limited selection.
[01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:14.180]   They regarded the bookstore as their own individual club that if you were, if you're
[01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:16.060]   fan of Danielle Steele, they're all over you.
[01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:19.660]   If you ask for anything they've never heard of, like, I don't know, Charles Dickens,
[01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:22.940]   you've got this glassy-eyed look and absolutely no offer of help.
[01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:26.460]   I'm not saying that I was pleased that they went under, but I'm saying that they
[01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:29.940]   were not in a position where they could make money any time in the future.
[01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:33.420]   And when you get a huge bookstore where, oh, we probably, we probably have what you
[01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:37.180]   want and by all means, take it off the shelf, sit over that comfy chair and read it
[01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:37.940]   for two hours.
[01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:39.540]   We just want you to be happy.
[01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:40.460]   Would you like a cookie?
[01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:41.100]   Yeah.
[01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:43.500]   I cannot complain about a store getting my business.
[01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:45.300]   No, in fact, I want and treats me nice.
[01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:48.780]   Just like the music industry, the publishing industry has done its own
[01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:50.220]   damage to itself, right?
[01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:53.460]   And what they want is they want their industry to remain the same.
[01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:54.420]   And I think that's one of the problems.
[01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:57.740]   And you see this to some degree with when people talk about Starbucks, when they
[01:03:57.740 --> 01:04:01.940]   talk about Walmart and when they talk about Apple stores, coming in and ruining
[01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:08.900]   the, you know, the vars, the value added resellers position is if you are producing
[01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:14.100]   a truly unique offering, people will keep on coming.
[01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:18.660]   There's a great coffee shop in Pittsburgh, probably one of the best coffee shops in
[01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:19.900]   the country called the Beehive.
[01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:22.140]   And it was one of the first ones in Pittsburgh.
[01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:24.420]   And, you know, it was there when I, you know, was there and we used to be there at
[01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:26.100]   two o'clock in the morning, you know, having coffee.
[01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:28.100]   It was there when women still had Beehive hairdos.
[01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:30.900]   I think, you know, it opened in 1991.
[01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:35.860]   Um, but what's interesting is a great truck stop, by the way, if you ever driving
[01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:40.900]   up to Red and called pantyhose junction, where the waitress is all in their 60s,
[01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:44.060]   or wearing short shorts, pantyhose and beer hive hairdos.
[01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:45.340]   This is germane to nothing.
[01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:45.700]   Go ahead.
[01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:48.300]   So the, uh, here's the interesting thing is that, you know, what people
[01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:52.020]   know is that, you know, Starbucks oftentimes looks for other coffee shops as a, this is,
[01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:56.140]   this would be a successful place to put a coffee shop, you know, and so Starbucks
[01:04:56.140 --> 01:04:59.140]   put a coffee shop cat a corner to the beehive.
[01:04:59.140 --> 01:04:59.860]   Of course they did.
[01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:02.540]   The beehive has expanded twice.
[01:05:02.540 --> 01:05:03.220]   Oh, that's great.
[01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:04.180]   Oh, I love hearing that.
[01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:08.620]   It is, it is the biggest coffee shop now and, and, and, and Starbucks doesn't do that.
[01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:10.260]   Well, and I, and I talked to the owner about it.
[01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:12.540]   I said, how, how has Starbucks across the street affected you?
[01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:14.300]   And he goes, oh, it's the best thing that ever happened to us.
[01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:18.740]   Because what happens is is that people find Starbucks on, you know, on their map,
[01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:21.700]   they come to Starbucks, but they look across the street and they see the beehive.
[01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:22.020]   What is it?
[01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:22.580]   Never come back.
[01:05:22.580 --> 01:05:23.660]   So is it the atmosphere?
[01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:25.900]   Well, it's, it's, it is an artsy atmosphere.
[01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:30.100]   It is a warm artsy, truly, your original, great place to hang out.
[01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:33.580]   It is, if, if anyone wants to do a model of how you should make a coffee shop that
[01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:36.820]   can compete with Starbucks, they should go to Southside Pittsburgh and look at the beehive.
[01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:37.180]   It is.
[01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:41.460]   It's the same message for everything, where the bookstore, Andy was describing coffee shops,
[01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:43.780]   record stores, even movie stores.
[01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:44.860]   It's about service.
[01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:45.980]   It's about atmosphere.
[01:05:45.980 --> 01:05:47.780]   It's not about unique and niche.
[01:05:47.780 --> 01:05:53.220]   You know, now our local movie store, Hollywood just disappeared one day.
[01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:54.020]   Yeah.
[01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:57.220]   And, and with it, their game store, I remember what it was called.
[01:05:57.220 --> 01:05:58.100]   EB Games or something.
[01:05:58.100 --> 01:05:59.780]   No, no, it wasn't that game stop.
[01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:04.980]   In fact, if you had a checked out movie or games, you got to keep it because they're gone.
[01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:06.580]   They were gone overnight.
[01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:07.300]   They disappeared.
[01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:09.820]   And I have to think that's happening too, all over the country.
[01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:12.820]   Who needs a movie store who needs a bookstore, but in their son book tours,
[01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:15.220]   like you still have to cannot get a coffee shop by mail.
[01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:16.540]   So they're safe in that regard.
[01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:17.020]   Right.
[01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:20.980]   But they have Starbucks, you know, to compete with the road to pieces of Santa Rosa.
[01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:22.660]   There's a Starbucks and a piece of it.
[01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:24.540]   Pete's catty corner right next to them.
[01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:26.900]   Hey, Barnes and Noble, right.
[01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:30.860]   And the local independent copper fields.
[01:06:30.860 --> 01:06:35.900]   It's one corner, one intersection in that town are exact demonstration of his war.
[01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:38.340]   Well, but and then you look at what you want to you want to you want to hear
[01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:42.500]   something funny, Barnes and Noble moved into Coolidge Corner about six or seven
[01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:45.860]   years ago and the booksmith ran them out of business.
[01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:46.580]   Yeah.
[01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:48.660]   They closed their doors three years ago.
[01:06:48.660 --> 01:06:49.100]   Love hearing.
[01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:52.380]   So if the community is going to support a business, you're good.
[01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:52.980]   It's community.
[01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:55.620]   If not willing to support a business, you can't blame Walmart.
[01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:56.980]   You can't blame Barnes and Noble.
[01:06:56.980 --> 01:07:00.220]   Well, let me backpedal that a little bit because sometimes those people do things
[01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:02.460]   that are very, very neat and very, very anti competitive.
[01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:06.940]   But, you know, communities spend, you know, if if these people, these people
[01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:09.060]   would not go out of business if they were incredibly profitable.
[01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:10.820]   So spend your money where you want to spend your money.
[01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:15.220]   Well, but I think also it is it's providing a service that is that is unique
[01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:17.220]   and individual and as a high quality.
[01:07:17.220 --> 01:07:18.940]   That's what a local producer can do.
[01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:19.940]   That's what an individual can do.
[01:07:19.940 --> 01:07:20.700]   They can be nimble.
[01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:24.460]   They can read some respects, not for every business, not for every business.
[01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:26.580]   But if you don't have that business, you should really be thinking about it
[01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:29.380]   because, you know, that's the like there's a there's a bookstore, like bookstore.
[01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:31.300]   There are it's a dangerous field to be in.
[01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:34.340]   There's an architectural bookstore and I can't think of the name of it in Berkeley
[01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:35.180]   on 4th Street.
[01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:37.780]   And it's this it's the best architectural bookstore.
[01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:38.980]   And I go that's a good idea.
[01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:41.500]   All those Stacys, which was the programmers bookstores,
[01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:41.940]   every business.
[01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:42.780]   Yeah, but it was everything.
[01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:47.180]   It had this one this bookstore is architectural, like it is just architectural
[01:07:47.180 --> 01:07:49.860]   and art and like, you know, graphic design and stuff like that.
[01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:56.060]   That's all they do, you know, and it's and it is and I go there to buy
[01:07:56.060 --> 01:07:57.140]   architectural books.
[01:07:57.140 --> 01:08:00.820]   And when I go there, I buy when I buy the book, I buy the book from them when I do it.
[01:08:00.820 --> 01:08:03.860]   I don't I'm not going to buy it on Amazon or whatever because I don't want them to go away
[01:08:03.860 --> 01:08:06.700]   because I don't know where I'd find these books otherwise, you know, and so.
[01:08:07.380 --> 01:08:08.980]   And I don't have the same feeling.
[01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:13.540]   There's a there's a great book called the case for working with your hands.
[01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:17.020]   You could buy that at Amazon.com, by the way.
[01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:22.660]   No, actually, it's called a shop class as soul craft and inquiry into the value of work.
[01:08:22.660 --> 01:08:27.660]   And one of the things that he says in this book is if you're thinking about being a
[01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:29.940]   programmer versus a carpenter, just keep in mind.
[01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:33.180]   The programmer job can be outsourced to India.
[01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:35.300]   Carpenter job cannot.
[01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:41.780]   So maybe it maybe we should really all be thinking about which of our jobs are
[01:08:41.780 --> 01:08:42.540]   predictable.
[01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:46.140]   Well, I think that I think like that though, I think that the future is with people who
[01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:49.540]   are being who are able to be creative, whether that's in a creative service or being
[01:08:49.540 --> 01:08:53.100]   in, I don't mean being creative like being in the creative industry, but but being
[01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:54.220]   creative about what you're doing.
[01:08:54.220 --> 01:08:55.300]   And that's what's going to make a difference.
[01:08:55.300 --> 01:08:58.300]   Otherwise, you're competing with people all around the world or you're competing
[01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:00.060]   with machines, right?
[01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:02.780]   You know, and you know what can't be exported.
[01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:04.500]   Well, maybe it can is service.
[01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:05.300]   It seems to me.
[01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:10.540]   Yeah, but there's also sometimes the nature of how people transact, consumer
[01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:11.900]   transaction just changes.
[01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:16.460]   I mean, a good example was I needed, but I wanted to buy a new watch and I knew
[01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:18.500]   exactly this after doing a lot of research online.
[01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:19.900]   I found exactly the one I wanted.
[01:09:19.900 --> 01:09:21.420]   And it wasn't to me.
[01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:24.260]   It's this kind of cool, like mundane Swiss railway watch.
[01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:29.100]   And I wanted to I wanted to buy it locally, but there was no store that had
[01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:30.700]   exactly the one that I wanted.
[01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:33.860]   And I really did have to go to Amazon to get it.
[01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:38.300]   There's I think one of the things that's being bred out of the consumer
[01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:42.060]   experience is the idea of, well, you know, it's not exactly what I want, but I
[01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:42.540]   need a watch.
[01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:44.020]   So I should get it right here and right now.
[01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:47.380]   Now people have an expectation that exactly the sort of thing that they're
[01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:50.540]   looking for is available somewhere in the world and they can get it with free
[01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:51.860]   shipping for two day delivery.
[01:09:51.860 --> 01:09:53.420]   And that's what's driving it.
[01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:56.900]   It's people like service, people like supporting local businesses, but in the
[01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:59.300]   end, they want the wristwatch that they wanted to get.
[01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:04.020]   Well, and the irony is that this Matt Crawford book shop classes, soulcraft
[01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:06.060]   is available on the Kindle and has an audio book.
[01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:06.940]   Download.
[01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:08.660]   You don't need to go to the book store.
[01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:12.780]   See, that's exactly like I love the fact that individual creators now have
[01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:15.940]   the ability to build their own audiences and profit directly there from.
[01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:19.060]   I've still I still have a really great relationship with Wiley, the publisher
[01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:21.180]   of my textbooks and other companies that I'm working with.
[01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:25.340]   But I like the idea that if there is an idea that I don't think is easy to sell
[01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:27.540]   to a publisher, I'm perfectly free.
[01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:27.860]   Right.
[01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:31.340]   Create an EPU version of it, either go through a storefront that will take only
[01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:35.980]   11% of the transaction or create it as an iPhone app and get access to better
[01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:37.660]   marketing for 30% cuts.
[01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:41.620]   That's what's and this is the book shop class as soulcraft and inquiry into the
[01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:42.300]   value of work.
[01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:44.180]   Matthew B Crawford and it's on audible.
[01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:45.220]   It's also on Kindle.
[01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:47.660]   It's also I absolutely agree with that though.
[01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:49.780]   I wish that and I wish that high schools would treat.
[01:10:49.780 --> 01:10:50.180]   Yes.
[01:10:50.180 --> 01:10:56.100]   Create the vote tech courses and promote them as just as viable a way to make a
[01:10:56.100 --> 01:11:00.180]   look as as if they need to be explained that it's okay to be a plumber.
[01:11:00.180 --> 01:11:02.140]   It's more than okay.
[01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:04.500]   It might be less jobs in the US.
[01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:05.140]   Exactly.
[01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:09.020]   And yet they're being denigrated and shuttled off into well, that boy is not too
[01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:09.340]   bright.
[01:11:09.340 --> 01:11:12.980]   We'll teach him how to fix toilets and that'll be, oh, it's not a challenging goal.
[01:11:12.980 --> 01:11:14.060]   He'll never go anywhere with it.
[01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:17.060]   Yeah, but he'll make as an apprentice, he'll make a lot of money.
[01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:21.140]   Like when he's 19 or 20 after he gets his high school diploma and gets his first
[01:11:21.140 --> 01:11:24.500]   cards by the time he's 30, he'll have two trucks and four people working for him.
[01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:24.900]   Right.
[01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:25.900]   They'll do well.
[01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:28.140]   They didn't even tell me that.
[01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:30.860]   The vote tech was available when I was in high school.
[01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:31.780]   I would have taken it.
[01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:34.180]   Like, I was like, well, we're glad you didn't.
[01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:37.300]   You had a number of you be here today.
[01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:37.980]   Cars.
[01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:38.420]   Yeah.
[01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:39.420]   No, it's true.
[01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:42.940]   And there's something very satisfying about doing that, but I, you know, I'm not a hand.
[01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:43.740]   I hate it.
[01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:46.340]   I got a, I got a, I'm a knowledge, I'm a classic knowledge worker.
[01:11:46.340 --> 01:11:47.460]   I sit on my butt all day.
[01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:47.940]   Yeah.
[01:11:47.940 --> 01:11:50.060]   Let's take a break.
[01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:53.820]   We're going to come back and get your picks of the week, gentlemen.
[01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:56.620]   But before we do that, I want to get my pick of the week.
[01:11:56.620 --> 01:11:58.860]   Actually, Andy, you can do one, but I was just thinking maybe we
[01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:04.740]   should make this book, our pick of the week says it is, it is in fact on Audible.com.
[01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:05.540]   I'm already downloading it.
[01:12:05.540 --> 01:12:07.380]   That's the beauty.
[01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:08.620]   Isn't that of Audible.com?
[01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:12.340]   It's a very, people with poor impulse control.
[01:12:12.340 --> 01:12:13.620]   It's like, couldn't be better.
[01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:14.060]   Couldn't be better.
[01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:18.020]   You want a book and, you know, I always check first to see if it's available in audio,
[01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:21.300]   because to me, that's the way I absorb.
[01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:24.340]   And I figure if you're listening to podcast, it might be the way you absorb
[01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:24.980]   information.
[01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:27.700]   And I just tell you, there's a lot of times I'm in the car.
[01:12:27.700 --> 01:12:28.380]   I'm at the gym.
[01:12:28.380 --> 01:12:33.820]   I'm doing homework or housework that I just, I can't be holding a book, but I love reading.
[01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:35.460]   It's one of my favorite things to do.
[01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:38.380]   Some of you may say, but yeah, but I like the physicality of it.
[01:12:38.380 --> 01:12:39.140]   I love the book and stuff.
[01:12:39.140 --> 01:12:43.580]   And yeah, that may be true, but try an audio book because there is another aesthetic
[01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:46.900]   going on and especially well done audio books that the kind that Audible
[01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:51.780]   dubs were a great reader brings a book to life in a way that is unique and wonderful.
[01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:53.140]   Let me play, just give you an example.
[01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:54.900]   And I haven't listened to this.
[01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:55.780]   So I don't know what we're going to get.
[01:12:55.780 --> 01:13:00.140]   Mac Bloom, Max Bloom, Quest reading from Matthew B Crawford's shop class is
[01:13:00.140 --> 01:13:01.060]   soul craft.
[01:13:01.060 --> 01:13:02.500]   Here's just what it sounds like a little bit.
[01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:05.020]   I'm not how identified as jobs of the past.
[01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:11.380]   But we might pause to consider just how hardheaded these presumptions are and
[01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:16.660]   whether they don't on the contrary issue from a peculiar sort of idealism, one that
[01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:21.060]   insistently steers young people toward the most ghostly kinds of work.
[01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:27.060]   Around 1985 articles began to appear in education journal.
[01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:30.420]   So you can listen this and it's like somebody talking to you.
[01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:34.620]   It's like somebody, the author in fact, this isn't the author, but that doesn't
[01:13:34.620 --> 01:13:37.100]   matter because it's, you know, it's the author's words.
[01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:40.620]   And it's, it's like you're having a conversation with the author and it's, it's
[01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:42.300]   just a different experience.
[01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:42.980]   I love it.
[01:13:42.980 --> 01:13:45.780]   Uh, go to audible.com right now.
[01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:48.980]   Actually go to audible.com/macbreak right now.

[01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:55.420]   Keep it even if you cancel at any time.
[01:13:55.420 --> 01:14:00.740]   I'm afraid that I, I, uh, I view reading now, uh, the way I view driving, you know,
[01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:02.140]   driving to me is just burning time.
[01:14:02.140 --> 01:14:03.700]   And I'm sitting there with a book.
[01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:07.300]   I'm afraid that I view it like, like I could be doing something while I'm, while
[01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:10.300]   I'm reading this, you know, I could be cleaning or I know I'm working on the
[01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:11.300]   out and the hard, whatever.
[01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:13.700]   I'm like, this is, I'm, this is a, I'm unit asking.
[01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:14.500]   I'm unit asking.
[01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:15.980]   I'm only, I'm only going to multitask.
[01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:17.060]   Oh, no, you're a bad.
[01:14:17.060 --> 01:14:17.340]   That's.
[01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:22.540]   I have never burned through more reading books in my life since I acquired my
[01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:26.580]   Kindle and since the Kindle app appeared on the iPhone series, it's true.
[01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:28.140]   Hail, hail the written word.
[01:14:28.140 --> 01:14:30.420]   Well, I think making it available.
[01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:35.620]   I raised my diet cola in my Houston area, Apple user group mug to the
[01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:37.300]   concept of words on pages.
[01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:40.900]   You know, they missed a bet adding the area and Apple.
[01:14:40.900 --> 01:14:43.100]   If we're just the Houston user group, it'd be hug.
[01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:46.540]   What, but then you, but now it's hard.
[01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:50.780]   You wouldn't have this adorable pig using what appears to be an apple three
[01:14:50.780 --> 01:14:51.340]   computer.
[01:14:51.340 --> 01:14:51.780]   Okay.
[01:14:52.340 --> 01:14:54.100]   And rainbow apple colors too.
[01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:55.340]   Rainbow hog.
[01:14:55.340 --> 01:14:57.020]   There's a reason.
[01:14:57.020 --> 01:14:58.980]   There's a reason why this is next to my desk.
[01:14:58.980 --> 01:15:01.620]   Sir, that's because powerful name, powerful logo.
[01:15:01.620 --> 01:15:02.660]   It makes me happy.
[01:15:02.660 --> 01:15:07.060]   I, I give you your hug mug and I raise you one, Joliet prison mug.
[01:15:07.060 --> 01:15:14.060]   Suitable for ringing, ringing across the bars to get the, the jail
[01:15:14.060 --> 01:15:15.060]   keeps attention.
[01:15:15.060 --> 01:15:16.900]   Hey, hey.
[01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:20.340]   When you grind, we're sitting on top of my latte.
[01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:23.460]   I suppose be a non fat whip.
[01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:28.180]   Jealous, Jealous, you gave me, you put caramel in my latte.
[01:15:28.180 --> 01:15:35.060]   Anyway, shopcraft as soul, shop class as soulcraft.
[01:15:35.060 --> 01:15:38.540]   I think a very provocative book for those of us and I know most of you
[01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:43.620]   are in this category who are knowledge workers about the value of hand work.
[01:15:43.620 --> 01:15:47.540]   And even if it's just a hobby, there is something about doing it with your hands.
[01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:49.500]   I just, I like to do it with my hands.
[01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:51.820]   I, I have a show title.
[01:15:51.900 --> 01:15:52.660]   Yes.
[01:15:52.660 --> 01:15:56.460]   Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[01:15:56.460 --> 01:15:57.500]   No, I can.
[01:15:57.500 --> 01:16:01.460]   I think Rudolph is on the roof.
[01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:03.700]   I go ahead.
[01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:04.180]   I'm sorry.
[01:16:04.180 --> 01:16:07.580]   There's definitely something about, you know, I'm, I'm getting back into farming,
[01:16:07.580 --> 01:16:15.300]   you know, I, I, and, but there is definitely something about the physicality of it that I, when I left the farm, you know, many years ago, I was like, I am never.
[01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:15.660]   Right.
[01:16:15.660 --> 01:16:18.100]   Like when I leave, I am never touching an animal again.
[01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:18.300]   Yeah.
[01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:18.940]   Like ever.
[01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:19.900]   I'm just never going to touch one.
[01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:20.420]   It's in your blood.
[01:16:20.460 --> 01:16:25.380]   And now I'm finding myself, I'm buying chickens in the spring and I'm.
[01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:26.620]   See, my father was a professor.
[01:16:26.620 --> 01:16:30.460]   So scrolling marginalia with a quill pen is in my blood.
[01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:33.220]   That's, that's, that's hand work for me.
[01:16:33.220 --> 01:16:36.660]   Audible.com/MacBreak, your first book is free.
[01:16:36.660 --> 01:16:37.260]   Take a look.
[01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:45.180]   There's a great selection of 65,000 wonderful titles waiting for you at audible.com/MacBreak.
[01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:48.780]   So Andy, I give you the week off for your pick of the week.
[01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:50.460]   You can, you can save that for next week.
[01:16:50.460 --> 01:16:51.300]   That's, that's okay.
[01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:54.340]   I'll, I'll just recommend a child's Christmas and Wales next week after Christmas.
[01:16:54.340 --> 01:16:57.020]   That would be good too.
[01:16:57.020 --> 01:16:57.380]   Who is it?
[01:16:57.380 --> 01:16:58.340]   Dylan Thomas reading it?
[01:16:58.340 --> 01:17:00.580]   Dylan, Dylan Thomas reading a child's Christmas and Wales.
[01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:02.700]   Actually, this is, this can be just a short and sweet one.
[01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:03.820]   No, do recommend this.
[01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:04.780]   He's narrating it.
[01:17:04.780 --> 01:17:05.540]   It's 40 minutes.
[01:17:05.540 --> 01:17:14.860]   It's not the, not, it's not the, given how many times I've really stuck it to audible.com, suggesting the people download 18 hour, 20 hour, 24 hour books as their auto, as their audible books.
[01:17:14.860 --> 01:17:16.220]   They'll get you the Christmas spirit.
[01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:16.940]   It's well read.
[01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:18.100]   It's well, well written.
[01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:22.820]   It has one of the best last lines in all of literature.
[01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:24.380]   It's a, you know, so funny.
[01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:28.020]   We had this album when I was growing up, Dylan Thomas reading this.
[01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:31.780]   I am so glad you mentioned this because it was a Christmas tradition for me.
[01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:36.620]   I'm going to play a little bit of it just because he's got this great, you know, Welsh voice.
[01:17:36.620 --> 01:17:40.700]   This is the great poet, Dylan Thomas reading from his short story.
[01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:45.820]   I'm, I'm buying this right now just because I want to have this every holiday season, a child's Christmas and Wales.
[01:17:45.820 --> 01:17:46.620]   It's beautiful.
[01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:50.100]   Nobody could have had a noise there Christmas Eve.
[01:17:50.100 --> 01:18:01.100]   And when the fireman turned off the hose and was standing in the wet smoky room, Jim's aunt, Miss Prothero, came downstairs and appeared in at them.
[01:18:01.100 --> 01:18:05.740]   Jim and I waited very quietly to hear what she would say to them.
[01:18:05.740 --> 01:18:08.980]   She said the right thing always.
[01:18:09.540 --> 01:18:17.900]   She looked at the three tall fireman and their shining helmets, standing among the smoke and cinders and dissolving snowballs.
[01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:21.700]   And she said, would you like anything to read?
[01:18:21.700 --> 01:18:27.820]   Yeah. Oh, Andy, I'm so thrilled that you found that.
[01:18:27.820 --> 01:18:29.700]   I mean, that really is my childhood.
[01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:31.460]   It is. It's just, it's 45 minutes.
[01:18:31.460 --> 01:18:38.780]   Well, he also says that I got, I got to read the last line, which is, which is like, I don't always remember it exactly.
[01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:40.460]   But there are many nights where I'm going to bed.
[01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:44.180]   I'm just thinking to my head, I turned the gas down, I got into bed.
[01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:47.860]   I said some words to the close and holy darkness and then I slipped.
[01:18:47.860 --> 01:18:50.100]   It's a wonderful book.
[01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:55.700]   I think it judging from the recording, it must have been a reading he did at some point in the hall.
[01:18:55.700 --> 01:19:00.180]   It's, I think, of course, the case back to 1950s, something.
[01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:02.580]   Yeah, I think it's long. He's long, long gone, of course.
[01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:03.780]   You might have better one.
[01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:07.300]   You can get one that, excuse me, better audio recording, not necessarily a better reading.
[01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:08.340]   By somebody else.
[01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:09.660]   It does one. Right. Right.
[01:19:09.660 --> 01:19:11.020]   Oh, actually he's down.
[01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:12.700]   Already from Raiders of the Lost Ark.
[01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:15.100]   Yeah, he's got a wonderful voice.
[01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:16.500]   So he would probably be good too.
[01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:19.700]   It just depends on whether you want to hear the author read it or not.
[01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:24.020]   But, oh, I'm so see to me, it's, that's the sound of Christmas.
[01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:25.340]   So we used to listen to that every Christmas.
[01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:26.660]   I'm so glad you found that, Andy.
[01:19:26.660 --> 01:19:27.100]   Thank you.
[01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:29.420]   You see, Audible, a treasure trove.
[01:19:29.420 --> 01:19:31.260]   It's all about Audible.
[01:19:31.260 --> 01:19:32.500]   It is.
[01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:33.460]   It really is for me.
[01:19:33.460 --> 01:19:35.220]   I'm going to, I'm downloading him right now.
[01:19:35.220 --> 01:19:35.900]   It's so wonderful.
[01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:39.220]   Now, let us get your pick of the week, Mr. Alex.
[01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:40.220]   Lindsay.
[01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:41.820]   I've got two small picks.
[01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:44.180]   They're both iPhones.
[01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:46.260]   I'm going to do an iPhone.
[01:19:46.260 --> 01:19:51.500]   I've been doing some big ones, but I got a couple applications that I'm that I'm really happy with.
[01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:54.620]   So one of them is, you know, I travel a lot.
[01:19:54.620 --> 01:19:59.500]   And a lot of times I'm trying to figure out how much things cost, you know, how much is going to cost me to get to different, different locations.
[01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:05.860]   And an application that I'd love to see more websites, you know, support or an application that I'd love to see.
[01:20:06.060 --> 01:20:07.860]   More people emulate is kayak.
[01:20:07.860 --> 01:20:09.860]   So kayak is always I love kayak.
[01:20:09.860 --> 01:20:11.420]   I love kayak.com.
[01:20:11.420 --> 01:20:19.860]   So kayak.com is where, you know, I often check to see, you know, what kind of rates I'm going to get to fly to Africa or fly to, you know, Brazil or whatever.
[01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:30.060]   And it usually, because it's scraping across many sites, it's the easiest place for me to find, you know, which site is going to give me the best price or the best features very quickly.
[01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:33.180]   And their interface is just fantastic for the iPhone.
[01:20:33.180 --> 01:20:42.900]   You know, I have one here that's from San Francisco to the seashells and, you know, Alex is going to the seashells still pending, but maybe possibly.
[01:20:42.900 --> 01:20:47.780]   So if any of our listeners are in the seashells, you know, contact, you know, contact me.
[01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:51.060]   So on my Twitter, something because I need more information.
[01:20:51.060 --> 01:20:53.180]   So anyway, but I, but I can do the search.
[01:20:53.180 --> 01:20:55.100]   I, you know, putting the date in is great.
[01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:58.620]   Anyway, it's, I think it's, it's either free road 99 cents or something like that.
[01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:03.780]   And it's just really, really, really worthwhile to have to download to do that.
[01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:07.940]   The other one that I believe is also free or 99 cents is the NPR news.
[01:21:07.940 --> 01:21:12.460]   I'm a, you know, I listen to NPR constantly and, you know, in the morning when I'm getting ready.
[01:21:12.460 --> 01:21:13.060]   I love that.
[01:21:13.060 --> 01:21:13.620]   And I have that.
[01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:14.500]   Oh my gosh.
[01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:15.580]   The app is awesome.
[01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:17.340]   I mean, it's, it is, it has all the story.
[01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:27.180]   I don't, I, the only downside of the NPR news is I can't imagine what the radio stations are thinking because now this is like NPR resisted this for a long time.
[01:21:27.180 --> 01:21:28.180]   And then they just resisted.
[01:21:28.180 --> 01:21:31.140]   And they finally gave up and now they've, it's all here.
[01:21:31.140 --> 01:21:48.300]   I have to say that the way all the programs NPR, their new website, which I complained about at the beginning, combined with this is probably one of the most advanced approaches to media distribution that any major organization is doing or even any small organization.
[01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:55.260]   When you can, you can download everything off their website, you can already download them, just, just, you know, hit download, download, download, download and download the ones you want.
[01:21:55.260 --> 01:22:01.580]   But when you talked about creating a playlist of stories, just the stories you wanted from all things considered, you can do that with this program.
[01:22:01.580 --> 01:22:02.060]   And that's, yeah.
[01:22:02.060 --> 01:22:04.580]   And, and, and you can do this on this application.
[01:22:04.580 --> 01:22:07.260]   You can just simply say, I want to listen to this, listen to this, listen to this.
[01:22:07.260 --> 01:22:09.460]   And then it'll stream it and it'll stream it over 3G.
[01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:09.740]   Yep.
[01:22:09.740 --> 01:22:18.380]   Which is part of why AT&T is, you know, complaining and hurting about general 3D traffic because people like us are interested in avatar go to fresh air.
[01:22:18.380 --> 01:22:22.060]   There's a short review of avatar and you add it to your playlist.
[01:22:22.060 --> 01:22:22.900]   You click add to playlists.
[01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:23.740]   Now it's in your playlist.
[01:22:23.740 --> 01:22:25.500]   You can create your own, basically.
[01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:29.980]   And it's a playlist can be a mixture of all things considered and fresh air and morning edition and all the other things.
[01:22:29.980 --> 01:22:30.420]   It's pretty impressive.
[01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:33.980]   Anyway, it is really, really well built application.
[01:22:33.980 --> 01:22:35.780]   And so anyway, those are my two choices.
[01:22:35.780 --> 01:22:36.140]   Yeah.
[01:22:36.140 --> 01:22:36.700]   My two picks.
[01:22:36.700 --> 01:22:36.900]   Yeah.
[01:22:36.900 --> 01:22:39.340]   This is, this is going to change the, the landscape.
[01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:43.140]   You know, I, I hope mom's not listening right now.
[01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:46.420]   There's a Livio makes a internet radio.
[01:22:46.420 --> 01:22:48.300]   That's the NPR radio.
[01:22:48.300 --> 01:22:53.260]   Now you can do this without an NPR radio, but they branded an NPR and money goes to NPR when you buy it.
[01:22:53.380 --> 01:22:54.740]   It's got an NPR button.
[01:22:54.740 --> 01:22:56.980]   It's got a list of all the NPR shows.
[01:22:56.980 --> 01:23:02.020]   It's an internet radio that you can listen to other stuff, of course, including us on, right?
[01:23:02.020 --> 01:23:06.540]   But, but it's, it's programmed so that it's easy to do exactly the same thing as you're doing with this application.
[01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:07.900]   But it does do story by story by story.
[01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:08.180]   Yeah.
[01:23:08.180 --> 01:23:11.980]   Because basically what NPR decided, remember when we met with NPR?
[01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:14.660]   Maybe you weren't there at the, I think it was a first podcast expo.
[01:23:14.660 --> 01:23:17.940]   Then I said, guys, it's great that you stream all things considered.
[01:23:17.940 --> 01:23:19.220]   It's great that you offer the full show.
[01:23:19.220 --> 01:23:23.540]   But really I want to listen to chunks.
[01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:30.940]   And they were very nervous about disintermediating the stations because really that's a lot of their money comes from stations.
[01:23:30.940 --> 01:23:31.220]   Right.
[01:23:31.220 --> 01:23:38.140]   And I guess somebody somewhere pulled the plug and said, sorry stations, but we're going to, we're this is the future.
[01:23:38.140 --> 01:23:39.780]   This is this, it's going to happen.
[01:23:39.780 --> 01:23:40.540]   So we're going to do it.
[01:23:40.540 --> 01:23:41.180]   Right.
[01:23:41.180 --> 01:23:47.300]   And while I'm glad about that, I do know that the application has a list of NPR stations by locality.
[01:23:47.300 --> 01:23:48.580]   You can find your NPR station.
[01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:53.580]   You should still support your NPR station because a lot of that money goes to NPR to produce these programs.
[01:23:53.580 --> 01:23:53.860]   Well, that's right.
[01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:55.300]   Something to check in the WQ.
[01:23:55.300 --> 01:23:58.100]   I mean, you know, you know, you know, I don't send it to NPR.
[01:23:58.100 --> 01:24:02.300]   So, so, but it's, you know, it's tough.
[01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:03.100]   It's got to be tough for them.
[01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:10.140]   And this is an example of a company of a business just like CBS or the record industry saying, well, we got to face the future.
[01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:14.100]   And it might be, it might be painful, but we're going to pull this bandage now.
[01:24:14.100 --> 01:24:14.900]   Yeah.
[01:24:15.060 --> 01:24:17.340]   Well, because you want to stay ahead of it and you want to keep on experimenting.
[01:24:17.340 --> 01:24:30.340]   And it's just, and, and, and, you know, for a lot of us that are doing, I know for me, when I think about doing audio podcasts and I think about audio content, I still look at, at NPR, at, at, you know, the American life.
[01:24:30.340 --> 01:24:32.900]   American life is simply the best radio show ever made.
[01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:33.140]   Yeah.
[01:24:33.140 --> 01:24:35.180]   And absolutely.
[01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:36.140]   And those are the things.
[01:24:36.140 --> 01:24:37.340]   And so I listened to them a lot.
[01:24:37.340 --> 01:24:42.780]   I listened to them for the content, but a lot of what I do is I also, I'm also listening to it because I'm, you know, I'm learning.
[01:24:43.140 --> 01:24:43.980]   But you know what they're doing?
[01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:45.660]   I know at least this American life does.
[01:24:45.660 --> 01:24:46.460]   And I think others do it.
[01:24:46.460 --> 01:24:47.620]   This American life has ads.
[01:24:47.620 --> 01:24:49.060]   They have audible ads.
[01:24:49.060 --> 01:24:54.260]   They have, they're basically turned their podcast into a commercial entity because they don't have the same restrictions.
[01:24:54.260 --> 01:24:54.580]   Yeah.
[01:24:54.580 --> 01:25:02.940]   And so they're getting financed at the cost, I think, at the cost of the stations, they're getting their own financing directly.
[01:25:02.940 --> 01:25:07.100]   It could be a kind of the beginning of the end for NPR.
[01:25:07.100 --> 01:25:10.260]   I don't know about the end over the stations, not for NPR.
[01:25:10.260 --> 01:25:10.380]   Yeah.
[01:25:10.380 --> 01:25:13.100]   I think I think what you're looking at is you're looking at NPR.
[01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:14.580]   It's program producers.
[01:25:14.580 --> 01:25:18.940]   Well, it's program producers, you know, like all things considered and they're not NPR.
[01:25:18.940 --> 01:25:21.340]   They're APS or something.
[01:25:21.340 --> 01:25:24.420]   They're another programming arm, public radio, but not NPR.
[01:25:24.420 --> 01:25:31.980]   It's them saying, just like a publisher, a author will go directly to the audience is them going directly to the audience.
[01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:32.340]   One.
[01:25:32.340 --> 01:25:43.060]   And I think that the one challenge that NPR is going to have when they do all of this is that there's going to be have to be some kind of reversal, you know, where, because one of the things that NPR does is they get a lot of their local news.
[01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:46.020]   From their local, you know, these local stations.
[01:25:46.020 --> 01:25:55.180]   And so they're going to it might get to a point where they have to they have to, you know, end up paying the local stations to cover the, you know, it could be a reversal over time.
[01:25:55.180 --> 01:25:56.980]   But it's exciting for me for PR.
[01:25:56.980 --> 01:25:57.820]   Thank you.
[01:25:57.820 --> 01:25:59.780]   It's a PRI public radio and a national.
[01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:05.500]   That's your pick to pick two great picks, Mr. Andy and I'll go your picture.
[01:26:05.500 --> 01:26:13.020]   Well, this is that time of year when this is a pick I was going to give next week, but I realized that
[01:26:13.020 --> 01:26:16.340]   I think you everybody needs to have as much advanced notice as possible.
[01:26:16.340 --> 01:26:24.820]   There is if I'm giving a talk and a Q and A goes into like hour four, almost inevitably, I will get a question that I love to answer this.
[01:26:24.820 --> 01:26:32.140]   And this is an actual question that I got during one Q and A, which was what font are you using for your presentation?
[01:26:32.140 --> 01:26:33.940]   It's like comic sans only.
[01:26:33.940 --> 01:26:34.940]   It doesn't suck.
[01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:42.780]   At which point I told them that while there's a really great company called comic craft, they have a website called comic book.
[01:26:42.780 --> 01:26:50.580]   And which they sell all kinds of really cool, hand-lettered fonts and display fonts and just special effects fonts.
[01:26:50.580 --> 01:26:56.580]   And such fun typefaces, not just fun, but very, very professionally done.
[01:26:56.580 --> 01:27:03.860]   If you picked up a comic book, anytime in the last five or six years, chances are probably seven out of 10 that that comic used a font that was created.
[01:27:03.860 --> 01:27:04.980]   The pros are using it.
[01:27:04.980 --> 01:27:12.740]   Oh, that's interesting because, yeah, because publishers will publishers will actually go and say, well, we'll actually commission the creation of a type of a font.
[01:27:12.780 --> 01:27:22.660]   For them, a lot of artists will even create who used to are known for hand lettering their own comics will commission the creation of a typeface that matches their lettering as well as possible.
[01:27:22.660 --> 01:27:26.380]   You will actually see lettering by comic craft in the credits for a lot of different comics.
[01:27:26.380 --> 01:27:26.860]   Oh, interesting.
[01:27:26.860 --> 01:27:33.660]   That's not just that's not just the pick because they do something awesome every single year.
[01:27:33.660 --> 01:27:42.340]   Now, if you look through this catalog, you'll find that most of these fonts start at 49 bucks for those, like really, really garish graphic fonts you might use for one headline or something.
[01:27:42.540 --> 01:27:50.580]   The comic book fonts, the things you might actually want to lay out even though a whole ad or a whole business card in those tend to go for $100, $200, $300.
[01:27:50.580 --> 01:28:03.660]   One day a year, January 1st of every single year, they have a sale in which every single font is priced at one penny for every year since year zero.
[01:28:03.660 --> 01:28:04.700]   Wow.
[01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:09.900]   The font in the entire catalog will be $20 and 10 cents January 1st only.
[01:28:09.900 --> 01:28:16.100]   That includes that includes monologous, which costs, which costs the $395.
[01:28:16.100 --> 01:28:20.820]   My presentation font, which is hedge backwards, normally $129.
[01:28:20.820 --> 01:28:25.700]   Even even the ones that cost $15 to begin with, those are going to be $20 in a penny.
[01:28:26.420 --> 01:28:47.220]   Every single title and every I swear to God, Twitter, if there's going to be a hashtag for comic craft sale on Twitter, it's going to be a trending topic because at least in my circle of friends, there's always that first tweet at one in the morning after, well, before I go to bed, I bought three fonts on comic craft, just the ones that those ones are going to buy.
[01:28:47.220 --> 01:28:49.540]   And then you wake up and you get tweets from other friends.
[01:28:49.540 --> 01:28:51.180]   Oh, did you get mild mannered?
[01:28:51.180 --> 01:28:52.540]   Oh, damn, that is a great one.
[01:28:52.540 --> 01:28:52.900]   Okay.
[01:28:52.900 --> 01:28:56.460]   I thought that went to, you see that new way that came out and I'm over.
[01:28:56.460 --> 01:28:57.660]   It's like sort of like the kiss font.
[01:28:57.660 --> 01:28:58.060]   Damn.
[01:28:58.060 --> 01:28:58.260]   Okay.
[01:28:58.260 --> 01:28:59.260]   No, the $20 one.
[01:28:59.260 --> 01:29:11.660]   So the only now the reason why I'm giving this advice well in advance is because on the day of the sale, every single price in this online catalog will be $20 and one cent.
[01:29:11.660 --> 01:29:18.500]   So now I know there's a psychological sort of marketing thing that says that people tend to attach value to higher prices.
[01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:22.500]   There's also the natural affinity towards saying, if,
[01:29:22.700 --> 01:29:27.180]   if every font is $20, $20 and 10 cents, I don't want to buy the $28 one.
[01:29:27.180 --> 01:29:28.820]   I want to buy the $400 one.
[01:29:28.820 --> 01:29:34.500]   So that's why off and on for the next week, I'm going to be making up my own little list wish list of fonts that I want.
[01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:35.380]   Good job.
[01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:42.580]   Including the ones that look monologous, which is the most precise, perfect looking hand-lettered font you have ever seen in your life, $400.
[01:29:42.580 --> 01:29:44.700]   Yeah, that's the one I want.
[01:29:44.700 --> 01:29:45.220]   Boy, that's great.
[01:29:45.220 --> 01:29:48.900]   How could I be making my decisions based solely on how much of a deal I'm getting?
[01:29:49.100 --> 01:29:57.940]   But also it's it's it helps you to steer your way towards the really the ones that really required a lot of hand detail, a lot of attention and a lot of precision.
[01:29:57.940 --> 01:29:59.700]   So I'll be buying a lot of those fonts.
[01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:06.500]   I'm also be buying a lot of those really garish looking fonts that you can't imagine using it more than once or twice.
[01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:16.660]   But that once or twice when you really want to have a slide that has this really 1953 flowing ribbon sort of typeface, you realize, wait a minute.
[01:30:16.860 --> 01:30:20.740]   There's a font called spills that I paid $20 and eight cents for two years ago.
[01:30:20.740 --> 01:30:22.300]   That's exactly what I'm going to use here.
[01:30:22.300 --> 01:30:29.540]   So yeah, I you know what you you did this last year and I bought a bunch of them, including hedge backwards, which I don't use in any presentations.
[01:30:29.540 --> 01:30:33.100]   Because respecting Andy and he and not because copyright.
[01:30:33.100 --> 01:30:37.100]   But and I got a kiss font and I forgot about that.
[01:30:37.100 --> 01:30:42.980]   I'm so glad you reminded of us and I'm going to check out my dog M O N O L O G O U S is that a spell?
[01:30:42.980 --> 01:30:46.300]   No, I'll just write my knowledge is my naga list.
[01:30:46.300 --> 01:30:48.540]   My naga list.
[01:30:48.540 --> 01:30:51.820]   My naga list comic book fonts.
[01:30:51.820 --> 01:30:52.740]   Don't let's stop.
[01:30:52.740 --> 01:30:53.220]   Stop.
[01:30:53.220 --> 01:30:55.580]   We're going to pay a licensing fee quickly.
[01:30:55.580 --> 01:30:56.260]   Stop.
[01:30:56.260 --> 01:30:57.900]   No, I don't care about the licensing fee.
[01:30:57.900 --> 01:30:59.940]   I care about suicide by our listeners.
[01:30:59.940 --> 01:31:04.060]   Comic book fonts.com.
[01:31:04.060 --> 01:31:12.660]   Remember the sale is one day only not until January 1st, but you definitely want to start putting put that on your little to do list to start looking at the
[01:31:12.660 --> 01:31:14.420]   catalog because they do have dozens and dozens.
[01:31:14.420 --> 01:31:18.540]   I do wish that the catalog were a little bit better organized.
[01:31:18.540 --> 01:31:28.780]   There's a there's a it's very well laid out as you can see, but it took me a while before I realized that, oh, you have to click on that little blue more arrow to see everything within a certain category.
[01:31:28.780 --> 01:31:31.460]   It's only showing you one or two representations of what's available.
[01:31:31.460 --> 01:31:34.540]   You'll have to really drill down deep to see the entire catalog.
[01:31:34.540 --> 01:31:35.020]   Great stuff.
[01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:37.700]   Well, since Alex gave us two two.
[01:31:37.700 --> 01:31:39.580]   iPhone apps.
[01:31:39.580 --> 01:31:40.820]   I'm going to give you two iPhone apps.
[01:31:41.180 --> 01:31:45.260]   But when I already mentioned, I thought, you know, I don't think I've ever picked this and it really deserves to be picked.
[01:31:45.260 --> 01:31:58.300]   Not that it's unknown because in fact, I think it's right at the top of the list of paid games, but it is it is a good example in my mind of what you can do with a iPhone game if you pay attention to the UI.
[01:31:58.300 --> 01:32:02.740]   And it is, of course, a spider, the secret of Bryce Manor.
[01:32:02.740 --> 01:32:08.340]   It's $2.99 and a really fun kind of casual game.
[01:32:08.740 --> 01:32:12.580]   Beautiful. I think Andy, you'd appreciate especially the artwork in this.
[01:32:12.580 --> 01:32:15.540]   It's just beautiful hand drawn backgrounds.
[01:32:15.540 --> 01:32:26.420]   And as the spider, you're exploring these worlds, looking for insects that you can trap by spinning your web, you know, to catch them, which makes it a lot of fun.
[01:32:26.420 --> 01:32:28.500]   It's just it's just beautifully done.
[01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:29.860]   A really fun game.
[01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:30.620]   I already bought it.
[01:32:30.620 --> 01:32:34.220]   And it's a casual game.
[01:32:34.220 --> 01:32:40.500]   It's not going to you're not going to find it as compelling as, you know, the tower defense games.
[01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:42.860]   So I've touched him and I'm going to throw him.
[01:32:42.860 --> 01:32:44.020]   Come on, flick away there.
[01:32:44.020 --> 01:32:44.980]   Oh, I went too far.
[01:32:44.980 --> 01:32:47.420]   So he couldn't he couldn't make a web.
[01:32:47.420 --> 01:32:48.620]   He can only make a web a certain distance.
[01:32:48.620 --> 01:32:52.700]   You have limited web making abilities, by the way, you have to complete the web by.
[01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:59.820]   You can move along the web, complete the web by running a thread across it.
[01:33:02.140 --> 01:33:05.980]   And then you have to hope that bugs go in there and you have to eat the bugs.
[01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:09.060]   Beautiful backdrops, really a lot of fun.
[01:33:09.060 --> 01:33:18.300]   And man, those bugs are so difficult to catch, you know, but you get to crawl around through the environment and it kind of gives you the idea of what it's like to be a spider.
[01:33:18.300 --> 01:33:22.500]   Just a very fun, not I wouldn't say a particularly challenging game.
[01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:25.940]   And, you know, there's no online play capabilities or anything like that.
[01:33:25.940 --> 01:33:28.740]   It's just it's just pretty to explore the environment.
[01:33:28.740 --> 01:33:30.580]   So that's that's the first one.
[01:33:30.900 --> 01:33:36.420]   The second one is something, you know, we're planning a trip to CES that I've mentioned before, a number of trip planning programs.
[01:33:36.420 --> 01:33:44.060]   There's some excellent ones, including travel assistant pro, which I use and flight track, both of which tie in to a I-trip.
[01:33:44.060 --> 01:33:46.940]   But this is a new one from USA Today called autopilot.
[01:33:46.940 --> 01:33:50.940]   It's free advertising supported and it also ties into I-trip.
[01:33:50.940 --> 01:33:57.340]   So if you use I-trip, which if anybody who travels should be, should know about the free I-trip site, you may let your confirmation emails.
[01:33:57.340 --> 01:33:59.580]   It automatically builds an itinerary.
[01:33:59.580 --> 01:34:06.380]   And then you can log into the itinerary and get information, you know, about weather and so forth maps.
[01:34:06.380 --> 01:34:08.980]   USA Today's has that.
[01:34:08.980 --> 01:34:11.900]   So I've got not I-trip, did I say I-trip trip it?
[01:34:11.900 --> 01:34:12.540]   Pardon me.
[01:34:12.540 --> 01:34:14.700]   T-R-I-P-I-T.com.
[01:34:14.700 --> 01:34:17.060]   I'm so sorry, tripit.com.
[01:34:17.060 --> 01:34:26.340]   But the USA Today app will tie into your trip it itinerary, give you flight details, tell you whether you're on time.
[01:34:26.340 --> 01:34:28.220]   You can email your itinerary.
[01:34:28.460 --> 01:34:34.340]   Then there's some advertising, but it also has a flight tracker by flight, by airport, by route.
[01:34:34.340 --> 01:34:38.220]   And in this tough winter, this might be a very useful thing to have on your iPhone.
[01:34:38.220 --> 01:34:41.060]   So it also gives you a map of delays.
[01:34:41.060 --> 01:34:43.580]   So from flight stats.com.
[01:34:43.580 --> 01:34:48.180]   So you can see all over the country, which air law airports are on time, which are not.
[01:34:48.180 --> 01:34:52.500]   You can get more details on the delays, how long they are and so forth.
[01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:56.700]   It has very handy directory of now these these.
[01:34:57.220 --> 01:35:00.980]   It has an advertised partner, which is the Hampton Inn's in this case.
[01:35:00.980 --> 01:35:02.820]   But then it has plenty of other places.
[01:35:02.820 --> 01:35:09.380]   So directories for all the hotels, last minute car rentals, yes kayak and more on here.
[01:35:09.380 --> 01:35:15.860]   So it's very handy if you're doing any traveling weather, galleries of destinations, articles and experts.
[01:35:15.860 --> 01:35:19.340]   This is a wonderful travel app and best of all, it's absolutely free.
[01:35:19.340 --> 01:35:21.620]   This is from USA Today.
[01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:23.660]   It's called autopilot.
[01:35:23.900 --> 01:35:29.540]   So there's a free one and a game that's two ninety nine, a couple of really useful iPhone apps.
[01:35:29.540 --> 01:35:35.780]   You know, there's a website I should also mention that captures famous people's iPhone front page.
[01:35:35.780 --> 01:35:37.540]   Are you I think you're on that Andy, aren't you?
[01:35:37.540 --> 01:35:45.780]   Can't remember the name of it, but it's a great way to see what, you know, people like Gruber and others have on the front page of their iPhone.
[01:35:45.780 --> 01:35:49.700]   They have yet to ask me, but they're but there I'm showing you.
[01:35:49.700 --> 01:35:50.540]   Not that he's bitter.
[01:35:50.860 --> 01:35:54.340]   Can I give you one more freebie and you're going to get mad at me Microsoft Bing?
[01:35:54.340 --> 01:35:57.860]   Bing actually has done a very nice iPhone app.
[01:35:57.860 --> 01:35:59.860]   It has the Bing picture of the day on it.
[01:35:59.860 --> 01:36:07.020]   And just as Bing does, if you use Bing for your search, it has highlighted areas that give you searches that are related.
[01:36:07.020 --> 01:36:11.340]   It also has it's a it's a location based speech basis.
[01:36:11.340 --> 01:36:13.540]   They're competent competition for the Google thing.
[01:36:13.540 --> 01:36:17.260]   So it has speech recognition, which is I would say is good as Googles.
[01:36:17.620 --> 01:36:20.340]   It has images, search movies.
[01:36:20.340 --> 01:36:21.820]   If you hit movies, it knows where you are.
[01:36:21.820 --> 01:36:24.100]   It'll tell you what movies are nearby maps.
[01:36:24.100 --> 01:36:29.140]   It's it's an all in one app that's designed to compete with the ubiquitous Google apps.
[01:36:29.140 --> 01:36:31.460]   Of course, it's not using Google's maps.
[01:36:31.460 --> 01:36:32.900]   It's using MSN maps and so forth.
[01:36:32.900 --> 01:36:36.500]   But I, you know, it's free and I think it's a nice thing to have on your iPhone.
[01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:39.820]   I put it as you notice right next to the Google app.
[01:36:39.820 --> 01:36:40.940]   Bought it.
[01:36:40.940 --> 01:36:42.460]   It's free.
[01:36:42.460 --> 01:36:44.180]   It's actually great.
[01:36:44.180 --> 01:36:46.220]   You know, Tom, Paul Thoreth told me about it.
[01:36:46.220 --> 01:36:47.420]   And I was very impressed.
[01:36:47.660 --> 01:36:49.780]   It's, you know, give him credit.
[01:36:49.780 --> 01:36:54.980]   They've done a very, I think, a beautiful iPhone app, actually, one of the most elegant iPhone apps I've seen.
[01:36:54.980 --> 01:36:56.980]   It's called Bing.
[01:36:56.980 --> 01:36:57.900]   You've heard of it.
[01:36:57.900 --> 01:36:59.580]   There you go.
[01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:03.420]   There are picks of the week and our thoughts about the news of the day.
[01:37:03.420 --> 01:37:07.900]   Andy Inako is a resident geek at the Chicago Sun times.
[01:37:07.900 --> 01:37:11.340]   And also at the celestial waste of bandwidth.
[01:37:11.340 --> 01:37:12.740]   That's his website, dub dub dub.
[01:37:12.740 --> 01:37:14.940]   C W O B dot com.
[01:37:15.580 --> 01:37:17.420]   And he's snowed in right now in Boston.
[01:37:17.420 --> 01:37:22.860]   So if you want to send him food, comic books, are you allowed to consume comic books?
[01:37:22.860 --> 01:37:23.820]   If you don't buy them.
[01:37:23.820 --> 01:37:26.300]   What do they taste?
[01:37:26.300 --> 01:37:29.020]   And do they taste good to turn off your are you muted, Andy?
[01:37:29.020 --> 01:37:30.700]   Andy, I can't hear you.
[01:37:30.700 --> 01:37:33.500]   What happened to Andy?
[01:37:33.500 --> 01:37:41.660]   One moment he's saying, yes, I was, I was, I was muting the audio so that as other people are talking, if I go like that, that would be like that.
[01:37:41.660 --> 01:37:44.420]   The Catholics would thought, wow, the body of Christ.
[01:37:44.580 --> 01:37:46.740]   Anyway, is that what the bell means?
[01:37:46.740 --> 01:37:50.380]   Is that the history of the bell for Christmas?
[01:37:50.380 --> 01:37:52.940]   No, there's no, no, no, that has nothing to do with Christmas.
[01:37:52.940 --> 01:37:54.980]   There's a piece of stage craft in the Catholic mass.
[01:37:54.980 --> 01:37:55.820]   Oh, when he rings the bell.
[01:37:55.820 --> 01:37:56.020]   Yeah.
[01:37:56.020 --> 01:38:00.580]   Anyway, in my, in my church, it was like a slave else sort of thing.
[01:38:00.580 --> 01:38:04.740]   And that was every time I hear a slave else, I think the body of Christ.
[01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:12.780]   Anyway, but getting back to more serious things, comic books, I'm running a long article about it for the Sun times.
[01:38:13.580 --> 01:38:27.140]   The first week of January, and every single category of media in which I have not bought a DVD, I've, I've, the only books I've really acquired are the times when people who are authors, friends of mine have given me books with lovely inscriptions and them.
[01:38:27.140 --> 01:38:29.740]   And I'm like, no, I'm not going to tell you, please take this back.
[01:38:29.740 --> 01:38:31.820]   I can't have this lovely thought in my side my house.
[01:38:31.820 --> 01:38:39.340]   But the only thing that was an absolute total fail was comic books because nobody is doing anything that serves my needs.
[01:38:39.340 --> 01:38:40.180]   Nothing.
[01:38:40.180 --> 01:38:40.620]   Nobody.
[01:38:40.860 --> 01:38:46.500]   Even marble has an online initiative there where it's more like we have a mega event coming up in three months.
[01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:52.340]   And so we're willing to let you have these four comic books that tie into that that were published 10 years ago.
[01:38:52.340 --> 01:38:53.980]   Thank you very much.
[01:38:53.980 --> 01:38:55.020]   The best.
[01:38:55.020 --> 01:38:59.500]   And part of it was trying to see how easy it is to get along with this sort of stuff.
[01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:08.780]   I did find, of course, very quickly that there are lots of websites where you can download just about every comic book that was published last week in a CBR or a CBZ format totally illegally.
[01:39:09.620 --> 01:39:11.420]   After so that wouldn't count.
[01:39:11.420 --> 01:39:17.380]   Well, no, that would that would not count because I'm getting it in a digital format and not getting a physical comic.
[01:39:17.380 --> 01:39:18.300]   That's right.
[01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:19.060]   Yeah.
[01:39:19.060 --> 01:39:26.900]   I should point out though that after I pretty much confirmed that it works and confirmed that yes, these are readily available, then I kind of stopped downloading comics illegally.
[01:39:26.900 --> 01:39:29.940]   Because I felt me, I felt pretty skeeved about it.
[01:39:29.940 --> 01:39:32.540]   But I could just pay down on them this year and pay for them next year.
[01:39:32.540 --> 01:39:34.620]   Yes.
[01:39:34.620 --> 01:39:35.220]   Yes.
[01:39:35.220 --> 01:39:37.100]   There's my plan, my clever.
[01:39:37.740 --> 01:39:41.660]   My Christmas gift to you, Andy, is I put rationalize your bad behavior.
[01:39:41.660 --> 01:39:42.500]   Excellent.
[01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:44.100]   It's like a minute.
[01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:45.100]   It's just no blower.
[01:39:45.100 --> 01:39:47.620]   I'm going to put it in my garage.
[01:39:47.620 --> 01:39:52.460]   Next year, he'll have it back better than ever.
[01:39:52.460 --> 01:39:56.260]   Leo said steel.
[01:39:56.260 --> 01:39:57.740]   No, I didn't know it.
[01:39:57.740 --> 01:39:58.300]   No, I didn't.
[01:39:58.300 --> 01:39:59.140]   Thank you, Andrew.
[01:39:59.140 --> 01:40:01.780]   Also, Andy is at.
[01:40:01.780 --> 01:40:04.020]   Oh, I mentioned that his website, CWOB.com.
[01:40:04.020 --> 01:40:05.220]   And are you coming to Mac world Expo?
[01:40:05.220 --> 01:40:06.580]   I'm coming to Mac world Expo.
[01:40:07.540 --> 01:40:09.340]   And I'm also doing lots of cool stuff.
[01:40:09.340 --> 01:40:09.780]   Of course.
[01:40:09.780 --> 01:40:10.780]   And it'll be months.
[01:40:10.780 --> 01:40:11.500]   What was I saying?
[01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:16.900]   Yeah, wait, I hope you'll come sit in one of those big tall backed chairs in the back of the stage for a Mac world life.
[01:40:16.900 --> 01:40:22.020]   See, the only thing that worries me is that the stage setup that you've described sounds like a hip.
[01:40:22.020 --> 01:40:24.060]   Like one of those R rated hypnotist acts.
[01:40:24.060 --> 01:40:24.660]   Yes.
[01:40:24.660 --> 01:40:25.220]   Yes.
[01:40:25.220 --> 01:40:26.580]   You are getting OK, though.
[01:40:26.580 --> 01:40:29.180]   One of you is now you're all getting very, very warm.
[01:40:29.180 --> 01:40:31.100]   The heat in the room is so high.
[01:40:31.100 --> 01:40:33.340]   You just have to take off your little.
[01:40:33.340 --> 01:40:34.420]   Oh, oh, there.
[01:40:34.420 --> 01:40:35.420]   There goes Donna.
[01:40:35.420 --> 01:40:36.260]   Yes, Donna.
[01:40:37.140 --> 01:40:41.100]   There's always a Donna who's very, for some reason, glad to be taking off her clothes.
[01:40:41.100 --> 01:40:54.220]   Alex Lindsey is at the beautiful Pixelcore, both Pixelcore.com for the multimedia guild of artists, working and training together to become the best that they can be in the 2D and 3D world.
[01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:56.060]   Have you seen Avatar?
[01:40:56.060 --> 01:40:57.420]   I have loved it.
[01:40:57.420 --> 01:40:58.300]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:40:58.300 --> 01:40:59.700]   Andy, did you see Avatar?
[01:40:59.700 --> 01:41:02.580]   I'm seeing it tonight or tomorrow night.
[01:41:02.580 --> 01:41:05.940]   I have been on media lockdown on that movie for an entire week.
[01:41:05.940 --> 01:41:08.820]   I won't say I'm almost vibrating with excitement.
[01:41:08.820 --> 01:41:13.780]   I'm reading Hebrews review, which the first the first paragraph was basically.
[01:41:13.780 --> 01:41:16.260]   He just loved it, didn't he?
[01:41:16.260 --> 01:41:26.700]   James Cameron gave me $4.8 billion to say the following words because I've never when when Ebert loves a movie, he'll just love the hell out of it right in the first graph.
[01:41:26.700 --> 01:41:31.740]   And if I if I was hopeful before I read it after it was like, Oh, God, I got it.
[01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:32.340]   I got it.
[01:41:32.340 --> 01:41:32.740]   I got it.
[01:41:32.740 --> 01:41:35.100]   There's a journalist.
[01:41:35.100 --> 01:41:36.020]   And it sounds like Alex agrees.
[01:41:36.020 --> 01:41:40.180]   Here's the thing is that the James Cameron is, of course, a technical master, you know, of what he does.
[01:41:40.180 --> 01:41:40.180]   Right.
[01:41:40.180 --> 01:41:41.380]   And he's able to.
[01:41:41.380 --> 01:41:44.060]   He just knows where the technology can be pushed to.
[01:41:44.060 --> 01:41:51.340]   But what's far more important is his understanding of a story, you know, and being able to tell a good story, you know, and it's not that this is a groundbreaking story.
[01:41:51.340 --> 01:41:55.860]   It's not that it's it's, you know, it's it's, it seems kind of trite.
[01:41:55.860 --> 01:41:58.940]   Yeah, but but it is it is told very well.
[01:41:58.940 --> 01:42:02.420]   It is, you know, packaged very well and it is it's a it's a good ride.
[01:42:02.420 --> 01:42:08.780]   It's a good ride and it's in it, but it's, you know, it really is, you know, a well built well built story.
[01:42:08.780 --> 01:42:16.900]   And it's and I got to just say, as someone who works on computer graphics, it is the most amazing collection of computer graphics.
[01:42:16.900 --> 01:42:21.780]   It's I don't I don't even think anybody else who's got to be a for visual effects Oscar.
[01:42:21.780 --> 01:42:22.700]   And I'll be honest with you.
[01:42:22.700 --> 01:42:25.660]   I think it's probably in contention for movie of the year.
[01:42:25.660 --> 01:42:26.180]   Wow.
[01:42:26.180 --> 01:42:27.260]   It's it's a revolutionary.
[01:42:27.260 --> 01:42:36.020]   It he's really, you know, when they say this and people I have friends who have been working on Avatar for a long time and they just say, you know, this really changes everything.
[01:42:36.020 --> 01:42:37.940]   And I was like, yeah, yeah, we'll see.
[01:42:37.940 --> 01:42:39.180]   Oh, and I saw it.
[01:42:39.180 --> 01:42:39.900]   He was right.
[01:42:39.900 --> 01:42:40.780]   I decided I'm going to see it.
[01:42:40.780 --> 01:42:43.620]   I saw it in the real 3D and I'm going to have to go see it.
[01:42:43.620 --> 01:42:49.660]   There's three different 3Ds, but I'm going to just go see it in the regular 2D in the right now and in the IMAX 3D.
[01:42:49.660 --> 01:42:51.220]   I have to see it in all the different versions.
[01:42:51.220 --> 01:42:52.260]   Yeah, at least once.
[01:42:52.260 --> 01:42:54.500]   Maybe there's a we were talking about this on the Twitter.
[01:42:54.500 --> 01:42:59.260]   There's real real D, there's IMAX 3D and there's Dolby 3D.
[01:42:59.260 --> 01:43:00.220]   And then there's 2D.
[01:43:00.220 --> 01:43:03.860]   So there's four different versions and I need to see all four.
[01:43:03.860 --> 01:43:07.340]   I'm not going to review the movie because everyone's reviewing the movie.
[01:43:07.340 --> 01:43:12.060]   I'm going to review the 3D the style of the movie, you know, on these different theaters.
[01:43:12.060 --> 01:43:13.260]   I think that's my mission.
[01:43:13.260 --> 01:43:15.260]   It's it's you see the theater.
[01:43:15.260 --> 01:43:15.740]   They're smart.
[01:43:15.740 --> 01:43:16.340]   Well, they're smart.
[01:43:16.340 --> 01:43:17.420]   You have to see it in the theater.
[01:43:17.420 --> 01:43:22.940]   And this is the this is the kind of movie that is going to continue to succeed.
[01:43:23.420 --> 01:43:27.900]   You know, in the movie theater system because it will not be the same watching it at home.
[01:43:27.900 --> 01:43:28.180]   Right.
[01:43:28.180 --> 01:43:31.780]   You really have to know they're developing 3D blue ray and they'll be 3D.
[01:43:31.780 --> 01:43:32.980]   You want this on a big screen.
[01:43:32.980 --> 01:43:35.140]   You want to see this movie on a big screen.
[01:43:35.140 --> 01:43:38.260]   This is the kind of movie if you if you've been thinking, oh, I'm going to wait or whatever,
[01:43:38.260 --> 01:43:40.420]   you need to go and see this movie in the big screen.
[01:43:40.420 --> 01:43:41.140]   It is it is.
[01:43:41.140 --> 01:43:42.500]   Is there you've seen it in 3D?
[01:43:42.500 --> 01:43:46.260]   I saw it in the real 3D, which I you know, is there is there is there a no
[01:43:46.260 --> 01:43:49.860]   to there was a 2D there's a there's a couple 3D things that are really 3D.
[01:43:49.860 --> 01:43:52.460]   I have to admit that I end up about half the time with 3D.
[01:43:52.460 --> 01:43:53.740]   I end up kind of crossing my eyes.
[01:43:53.740 --> 01:43:53.980]   Right.
[01:43:53.980 --> 01:43:59.420]   You know, it kind of it so so I don't I kind of want to see it in the different versions.
[01:43:59.420 --> 01:44:01.060]   I would be actually willing to invest.
[01:44:01.060 --> 01:44:02.060]   I don't know if anyone's doing this.
[01:44:02.060 --> 01:44:04.060]   Someone should Twitter me or something like that.
[01:44:04.060 --> 01:44:09.420]   I would invest in like having a personal that we're just coded and ready to go.
[01:44:09.420 --> 01:44:13.380]   Like I can buy all three of those techniques use a different form of glass.
[01:44:13.380 --> 01:44:15.540]   I'll just commit to real 3D.
[01:44:15.540 --> 01:44:15.980]   Right.
[01:44:15.980 --> 01:44:17.100]   That's the one that's here in Petaluma.
[01:44:17.100 --> 01:44:17.700]   Is that what we have?
[01:44:17.700 --> 01:44:18.180]   That's what we have.
[01:44:18.180 --> 01:44:19.940]   We have I think they have two theaters that are real 3D.
[01:44:19.940 --> 01:44:22.100]   So I just commit to real 3D because that's why I go see I'd buy
[01:44:22.100 --> 01:44:28.900]   twenty dollar glasses from China and then have someone coat them, you know, and and and to me, that would be if that was possible.
[01:44:28.900 --> 01:44:30.100]   I'd love to have that service.
[01:44:30.100 --> 01:44:32.180]   If anyone knows about that service, they should Twitter me.
[01:44:32.180 --> 01:44:36.340]   Own your own 3D glasses so you don't have to share with the kids and the
[01:44:36.340 --> 01:44:39.340]   people who show up at the bowling alley with their own shoes.
[01:44:39.340 --> 01:44:39.540]   Yeah.
[01:44:39.540 --> 01:44:42.940]   Well, no, it's mostly because I feel like I think that one of my problems is that
[01:44:42.940 --> 01:44:44.740]   make way way.
[01:44:44.740 --> 01:44:45.860]   You own just own glasses.
[01:44:45.860 --> 01:44:48.900]   And that well, I know you never play pool with a guy who owns his own stick.
[01:44:48.900 --> 01:44:49.580]   So that's true.
[01:44:49.580 --> 01:44:51.420]   Well, the thing is, is that for me, it's not that.
[01:44:51.420 --> 01:44:56.140]   It's that I think I have an irregular head, you know, that just doesn't this is this we know.
[01:44:56.140 --> 01:44:58.380]   You know, so they pinch your temples?
[01:44:58.380 --> 01:44:59.940]   No, just that I feel like they're there.
[01:44:59.940 --> 01:45:01.980]   I feel like they're very flat and far away from my face.
[01:45:01.980 --> 01:45:05.900]   And I think that's part of why I think you're so close to getting this show over on time.
[01:45:05.900 --> 01:45:07.820]   We're this close.
[01:45:07.820 --> 01:45:09.900]   Tell him to say.
[01:45:09.900 --> 01:45:13.820]   Then I said, I said the magic word avatar.
[01:45:13.820 --> 01:45:14.740]   Like I say, is avatars great.
[01:45:14.740 --> 01:45:15.060]   That's it.
[01:45:15.060 --> 01:45:15.580]   Go see it.
