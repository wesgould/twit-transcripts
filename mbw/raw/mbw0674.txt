[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.280]   Hi, I'm Renee Ritchie.
[00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.400]   Leola Port is on special assignment.
[00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.880]   Today on Mac Break Weekly, we talked about Apple Security,
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.360]   locking out battery health information,
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.240]   and what it would take to make the iPhone Pro.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.040]   Netcasts you love.
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.040]   From people you trust.
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.400]   This is great.

[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.800]   I'm Renee Ritchie because Leo Laport is still off.
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.440]   I imagine trying to find some kind of 5G in the greater San Francisco area.
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.920]   But we still have a show to do and joining me,
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.440]   just like he does every week, the rock of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.800]   And Iannako, how are you, Andy?
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:45.760]   5G is really easy to find at any city.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.160]   Just look for the place where people have like huge bags of like frozen peas on top of their
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.200]   phones to keep them cool.
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.400]   That is true. That is true.
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.760]   Especially when they live in sunny, sunny Sacramento, like Lori Gill.
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:58.560]   How's it going, Lori?
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.400]   Yeah, and bags of oranges and avocados.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.640]   We're just rife with 5G and all the good stuff because of our sunny, sunny weather.
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.640]   All right.
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.240]   So the first thing I want to talk about is Apple went back to Black Hat.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.520]   Sorry.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.360]   Yvonne Christick, Apple's head of security platform and architecture,
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.800]   went back to Black Hat.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.880]   The last time he was there three years ago,
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.320]   they announced the original Bug Bounty program,
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:30.960]   which at the time offered up to $250,000 if you could find an exploit in iOS or iCloud.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.400]   This year he announced that the program was expanding to include Mac OS, WatchOS, TVOS,
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.520]   all the OSes.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.920]   But also they were going to kick up the bounty,
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.760]   not just to $500,000.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.560]   But with a bunch of different bonuses and different factors,
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.600]   including a 50% bonus, if you could find a beta bug,
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.600]   it could hit 1 million.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.200]   And Austin, sort of Dr. Evil, pinky finger to mouth, $1 million.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.040]   But there was more, like in a sham while sense, there really was more.
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.560]   They also announced a research fused device because it can be really hard for researchers to
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.400]   get into iOS, to begin with, to do all of their research.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.080]   So instead of hiding away their own full chain exploits or buying a developer fused phone off
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:21.520]   the gray black market, Apple is going to provide a phone with SSH and root terminal access
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.240]   to any researcher who has a history of finding just these kinds of exploits.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:32.480]   And is it a whole new, whole warm, whole, awesomeer day when it comes to Apple and security researchers?
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.400]   Somebody was visited by Three Ghosts in the middle of the night in Cupertino for sure,
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.920]   because this addresses a couple of things that have been super, super important.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:48.320]   Number one, you really do have to encourage people to find your bugs and your security flaws
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.760]   and show you where they are.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.360]   And you have to understand that it is a competitive market for this stuff.
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.880]   There are lots of people who are security researchers.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.960]   They are on the side of the angels and they will even be grudgingly after saying, hey, look,
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.800]   if you don't, I've told you about this bug like eight months ago, and you still haven't fixed it,
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.640]   I'm just going to make it public. You have three days to fix it. And then when the company says,
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.920]   oh, we're really going to fix it. Okay, fine. I'll delay it another month.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:22.160]   But most people are like, hey, foreign government, how much are we willing to bid for this way to
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.680]   get into any lock iPhone anywhere? So the fact that they're willing to put their money with
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.280]   their mouth is by actually producing a really highly competitive bug bounty and also giving
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.160]   these researchers the tools they need to find those bugs means that when they put up those big
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.840]   posters about how private and secure iPhones are, they really are thinking of the inside of the
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.560]   donut as well as the outside of the donut. So that's really good sign.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.120]   Yeah, what was interesting, Laurie, is that previously they would,
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.160]   researchers would say that one, because they needed to have their own exploits,
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.800]   just to get into iOS to do research, they didn't want to tell Cupertino about it because that
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.200]   would lock them out of their own research phones. And also they had to try to get these phones off
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:12.400]   the gray market. Meanwhile, foreign intelligence agencies, known bad actors, and even the companies
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:18.080]   that sell equipment to both of those were offering like 1.5 million for a zero day.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:26.000]   Yeah, so this is a great thing that Apple is inviting the white hat hackers to come in and
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.800]   break these iPhones so that when it comes to market, when we get them in our hand,
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.600]   when we get the software updates on our hands, we're not seeing these unexpected glitches and
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:43.280]   bugs and security vulnerabilities. Especially when you think about what people, just like you're
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.560]   saying on the gray market, they can still get these things, they can just get them through other
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.200]   means. And so they're still going to be doing these kinds of hacking schemes. And this way,
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:59.360]   Apple can say, we want you to do this for us directly. So we're going to pay you up as much as we can
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.160]   to make sure that you do this for us and that you don't sell this information to someone else.
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:14.320]   Or even this idea of the right way to do it, this appropriate culturally way to do this,
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:19.120]   which would be to tell Apple, for example, hey, I found an exploit and I'm going to give you 90
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.480]   days to fix it or whatever that time limit is. What if they can't fix it in 90 days? And just
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:29.200]   like you're saying, Andy, sometimes they'll say, oh, okay, we'll postpone a little bit longer. But
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:35.520]   frankly, some of the people in the hacker industry make their name by finding these exploits. And so
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:41.680]   they're not opposed to, I gave them the amount of time that I'm supposed to give them and they
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:47.120]   didn't say anything, so I'm telling the world. And their names are known and their reputation
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:53.840]   is important too. So being able to be on the inside of this situation where Apple can have a
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.480]   little more control over who finds these bugs and how quickly they get fixed, I think, is a really
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:07.440]   great thing. I think the device that they get to access is maybe not worth more than the
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:14.160]   million dollar bounty, but worth it. >> Yeah. It's super interesting to me because they said that
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:19.440]   so far in the history of this program, which is around three years, 50 high value, high quality
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:24.400]   bugs have been reported and paid out through it. But it seems to me, Andy, it's like what Steve
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:30.000]   Jobs used to say about iTunes is that if you give people an ethical way to do something at a fair
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.600]   price, they're more likely to do it. And I think this addresses by removing the barrier of the
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:40.560]   full chain exploit, and also paying out a lot more, I think that really promotes the, it promotes
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:45.600]   people to find their ethicalness. >> Yeah, and I think for the people who are not ethical,
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:49.920]   they're always gonna go for the money. So that's not gonna affect them so much. I think what this
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:55.760]   does, I think it helps to breed another generation of ethical hackers who feel as though their work
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:01.520]   is being respected. I'll give you an example from my own personal life from two weeks ago,
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:11.600]   partly because I'm still stewing a little bit over this. I live in a 350 year old seaport town,
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:17.360]   which means that there are a million little streets, as opposed to big streets. And so a big,
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:23.920]   two or three FedEx packages that were supposed to go to a store at number whatever on a different
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:28.720]   similar street got delivered to my place instead. I said, well, you know what, I'm kind of going
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:33.360]   that way anyway, and I'll just carry them over there rather than have FedEx. It's a store, maybe
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:38.800]   this is merchandise they need. And so I walked, maybe it was only half a mile, but they're not
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:42.720]   like they're really heavy packages, but they were hard to carry because they're bulky.
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:48.000]   And so I walked in, walked to the counter, talked to the store owners. Oh, by the way,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.360]   FedEx delivered these to my address by mistake. I thought you might like them. And they basically
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:59.520]   said, great, thanks, you can put it over there. And I felt like this was my like the
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:04.800]   curb your enthusiasm moment where I would come back up. But you know, you didn't really thank me
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:09.280]   last week when I dropped over the package. It really was a, I mean, there's no problem, but
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:14.720]   yeah, that wasn't really a thank you that you gave me. And so what I'm saying is that you
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:20.720]   previously Apple was kind of notorious for saying, Oh, wow, yeah, oh, you say this bug could like
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.480]   make anybody be able to get into anybody's phone remotely from anywhere in the internet.
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:32.960]   Oh, okay, great. What's your email address? Okay, great. Thanks. That's nice. And then you're like,
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:38.240]   I just saved your butts. I just saved you from being the top story in the tech news cycle for
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:44.640]   an entire week. And you're just saying, Oh, okay, thanks. And so a bug bounty is not just good
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:49.120]   money, which is good money. But it's also look, we are, we are thanking you, we are appreciative.
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:54.160]   And one way to tell you how much we appreciate it is to give you money for this sort of thing.
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:59.600]   And it's not invitation only anymore. It's like anybody can take part in this. If you find
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:04.000]   something that is worrisome and you send it to Apple and you're not on the list, they will still
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.680]   pay out and they will probably not even invite you to the list because there is no list anymore,
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:12.800]   Laurie, you could be on this bug bounty program tomorrow if you get your hacks together.
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:19.760]   You know, if I join the hacker industry, that's been my goal all along was to
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.960]   break my way into the hacker industry.
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:28.640]   So one of the other subjects that came up at Black Hat was on the complete opposite end of the
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:33.520]   spectrum. And that is this gentleman spent a lot of time in his kitchen modifying a lightning
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:40.160]   cable so that it could be used to take over your machine if you plugged it in. And we've seen
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.560]   different kinds of juice-jacking attacks in the past, which are basically when you modify the
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:52.640]   firmware of USB cables in order to make them malicious to carry a malicious payload. What makes
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:57.040]   this interesting is that it's a lightning cable, which I believe, or which I think they said was
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:02.400]   harder to do this on, but he still managed to do it in his kitchen and has plans to sort of mass
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:07.360]   produce these devices. And Laurie, I don't know how you stop this kind of stuff. I know they keep
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:11.040]   hardening the operating system, but it feels like we already get so many complaints from the
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:15.680]   Mac community about Macs being locked down. And then on the other side, you get people like this
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:19.680]   just getting up into your Macs. And I don't know ultimately how we balance this.
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:26.640]   I think the crazy thing that I took from that article specifically was that, yes,
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:30.960]   I figured out how to do this. And now I'm going to make hundreds of them for anybody who wants to
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:36.320]   buy one. That's the part that scared me about it was it's not just the discovery of it. It's the
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:43.520]   fact that somebody wants everybody to have access to one of these things. I guess in this particular
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:50.160]   instance, it's good to hear that the lightning cable is harder to hack than any. I think he even
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:56.400]   said than any other cable that he has tried to or that person tried to or has hacked. But I think
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:02.400]   that's almost why people are trying so hard to hack into Apple products is it's the
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:07.040]   it's difficult to do so they want to do it. So
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:14.000]   your question of what can be done about it, I don't think there is an answer. I think the
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.280]   answer is what Apple's doing now, which is offering large bounties and attending the White Hacker
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:25.840]   Conference and saying we want to be a part of this community too. We don't want to shut you out.
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:30.480]   We want to bring you in so that in circumstances like this person who
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:36.880]   figured out a way to juice jack the lightning cable, somebody on the on you know on Apple's team
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:41.040]   where somebody who's working with Apple in the hacker community can say, hey, I just figured out
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:46.960]   a way to stop that from happening. So we're good. So I think that's what what's being done now is
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:52.960]   what we can do. The balance would be all the people that are trying to break into Apple products.
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:57.520]   If there's equally enough people who are trying to find those breaks and tell Apple about it,
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:03.360]   that's the best balance that we can get. Well, this is this demonstrates that this is an industry
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:10.400]   with a very complex market. He wouldn't be I'm sure that if his if his goal were to simply
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:16.000]   spread chaos and help people to break into random phones, he wouldn't have announced this. He wouldn't
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.160]   would have made this really, really public. I think what he this was a a a way to tell everybody how
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:28.400]   cool how smart he is. That was a very clever hack. But also to tell yeah, but also to tell that
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:35.200]   all the world security agencies that if you want to if you approach me and give me $5,000 per unit,
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:40.000]   and I will sell you these cables, because when I see when as soon as I saw this, assuming that
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.760]   it really does look like a completely undocked lightning cable and all the pictures that I've seen
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:50.480]   have been just like stock images of like Apple cables. So I don't know that for sure. But that's
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:55.520]   how they described it that's that it could pass for a normal camel. I don't see it as someone
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:59.360]   trying to get after me or trying to get after a random person for their credit card information.
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:05.920]   I see it as a spy agency or a law enforcement agency getting a warrant breaking into somebody's
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:11.120]   office and just simply like dropping what replacing one of their cables, this person's cables with
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:17.440]   this special cable or as has been happening with like flash drives loaded with malware just hey,
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:21.600]   what do you know some idiot left their iPhone charger and cable like
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:25.040]   plugged in right here in the waiting room of CIA headquarters.
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:30.080]   Shink, that's going to be that's now it's my cable. So that's the sort of people who are going
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:34.640]   to be buying this. I think this is really advertising to sell this to again the espionage community,
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:39.040]   the law enforcement community. I don't I hope we don't see this in the wild because that would
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:44.080]   be a hell of a thing for someone to try to sneak a lightning cable into my bag and make sure that
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:50.320]   I use it. And then also be less than 300 feet away from you when you were trying to use it. I think
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:55.840]   I remember that was the other restriction. Yeah, so but it's Tom Riddle's diary, Lori,
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:15:02.800]   it's Tom Riddle's diary. It's still even though it's the we hear a lot about especially every
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:08.800]   year when they have the the white hacker event. We hear a lot of these these the people they come
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:12.480]   out and they say this is what I've done. This is what I can do. Here's the thing. I think there's
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:17.920]   another one that came out that you can spoof face ID by using a pair of glasses with just some tape
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:27.120]   on it. These are these are a big deal. So it's our responsibility as journalists because that's
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:32.800]   always the headline and say, Oh, someone's finally broken face ID says, okay, a you have to prepare
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:38.400]   a special pair of glasses. B you have to you have to put them on a person who is asleep,
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:43.280]   deep asleep and unconscious. And so it's not as though someone's going to be able to put on the
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:49.920]   magic glasses that gives them a godlike powered unlock iPhones. But yeah, it's I love what I love
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:55.600]   about the week after these conferences is again, how clever everybody is to just keep trying things
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:02.160]   because I think I really do think that one of the shared like geek youth culture experiences is
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:07.840]   the time you learn to like pick your first lock or the time you first learned how to pop open like
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:16.080]   a master high school lock. And that it leaves you with this wonderful mind expanding concept
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:22.560]   from like your teenage years onward that all locks are a lie. There is any lock can be any
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:27.120]   security can be defeated. It just depends on finding thinking of a way that the people who
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:33.200]   designed this either didn't think of or didn't think that you would bother to try. So that's so
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:37.840]   that just shows you the ingenuity that's at work here. Exactly.
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:41.200]   It's funny because a couple of years ago. So go ahead, Laurie.
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:50.240]   The hackers are absolutely incredible and talented and geniuses to come up with these ideas. And it's
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:58.400]   really such a fun culture to the whole point is to just see what you can do, see how you can break it.
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:04.480]   And I almost think it does them a disservice the white hat hackers especially a disservice
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:09.280]   when we report on it as it's some kind of scary thing because it's actually really fun and really
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:14.720]   funny that they've been able to figure out something like that. And just the fact that it exists in
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:19.840]   the world also means that companies like Apple in the case of Face ID, maybe they're going to work
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:25.360]   a little harder to make sure that the attention awareness is actually more specific to your
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:31.360]   the three deeness of your pupils even when you're wearing glasses or something like that. So it's
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:38.080]   all a lot of fun and most of the time not scary. The funniest time is not when like tech crunch
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:43.760]   or Forbes does a deep dive or motherboard does a deep dive after the presentation. It's when
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:49.200]   when some journalists at faster moving sites get the abstracts for the talk a week or two weeks
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:53.200]   before they come out and then just write all these scary articles based off nothing but the
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:58.160]   one-line blur a bit black at before the talk comes. But for this one, I think it's really
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:02.640]   valid point Laurie because some of these things are presented as scary but like a person being
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:09.200]   unconscious, you're least to your concern to someone with Face ID. I remember like was it a year ago
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.880]   where a woman waited for her husband to fall asleep on a flight then put his finger on his
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:18.000]   touch ID opened his phone saw the sneaky sneaker text that he was looking at and got so angry
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.400]   they had to land the flight and she's not a security researcher. She's just smart and she knew the
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:27.280]   information she wanted and she knew how to get it. And that we've seen Face ID exploits where people
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:32.000]   have put white tape on their eyes and things to get around it. So biometrics again, they're
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:38.800]   better, they're not passwords, they're usernames and if you use them and you're rendered unconscious
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:43.120]   or incapacitated there's all sorts of things that can happen. So I think it's just like you said
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:47.920]   a really good reminder of how far what the limits are to the convenience that you're getting from
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:53.200]   yeah. So our mech break tip of the week is that if you're fooling around on your wife or girlfriend
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:59.360]   make sure you just press that power button five times before you go to sleep just to deactivate
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:05.520]   all biometrics. Yeah, I've been saying this for a while now. I think we should have the option for
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:10.720]   passcodes and biometrics and not one or the other. I think that would be the best thing to it.
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:15.600]   So Craig mentioned that at the last WWDC because a lot of people have asked for that and he said that
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:21.520]   the only problem is when they test it, if it's like a thumbprint and a passcode and you burn your thumb
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:26.000]   you count, you can't get it into your phone anymore. So then you have to have like a longer
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.240]   recovery password hidden somewhere and most people forget what those are and lock themselves out of
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:36.480]   their phones. Yeah, but again, if it were an option, if it were a third option, passcode or face
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:41.760]   or touch ID and your third option if you're the kind of person who cheats on your spouse and you
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:46.320]   really want to protect your private stuff, the third option being that you can go ahead and
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:51.120]   enable that. I think that's, I don't know, I just like that idea. It gives us an extra step
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:57.840]   of protection. Yeah, yeah, real long. All right, so the last bit of news that it's not really
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:04.320]   tied to this, but I am going to tie to this is a story came out about Apple and third party repairs
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:10.800]   and this story involves, we've heard previously about how difficult it is to pair touch ID sensors
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:15.600]   or face ID sensors. If you swap out some of the other components, now what was discovered,
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:19.120]   it was originally on a YouTube channel by Justin and I fix it has picked up the story,
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:24.640]   is that Apple is doing the pairing with batteries. They've had the capability for a long time.
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:29.600]   It's been on Apple's website since at least March that they would be doing this, but now people
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:34.640]   are seeing it in the wild and what it basically means, it was misreported a little bit and that
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:38.000]   Apple was locking out third party batteries and that caused a lot of people to panic,
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.320]   especially people in countries that just don't have Apple stores or authorized Apple's repair
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:46.240]   people. They're not locking out the batteries, you can still replace a battery, anybody can still
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:51.200]   replace a battery. The only thing is if you replace a battery and you're not authorized by Apple,
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:58.480]   which means you don't have Apple's tools, you can't repair that battery with the iOS software,
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:03.120]   which means those new battery monitoring features that were introduced a couple of years ago that
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:08.240]   show you your battery health no longer functions. Instead, they give you this warning that says that
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:12.560]   this battery was not replaced by Apple and this feature was no longer than it will work.
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:17.200]   And we've seen a lot of reactions from this. Some people in the right to repair movement
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:22.080]   have been just completely flabbergasted, they're enraged by it, they see it as yet another encroached
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:26.960]   by Apple onto the freedoms an individual has to control their phone. Other people have pointed
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:33.280]   out that if you're just buying a phone, for example, it's nice to know that it doesn't have an Apple
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:37.760]   replaced battery. I think Lori Gill, I'll pass it to you first because you had an awesome idea for
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:41.280]   a pop-up instead of just turning it off. But what are your quick thoughts on this?
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:47.520]   Yeah, so just right out of the gate, I think in this particular circumstance,
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:53.680]   I don't think that Apple is doing its users, its customers, a service to,
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:22:00.960]   it's not locking down the battery, it's locking down that specific feature of the battery health
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:07.760]   by saying just, no, there's nothing there except we can't determine whether or not this has a
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:12.400]   good or bad battery health because it's not an, yeah, it's not a, yeah. And that's all it says.
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:18.480]   So to me, that's a disservice to the user because if I choose to, which they are now, you know,
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:23.600]   they're easing up on that third-party battery situation or third-party repair situation,
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:32.480]   not battery, allowing Apple support to change batteries that were originally replaced or
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:36.800]   repaired by a third-party. So they're moving in the right direction, but then to see this,
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:43.120]   it's sort of a backtrack because they're saying it's fine if you have a third-party repair,
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:48.000]   your battery, but we're going to remove this useful feature, which is to give you the battery
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:54.720]   health information. Now, I think Renee, you had suggested, I think that what would be a benefit
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:23:01.520]   or would work better is for Apple to give you that notification, kind of like when you plug in a
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:08.880]   device that's not in Fi compatible, so it'll say, we're sorry, this device is not compatible with
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:13.920]   the iPhone and you just swipe it away and a lot of times it still works, even though you get
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:19.600]   that notification. So a pop-up that says, we can't determine whether or not the battery of this
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:24.320]   health is actually what it is. So this is actually just an estimate, don't use it,
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:29.040]   but then you swipe it away and you're choosing whether or not you want to base
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:33.840]   that information on what you think is to be correct or not. I think that's fair,
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:38.320]   that's telling you that you've got a third-party repair or battery in your phone and therefore
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:43.280]   Apple's not responsible for it if something goes wrong, but it still allows the user to use that
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:48.640]   health, that battery health feature. It doesn't just completely disable that feature for them just
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:53.360]   because it was done, the repair was done somewhere else, even with an official battery.
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:59.360]   That also kind of gives me a little tingle in the back of my neck as it can be an official
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:05.600]   Apple battery, but if it's repaired at a third-party repair company, then you're now,
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:09.440]   it seems like a punishment, it feels like a punishment to me.
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:14.480]   Yeah, that's definitely a way that Apple could extend their we're awesome policy
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:19.920]   to people who even get their repairs done outside of Apple because it's certainly possible,
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:29.520]   it's happening. If you buy an Apple logoed battery from a third-party, like you buy the money,
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:35.760]   and it is legitimately, it's not a knockoff, it's legitimately an Apple product, but before
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:41.120]   it was sent out, it can be reprogrammed so that it said, "Oh, I've got 5,000 cycles, this is only
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:47.920]   had like 80 cycles and the capacity is actually exactly what it was from the factory when it's
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:52.720]   actually maybe 80% of what it was from the factory." And so that's the sort of situation where you
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:57.920]   kind of want those kind of features for the phone to itself do its own testing of the battery and
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:02.480]   after a couple of weeks be able to figure out what the status of this battery is by empirical
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:07.680]   evidence and give you an accurate guess as to what the state of charge is at any given moment.
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:17.360]   And we can, in the United States, we can be a little bit, we can maybe make the argument that,
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:22.560]   well, Apple does make sure that battery replacement is really, really cheap, they don't charge for
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:26.160]   labor, they just charge for the battery, and you know you're getting a certified Apple brand new
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:31.120]   battery, so what's the difficulty? But you have to remember that not every place in the world,
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:35.600]   not even every place in the United States has close access to an Apple store, you can walk in
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:41.920]   and then walk out an hour later with a fresh battery. And also, what about the people who are
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:47.120]   holding onto like a five or six-year-old phone? I think that Apple builds their phones so nicely,
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:52.720]   as long as you can keep it out of toilet water, you might be able to get five, six, seven years
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.880]   out of time. Sometimes even if it's in a toilet water.
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:01.920]   You know, when it falls in the toilet, Neptune can have it. It's a long talk with man at that
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:07.920]   point. As far as I'm concerned, I'm not going to shame anybody who has dropped their iPhone
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:12.160]   in a toilet because I have been one of those people and still used it afterward. So, you know,
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:17.680]   I'm just saying that's my subconscious saying I really, really, really want to upgrade my phone
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:24.080]   in a month. But that's what basically, I mean, I think Laurie and I are pretty, are of the same
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:28.560]   mind here that I think that it's an important principle that this is your phone. You own this
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:34.400]   phone. You can do what you want with this phone. And if Apple is making a choice to make that
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:39.520]   difficult and they're just being kind of churlish about it, and I'm saying this is, I'm not saying
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:44.480]   that this is one of those times, but if there's a simple thing they can do to support people who
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:48.640]   are repairing their own phones or a simple or a simple thing they could do to at least not get in
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:55.040]   the way, they should at least not get in the way. So, this is something where I think they could
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:59.520]   really help people out. Yeah, I agree with both of you. I think that, you know, because again,
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:04.000]   especially because there are people who just don't live near Apple stores or Apple certified
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.080]   hair people, there's whole countries like that and they need the same level of service.
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:13.360]   And to me, the pop up idea so it's disclosed so everybody knows it's not an official. And I
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:16.960]   think the reason the official Apple batteries don't work is because they're not paired either.
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:20.800]   And that leads into a larger conversation about whether Apple should be making the software
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:25.440]   that does this, that does all the pairings more widely available. And I think for something like
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:30.160]   Touch ID and Face ID, you could make, you could say that maybe it's bad because people with
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:33.680]   who steal iPhones would be able to use it then to get around or government agencies would be able
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:38.640]   to use it then to get around security measures. But for things like a battery, just a stripped down
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:44.480]   version that let people run a set of tests and if it passes those tests, pairs up that battery,
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:48.240]   I think that would be phenomenal and that doesn't, I don't think that would in truth.
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:52.000]   There should be safety, I always worry about lithium ion because you do see headlines like
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.800]   there was a young lady a week ago and there was a guy on the fire on his desk and I think they
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:00.240]   were iPhones. It's hard to tell sometimes based on the reporting. So I don't think there should
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:04.560]   be safety and quality standards for these batteries, especially if you are getting them from sources
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:08.880]   you don't know about. But otherwise, let people have the best possible service they can have.
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:13.680]   It seems like that's keeping with Apple's philosophy with what Lisa Jackson talks about when she says
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:16.160]   making those iPhones last as long as possible.
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:22.880]   All right, so with that, I think we should check in with Leo and see how his search for
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:25.840]   the elusive elusive 5G is going.
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:32.320]   Hey, if I might, I'd just like to jump in here and tell you about our sponsor of this
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:37.520]   week's episode of Mac Break Weekly. Last pass, they like me to talk about it because I use it,
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:41.840]   I use it, I've been using it since they came out with it. Steve Gibson reviewed the creator of
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:45.600]   Last Pass, Joe Seagrest, got all the code. He gives it his thumbs up.
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:50.720]   In fact, Steve Gibson, our security guy uses it. We even use it here at work, Last Pass Enterprise.
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:56.000]   Last Pass is the number one most preferred password management and an award-winning security solution
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.680]   that helps millions of individuals, thousands of businesses navigate their online lives easily
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:06.720]   and securely. Passwords are a nightmare. Everybody admits it. But you got to have them and you got
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:11.840]   to remember them. And you may be tempted because there's such a pain in the butt to use the same
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:18.080]   password over and over. Bad idea. You might also be tempted to use something easy to remember.
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:23.920]   Another bad idea, your birth date, your children's middle names, that kind of thing,
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:31.840]   that's easy to remember. It's also easy to guess for bad guys. You need Last Pass. Last Pass generates
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:35.840]   strong passwords and remembers them. So you don't have to. You just remember your master password,
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:40.240]   let Last Pass do the rest. No wonder it's the number one most preferred password manager,
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:45.600]   both at home and at work. In fact, we're really excited because Last Pass Enterprise is expanding.
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:50.960]   They've got a brand new business lineup. That's what we use here at Twit with fantastic new features
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:55.200]   that will improve security across your company while making it easy for users to get their work done.
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:30:00.000]   I'll start with Last Pass Enterprise. That's the business password manager we use. They now
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:06.480]   include single sign-on for 1,200 plus SAML integrated apps. That means you don't have to
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:13.200]   use a password manager. You just approve it on your phone and you're in. And that is great for
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:20.320]   convenience, but it's also more secure. It's kind of a win-win. Each app comes with its own
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:24.720]   getting started guys. It's very easy to set up and get running. You're going to love SSO in the
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:30.480]   Enterprise. There's also Last Pass MFA. It's an extension to two-factor authentication. It's
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:36.000]   multi-factor. It leverages things like biometrics, your face, your fingerprint, and contextual
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:42.800]   factors, your location, your IP address, to verify you are who you say you are. And it does this all
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:48.960]   in an easy to manage dashboard for admins so you get oversight and control. We love it. I am very
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:53.680]   excited about these two new features. They call it all Last Pass Identity. It's a combination
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:59.120]   of Last Pass Enterprise, Last Pass multi-factor from single sign-on and password management
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:06.880]   to adaptive authentication. Last Pass still is the number one solution, giving you granular control
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:13.440]   and frictionless access to users in one simple secure solution. We use it a twit. We're proud to
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:18.160]   be using it. We will always use it. We're really excited as Last Pass gets better and better and
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:23.280]   better. Last Pass bridging the gap between passwords and identity by making access and
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:30.160]   authentication simple and secure for both IT and end users. Join the thousands of businesses like ours
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:36.640]   that have signed up for Last Pass and are loving it and trusting it. Visit lasspass.com/twit to find
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:43.360]   out how they can help you. lasspass.com/twit. Thank you, Last Pass, for supporting Mac Break Weekly.
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:49.680]   Now back to the show. >> And we are back with Andy Anaco and Lori Gill.
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:54.080]   And Lori Gill, I want to ask you something because you've now had your apple card for a
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:58.400]   little while. And we're starting to see reviews, we're starting to see pros, we're starting to see
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:02.160]   some cons, we're starting to see people getting approved who didn't think they would and maybe
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:06.560]   people who thought they would not maybe. So now that you've been using it for a while, what do you
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:13.200]   think? >> So for a while means yesterday. >> Yes.
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:17.920]   >> Let me just say it hasn't been long enough for me to even go out of the house and use it.
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:22.560]   I've actually just been using it to buy things through the app store just so I can sample it out.
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:30.320]   But right out of the gate, it was obviously the easiest application experience I've ever had.
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:37.520]   Almost to, that's almost a negative because it's going to be very easy for everyone to apply for
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:40.720]   this card. >> Sauspiciously easy to apply for this card.
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:44.960]   >> Yeah, I mean, I immediately applied. >> I'm 12 years old and I just got no, I didn't have.
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:52.640]   >> I was starting to have application remorse just a little bit today. I haven't gotten a new credit
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:59.600]   card, I haven't added credit to my life in probably 15 years. So it was so easy to do yesterday that I
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:04.480]   didn't think about it. And then this morning, I was like, man, I just added a bunch of credit to
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:11.040]   my life. What was I thinking? Why did I do that? So let me just tell everybody, before you hit that
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:18.320]   accept Apple terms button, think about the fact that you're adding credit to your life. That's a
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:24.320]   big deal. So I don't regret it, but I was feeling a little bit funny about it this morning. So the
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:30.080]   application process is incredibly easy. And it seems silly, but one of my favorite things is the
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:37.200]   terms and conditions are so clear and written, so simply that I don't think I've ever written,
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:42.800]   read a terms of condition for anything that made as much sense to me. And I actually read
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:46.800]   almost all of it. >> There wasn't the iTunes people who wrote it, it's what you're saying.
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:52.480]   >> Yeah, yeah. They're always kind of long, but this one was actually not as long as I've seen,
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:57.840]   and it was clear and easy to understand. So that was, to me, actually surprisingly impressive.
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:06.080]   I'll go ahead and say my credits score with TransUnion, which is who they run the credit through.
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:15.040]   It was 793. So that's within the excellent credit score rating that most people have.
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:24.160]   My interest rate was 17.99, which because I'm in the excellent section, I actually was hoping for
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:29.440]   it to be lower, but I have two other credit cards that are almost the exact same percentage rate.
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:35.440]   So it's about average. It's about normal for my credit rating versus my interest rate. So
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:42.960]   I think because Apple came out of the gate announcing that they were going to have really
[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:48.960]   low interest rates, I think they said something like one of the industry's lowest.
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:56.080]   And that's true at the lowest end at the 13.99. That's very low. But I think we all kind of
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:35:02.640]   jumped on that fact and thought, "Oh, well, I've got great credit score, so therefore,
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:08.400]   I'm going to get that super low interest rate." But that's not necessarily true. Now,
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:14.000]   I have talked to a few people in Twitter who did get the 12.99. So it's not impossible. It's just
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:21.760]   that it's not as easy to get to 12.99 as we all wanted it to be. So at 1799, that's not unreasonable.
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:27.040]   That's about average. So going into that when you're thinking about applying,
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:33.760]   obviously, whether or not you're concerned with that credit, that interest rate,
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:42.320]   you can apply without affecting your credit score as long as you don't accept the terms and conditions.
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:47.680]   So you can go into the app once you receive your invitation for now. It's not available to
[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:51.520]   everyone yet. You still have to be invited at the moment when you tap.
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:54.400]   Some people said that they got approved when they didn't think they would. They thought their
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:58.800]   score was so low, they wouldn't even get in. And it looked like Apple is kind of going broad with it.
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:04.720]   Exactly. So on the one hand, those of us who think that we think we're better than
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:10.320]   1799 and we want it to be lower, we're complaining about wanting it to be lower.
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:15.760]   But there's hundreds of people who are being approved that didn't think that their credit score
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:21.680]   was good enough. And Andy, I think you joke about whether if you were approved, then the world isn't
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:30.160]   troubled. You might be approved. I think I've talked about this. I think in the way Apple is
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:38.400]   positioning this, they are showing their software as being a way for you to get control over your
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:45.360]   credit and to have a better financial future and understanding what owning a credit card is.
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:51.120]   Andy, for somebody like you, I think this is great because this gives you the opportunity to reset
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:56.320]   or to start over or to start from scratch. I don't know what it's like for people who have
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:00.880]   zero credit history. But I do know that people who thought that they had a poor credit score
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:05.360]   are getting approved. And this could be a real good thing for them because there's this tool
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:11.280]   right inside the app that lets you make your payment. I just bought, I don't know, maybe $7
[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:16.080]   worth of apps just since yesterday. I could go pay it off right now if I want to. I don't even have
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:20.800]   to wait for the ballots. You can pay one time, you can make one time payments where you pay off
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:25.600]   or pay a certain amount or you can schedule them out so that you never even have to remember them.
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:29.920]   It'll just automatically pay a certain amount every month where you can wait until the bill
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:34.960]   comes in and then pay it. It's all done right on your iPhone, which a lot of people, that's how
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:38.480]   they do a lot of things is right from their phone. Now they don't go to their computer, they don't
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:42.640]   read a check, they don't do all these other things. It's so convenient. It's right in front of them.
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:48.080]   So to have that sort of quick, easy to access payment plan on top of the fact that there's all
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:53.920]   these tools that help you understand what you're doing and how much you're spending. It shows you
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:58.800]   kind of gives you a very easy to understand layout of where your spending is happening. So
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:05.200]   as you're either starting over and trying to do better with your credit or if you're a first-time
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:12.160]   credit card owner, these are all excellent tools to help you get better at having credit. So I
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:18.800]   think it's great that Apple and that Goldman Sachs are, I think it's called subprime if I'm not
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:23.760]   mistaken that that's allowing people with lower credit scores to access this, yeah,
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:30.160]   subprime lending, which is allowing them to access this. Now the negative of that is subprime
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:36.560]   lending also means the slightly higher credit score. So when Apple said that they have the lowest
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:42.080]   in the industry, that was probably under this sort of example or understanding of the subprime
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:48.240]   loan. And if I'm not mistaken, my first credit card, which was, it was part of that sort of
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:56.560]   subprime thing, it was 23%. So that's all within the standard that Apple is going with, that Goldman
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:03.120]   Sachs is going with, which is if we're going to be giving out loans or credit to people who have
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:08.640]   low credit scores or no credit history, we're going to have to compensate a little bit by having
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:13.440]   a slightly higher interest rate for the people who think that they deserve the lower interest rate.
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:21.040]   So I think it's all balancing out in the end. And if I have 1799 in order for somebody to get a better
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:26.320]   credit history to learn how to use credit cards, then I'm on board for that. It's all about being
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:29.040]   being there together with each other, helping each other out, right?
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:39.440]   Yeah, I don't know if it's a, if Apple is in this to benefit people with poor or no credit
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:43.680]   history. It'd be nice if that was said. I think that part of it is that they really,
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:51.280]   there's a reason why this card has, it has no annual fees, but it also has some of the
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:56.320]   skimpiest benefits of any card that's offered anywhere. You don't get, you don't get air
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:40:02.000]   mile points, you don't get credit points, there aren't, I don't have the tab in front of me, but
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:08.560]   you can get a mastercard.com has a page for, here's the, here are the special programs that
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:12.400]   you're available, that's available to you get basic buyer protection, a couple other simple
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:16.720]   things, but a lot of the stuff that you would get with the standard mastercard, anyplace else,
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:21.680]   you're not going to get there. So I think that Apple and Goldman Sachs are expecting that a lot
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:29.520]   of the most people signing up for this are going to be people who will buy it, will get this card
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:33.600]   because A, it works so well within the Apple ecosystem of having the Apple watch and the Apple
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:40.800]   phone, but not because it's competitive as a regular credit card. So the only thing that worries me,
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:45.520]   and I think I expressed this when we first started discussing this several months ago,
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:51.920]   is that when you're offering credit to people with no credit history or actively bad credit
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:57.840]   history, you run the risk that you are allowing somebody who doesn't understand credit or is
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:04.160]   impulsive or doesn't purchase or manage credit responsibly to take out loans at 24 and a half
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:08.800]   percent interest that they, if they can't pay the balance every month, how are they going to be
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:14.480]   able to pay the balance plus 25% every month, every month, every month. And that's certainly,
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:19.760]   that's just the way things work with credit cards, but that's a really, really bad looking
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:26.160]   color on Apple. If they, if a year from hour, two years from now, they're a Newsweek or someone
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:33.680]   Newsweek, if the verge or anybody else is saying has all these car stories about people who
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:40.240]   not on top of my student loans, I also can't quit the kit. I have to live till 73 because I
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:47.600]   got to pay Apple back for the for the for the $1 million. So it's it's it's I'm still navigating
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:53.200]   Apple's reasons for doing this. And I'm sure that this is I feel as though this is going to be
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:59.360]   something that will be crystal clear in retrospect three years from now. For now, I still don't really
[00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:02.960]   know why they're getting into this. Did you remember the rainbow card? Because everyone was
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:06.880]   tweeting pictures of the rainbow card from Steve Jobs here, like, get this card and buy you. I
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:11.280]   did not remember that at all. And I didn't know that it exists. I forgot that it existed and I
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:15.760]   forgot that it went away. You could buy a wind surfer with the Apple logo on it from the Apple
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:21.520]   card. Like at some point, there was it was a different time, wasn't it? Yeah, it was heady.
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:24.960]   Laurie, there was also a story about how you should be careful because if you lose your
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:29.200]   iPhone, you may not be able to pay for your Apple card because it's not web friendly yet.
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:37.760]   >> Yeah, so that's a big deal. I think on the one hand you think, well, obviously they didn't
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:42.080]   build it that way. It's all on the iPhone. And then as soon as somebody goes, well, wait,
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:49.200]   what if I lose my iPhone? Then all of us go, yeah, I didn't think about that. And it's so true.
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:52.960]   There's no dedicated website yet. There's no portal on the internet. So
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:43:00.320]   right now, I believe the article that popped up about the fact that Apple doesn't have
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:06.320]   an online web portal for you to access is that you have to contact Apple
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:14.560]   or Goldman Sachs to pay your bill, to freeze your card, to do any of the things that you would do.
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:15.040]   >> Call them like an animal.
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:22.560]   >> Yeah, and well, the thing is, if you've lost your iPhone, you've also lost your phone.
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:25.200]   >> Better have an LTE Apple watch. Come on.
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:31.040]   >> And it's not such a big deal. It's not anything that everybody should, oh my God,
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:35.360]   I can't believe they didn't think of that. But the truth is that there probably should be a
[00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:42.000]   web portal so that we can go online if we don't have an easy access to a phone. And we can put a
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:48.160]   hold on our card. We can put a hold on the payments or we can make the payment before we get our
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:52.160]   next phone or something like that. Because I think the other suggestion was use a different
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:56.880]   device connected with your Apple ID, like your iPad. Well, not everybody has all that stuff.
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:57.040]   >> Yeah.
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:02.240]   >> So for now, I think it's good that we're still in the preview phase because I think
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:08.560]   that it's a very good idea for Apple and Goldman Sachs to have a way for you to go online and
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:14.720]   manage your account like that. I just think that it makes sense for them to have that.
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:18.240]   And hopefully that's something they've got planned in the near future so that when it rolls out to
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:23.600]   everybody that this does exist. Because though it's not that big of a deal, you can always call
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:27.760]   Goldman Sachs, you can always call Apple and get transferred to a Goldman Sachs representative.
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:31.200]   You can't go online to do it. And I think we should have that.
[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:36.000]   >> I think that's indicative of a really weird thing that Apple keeps doing.
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:42.480]   I of course, I sign up for two-factor authentication on my Apple account because of course, of course,
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:50.160]   I want to do that. But their idea of two-factor authentication is that you can sign into your
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:56.800]   Apple service or hardware using any other Apple piece of hardware. And so what happens when I've
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:03.760]   just installed, I've just installed Apple Music on my new Android phone. And I'm in a coffee shop
[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:08.880]   with my Android phone and my Chromebook. And it says, "Oh great, no, we've sent a code
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:16.560]   to either your iPad or your MacBook back in the office." And I'm like, "This is not really hard,
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:23.680]   guys. I have a phone. You could text to that phone and that's usually how it's done." Or I could
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:30.480]   just use a third party authentication service. But no, I've got to own another Apple device in
[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:35.360]   order to authenticate. That doesn't seem to make sense. Again, that's you creating problems for me.
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:41.760]   It feels like Apple's punishing me for marrying outside my faith, so to speak.
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:47.920]   >> And by no means to excuse Apple in any of this. But the digital thing is great as long as it
[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:51.920]   works. But I've also been that person who's tried to sign into WhatsApp when the SIM card
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:56.960]   I originally used for it was probably sitting in a desk drawer in another country at the time.
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:01.520]   And I've also just tried to do basic things when you can't get an internet connection,
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:06.000]   or you can't, for some reason, your mail's not loading. You can't get the thing off the email
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.720]   that has your reservation number for the hotel room. And all of a sudden, this super convenient,
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:17.760]   no problem. Super easy stuff just breaks down and you're left wishing that you'd written it down in
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:22.800]   a scrap of paper like it was in 1970. >> Yeah. >> Yeah, it's so true.
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:28.400]   All right, so in future looking Apple news, we got a rumor from
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:34.000]   Coin X, Coin 10. Apple has confused me so much. I don't longer know what that character means
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:42.240]   anymore. Coin on Twitter, that iPhone Pro, wow, Apple's getting really crazy with the names
[00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:47.280]   this year. And this source, I'll call it a source, it's a Nameless Twitter account. But
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:51.600]   last year, right before the iPhone event, I actually predicted iPhone XS, XS Max,
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:57.600]   and 10R has predicted stuff about the iPad losing the headphone jack, about the iPad Mini refresh.
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:03.120]   Some of the stuff hasn't come to pass yet, so we can't accurately grade all of it. But so far,
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:08.560]   pretty much everything has been accurate. And so I started scratching my head. I know we've devalued
[00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:12.880]   the word pro. I mean, even power beats are pro now, and I'm sure someone could explain why.
[00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:19.840]   But it's non-obvious, I think, to people what the label pro means now. But Andy, what could make
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:26.160]   an iPhone Pro this September? Really, the one thing that they could do that would make everybody
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:33.360]   say 100 bucks more done would be Apple Pencil Support, the short, the stubby pencil support.
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:42.720]   Because we've we had the Galaxy Note 10 launch last week. And I've spent all of like 90 minutes
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:47.840]   with one. And it just for every time I hand it back, whether it's after like 10 minutes in the
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:55.360]   demo area or two months with it, my office on loan. Boy, do I wish I had a pop tart-sized phone with
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:48:01.840]   a stylus. Because when you can, when you can have a real like responsive stylus that keeps up with
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:08.880]   you, when you can draw, when you can write, because sometimes you're really you don't need to like,
[00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:14.640]   all you need to do is just write down a six digit number. And you don't, and you don't have time
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:18.720]   to open up an app and then create a text, click into a text field and then tap, tap, tap, tap,
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:24.880]   tap. Every time I use that stylus, I wish, wish, wish, wish that a real stylus were available for
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:29.200]   the iPhone or a real stylus were available for pretty much any other phone. So I've, there are,
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:35.600]   and there are other things that could be suggested like amazing extra storage, but and maybe a
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:40.800]   little bit larger, who knows? But really, I think that all they have to do to earn the pro moniker.
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:47.200]   However, Apple is choosing to define pro nowadays is add potential support to the screen.
[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:51.760]   See, I thought you're going to go with USB-C. I just, I thought it was so beautifully said.
[00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:58.800]   You see, you can't predict them. I'm Maverick. You zig and I zag. I know, I know, you zag when I zag.
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:06.560]   I don't think this rumor is particularly, I don't, I don't, I don't go for it. If Alex
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:13.200]   Munzi were here right now, he would be rolling his eyes at the idea of an iPhone being a pro.
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:18.560]   And here's the thing. Again, Renee, you've pointed out that we, we use the word pro
[00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:24.400]   to mean things that aren't pro these days and that's bad. And when it comes to an iPhone,
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:34.160]   literally what has anyone ever needed a phone to do pro things on, maybe photography,
[00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:39.520]   and that's more of a niche thing. It's not actually something that you do every day in your workflow.
[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:43.840]   Like photographer, like wedding photographers aren't throwing their DSL cameras on the trash
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:50.960]   because now they have an iPhone. So there's no such thing as a pro phone. And, and I can't imagine
[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:57.840]   any hardware or software feature that would make a pro version of a phone. Not, you know,
[00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:04.160]   when what we have now, the 10s and the 10s Max, for example, those are kind of what you would
[00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:11.680]   consider to be like the proist of, of an iPhone. So I just, it doesn't make any sense to me. I
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:16.640]   don't think that there's a reason to make a phone into a pro device. And I don't think anybody would
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:21.440]   be on board with that. And I think that it would, in marketing wise, I think that it would be a
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:26.880]   pretty negative on Apple because they would have to prove that this phone is pro worthy,
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:32.160]   which I don't think that exists yet. The technology to make something on your phone be something that
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:38.080]   is your dedicated everything device that you can stop using your computer to use, you know,
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:45.600]   that just doesn't seem possible to me. So I got two suggestions. One, one is your iPhone can
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:50.560]   become your computer. You plug it in or you use wireless the way you do with VR systems to go
[00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:55.680]   straight to a display. And then it throws up either the iPad or the Mars a pan version of the OS.
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:51:00.000]   And you can use it with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse to do like computery things.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:06.080]   And then also like Moto Mods. So you could slap a much better camera or a lens mounting system on
[00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:09.600]   it. I know those things have never worked, but listen, an imaginary universe where they work
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:15.200]   amazingly well or an extended battery or an audio DAC or something. Would that tickle the pro
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:23.680]   buttons? No, not for what people use iPhones for. It really is a good question.
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:28.000]   Because there's so many things you could do to a laptop or a desktop to make it
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:33.600]   pro because you kind of understand what is a professional like desktop user. Okay,
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:39.920]   image editors, content creators, people who do like server work. What is a professional phone
[00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:44.640]   user? Usually you're talking about like slick hair and car salesman and real estate. Yeah,
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:49.600]   exactly. Instagrammers. So basically, how about how about a selfie lens? It's about two inches wide,
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:57.840]   F1.1 automatically blurs. I hear what you're saying though, Alex Lindsay would want a terabyte
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:02.720]   of RAM and like two terabytes of storage on the phone for it to be pro. Right.
[00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:05.360]   And I'm able to read Windows 10 in emulation. Yeah.
[00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:11.600]   All right. So the other rumor we heard is that the iPad Pro might be getting even more pro
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:17.920]   basically by getting the same camera system as the iPhone is rumored to be getting. And that is
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:22.720]   either a two lens camera system on the lower end models, which would be the telephoto and the
[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:26.800]   current wide angle. So it could do portrait mode and it could do all the stuff, the current iPhone
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:32.560]   and tennis and tennis max could do. But also the higher end one would be getting the three lens
[00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:39.120]   system that would have that equilateral arrays for fancy math stuff like smart frame where you
[00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:44.320]   could if you cropped Lori out by accident or part of Andy's beard or a bit of that squirrel's tail,
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:49.040]   you could reframe it so that it shows all of the all of the frame that you originally intended to
[00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:54.400]   show. But Andy, are we are we at the point where you need that quality of a camera on an iPad or
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:53:01.440]   just want it for your Squirtle photography? Fun. I'd say so because once we talk about iPad Pro,
[00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:08.320]   when you're on like the $329 budget iPad, you really are talking about, oh, why are you taking
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:11.440]   pictures with that when you probably have a much better phone in your pocket as much more convenient.
[00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:15.520]   But when you're talking about a pro, there are going to be people who will as soon as you put
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:21.280]   that class of a camera on the iPad, someone will come up with a frame rig for it so that you can
[00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:26.720]   really and use it for for a legitimate 4K event photography with it'll be like a aluminum frame
[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:32.000]   with two handles and a gimbal and a rack for lights and a couple of microphones. There's going to be
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:36.800]   people who are going to be using it for AR. So that certainly makes sense. I would love to see Apple
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:41.920]   really leverage the idea that this is a huge, huge, huge piece of circuit real estate. Let's
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:46.800]   pack it full of as well. Let's not try to and let's not try to guess that people are not going to
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:53.520]   need a certain feature. If we have room for it and if we can do it within the price frames that we
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:59.040]   have set for this product line, let's give them the better camera. What it will only open this up to
[00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:04.800]   new uses and sell more of them to more of the pocketed people. Yeah, I completely agree with you,
[00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:10.640]   Andy. I'm surprised that Apple hasn't done a better job with the cameras on the iPad.
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:18.000]   At first, it made sense that they were keeping them behind the iPhone in terms of pixel quality
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:22.560]   and things like that. But it didn't take long to realize that there's a lot of people out there
[00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:30.000]   that are using iPads for photography reasons or for video reasons. I think it's a couple years
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:36.960]   behind. I think it's about time Apple kind of push the iPad and iPad Pro camera specs up to
[00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:42.800]   par with the iPhone specs because it's capable of handling it. Why not go ahead and do that? I think
[00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:49.440]   it's a really good idea and it should have been done a long time ago. Especially when you think
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:54.400]   about Photoshop is probably going to be available by the time at the end of this year. So when this
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:55:01.360]   new iPad comes out, Procreate is already burn and barn with creatives. Imagine the ability to do the
[00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:07.760]   -- shoot the reference footage or even shoot the primary photo and then edit it completely on this
[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:14.160]   device and boom, shoot it off without ever having to do an import or ever have to worry about translation.
[00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:20.240]   That's just one way that people could use that. And I really think there's a long list of people
[00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:26.240]   that if they found out that there's a tablet with the same camera system as the latest iPhone,
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:30.800]   that would really move them from, you know what? I was thinking about getting a Windows tablet.
[00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:35.680]   I was thinking about getting this device instead. Now I'm definitely getting an iPad because I've
[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:42.160]   been using the iPad for other things and the ability to put one thing in my bag and carry it
[00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:47.360]   with me on the plane and basically have most of my studio in this one magazine-sized object.
[00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:54.320]   That is a really big attractor. The interesting thing for me is that we shots when we did CES,
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:58.480]   we used to shoot with iPads because you would get such a big frame. Like it was just such a big
[00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:02.720]   viewfinder and it was really easy to get everything exactly. You knew it was tack sharp,
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:06.640]   you knew it was right there. Then at the same time, you see people walk by going to take a photo
[00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:14.000]   with your iPad and that stigma doesn't go away. But I'm hoping that if it's a "rel-serious" camera
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:19.680]   system, then people will be real serious about using it. It could be a PR problem because if
[00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:23.520]   you think it's annoying enough being a concert and people just holding up little phones,
[00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:28.320]   imagine them holding up 8.5 x 11 tablets blocking your view. At least you'll be able to get a better
[00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:36.960]   view off their screen. It's especially annoying when they're using a folio cover that they have
[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:42.480]   dangling down. They're taking a picture and like there's just this thing dangling that happens.
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:47.040]   I see that happen out there. The "your-verse" campaign that Apple had was like,
[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:51.600]   "Doom, dooom, dooom, dooom." You saw people on top of mountains with their iPads and exactly
[00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:55.680]   those frame setups that Andy was talking about. It just looked like they were carrying Thor's
[00:56:55.680 --> 00:57:02.720]   hammer around from P2P. This is a complete tangent, but it occurred to me while we were talking about
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:07.840]   this, Andy's. We've seen some people criticizing Samsung's latest Galaxy Notes, saying they're
[00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:13.840]   falling behind Huawei when it comes to things like sensor size and pixel binning. I think
[00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:19.280]   they have 12 foot size sensors now inside those cameras. But they're doing at least 4 to 1 pixel
[00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:24.240]   binning, like 48 megapixel now to 12 megapixel. We've seen that Apple on the iPhone 11 looks like
[00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:28.720]   they're going to have bigger lenses, but do you think they need to start stretching their physical
[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:32.800]   camera, their optics to match what Huawei and some of the other Chinese vendors are doing?
[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:41.280]   Not really. Not until these really, really huge sensors can deliver results that actual regular
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:47.440]   users can relate to. You'll see all the photography blogs will do these really nice and detailed
[00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:51.040]   evaluations and all these pixel peeping sort of things about saying, "Oh, well, there's so much
[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:57.600]   noise in the grays." And here's the gamut of this. When really, phone users are not people who care
[00:57:57.600 --> 00:58:04.240]   about to see spectrographs. They care about seeing here is a picture in this dark bar
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:09.760]   with camera A. Here is a picture in this dark bar taken with camera B, while camera B is way,
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:13.440]   way better. And that's one of the things that you can do when you have these hyper megapixel
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:20.240]   sensors. You have the sensors taking multiple samples, multiple guesses as what should be
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:26.880]   in that place that is to the human eye practically blacked out. And Samsung is now coming out. I
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:33.120]   think it has come up with a brand new process, excuse me, brand new camera sensor. That's certainly
[00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:38.720]   going to be in next year's Samsung phones. Again, but it would be a more interesting
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:44.320]   tidbit if it were in Google's hands or Apple's hands, because Google and Apple, when it comes to
[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:50.080]   cameras, they are very much fixated on that. I want the user to, there's a reason why the
[00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:55.600]   primary control on this camera is one big round white button that you click and you expect to get
[00:58:55.600 --> 00:59:02.240]   a really great photo of a photo from Google gets it, Apple gets it, Samsung doesn't necessarily get it.
[00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:06.160]   If Apple and Google had their hands on this sensor, if they believe it was worth investing
[00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:10.960]   in this and putting this in their phones, they would figure out a way to combine that with
[00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:18.720]   laser sensors and with multiple cameras and multiple lenses to figure out ways to
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:25.520]   turn back time and reshoot something if you mess something up. Like you're indicating
[00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:30.000]   or get pictures where the number of times where I've been walking through the city.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:38.480]   Through my really nice expensive camera in my laptop bag on a whim and I forgot to charge it,
[00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:42.800]   so I only got to take like 10 pictures before the battery crapped out. I spent the rest of the
[00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:48.560]   time with my three year old phone. The number of times I've looked at that, like my camera roll,
[00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:56.080]   that's been on an Adobe Lightroom back home. It sickens me that the pictures that this phone took
[00:59:56.080 --> 01:00:01.920]   because so much of the engineering is in making active decisions on how to fix that sky and how
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:06.720]   to deal with that really, really dark foreground and how to freeze that action in that section of the
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:12.480]   frame. I almost sickens me that this three year old phone is way better and at these things.
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:16.800]   So that's what I'm looking at. I think I'm glad that we're way past the days where
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:23.360]   companies used to be able to advertise a camera or phone by, oh, that one had three megapixels.
[01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:28.480]   ours has five megapixels and we have an independent lab that certifies that five is a larger number
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:36.720]   than three and then expects that to sell the phone. Now they really are looking forward that time,
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:42.800]   that moment during the Apple presentation when they put up on this brilliant and incredibly
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:49.680]   expensive 8K projection perfectly tuned screen examples of these phone pictures. Again, on this
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:56.160]   amazing billboard type size screen and say yes, not only not only we're showing you AB,
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:01:03.280]   but just look at how good it looks in a professional viewing setting. This could have been a billboard
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:09.120]   in Times Square anytime from the 80s to the 90s and would be would kick the butt of any professional
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:14.160]   camera that was shooting at that time. Yeah, that's it, Lori. People don't care about megapixels,
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:20.800]   they care about having good concert photos. Exactly. Especially when it's in the dark and
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:27.520]   there's a lot of movement. So we are here with Lori Gill, managing editor of IMOR and Andy and
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:33.600]   NOTCO from the Boston Public Radio. But I'm sure all of us are eager to find out whether Leo is
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:38.560]   now buzzing Cupertino and Mountain View in his search for 5G. So Leo, where are you now?
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:46.720]   Ah, can you smell the air in the Mac Break Weekly studio? No, that's not Andy and NOTCO. That's
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:54.080]   although he is spring fresh. It is our molecule air freshener. I am such a believer in the molecule.
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:59.440]   It really was a solution for our house. Lisa, we moved to the country and Lisa got allergies
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:03.440]   all of a sudden from all the pollen and dust in the air. She was waking up every morning with a
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:09.040]   headache. It was no fun for her. No fun for me either until we got the molecule. A lot
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:14.960]   molecule has reinvented how an air purifier works. And man, it really works. When Lisa sleeps
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:18.640]   somewhere else, she knows because she gets that headache again, but not in our bedroom. We liked
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:22.560]   it so much. We got a molecule for our son, Michael. We have a molecule now in the studio.
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:29.280]   Molecule is reimagining the future of clean air with their amazing air purifier. It's not a
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:34.080]   HEPA filter. Let me be clear about this. The HEPA filter was invented during World War II.
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:41.520]   It really hasn't changed since. It does what it does well, which is basically trap big particles.
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:46.160]   But that's not the whole source, not the whole story of air pollution in your house.
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:50.960]   It's also really tiny particles that HEPA filters just pass right through viruses,
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:57.360]   volatile organic compounds, pain, formaldehyde, mold. These are in fact the most dangerous
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:03.520]   pollutants in your home. Molecule uses something they call PICO, photo electrochemical oxidation.
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:06.640]   It goes well beyond the HEPA filter. It doesn't just capture
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:13.760]   allergens, mold, bacteria, viruses, airborne chemicals. It destroys them. It destroys them,
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:17.840]   including pollutants a thousand times smaller than those a HEPA filter can catch.
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:22.960]   Molecule's technology has been personally effective in our house, but it's also verified
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:27.440]   by science and most importantly tested by real people. Allergy and asthma sufferers around the
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:35.280]   country are rejoicing. We are, I know. Molecule's technology was funded by the EPA, extensively
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:39.920]   tested not only by people like us, but verified by third parties and university laboratories,
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:44.400]   like the University of South Florida's Center for Biological Defense and the University of
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:49.680]   Minnesota's Particle Calibration Laboratory. Molecule is very easy to use. It's beautiful.
[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:54.640]   It's this aluminum tube. It's kind of like the apple of air purifiers.
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:04:01.200]   I love it that it's got a subscription service for the filters. In fact, I paired my phone to
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:05.600]   the Molecule and when the Molecule filters get low, it automatically orders new filters. They come
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:11.920]   in the mail and I pop them in, so we're always up to date on our Molecule. I think this is fantastic.
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:15.600]   By the way, if you don't want to use Wi-Fi or Bluetooth or your Molecule, you don't have to.
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:20.080]   It's got a nice control on the top. Really easy to change the filters too. You just pop a button,
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:25.360]   raise it up, pop in the new filter. I am such a fan of the Molecule and you better believe we got
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:31.680]   it running at home and at work all the time. For $75 off your first order, visit Molecule.com.

[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:58.160]   Apple keeps canceling special projects. I've joked in the past that if we could have had this
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:02.080]   level of scrutiny back when the iPhone was being made, we would have seen headlines like Apple's
[01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:08.880]   shelves, tablet project. Apple destroys Tony Fadal's dreams and doesn't make his iPod phone.
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:12.720]   Apple has secret project rooms, smells like pizza where they're working on a Mac phone.
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:16.800]   It's just that there's so much you can pull from these, but we keep doing these stories about
[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:22.320]   stuff being canceled, followed almost immediately by stories of them still being an active development.
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:27.120]   And one of the ones we got this week was a story about Apple working on gaze tracking
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:32.480]   to make AR and VR faster and more accurate. And I know in the past, we've talked about what is
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:39.360]   the killer feature for AR glasses or a VR experience. And if it's just maps, walking around with maps,
[01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:44.800]   probably not enough. But when you start to see different activities like this, what do you think
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:49.120]   about how they're shaping these products or if they're still shaping them?
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:55.920]   The thing is Apple hasn't released anything. They haven't published any papers. They haven't
[01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:01.920]   done anything. They really have done nothing. They've done nothing but offer their usual
[01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:05.760]   statement that we don't know that we're not commenting on anything that we haven't announced
[01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:10.080]   yet. So they're not moving the needle at all. Everybody knows that they've hired a bunch of
[01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:14.480]   people. Everybody knows that they're working on something, but they could go the way of the
[01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:19.120]   Apple television set where we know that they're developing it. We know that they built it. We
[01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:23.280]   know that they are thinking about what to do with it, but maybe they will just simply
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:28.880]   go to the land of ghosts and winds. So they're really having absolutely no influence whatsoever.
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:33.280]   Whereas pretty much every other company that knows how to handle a graphics processor
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:38.240]   is doing something. They're giving the most important thing that they're doing for the category
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:43.680]   is putting hardware in the hands of developers so that they can then figure out ways to use this,
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:50.800]   either in gaming and therapy and commerce. All these ways that they can implement these ideas
[01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:54.400]   limited by the hardware or not limited by these new changes in the hardware.
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:58.720]   Do people want to wear a pod on their belt with a processor? Do they want to do it all with the phone?
[01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:04.960]   These are all decisions that are being explored and answered actively by all these other solutions
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:09.520]   that are out there. Apple really isn't doing anything. I'm sure that they're taking copious notes.
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:14.560]   But for now, we can't give them credit for doing anything at this point. Maybe, and again, maybe
[01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:20.400]   it'll be like the iPhone where after sitting out this category for, since the smartphone
[01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:24.400]   category, since it's inception, they suddenly appear because again, they've been watching,
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:29.120]   they've been taking notes and they know exactly what not to do. They can avoid all the mistakes
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:33.520]   that everybody else made developing their product. Or maybe they'll just figure out that we have
[01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:37.600]   nothing new to offer this category and they'll just sit out. Who knows?
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:42.400]   What do you think, Laurie? Do you think Apple should have actual hardware out there, even if
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:47.200]   it's not polished and perfect yet? Maybe arguably the first generation Apple watch?
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:51.920]   Or are they doing okay just by putting AR kit out, putting it on iPhones, putting on iPads,
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:55.920]   and seeing what people do when they're holding it without the benefit of it being on their glasses?
[01:07:55.920 --> 01:08:03.040]   I think Apple would be smart to hold off until they have a hardware product that they can be
[01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:10.640]   proud of, that they can launch and be successful. Apple gets the hardware scrutiny more than a
[01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:15.040]   lot of other companies out there. So if it's not perfect out of the gate, you're going to hear
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:19.840]   about it. Apple watches is an example of that. You're right, the first iteration and the second
[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:25.840]   and the third were probably less than perfect. And then it made it to the fourth iteration and
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:34.000]   became the most popular, where a smart watch in the market. And so I think it'd be a good idea
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:39.040]   for them to hold off a little bit. I think they are obviously working on AR. That's why I think
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:46.080]   they earlier this week, they announced that they were opening a special art installation in a
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:51.360]   bunch of different Apple stores around the world. So what they're doing is they're showing us that
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:55.360]   right now the phone that you have in your pocket, if you have the iPhone 10 or higher,
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:09:02.000]   is capable of an incredible amount of augmented reality. And here's some incredible things that
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.960]   can be done with just what's in your pocket. And then in the future, when they feel like they've
[01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:12.320]   got, they've got down. And again, Andy, just like you're saying, if they're taking all the notes,
[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:16.400]   they're going to know where the pain points are, and they're going to try to make sure that they
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:23.600]   adjust for those when they finally do come out with theirs. My very limited experience with VR
[01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:29.280]   would be the Oculus Go, which is a lot of fun. But it's also not super comfortable. And I have a feeling
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:36.400]   that Apple would be able to come up with something that would be more comfortable, but also provide
[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:42.480]   the same amount of technology on the inside as what AR and VR is going to be doing for us in the future.
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:50.160]   So I would say they should hold off until they've got what's going on. I want a nice thin pair of
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:53.200]   Jordi sunglasses, maybe that kind of wrap around my head a little bit.
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:58.000]   I want to eat a thing from the last Spider-Man movie. I think that's my style.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:06.000]   See, we're joking, but that is absolutely part of the problem that people have seen this
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:11.200]   technology in so many movies designed by Hollywood scenic designers who build these
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:15.300]   beautiful devices. And so maybe people are not necessarily going to be waiting for the
[01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:20.800]   function of Tony star, exirman, soot, then I can expect him to have Jarvis inside there
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:25.240]   inside that lens with them. But they know they know they know they know they know they know they know.
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:27.320]   They know they know.
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:36.840]   So yeah, I think that one amazing thing about science fiction is that they tend to predict
[01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:42.720]   the future for us and to some degree. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has always
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:49.800]   been my frame of reference for like the future of technology. That was the smartphone. Dick
[01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:54.920]   Tracy, that was the smartwatch. These are science fiction stories that are now actual
[01:10:54.920 --> 01:11:00.440]   real things that are happening. So the idea that what we see in movies and on TV shows
[01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:07.040]   about the future of AR and VR, I am excited if that means that we're going to get stuff
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:11.640]   that looks like that better than what actually exists in the world right now, which is this
[01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:17.680]   massive machine on our faces. So, you know, give me give me the Star Trek future in VR
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:20.040]   and I am all on board with that.
[01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:23.480]   Yeah, I don't know if you've seen those movies yet, but a lot of them they put on the glasses
[01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:27.760]   and then they see their world augmented. So like you can put your hand into an Ironman
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:31.640]   armor thing and he can tell Jarvis to make tweaks to it. And because I'm still trying
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:35.240]   to think of the compelling use case because right now it really is you're just walking
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:40.640]   around and maybe it shows you maps or the cliched one where I walk up to Lori Gill and it says
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:43.400]   this is her significant other isn't it and this is where she lives. He talked to her
[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:47.600]   about the rain because it hasn't rained there in six months. And like, those sorts of things.
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:53.440]   But to me, the really compelling part is making you interfaces anywhere. You know, you walk
[01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:56.600]   up to something you don't need to pull out a phone, you don't need to pull out an iPad,
[01:11:56.600 --> 01:12:00.600]   you don't all this stuff is just there and available to you opportunistically when you
[01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:05.280]   want to hit. But the science fiction thing does seem to you know, like you're trying
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:09.400]   on a new shirt or something, you're not actually trying it on. You're just looking in the mirror
[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:14.360]   and the AR is layering that shirt over for you. It just seems like there's so much opportunity
[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:18.320]   when we're no longer tied to those tiny little screens.
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:23.720]   Yeah, and you know, some of that's going to come with a little bit of time and a little
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:28.360]   bit of research because what just like what you're saying right now, what is the future
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:34.240]   of AR and VR. To me, right now, I see it as something that's going to be an AR is going
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:41.560]   to be invaluable to research in the future for medical and scientific things. And VR
[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:46.960]   is games. Right now, I don't see VR being good for anything else but playing video games
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:52.280]   on which is awesome. But I don't know, I don't understand, you know, I can't visualize.
[01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:58.080]   You could go to Disney on your couch and VR Lori. I could, I could, I could definitely
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:04.840]   do that. But I would rather go to Disneyland in real life and eat their delicious foods.
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:08.800]   And the other story which was super similar to this is Apple is again, you know, the car
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:12.680]   project was canceled obviously, but Apple is still ramping up the amount of people who
[01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:17.600]   are or testing these things out. And I'm going to throw this one your way first, Lori. I
[01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:21.640]   mean, there's, again, to me, it's like watching the iPhone project from the early days of
[01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:25.240]   Safari, and there's just no way of knowing what's going to come out the other end or
[01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:29.080]   watching the Gizmo project before it became the Apple Watch. It's just hard to see what
[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:32.840]   the end result is going to be. But when you hear things about Apple getting more testers
[01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:37.640]   on the road, does that sound to you like they're still figuring this out or that they're
[01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:44.160]   starting to get an idea of what they want? And where is this going? Are they going to
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:48.600]   have their own Tesla autopilot or are they just going to make a bunch of cool technology
[01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:52.360]   for something, something in the future?
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:56.760]   So you think it's going to be a long time before we see Apple VR glasses? It's going
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:14:03.400]   to be way longer before we see cars. That's what I think. I don't think just, at least
[01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:11.160]   we can say that AR and VR exists in commonplace and it's usable and it's not dangerous. Cars
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:17.480]   are so far behind. The self-driving car is so far behind right now that it's going to
[01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:25.640]   be quite a while before number one. It's stable enough to be used by people other than testers.
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:31.000]   Number two, before people like me and my mom and my next-door neighbor and my best friend
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:39.320]   want to even get into one of those because it's such a high risk thing to invest in,
[01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:44.520]   to participate in that you're going to have to make me trust you in a lot of ways that
[01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:48.600]   I don't trust anybody to do right now. I barely even trust humans to do right now,
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:54.360]   which is to drive me around. So the fact that Apple is investing in a lot of
[01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:59.880]   research and development for the car of the future, the self-driving car of the future,
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:04.600]   of course they are. That's what everyone's doing. Whether or not the self-driving car of the future
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:13.800]   happens while I'm still capable of driving a car. That I'm not so sure about. It might happen
[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:20.040]   in my driving lifetime. It might not happen until I'm no longer have the vision.
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:22.520]   That's perfect timing, Laurie. As soon as you're ready for it, it will be there.
[01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:25.160]   Yeah, it's true.
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:29.800]   How should people interpret these stories though, Andy? Should they be following them,
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:33.640]   or are they just like curiosities to note as you pick up your latte and head on out the door?
[01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:42.520]   I mean, it's trivia. It's kind of like being on a fan message board and finding out,
[01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:48.280]   oh, here's a shot that I pass her by God of the next Avengers movie. And it doesn't mean
[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:54.280]   if I saw some guy in a gray suit with spots all over it. And you saw somebody's boyfriend or
[01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:57.800]   girlfriend that indicates that maybe their girlfriend or boyfriend is part of the cast.
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:01.640]   And it's nice, but it doesn't really mean anything. But it's fun because we're fans and we kind of
[01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:06.360]   follow these things. It's just really difficult when it's a company like Apple that again,
[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:09.720]   you know, they're working on lots of stuff. They're not going to talk about it. No matter how
[01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:14.520]   interesting it is, compared and contrast to pretty much every other tech company that will,
[01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:20.280]   like again, Google has decided that we know that people that know that news about the new
[01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:27.160]   Pixel 4 is going to leak anyway. Let's leak it ourselves. And we'll explain to you why we have
[01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:33.640]   this big unibrow at the top of the screen that looks kind of like off-putting. Well, it's because
[01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:37.720]   we put these really cool sensors in there. And okay, well, yes, we did put four cameras in the
[01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:42.280]   back of it. Aren't you going to enjoy that? And we'll explain exactly what's used for three months
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:48.360]   of advanced while you've got $1,000 burning a hole in your pocket, maybe for another person's phone.
[01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:53.640]   So we can talk about that sort of stuff when it comes to a Samsung phone or Google phone,
[01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:59.720]   or a Microsoft laptop with Apple. Again, it's fun. It's fun to think about what they're going to do
[01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:05.240]   with the camera. It's fun to think about what an iPhone Pro would be like. It's fun to think about
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:11.480]   what would be like to have an iPad with multiple cameras. In the end, we just know that we're
[01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:16.600]   just, again, we're having a big sleepover. We've got the popcorn, we've got the MTV Movie Awards
[01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:21.320]   on, and we're just gossiping. And we're not going to know anything until the big day comes. They
[01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:26.760]   actually announced. >> That reminds me too, we saw Google pre-announced Project Soli
[01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:32.360]   is coming to the Pixel 4. We've now seen LG's attempt at gestures where you sort of claw your hand
[01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:37.160]   in the middle of the thing and turn and hope that it does something. Samsung now has these pencil
[01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:42.040]   gestures where even though you're whole, I forgot how Andrew Martone mentioned it, but even though
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:45.960]   you're holding the phone in your hand, it'd be easier to actually touch it. You can still swipe
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:51.560]   above it to go through it, but it's kind of wonky. We're seeing LIDAR, we're seeing radar. Does
[01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:55.400]   radar have a place on your phone, Andy? Are you hungry for radar on your iPhone?
[01:17:55.400 --> 01:18:03.000]   >> Ask me, this is something that you and I can commiserate on, Renee. We both live in areas that
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:09.640]   have this thing called intense cold during the winter. And the first time that I can interact
[01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:14.440]   with my phone without having to pull my glove off and lose a fingertip to frostbite, that's
[01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:18.680]   what I'm going to say. You know what? That was a really good idea. I'm glad I got this.
[01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:26.120]   >> Yeah, the criticism of it right now is that it's not intuitive to do what you think it's going
[01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:31.800]   to do, and it doesn't do what you want it to do most of the time. And I think Google probably
[01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:36.920]   is best positioned to fix that part of it. And then once it does exactly what I want in the way
[01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:40.600]   that I think I want it done, I'm definitely going to want it when I have gloves on, Andy.
[01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:45.160]   >> Yeah, that's a good point because we don't have the double click, the double click and drag,
[01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:50.120]   the option shift click, yet things that are completely not intuitive at all. But we all know,
[01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:54.280]   I can plop anybody in front of their first Linux system for the first time. They would be double
[01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:58.440]   clicking, they would be control clicking, they would be doing all this sort of stuff. But it
[01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:03.080]   seems like Google is starting small by simply saying, okay, do this to go to the next track,
[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:07.480]   or do this in front of the phone to say, shut up now. And then I'm sure they're not going to pile
[01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:09.960]   on with the gestures to begin with. Yeah, exactly.
[01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:15.560]   Do you want that kind of stuff, Tular? Are you interested in all the air gestures that we've been
[01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:26.360]   seeing? >> As a fun thing, but certainly not as a feature that would, if it meant taking away
[01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:32.760]   something that I need a news on my phone or my tablet, I know. But I think what I think is great
[01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:40.440]   about what Google does is they just go for it and they let everybody try it out. And they just,
[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:44.920]   they throw caution to the wind and they say, here's a feature, what are you going to do with it?
[01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:49.960]   And it's not kept in a box where only a handful of people are researching on it.
[01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:53.560]   They throw it out there. And then if it turns out that everybody thinks that this
[01:19:53.560 --> 01:20:01.240]   gesture-based control is dumb, useless, difficult, doesn't work, they'll pull it. And it won't be in
[01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:04.360]   the next phone. And I think they know that and they're not afraid to try that.
[01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:11.080]   And maybe it's partly because they don't get quite as much heat when they do something wrong as the
[01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:16.520]   way Apple does it. But it's something that I've always been so impressed with Google for what they
[01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:23.000]   do is that they're much more open and they love to hear people's ideas and they love to try new
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:29.720]   things and experiment with things like that. And this gesture-based control is a perfect example.
[01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:35.080]   I went to Google I/O a few years back. It's probably been five years now. And they were first
[01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:43.080]   introducing the solely. It was incredible. The minute they were doing this, which if you're listening
[01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:51.800]   and not watching, I'm making the tiniest fiddle in the world movement. And they were controlling a
[01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:59.320]   digital knob by just rubbing their two fingers together. And that's incredible. And the only way
[01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:04.360]   that we get to things like that in this world is by experimenting with them and experimenting
[01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:08.120]   with the world with them and finding out what they're doing with it so that we can
[01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:14.120]   further that technology. And there are definitely two different reasons why we do or don't use
[01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:21.320]   Google or Apple. And on the one hand, we may not want our phone manufacturers to know
[01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:25.800]   everything that we're doing with our devices. And that's why we choose Apple. But on the other
[01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:31.240]   hand, we might want to help future this technological world. And that's why we use Google because they
[01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:36.520]   use that information to create new and better technologies in the future just based on what
[01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:44.520]   happens in the wild. Yeah, I hope that as soon as I saw the first solely demo and as soon as
[01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:48.760]   I got into the phase this year of, okay, this is a real thing now. And now I have to look at all
[01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:53.080]   the research papers of what researchers have been doing with the solely developers kits that Google
[01:21:53.080 --> 01:22:00.200]   has been sending out. It really, really got me super excited because this could be as if this,
[01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:06.040]   if Google does a good job of implementing this and also getting other people and developers excited
[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:10.760]   about this, this could be as transformative as the touch screen as multi touch was for phones.
[01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:15.400]   Because because we're not just we're not just talking about, oh boy, it's so difficult for me
[01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:20.280]   to press this button for me to change the volume on this thing without having a gesture. But okay,
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:24.680]   here's something that's really, really out there. And this is this is from a research paper. Like
[01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:30.760]   what if the solely equipment that is that is possibly probably going to be on the next
[01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:39.240]   Google for the next pixel phone will allow a developer of a music app or podcast app to use the
[01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:45.800]   solely sent the this radar sensor to basically do whatever they want it to do. So imagine that
[01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:50.760]   I've got the phone just basically like on the table. I met my usual diner having my Tuesday morning
[01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:58.120]   breakfast. And what if I were able to simply take a salt shaker or anything like from the
[01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:03.240]   little caddy that's in front of me, set it in front of the phone, a phone. And then is it the
[01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:09.240]   salt shaker, which does not have Bluetooth or Wi-Fi or lightning or anything becomes a volume control
[01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:15.240]   knob just simply because if I because the set the radar, the sense that this object is being turned
[01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:21.160]   and then turned that into an active control. There are even some studies that are there was one
[01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:29.960]   study that came that came across that was fascinating about the because this radar this
[01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:36.440]   millimeter radar doesn't just hit the surface it actually can go below below the surface of certain
[01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:42.040]   certain surfaces. It can go below the surface of skin. And so one researcher was trying to figure
[01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:46.920]   out would it be possible to figure out what's what someone's blood glucose level was
[01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:52.120]   through one of these sensors. And so they set up an analog of human skin. They set up an analog
[01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:56.680]   of blood underneath it. And this was highly experimental. This is not a practical demonstration,
[01:23:56.680 --> 01:24:02.840]   but they said that yes, we can detect blood in this highly artificial environment. We can detect
[01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:08.840]   blood glucose levels. That just shows you how big this how broad this technology could be gone.
[01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:14.280]   And the last thing is it's almost we see ironic for Google to be promoting this because a lot
[01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:18.440]   of the stuff that is being talked about by using gestures, they certainly can be done with cameras
[01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:24.040]   of a way, way higher CPU overload, but it could be done with cameras. But the great thing about
[01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:31.560]   sonar is that radar is that it doesn't image anything. It just it just returns feedback on what signal
[01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:38.360]   was relayed back to the sensor after it made its cycle of pips. So it can't really paint an image
[01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:45.240]   of who is here can't really paint an image of what the room looks like because the range of it is
[01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:50.040]   so small. So this could be this would be a way of getting a lot of the features you can get
[01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:55.160]   through a camera with the privacy of saying no, I'm not showing any pictures of anything or anybody.
[01:24:55.160 --> 01:25:00.280]   All it is registering is simply movement. And this is the solely sensor. It really isn't about fine
[01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:07.000]   grained figuring out where it's strength is not necessarily detail of a radar image.
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:11.800]   The strength of it is the frequency by which of samples it can take. I think it takes something
[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:18.440]   like 10,000 samples per second. So this would be a way for people to say maybe I am willing to use
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:22.280]   this feature and have it on my nightstand without having to put like a band-date or something on
[01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:26.360]   top of the camera sensor because oh my god, it's right on my nightstand. So as you can tell,
[01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:30.520]   I'm really excited about what could happen for it. If it were a Samsung feature, I'd say wow,
[01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:35.560]   that's going to be a great demo during the release event. And then we'll never hear from it again.
[01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:40.280]   But with Google, I think you know, with Google as with Apple, you would know that no, they have a
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:45.720]   plan for this. Whatever features they show up, they release with the phone when they first released
[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:49.960]   is just the beginning. And next year, we're going to see things with that sensor that
[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:56.840]   are going to that couldn't make people switch because how many how many iPhones did all of us so
[01:25:56.840 --> 01:26:01.160]   so simply about virtue of the fact that we were using it in the office or we're using with friends
[01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:05.320]   and people next to us were just incredibly jealous because they realized that I like the way that
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:10.760]   that phone works and I can't do that with my phone. So I listen to not if you can give me daredubbles.
[01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:13.560]   Yeah, if it can give me daredubbles radar sense, I'm buying one tomorrow.
[01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:18.920]   With the graphics though, without the graphics, it's not really much.
[01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:24.040]   Yeah, or Spidey's, I'm sorry, Peter Tingle, Spidey Sense, whatever is called. I want all of that now.
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:28.520]   You still won't be able to count the number of salt grains on a pretzel. And if you can't do
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:32.360]   that, why be dareduble at all? Not until Gen 3 at least. Okay, I'm waiting.
[01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:38.920]   Last thing for now, Apple is partnering for, we saw Apple partner for better aluminum in the past,
[01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:43.400]   Lori, came all the way to Montreal to smelt cleaner, better aluminum. But now they are talking
[01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:49.560]   about sourcing even better gold. Is this a return of a gold watch or is this just part of a more
[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:58.040]   ethical and responsible supply chain for everybody? Well, Apple's been pretty, pretty outspoken on
[01:26:58.040 --> 01:27:03.560]   their desire to be as environmentally friendly as possible to have the smallest footprint as
[01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:11.480]   possible. So seeking out organizations that are better on the environment, but still finding the
[01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:17.560]   gold that they need for all of their devices, I think this is a good step in the right direction.
[01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:25.080]   The industry of mining for any kind of mineral in the world can be really damaging to the Earth.
[01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:31.720]   And the longer we're here on this planet, mining things, the harder it gets. So not only is this
[01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:39.560]   good that Apple is taking this initiative to try to get a better gold in a better way that doesn't
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:44.840]   damage the Earth so much, they're also very good at being sort of the progenitors or the
[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:51.320]   trail blazers for other companies to do the same thing. We've seen it happen in the past and if
[01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:56.440]   they can kind of champ in how good they are for being so environmentally friendly with how they
[01:27:56.440 --> 01:28:00.680]   mine gold, then we're going to see that happen with other tech companies in the future too,
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:06.760]   which is all of this is all good for our future, our children's future and the planet itself
[01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:11.720]   surviving long enough. And the salmon, you have to think of the salmon Andy, all the salmon.
[01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:16.040]   Oh, that's one way that that was a good video.
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:26.360]   You saw the salmon tubes that I really, the video of the salmon floating through those tubes
[01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:31.560]   so they're just rocketing instead of using up to the spawning grounds of using a fish letter.
[01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:35.320]   And I just wanted to download that and put the Futurama theme song on top of it.
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:42.200]   One thing I skipped over that actually is really cool is that Apple's student IDs are coming to
[01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:46.280]   more schools. The minute I saw this, Apple's been using them internally at Apple Park for a long
[01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:50.760]   time where you can just, instead of using your old fashioned badge, you can use your Apple Watch
[01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:56.280]   or your iPhone to access parts of the company that you have access to. And they announced
[01:28:56.280 --> 01:28:59.880]   it for schools, but there was only a handful of schools that were doing it.
[01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:05.080]   And now there's 12 more of them. And this, I know Andy, we just talked about how dangerous it is
[01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:10.040]   to depend on digital devices for your security and happiness. But I still want this technology
[01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:16.040]   everywhere. I want this on my house. Yeah, I'd be a little bit concerned about it in schools though,
[01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:24.600]   because the implication of students owning what could be a very, very expensive phone and how
[01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:31.400]   it's a chance every time a student has to pass into a secure area or out of a certain
[01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:35.720]   area to demonstrate that, no, I don't have an iPhone, an iPhone, I have a feature phone, or I
[01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:41.640]   don't have a phone at all. This is why I'm using the laminated pass card. I like to see things that
[01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:48.440]   can do the job without causing any real class distinctions between people. But if you can show
[01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:57.400]   me how it'll make the security compound nature of modern schools feel less like you're getting
[01:29:57.400 --> 01:30:04.680]   into and out of the Kremlin, I'm for it. >> I was thinking of it as positive for college
[01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:12.120]   kids who are running from the dorm room or they just got up in the morning. They're gonna forget
[01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:16.280]   their wallet, but they're not gonna forget their phone. And there it is for them every time they
[01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:21.480]   want to. That's the first thing that pops into my head is getting it, getting access to the campus
[01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:26.680]   areas where you need to have your student ID. And oh no, I left my wallet at home. Oh wait, I've
[01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:31.880]   got my phone, I can get in this way. I think if I'm not mistaken too, it's part of the wallet app,
[01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:39.640]   which also allows them to add money, funds to their student ID so that they can purchase food and
[01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:48.120]   things like that. So college kids away from home, again, I have not been able to access this
[01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:53.080]   information. I have no idea what the interface looks like or how it works because previously,
[01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:58.120]   especially there were so few colleges that were even supporting it. But I believe that it includes
[01:30:58.120 --> 01:31:06.280]   a way for parents to upload funds to their kids student ID so that they can go get their
[01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:14.520]   lunches and go buy things in the student store and things like that. So I'm glad that it's rolling
[01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:21.560]   out to more campuses. Andy, I definitely understand your concept of the sort of like class separation
[01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:26.680]   between the two. And that is something, there's a discussion to be had on that for sure. But if
[01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:33.400]   I'm just thinking about the joys and benefits of having this sort of extra way to get around,
[01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:38.680]   it's sort of like having Apple pay, but it's for college kids and their campus life.
[01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:42.680]   So I do think it's pretty fun and I'd like to see it on more campuses.
[01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:47.080]   You're absolutely right. I was thinking of high schools in which that would be more of a
[01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:52.200]   distinction. Once you're in college, that's a totally different thing. I think you got to...
[01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:58.680]   college is supposed to be like the real world with training wheels on, and you have to deal
[01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:02.840]   with this sort of stuff in the real world. In high school, we should protect kids and
[01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:07.560]   create an environment. And college, we're trying to teach them that, look, we're...
[01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:13.400]   your professor, he or she is really nice. He doesn't care if you fail this course. He's got to
[01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:17.560]   teach you really, really hard. But if you don't show up and you don't do the class work, he's not
[01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:23.080]   going to get all sad. He's just going to mark you with an F and move on. And that's, and yes,
[01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:29.080]   that's part of it. You also made me think about how this sort of technology, whether it's embedded
[01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:37.160]   in a student ID or used in phones, can be used with, okay, this person does not belong in this dorm.
[01:32:37.160 --> 01:32:43.320]   But there is an outside door and there's an inside door. And maybe this person needs the safety of
[01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:46.680]   having a locked door between themselves and whatever they're trying to get away from.
[01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:51.560]   We will let them inside the front door, but not let them get into the housing area.
[01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:55.400]   There are a lot of things you could do with this. There's a lot of possibilities. And yeah,
[01:32:56.360 --> 01:32:58.360]   it's going to be some pretty cool stuff.
[01:32:58.360 --> 01:33:02.200]   Lori just made me think about all the kids going through and going, "Oh,
[01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:07.160]   MG, be right back, have to stop snapping so I can tap my damn phone and get in,
[01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:10.920]   I roll, I roll, I roll." And then for the three seconds that they tap, they want to make sure
[01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:16.760]   their friend doesn't think they abandoned them. Just make sure that your son or daughter knows
[01:33:16.760 --> 01:33:20.600]   which card they're pulling out of the Apple wallet, because if they're going to buy a burrito
[01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:25.000]   at 24.8% interest, that's a harsh lesson. You don't want them to learn.
[01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:34.600]   We have Boston Public Radio's Andy Inaka with us. We have I'm War's own Lori Gill. And for the
[01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:39.080]   last time, at least for right now, we're going to check in and find out where in the world Leo
[01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:45.000]   LePort is. And now, ladies and gentlemen, I interrupt this program for a word from the bravest. You
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:49.880]   want to talk courage? I ain't talking taking out the headphone bar, but port. I'm talking about
[01:33:49.880 --> 01:33:55.560]   taking out the inkjet cartridges. Most printer manufacturers, almost all the profit is tied up
[01:33:55.560 --> 01:34:02.520]   in ink cartridges. But Epson realized that customers don't like to have to jump up in the middle of
[01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:08.360]   a print job and go get more cartridges. They don't like the expensive cartridges. Customers,
[01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:12.520]   like me, want to put ink in the printer and forget about it. And that's the Epson Eco Tank
[01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:20.280]   printers. You just fill and chill because they come with giant super tanks that can hold up to
[01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:25.080]   two years of ink that comes with the printer. So and they're very easy to use color coded.
[01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:30.200]   You can't use the wrong bottle in the wrong tank. You put it in and you've got thousands of pages
[01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:35.960]   of print before you have to buy more ink. And when you go back to the store in 2021,
[01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:42.120]   you'll get another two years supply. So you won't be back till 2023. Yes, you could say goodbye to
[01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:48.440]   the office office store in your neighborhood. I won't be back till 2023. I love the Epson Eco
[01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:54.440]   Tank. Great printing. Really great all in one printers. They they scan the facts. They print,
[01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:59.960]   they copy the color is beautiful. And these these these tanks just make so much sense. It's
[01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:03.800]   changing the way people print. And I think it was courageous of Epson. I want to just pat him on
[01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:08.200]   the back to say, you know, maybe there's a better way. Let's think about the customer first.
[01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:13.080]   I love them. Get the compact eco tank printer for your home or office. Of course, we have both.
[01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:19.400]   So you can just fill and chill do away without a vinc frustration for the best combination of
[01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:24.680]   ease and value. Turn to the Epson eco tank printers got a specialty for you announced at the end of

[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:51.960]   first printer was an Epson. I've been using Epson's ever since. Remember the tractor feed the MX 80?
[01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:58.440]   That they've come a long way, baby. And now with these Epson eco tanks, they are state of the art
[01:35:58.440 --> 01:36:06.280]   eco tank printers just fill and chill Epson exceed your vision. And every photographer agrees there's
[01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:12.200]   no better photo printer than Epson's. We've all been using them. I love them. Epson dot com slash
[01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:20.680]   eco tank Leo. Now back to the show. Okay, it is time for our picks of the week. And I'm going to
[01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:27.800]   get Andy and not code to start us all off right. This is one of my favorite things in the world.
[01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:33.960]   In that it makes my life less stinky as a person who has to travel with lots and lots of different
[01:36:33.960 --> 01:36:39.560]   types of technology and lots of them are really weird shapes. This is from the camera company
[01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:45.640]   Domke D-O-M-K-E and it's just a protective wrap. And other companies make things are like this,
[01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:51.880]   but that's the word that you should look for. And all it is is it's a little padded square of
[01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:57.640]   material. It's lines like a little bit quilted available in several different sizes. And on the
[01:36:57.640 --> 01:37:04.360]   corners of one side, you have like Velcro A type stuff. On the other side, it's completely covered
[01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:10.200]   in the other type of Velcro. So why is this so cool? Well, because sometimes you have something
[01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:16.440]   like you have an object like a camera that does is so weirdly shaped, it doesn't really fit in a
[01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:21.960]   bag. Well, well, this will wrap and you can conform it to a shape. And it will always be exactly the
[01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:26.520]   right size for whatever you want to put in it. So for instance, like here is something that
[01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:32.920]   actually I'm part of the stuff that I've been carrying with me for like doing remote podcasts.
[01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:38.200]   So here's like it's a little folding tripod. And here's like a little bendable extension for the
[01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:44.600]   tripod head. And here's a little clamp extension. And I don't have a bag that will fit this correctly.
[01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:49.560]   I have lots of bags that I can just sort of toss it in and it'll rattle around. But if I just put
[01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:57.640]   this in the middle of, if I treat it like a burrito, I can just roll it up. I can just roll it up inside
[01:37:57.640 --> 01:38:03.400]   this equipment wrap. And then when I roll it up and seal it like that, now the Velcro on the top
[01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:09.640]   grabs that and I can simply fold the Velcro on the sides. And now I have a completely form fitting
[01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:14.680]   bag that is exactly the size of that weird shaped object that I wanted to put in there. And they do
[01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:19.240]   make them in all kinds of different sizes. I have one that's really, really huge that I usually use
[01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:24.760]   as a laptop sleeve, because when I travel, I don't know what's I have two or three different laptops
[01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:28.920]   with two or three different operating systems. I know I don't know necessarily which one I'm going
[01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:36.200]   to take. And I am just persnickety enough that I hate it when you buy like a laptop sleeve. And
[01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:41.800]   it says, Oh, this is especially especially for the 2015 retina Mac MacBook Pro. And you put it in
[01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:47.400]   there. And it's like, and there's like an inch. It's just the bag is like the sleeve is just an
[01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:52.920]   inch too big. It's not like form fitting. But I can put this inside this in this equipment wrap,
[01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:58.520]   and it will be exactly the size of this thing. It will not shirk, it will not shimmy will not do
[01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:03.000]   anything that stuff. And then when I want to use it on a 13 inch, on a 15 inch MacBook,
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:09.080]   I can also use it on the 15 inch. So I only I have a collection of these. And I always have like,
[01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:12.760]   at least whenever I'm traveling, I have like a lot of my equipment wrapped in these,
[01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:16.680]   because it allows me to simply protect it well enough. It's nicely padded. Now if I put it in my
[01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:20.360]   laptop bag, I don't worry about it. Lens getting scratched or I don't worry about
[01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:25.640]   if I'm traveling with a router that the cables will get separated from the router or whatever.
[01:39:25.640 --> 01:39:30.600]   So it's it's it's on my list of if you buy this and you just have this around,
[01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:36.040]   you will find a time probably four AM when the when the van taking you to the airport is
[01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:40.200]   is arriving in one hour, you will find a very, very important use for it. I promise you.
[01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:50.120]   It seems like it'd be good for carrying shoes around too. Like if you have a really fancy
[01:39:50.120 --> 01:39:54.520]   pair of shoes that you don't want to get messed up in your in your bag, or maybe you don't want
[01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:58.600]   it to mess up things in your bag, you can just kind of. My blue suede. I do know Lori.
[01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:05.960]   Yep. The inside is isn't like, you know, it's not like it's it's coated with marble or anything
[01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:09.560]   like that. It'll it's padded and it'll protect whatever you put inside it. So yeah, it's what
[01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:13.080]   it is for. Oh, terrific. What about you, Lori? Go what you got for us today?
[01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:20.360]   Okay. So 12 South about a year ago, they made this thing called air snap. And I've had one
[01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:26.600]   the entire time as soon as they came out, I got one because I carry my my AirPods with me.
[01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:33.560]   Hooked to my Fanny pack. I have a little, a little, like a D ring on my Fanny pack. So I hook
[01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:39.400]   things to it. And one of the things I hooked to it is my my AirPods. And the Air Snap is pretty
[01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:45.720]   amazing at being incredibly sturdy and easy to use. It has a little clip on it so that you can
[01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:49.880]   connect it to your key ring or, you know, a pull a zipper pull or in my case, the D ring on your
[01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:57.960]   Fanny pack flips open on the top so that it's very easy to access your AirPods. They're not kind of
[01:40:57.960 --> 01:41:04.440]   trapped in one of those plastic containers that's really hard to pull them out. It's really easy
[01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:11.960]   to get them in and out. And just last week, or maybe it was even earlier this week, they released
[01:41:11.960 --> 01:41:19.160]   the Twill version. So I have the beautiful cognac leather, which is really nice. It's got the
[01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:23.960]   patina growing on it already. Well, already I've had it for a year. But the new one is the Twill
[01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:29.720]   version, which is like just a little bit classier, you know, it's if you're kind of more in the
[01:41:29.720 --> 01:41:34.200]   executive market and you don't want to carry around brown leather or I mean, I they do have the
[01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:39.640]   other color leather. But I love this one too, because it's just kind of a little nicer for the
[01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:42.360]   dressier times when I'm out. And I'll probably.
[01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:43.960]   Professor Jones and Indiana Jones.
[01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:50.920]   Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So if you, I've said this before, if you are looking for a case for your
[01:41:50.920 --> 01:42:00.440]   AirPods, the air is not by 12 South is my absolute hands down favorite. The features on it, the way
[01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:06.200]   it works, how how rugged it is. Like I said, I've had that the leather one dangling from my
[01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:10.600]   Fanny pack for the past year. So it's gone on rides with me. It's been in the rain with me.
[01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:15.720]   It's been at punk shows where I'm watching in a pit with me. It goes everywhere with me and it
[01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:22.600]   has never torn or the hook hasn't messed up or anything. So they're incredibly rugged and reliable.
[01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:28.120]   And they're just, I don't know, their feature features are awesome. So go out and get one if you
[01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:35.400]   need anyone. Awesome. So my pick is, I don't remember if we talked about it or not, but I do know that when
[01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:41.640]   Apple announced the $1,000 stand for the $6,000 display, there was a series of crushed souls in the
[01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:48.440]   prosumer display market, because after LG had discontinued the previous 5K, almost everyone and
[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:54.360]   their Apple store business rep were hoping that there would be a lower cost 5K display to replace
[01:42:54.360 --> 01:43:00.520]   it. Turns out not from Apple, but LG has come out with a new 5K display all of their own and you
[01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:07.080]   can get it from Apple. Now Apple typically uses LG panels in their displays. So this,
[01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:13.400]   in all likelihood, is what Apple is shipping now in the iMac and the iMac Pro. So it'll look like
[01:43:13.400 --> 01:43:18.440]   your iMac display. It'll be calibrated like your iMac display. Apple's probably working with LG to
[01:43:18.440 --> 01:43:24.600]   make sure that it is as exact as it can. But of course, it doesn't have Apple industrial design.
[01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:30.920]   And for people like me not having that Apple logo on is still a horn effect, the opposite of a
[01:43:30.920 --> 01:43:37.240]   halo effect. Anything a user looks at should have an Apple logo on it if I were Apple. But since you
[01:43:37.240 --> 01:43:44.040]   can't get that from Apple and if you are just not in the market for a 6K display, 4 or 6K,
[01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:49.720]   you can pick up the 5K version. I think it's $1200 right now and it might go down a little bit over
[01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:55.560]   time. It works with all of your Macs over Thunderbolt including the MacBook Pro. There was some erroneous
[01:43:55.560 --> 01:44:00.360]   information at first about how many you could use and how but Apple has corrected that. So
[01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:06.440]   on any Thunderbolt 3 equipped MacBook Pro, iMac Pro, all of those things, you can plug one or two
[01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:13.080]   of them in. And it'll also work over USB-C in 4K mode with your iPad Pro. So if you looked at that
[01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:19.080]   iPad Pro introduction and you saw them swipe away that lightning port and wipe in that USB-C
[01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:23.800]   port and then promptly plug it into a monitor to do all sorts of fancy video editing and video
[01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:29.640]   watching, you can do all of that with this. So again, not ideal in terms of not having an Apple
[01:44:29.640 --> 01:44:34.760]   logo on the front or Apple industrial design wrapped around the panel, but it's a really good panel
[01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:40.520]   and it's not back in stock, but it's newly in stock at Apple stores and probably elsewhere. So
[01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:45.400]   you're in the market, you don't want to spend six grand, you have a 12. 1.2 grand option.
[01:44:45.400 --> 01:44:52.200]   So that's it. Andy and Aco, if people want to see you or sorry if you want to hear you
[01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:54.920]   on Boston Public Radio this week, when can they tune in?
[01:44:54.920 --> 01:45:01.960]   I'm going to be on Friday, I think 1230, check my Twitter at an onco for the exact time,
[01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:07.160]   but it's going to be at the Boston Public Library again. The GBWGBH has a studio right there. So if
[01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:11.480]   you're in Boston, check out the Boston Public Library, sit down, watch the show live if you'd like.
[01:45:11.480 --> 01:45:17.640]   And if you don't get to see it, go to wgphnews.org, they will stream it live and you can also stream
[01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:23.000]   it later. And you'll be talking all about Samsung's new phones and Google's new betas
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:30.520]   on the podcast this week. I'll be talking about probably about a certain executive's
[01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:36.040]   attempt to destroy the entire internet as we know it, because he thinks that the internet is
[01:45:36.040 --> 01:45:40.440]   being deemed him. I'm not going to mention any names that I want to surprise, but he's very,
[01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:43.480]   very high up in the American corporation, let's just say.
[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:48.200]   All right. And Lori Gill, what have you got going on this week? What's I'm more up to?
[01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:54.680]   Well, you know, I might go out and buy myself that Aura Glow Note 10, because that thing is gorgeous.
[01:45:54.680 --> 01:46:01.800]   If it weren't for the fact that I'm saving up my car, I'd be buying that right now.
[01:46:03.720 --> 01:46:13.000]   But the small one, obviously, my best friend actually just yesterday bought himself an iPhone SE.
[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:19.400]   He's going to downgrade to the iPhone SE right now. He's really down great though.
[01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:21.560]   I don't think so.
[01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:29.800]   They're like Volkswagen's people who love them love them. And they will, if Apple were to
[01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:34.200]   completely say, we will never make a phone like this again. Watch the value of that phone go up to
[01:46:34.200 --> 01:46:40.360]   like $1,500 on eBay as people have people try to collect stock piles of them.
[01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:43.880]   Hello. Oh, look, my phone actually fits on my face.
[01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:47.720]   Yes. I swear, Lori, you were saying what you were working on.
[01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:52.840]   Oh, yes. So obviously it's all about Apple Card this week for me. So if you want to learn
[01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:57.400]   more about Apple Card, you can hit me up on Twitter. I put out the call, any questions. I'll
[01:46:57.400 --> 01:47:01.080]   answer what I can. Obviously, there's some stuff that I definitely won't be able to answer. But
[01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:06.520]   I'll try to get some answers if I don't know them. And I'll be writing how to
[01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:10.920]   guys how to use it. And we'll hopefully have an actual review of it maybe early next week.
[01:47:10.920 --> 01:47:14.360]   I got to go out and buy some stuff with it. So I'll stop that.
[01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:18.200]   Thank you for taking that below. And that you will find at iMore.
[01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:21.000]   Anything in the sick burn agenda?
[01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:30.360]   Our next show is on Saturday night. We're playing with an old punk band that's been around for a
[01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:35.880]   long time. So it's kind of awesome. So it's a big-ish deal. They're sort of having a reunion
[01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:39.720]   show. So we get to play with them. And that's going to be cool. So yeah, this Saturday night.
[01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:45.320]   Everybody else is going to be going and begging Leo to come back because as much as we try to fill
[01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:51.560]   in for him, he just makes it look and sound and is just so great. So time to get back to work.
[01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:54.120]   Sorry, you gold bricks, but break time is over.
[01:47:54.120 --> 01:48:07.000]   [Music]
