[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. Renee Richie is here and the Inako and a visit, a visitor from the past.
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:12.400]   Merlin Mann joins us. There's lots to talk about. Apple has announced new headphones at a breathtaking price.
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.800]   They're going to try to talk me into buying them. I won't tell you whether they succeed or not.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.600]   You could probably guess. We're going to talk about the worst zero-day exploit I've ever heard of.
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.600]   Fortunately, it has been patched. And then a visit from Bando the bearded lizard.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:34.000]   It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly. Mac Break Weekly comes to you from Twitt's LastPass Studios.

[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.600]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we covered the latest news from Apple.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.600]   We have been doing this for a while, episode 743 today.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.600]   But the first episode and some time without Lori Gill, who has gone on to take a job with the fruit company.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.600]   But Renee Richie has refused every entreaty and has stuck with his YouTube channel.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:31.600]   Or YouTube.com/Renee Richie. Let's hope you don't look back some days and years from now and say, what a mistake that was.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.600]   I'm still on there.
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.600]   I'm not going to big fruit LaPart. I'm staying right here.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.600]   Come on people. They're already big.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.600]   Biggie is Andy and I co.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.600]   Can everyone else?
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.600]   He's with the WGBH in Boston, the Boston Public Brain Administration.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.600]   So you should now talk like this all the time.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:58.600]   And next after the next presentation, we'll be talking to a manufacturer of custom flowers and salts.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.600]   He just opened his second pop up in the village.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.600]   And one percent.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.600]   We had an MTC where Lori used to sit.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.600]   So for a while we left just a potted point set of there.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.600]   But I think it'd be better to put a guy who's actually going back to almost the earliest days,
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.600]   probably the earliest days of Mac Break Weekly, one of our favorite long-time contributors.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.600]   We've missed him so much. It's so good to get Merlin Mann back on the show.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.600]   Writer/speaker/ broadcaster.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.600]   You know why you're on Merlin?
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.600]   I don't.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.600]   Because of the New Yorker.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.600]   I'm reading the New Yorker.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.600]   They're talking about getting things done, which was, of course, kind of a fad.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.600]   We stopped getting things done around about, I think, March of this year.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:56.600]   And they lead. The lead in the New Yorker is, and then there was this guy named Merlin Mann.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:04.600]   It's called "The Rise and Fall of Getting Things Done, How Personal Productivity Transformed Work and Failed to."
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.600]   And the very first sentence, oh, I mean, I guess, "Sign in."
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:35.600]   That's how I got it, amazingly, though. The opening sense of this article on "The Rise and Fall of Getting Things Done"
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.600]   in the early 2000s, Merlin Mann, a web designer and a vowed Macintosh enthusiast,
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.600]   was working as a freelance project manager for software companies.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.600]   And it goes on and you talk about how you were overwhelmed with all the emails.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.600]   Email is a ball of uncertainty that represents anxiety, man said.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.600]   And then they talk about 43 folders in your blog.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.600]   And that's, of course, that was right about the era that we were talking to you on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.600]   And then, of course, you abandoned it all. Now you get nothing done.
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.600]   There's nothing to get done, Leo. Like you say, since March, what are we going to do?
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.600]   What are we doing here?
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.600]   What are we doing here?
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.600]   It's like Ted Lasso. It's the hope that kills you.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:25.600]   Merlin does one, two, three, at least four podcasts due by Friday,
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.600]   reconcilable differences, Roderick on the line and back to work.
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.600]   So you're busy.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.600]   You're busy.
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.600]   You know.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.600]   Yeah. Yeah. I like podcasts. It's fun. I like making a man eating them.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.600]   Oh, I'm a fan. I like them.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.600]   Roderick on the line. You're up to episode 400. So you've been doing it for a while here.
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.600]   500 on the back to work.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.600]   Yeah. Back to work is probably the longest standing.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.600]   But it's really fun. And I have to say to state that somewhat obvious that, you know,
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.600]   during amidst these challenging times, it's nice to get to visit with your pals a little bit
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:05.600]   and to get to disappear from the world for a little while and not see all the dreadfulness
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.600]   happening and take a little break.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.600]   Honestly. Podcasts and like Spotify playlists are like pretty much all that's keeping me sane at this point.
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.600]   Yeah. I think this is a world made for podcasts. Really?
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:21.600]   Yes. Like lonely people who no longer have to leave their house. It's kind of ideal.
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.600]   I'm going to be very sad.
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.600]   People are broken inside.
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:29.600]   I'm going to be very sad when they cure this COVID thing and we have to go back to the normal way of being.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.600]   It's just going to ruin it for us.
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.600]   Look at it.
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.600]   I think it's definitely not.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.600]   It's always another pandemic. Never fear.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.600]   Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.600]   I'd kind of like to be able to see Wonder Woman in theaters. That's all.
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.600]   Oh, that's a much bigger screen than I've got at home.
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.600]   Actually, you know, normally I would start the show with the new Apple products that they announced and all that stuff.
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:56.600]   But honestly, I think for the three of four of us,
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:02.600]   probably a hotter topic is what AT&T the Death Star is doing to Warner.
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.600]   Warner media.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.600]   I'm going to say fitness plus because we needed it.
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.600]   You're going to start with that.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.600]   I'll get to fitness plus. I will.
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:16.600]   But I think the I feel like it's almost shameful what AT&T has decided to do to HBO, HBO Max.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.600]   They announced that they're going to put all of the movies that come out next year.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:29.600]   It starts with Wonder Woman this month, but also throughout 2021 will appear first for free for a month on HBO Max
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.600]   while they're in theaters.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.600]   And theater owners are just crying foul.
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.600]   They're devastated.
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.600]   They've gone through a really tough nine months.
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:41.600]   And now it looks like it's going to be a tough couple of years for them.
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:50.600]   And this seems to be kind of almost predatory by AT&T, which purchased HBO when they bought Warner media for over $100 billion.
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.600]   It was a big.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.600]   Is it predatory or just really, really dumb?
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.600]   That's a part I can't really figure out.
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.600]   Well, that's the question.
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.600]   It looked like it was last minute.
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.600]   Like it was so last minute nobody at Warner's knew about it.
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:05.600]   They found out about it and they were like, even logistically, this can't work.
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.600]   You know nothing about our business if you think that this could work this way.
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:17.600]   And even as far as it was detrimental to an already hurt theater industry, it was also like, and I'm always going to harps on this.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.600]   Sorry, it's US only.
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:27.600]   And nobody knows what that means outside the US because Warner has no HBO Max presence outside the US, but there's still movie theaters
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.600]   and they still have windows and deals.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.600]   And it really sounds like this.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.600]   Like for a while, they've been wanting to do this and they decided, okay, we have an excuse.
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.600]   We can do it in three minutes starting now.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:47.600]   Christopher Nolan, the director of many wonderful Batman movies and an inception says such a great, such a great quote.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.600]   He's kind of pissed off.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.600]   He says, let me see.
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:56.600]   Some of our industries, this is from a quote he gave to the Hollywood Reporter yesterday.
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:03.600]   Some of our industry's biggest filmmakers and most important movie stars went to bed the night before thinking they were working for the greatest
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:09.600]   movie studio and found out they were working for the worst streaming service.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.600]   The worst telephone company.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.600]   Yeah, really.
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.600]   And honestly, this is exactly what you'd expect AT&T to do.
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:21.600]   They forced out Richard Pepler, who was the head of HBO and really beloved by creatives.
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.600]   Brilliant.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:27.600]   He gave us so many amazing shows and they just like, they threw him in a burning trash can.
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.600]   Well, it was Apple's game because he's producing now for Apple TV Plus.
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.600]   And now Apple TV Plus is HBO from two years ago.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.600]   Right.
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:39.600]   And then John Stanky aptly named became this.
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.600]   He was the guy who engineered this whole thing.
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:46.600]   He became the CEO of AT&T for his brilliant handling of this.
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:51.600]   So you think it's possible that it may be in two years, Stanky will be out.
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.600]   This was a horrendous move.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.600]   It's damaging though in the meantime.
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:00.600]   Well, the movie theaters point out they're going to lose money.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:06.600]   HBO will lose money because or the Warner will lose money because those movies can't make
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.600]   enough money.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.600]   You can't get enough subscriptions for HBO Max to make up for the loss of box.
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.600]   And deals are based on the theater.
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.600]   All of them have back it was not all of them, but all the big stars and all the big director.
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:21.600]   Everybody has deals based on back end of movie growth, which they will like who's going to,
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.600]   you have Wonder Woman opening in the theater and how do they pay on HBO Max on your TV.
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.600]   How is Gal Gadot getting hers?
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.600]   Apparently.
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.600]   Apparently.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.600]   Apparently.
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:35.600]   They're saying HBO Max has to write Gal Gadot a check that this, that what's going to happen
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.600]   is that they're going to insist on, look, I'm paying.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.600]   Every Gal Gadot though from everybody.
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.600]   Everybody.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.600]   Everybody.
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:48.600]   And that's, so this could, this could actually be a horrific financial decision.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:52.600]   The only thing that could make possible sense to me is it's a classic antitrust move where
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:57.600]   you undercut your competitors, in this case the movie theaters, put them out of business,
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:03.600]   and then when you control all the distribution, maybe even buy up the theaters, then you
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.600]   raise the prices and you can make more money.
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.600]   And the dude, the company that makes it huge, they were selling it to Netflix and they didn't
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.600]   even know that Wonder was going to do this.
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:14.600]   And like we had Netflix offering us tens of billions of dollars for the Bune rights and
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.600]   you're now putting it on HBO.
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:17.600]   Where's our lawyer?
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.600]   For free.
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.600]   And apparently like there's huge legal fights right now.
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:21.600]   Yeah.
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.600]   There's a lot of precedent for this too.
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:31.160]   The cast of Mash wound up suing Fox for a huge amount of money by saying that the syndication
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:35.480]   rights to Mash were incredibly valuable, but they were undermining the value of it by
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:41.320]   using it as leverage to package other properties that in syndication that they couldn't sell
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:45.520]   quite so well and therefore is cutting into like the actors and the producers shares of
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:46.600]   the profits.
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:54.120]   And this could also be a big mozzibal for the fact that AT&T made all of these arguments
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:57.320]   for four years in front of lots of courts.
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:01.960]   But when they were about to acquire emergent to Warner Brothers saying here are here are
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.880]   activities that we promise we are not going to be able to do.
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:10.800]   We're not going to try to leverage our new dominance by owning this catalog as these
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:11.800]   studios.
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:17.480]   And of course the first thing they did is the first sign I got that they were absolutely
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:25.000]   100% not even kidding about keeping up with all this was when I got an email saying congratulations
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.600]   as an AT&T digital subscriber, you're going to get HBO Max for free starting on day one.
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:35.880]   Say, isn't that like you're giving me this free package that you wouldn't be able you're
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.200]   not going to be able to give me other free packages that you don't.
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.200]   Okay.
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.200]   That's interesting.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:45.760]   Yeah, the ability to simply say we're going to throw these hundreds of millions of dollars
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:51.080]   worth of produced entertainment onto this channel that we already own.
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:55.040]   That's there's going to be not now that we now that we're going to have a new administration
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:13:01.600]   and the argument about the wisdom of this merger is no longer being complicated by a
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:06.240]   president who is like, well, you want to see this Trump fought it for years, but he fought
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.840]   it like CNN.
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:08.840]   Exactly.
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:09.840]   He fought it out of spite.
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:16.040]   And when all these all these denials went into appeal, a higher higher courts struck it down
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.400]   obviously through it out was the courts, right.
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.000]   The courts had merge.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.760]   I believe everything you're saying, John Stanky was seen at the airport talking into his wallet
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:30.480]   saying, this is the this is the guy that's a little nod to our friend.
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.680]   Our feeling is there's a win, win, win type of solutions.
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.960]   It's exactly the kind of thing you'd be saying, Merlin, right into your wallet.
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.200]   There's a win for us.
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.200]   There's a win for our customers.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.760]   There's a win for our partners.
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:44.280]   Anytime you're going to change a model, it creates a degree of noise.
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.120]   And this is certainly no exception.
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:48.040]   This is the CEO of a T and C.
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.040]   You guys saw this, right?
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:52.040]   Like you saw this with Bell and Rogers in Canada where they were allowed to own all
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.600]   the different production companies.
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.960]   And now it's yeah, because of the CRTC, our version of the SEC does not help consumers
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:58.960]   at all.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.080]   It helps the industry.
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:04.540]   And I get CBS all access and there's no Star Trek on it because they resold it to
[00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:07.780]   the craze, which is owned by Bell and they have their own and you have to sign in with
[00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:08.780]   you.
[00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:09.900]   It's a complete and utter mess.
[00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:12.900]   And it's sad that the same thing is now propagating to the US.
[00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:13.900]   Yeah.
[00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:20.100]   I try this is going to, this might sound really naive, but as I get older, I try I'm trying
[00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:23.780]   really hard to stop assuming that I'm the only smart one.
[00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:24.940]   Everybody else is the dumb one.
[00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:25.940]   That's true.
[00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:30.060]   With that said, with that said, it sometimes is just really difficult when you look at an
[00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:37.260]   industry, a company that creates products that you love and things like music, movies,
[00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.660]   those are things are very meaningful to me.
[00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:43.980]   A phrase that I find myself thinking sometimes is you don't love this as much as I do and
[00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:44.980]   it shows.
[00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:50.180]   Like sometimes I can tell in certain sometimes with a hardware device, a software device,
[00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:56.380]   the way that this thing is marketed, we have different roles and that's what makes America
[00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:00.340]   great is that your job is to run the studio and my job is to go see the movies.
[00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:05.900]   But with that said, it does feel like the long term consequences of this are going to
[00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:10.340]   affect a lot of people, not just big theater chains, but the people who work at the theater
[00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:11.340]   chains.
[00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:16.500]   I mean, people who review movies for a living, the there's this sounds silly and inconsequential,
[00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:21.620]   but something we've learned in the last six or eight months is that we can see a little
[00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:25.300]   bit in front of us of what is happening, but it's extremely difficult to see two or three
[00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:28.260]   steps ahead because of all this uncertainty.
[00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.660]   And it just seems like sort of like David, I think it was David Sims at the Atlantic said
[00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:34.860]   this, they're just it just feels like they're burning money.
[00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:39.900]   And even if I try to be kind hearted about it, I don't understand what is the strategy?
[00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:42.820]   What is this in service of?
[00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:48.140]   See, I'm assuming it's typical antitrust, but you're you're you're assuming, as Robert
[00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:52.460]   Heinlein said, never attribute to malice that which can be can to be attributed to
[00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:53.460]   incompetence.
[00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:55.500]   I'm saying that just you know, I love Apple.
[00:15:55.500 --> 00:16:02.060]   I love Apple, but I don't think they use some of their stuff as much as I do.
[00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:07.980]   I think the people who make it don't the the the remote for my Apple TV, which John
[00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:10.860]   says refers to as a diving board.
[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:14.020]   It's like you have to get the right pivot on the diving board to do the thing.
[00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:18.500]   And I don't mean to bag here, but like there was I think like you don't deal with as many
[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:23.620]   photos as I do, and like I'm not even like a photo guy, but like or whatever that is,
[00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:26.300]   you don't whatever that is there are products to come along.
[00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:28.740]   We're clearly somebody's really thought it through, but I don't know.
[00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:33.060]   I don't want to bag on the poor executives, you know, all those rich powerful men making
[00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:34.060]   these decisions.
[00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:38.140]   But I hope movies are still going to be it's difficult because in the tax on I'll show
[00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:39.140]   it up in a second.
[00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:42.820]   The taxonomy, this is difficult because when we talk about movies, really there's there
[00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:45.980]   are people who look at things like that as what has come to be called content, which
[00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:48.740]   is the thing that we shovel at the people with money.
[00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:51.620]   And then there are people who look at it as there's the theater going experience, there's
[00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:52.620]   all these different things.
[00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:57.980]   It's just you have to disassemble those pieces and look at what each one means on its own.
[00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:01.460]   I don't think it's as simple as saying, well, let's just throw a bunch of movies at HBO
[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:03.820]   Max and people will get it.
[00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:05.740]   I mean, this is this was there a hit?
[00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:09.540]   Was there a legitimate Apple TV hit like legitimate like no before?
[00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:11.500]   I want to say Ted Lasso.
[00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:13.660]   I mean, I know some did well, some were well liked.
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:15.660]   I feel like Ted Lasso.
[00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:16.660]   Was that a hit?
[00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:18.740]   Yeah, it's been approved for three seasons.
[00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:19.740]   Yeah, really?
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:24.820]   They don't even tell the producers any numbers as Jason Sudeik has mentioned.
[00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:28.900]   But I mean, so just slapping an Apple label on something is not going to make people buy
[00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:29.900]   it.
[00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:32.740]   And I really think slapping the Death Star on something is not going to make people buy
[00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:33.740]   it.
[00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:34.900]   And it's hard to understand.
[00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:38.260]   They're really diluting a lot of one of the strongest brands in media.
[00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:41.340]   And that's I don't understand why they're doing all of these things.
[00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:43.100]   I don't understand any of it.
[00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:47.740]   They're applying the Quibi the Quibi mindset to inception.
[00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:50.540]   And you saw how well that will blow blow blow.
[00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:52.580]   No, but it is a low blow.
[00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:54.420]   It's exactly what's happening.
[00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:56.740]   This is Quibi all over again, right?
[00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:02.900]   I always feel like every time another piece of information about that company came out,
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:07.500]   I would always think of a board meeting being run that run by attended by like, let's do
[00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:12.940]   the report on Quibi from George Costanza and George would be like, yeah, we'd like,
[00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:14.460]   to no one in 10 minutes.
[00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:17.860]   You can't take a screen grab and go, well, like, what if it's really good in 11 minutes?
[00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:19.060]   No, got to be 10 minutes.
[00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:20.060]   No screen grabs.
[00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:21.060]   You watch it on your TV.
[00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:22.060]   Nope, not for TV.
[00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:23.060]   Just for your phone.
[00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:25.940]   You know, it's a smart joke and a smart crowd.
[00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:28.500]   I'm just getting angry.
[00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:35.380]   I, you know, okay, you could say Ted Lasso is a hit.
[00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:36.460]   I enjoyed it.
[00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:40.220]   I don't think it was the greatest show on TV, not even close.
[00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:44.220]   Just because Apple's renewing it for three seasons doesn't mean it's a hit.
[00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:48.940]   They're kind of, they need content, right?
[00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:51.860]   They also proved the morning show for another season.
[00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:53.500]   Is that a great show?
[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:54.500]   I don't know.
[00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:56.700]   You really liked it, obviously, and it made you feel good.
[00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:57.700]   No, no, I did not.
[00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:58.820]   I did not watch the morning show.
[00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:04.380]   It didn't appeal to me, but I don't, but like it's, it's, it's, sometimes when you run
[00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:08.220]   into a company, I realize we're a little off topic here, Rattle, but sometimes you, you
[00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:11.180]   encounter something and you're like, what is this the answer to?
[00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:14.940]   Like I, I assume that there was somebody smart enough to say that there's a question that
[00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:15.940]   needs to be answered.
[00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:17.660]   There's a demand that needs to be filled.
[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:21.100]   And the case of Apple TV Plus, by the way, Apple TV Plus, just so you know, you watch
[00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:24.460]   it in the Apple TV app on your Apple TV is where you get your Apple TV Plus just so
[00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:28.460]   you know, just to be clear in terms of brand identity stuff.
[00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:33.660]   And but like I don't feel like so, but the, the, even Apple picked Disney Plus as the
[00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:36.260]   best Apple TV app of the year.
[00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:41.700]   Even Apple couldn't say, it's, it's, oh, they're, they're, they're just, they're just
[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:42.700]   bending the knee.
[00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:43.700]   What is that?
[00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:44.700]   Alphan and egg?
[00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:45.700]   What is that?
[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:46.700]   Hey, watch it.
[00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:47.700]   Hey, keep it.
[00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:48.700]   You brought back the theme, everybody.
[00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:49.700]   It's the world.
[00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:56.700]   You brought back the theme, everybody.
[00:19:56.700 --> 00:20:03.700]   Are you playing the off?
[00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:04.700]   Yeah.
[00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:05.700]   Get the heart.
[00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:08.700]   No, we love it.
[00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:10.940]   We love it.
[00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:11.940]   I don't mind.
[00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:13.660]   This is a show full of rat holes.
[00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:15.860]   It hasn't been as rat holy since you left.
[00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:18.540]   So we're glad to bring the holy rap.
[00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:21.700]   I have tried to pick up the slack.
[00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:23.860]   I mean, it's true.
[00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:24.860]   It's true.
[00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:30.300]   Andy is good at the long digression, but you know, nobody's better than Merlin at the
[00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:31.860]   rattle.
[00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:33.420]   We should have a jingle for you, Andy.
[00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:34.900]   Come to think of it.
[00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.500]   We'll work on that.
[00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:41.060]   That was Paul Minshall, by the way, who used to do a lot of fun stuff for us back in
[00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:42.060]   the day.
[00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:43.060]   How long has it been, Merlin?
[00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:44.060]   Excuse me?
[00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:45.980]   How long since what?
[00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:46.980]   Since you were on.
[00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:48.980]   Oh, I came in.
[00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:50.580]   You did a few visits, but you were.
[00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:52.420]   I mean, it's been 10 years, right?
[00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:53.900]   I don't know.
[00:20:53.900 --> 00:21:00.700]   I mean, I was around probably 2006, maybe in the first like 10 or 20 episodes.
[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:08.300]   I think Scott had just acquired a second yacht to store his extra wax.
[00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:11.780]   And the wax Alex picks them up a couple of crates, $700 a can.
[00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:14.420]   So don't consider the golden era of Mac break weekly.
[00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:17.420]   Scott for instant.
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:18.860]   I'm eternally grateful that you.
[00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:19.860]   We love you.
[00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:20.860]   We love you.
[00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:21.860]   It's so nice to have you back.
[00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:23.860]   You're asking me to leave now, aren't you?
[00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:24.860]   No, no, no.
[00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:25.860]   I'm serious.
[00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:26.860]   Don't ever leave.
[00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:27.860]   Stay.
[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:28.860]   Stay.
[00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:36.740]   By the way, here is just, I think the chat room is giving me the actual physical award
[00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:39.100]   that they get, which.
[00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:41.420]   Wow, it's not.
[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:42.580]   Being on Mac break?
[00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:43.580]   It's not that.
[00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:47.820]   This is the App Store Award.
[00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:50.460]   It looks like a Mac mini or maybe, you know what?
[00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:54.580]   This could be a prototype aluminum case for next generation Apple TV.
[00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:55.740]   It should be a Mac mini.
[00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:58.660]   They should get a functional Mac mini that's just coated blue.
[00:21:58.660 --> 00:21:59.660]   Yeah.
[00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:00.660]   Overstuck.
[00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:01.660]   Yeah.
[00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:02.660]   Something with the DVD slot on it.
[00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:03.660]   It's aluminum.
[00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:04.660]   It's thick.
[00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:06.060]   It doesn't look too heavy.
[00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:07.060]   It's probably hollow.
[00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:09.860]   I think I'm having a neurological episode.
[00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:10.860]   What are we looking at?
[00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:11.860]   What's happening?
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:14.460]   The App Store Award, they did Apple TV.
[00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:15.460]   Oh, I see.
[00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:16.460]   I get it.
[00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:17.460]   They gave it to Disney.
[00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:21.380]   Yeah, and the iPhone app of the year is Wake Out and this is the guy who created Wake
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:22.380]   Out.
[00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:37.220]   You really look like an
[00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:44.220]   Apple TV.
[00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:45.220]   Oh my god.
[00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:46.220]   Oh my god.
[00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:47.220]   Let's take a break.
[00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:48.220]   I do.
[00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:50.420]   There are new Apple products and I really should start the show with those but I just,
[00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:53.380]   I'm so angry about what's going on with AT&T.
[00:22:53.380 --> 00:23:03.660]   I just, you started, let's see, I have six pages of you on Mac break weekly actually.
[00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:04.660]   Look at this.
[00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:05.660]   Wow, look at that.
[00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:06.980]   Look at all of these.
[00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:10.300]   You can actually do a search by name.
[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:16.060]   So your first Mac break, you first appeared on Net at Night, February 21st, 2006 with Amber.
[00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:19.340]   Wow, yes, that was really cool with Amber.
[00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:20.340]   I remember that.
[00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:26.980]   And then shortly thereafter in July of the same year you started showing up on Mac break.
[00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:28.540]   Pretty consistently I think.
[00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:30.780]   And then we did those videos in the studio.
[00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:31.860]   Oh, that's what these are.
[00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:32.860]   Those are the videos.
[00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:33.860]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:34.860]   Yeah.
[00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:36.340]   You made my hair, you made my hair lay down.
[00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:39.180]   I think that was Alex.
[00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:43.180]   You were on the third episode of Mac break weekly, the third episode.
[00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:44.180]   What?
[00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:45.180]   Yeah.
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:46.180]   It's crazy.
[00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:47.180]   August 2006.
[00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:50.020]   Is that the one where somebody made a backpack out of an SE?
[00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:53.060]   Probably that's how long ago it was.
[00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:55.220]   Oh my god.
[00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:56.220]   Now you.
[00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:57.220]   It's all coming back to me.
[00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:00.300]   It's all coming back like a, the hot kiss at the end of a week.
[00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:02.660]   Yeah, like a flashback, like an acid flashback.
[00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:03.660]   Yeah.
[00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:04.660]   Last Mac break.
[00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:05.740]   Lee was 2010.
[00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:10.820]   So you had a four year run episode two, two, one, then you've appeared a couple of times
[00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:14.500]   since then episode two, two, one, so it's been 10 years.
[00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:15.500]   Welcome back.
[00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:16.500]   We missed you.
[00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:17.500]   It's nice to be here.
[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:20.860]   Our show today brought to you by Twilio.
[00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:22.260]   You don't have to talk into your wallet.
[00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:28.500]   If you want to communicate with your customers where they are, Twilio makes it easy.

[00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:42.340]   countries.

[00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:52.380]   percent up a time.
[00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:58.420]   Let me give you some examples of people who use Twilio Shopify uses Twilio Flex to run
[00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:01.860]   their global contact center with more than a million customers.
[00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:05.100]   Flex is Twilio's programmable contact center solution.
[00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:08.780]   Blue Apron uses Twilio's Send Grid to send out their newsletters.
[00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:10.780]   You get the newsletters right from Blue Apron.
[00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:12.940]   When you log in Netflix, I hope you're using two factor.
[00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:14.180]   If you are, you're using Twilio.
[00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:20.380]   In fact, I use Twilio's Authy as my two factor app all the time everywhere I go.
[00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:23.980]   Ever order food or a ride from Lyft or Uber?
[00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:24.980]   You know that text message?
[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:27.060]   Your driver's on the way?
[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:28.060]   Twilio.
[00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:29.060]   Twilio.
[00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:33.380]   Product and operations teams use Twilio to create new ways to communicate with their
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:38.900]   users in their applications, inside your applications, ranging from account notifications
[00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:40.260]   with text messaging.

[00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:47.300]   Twilio Flex for customer service teams.

[00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:53.300]   It's built by developers for developers, which means you don't have to be a specialized
[00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:58.300]   telecom network engineer to have access to all the superpowers the network will offer
[00:25:58.300 --> 00:25:59.300]   you.
[00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:02.740]   You just need to know how to build web apps, a few lines of code, and you can build an
[00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:06.940]   app that to text, call, chat, and video conference.
[00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:11.500]   Everybody knows the best way to do this is Twilio.

[00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:23.220]   To learn more today, Twilio.
[00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:24.460]   It's time to build.
[00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:26.460]   It's time to build.
[00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:27.940]   All right.
[00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:31.220]   This morning, press releases from Apple.
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:38.580]   I had heard there was a tweet, a rumor that there'd be a new Apple TV today.
[00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:40.820]   I guess it could still happen, Renee, right?
[00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:41.820]   No.
[00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:42.820]   No.
[00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:44.500]   This is driving me crazy.
[00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:47.900]   What happened was after Jon Prosser became popular, a bunch of different Twitter accounts
[00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:51.580]   popped up, called like Leaks Apple, all these different things.
[00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:53.460]   They have no track record, no credibility.
[00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:55.020]   They're totally anonymous.
[00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:56.460]   They are thirst traps.
[00:26:56.460 --> 00:27:01.460]   And yet a bunch of websites that I like, that I respect, that I appreciate started blogging
[00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:02.460]   them.
[00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:06.420]   I'm guessing because they're under immense pressure in 2020 to get as many views as they can.
[00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:08.100]   And then YouTubers picked them up.
[00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:10.540]   And then I look in there on the lightest tech tip show.
[00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:13.300]   And no, you've got like this person has no track record.
[00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:15.140]   Please stop doing this.
[00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:22.420]   Oh, no new Apple TV, but the long rumored AirPods Max came out.
[00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:30.500]   But before I tell you all the features, cut to the bottom line, $549.
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:31.500]   Whoa.
[00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:32.500]   That seems a lot.
[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.500]   That's the cheapest you can get on there.
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:35.500]   That's a lot of money.
[00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:36.500]   That's a lot.
[00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:37.660]   It's Merlin.
[00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:38.660]   That's a lot of money.
[00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:39.660]   It seems expensive.
[00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:40.660]   Wow.
[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:42.220]   How much are they Bose Quiet Comforts?
[00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:43.820]   Because that's what they're going up against, right?
[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:46.020]   They're all between they're all like 300 350.
[00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:51.220]   The Sony is there are headphones that are more expensive than this.
[00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:53.540]   You can spend a ludicrous amount of money on audio.
[00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:55.980]   You can buy a million dollar setups and they'll all sell you accessories.
[00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:58.700]   I'll be the last person to criticize expensive headphones.
[00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:04.340]   I have a pair of very expensive high-fi man headphones that are great because instead
[00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:08.260]   of buying a very, very fancy stereo, if you get really, really good headphones and a good
[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:10.180]   input, you can get great sound.
[00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:14.220]   And so these high-fi men, which are magnetic planar technology, sound great.
[00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:16.180]   But that's not what these are.
[00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:17.380]   And most people don't know those.
[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:20.100]   The biggest issue for me with this is most people have no idea that those headphones
[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:21.100]   exist.
[00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:23.580]   For most people, the high-end are like the Sony's and the Bose.
[00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:28.100]   And for Apple, Apple, they look at as an affordable luxury brand.
[00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:32.020]   And then when Apple only introduces the high-end, like if they only introduce the Mac Pro and
[00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:37.620]   there's no Mac Mini or they only have an iPhone XS and it's not the iPhone 11, you feel like
[00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:42.300]   that compact has been broken and they're only giving you the luxury and you want them and
[00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:44.900]   you can't afford them and you get really angry, really fast.
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:46.980]   ScooterX says, "No, come on, guys.
[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:47.980]   It's simple.
[00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:53.460]   Buy a Mac Pro and a Pro Display XDR on your Apple card and the cash back, you could buy
[00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:54.460]   the headphones free."
[00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:58.060]   I mean, they're computationally, like they have a bunch of technology inside them that
[00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:03.460]   is expensive, but people aren't used to paying for the accelerometer and the gyroscope and
[00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:10.340]   the eight different microphones and the there's two H1 Apple Silicon 10-core audio processors.
[00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:12.660]   Nobody who buys the headphones is used to be a great company.
[00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:14.780]   Each cup has its own 10-core processor.
[00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:18.620]   It's own 10-core system in package like an iPhone.
[00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:22.780]   See, that's the problem that Apple's up against.
[00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:27.500]   I think the HomePod really proved that nobody is impressed with all the stuff you put into
[00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:28.740]   the press release.
[00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:33.620]   All they care about is maybe you put $1,000 worth of incredible technology into this.
[00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:39.340]   If it only sounds $8 more expensive than something that costs half as much, you lose.
[00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:45.780]   I think that most people are going to regard this as a set of headphones for an appositive
[00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:48.260]   way for audio muggles.
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:51.420]   People who are just like, "I want headphones that sound good.
[00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:52.420]   I want them to be.
[00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:54.260]   You have really good noise canceling.
[00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:57.780]   I want them to sound really, really great."
[00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:04.140]   Once you get into the rarefied era of $550, yes, there are headphones that cause that much
[00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:06.340]   and more, but these are for the audio files.
[00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:10.740]   I'm not sure if the audio files are going to think that these headphones are in their
[00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:11.740]   class.
[00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:13.540]   Well, it remains to be seen.
[00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:14.540]   But I just…
[00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:19.620]   That's the question is do these sound $550 good?
[00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:21.340]   If they did, I don't care about the technology.
[00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:22.340]   They've got to sound…
[00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:24.180]   You may have that much brand cache.
[00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:25.860]   Like will people find them just to wear them?
[00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:26.860]   Well, look at things.
[00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:27.860]   Not just…
[00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:28.860]   These come in five…
[00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:29.860]   Go ahead, show the…
[00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:30.860]   Show John…
[00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:31.860]   Yeah.
[00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:32.860]   Five gorgeous colors.
[00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:35.860]   They do look a little like an Altoids tin.
[00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:37.260]   They're a little more rounded.
[00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:38.620]   So, get this, Leo.
[00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:43.940]   The cups were made to exactly match the iPad Air and the bands were made to match exactly
[00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:46.780]   the iPhone 12 so that they would be…
[00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:48.340]   Regardless of which one you had, they would match both of them.
[00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:50.420]   And the stem was made to match your Apple Watch.
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:53.420]   In fact, that could be an Apple Watch on the side right there.
[00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:54.420]   Yeah.
[00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:57.460]   Now, they're wired and wireless, which at least they are…
[00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:59.380]   You could plug them in, which I think…
[00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:00.740]   Wired sold separately.
[00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:01.740]   What?
[00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:02.740]   You don't even get a jack?
[00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:08.900]   You've got to like the USB-C cord, but if you want the lightning to USB 3.5 cord,
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:10.460]   I think it's like 35 bucks.
[00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:11.460]   Oh, that's just insulting.
[00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:12.460]   No, no, Charlie.
[00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:15.420]   Someone said 10 bucks for every millimeter.
[00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:17.420]   It's just insulting.
[00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:18.420]   Yeah.
[00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:20.820]   Because if you're on a…
[00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:24.300]   No one who cares about audio fidelity is going to listen wirelessly.
[00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:26.220]   It's a convenience, not a…
[00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:27.220]   It doesn't…
[00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:28.220]   Even aptX.
[00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:29.220]   I don't…
[00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:30.220]   They don't even…
[00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:31.220]   Do they do aptX in the iPhone yet?
[00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:32.220]   I don't even think they do…
[00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:33.220]   They do their own thing.
[00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:34.220]   They do their own thing.
[00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:35.220]   Yeah.
[00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:36.220]   Okay.
[00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:41.020]   The only thing that I think counteracts with that a little bit is that I think…
[00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:42.900]   If there are people who regard it not just as an…
[00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:44.220]   Ooh, this is the Apple thing.
[00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:45.220]   This is the…
[00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:46.220]   I'm an Apple fan.
[00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:47.220]   I like Apple style.
[00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:51.980]   There are people that will think of it as not just as a good $300 pair of headphones,
[00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:56.260]   but as maybe a $250 fashion accessory on top of it.
[00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:59.420]   Because I think the industrial design really bears that out.
[00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:05.100]   Look, they actually stitched the L and the R into the fabric of the cup.
[00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:06.100]   No.
[00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:08.780]   There was a rumor that a bunch of features got cut and one of them was that it would
[00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:11.380]   be able to automatically detect which of yours it was on.
[00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:12.380]   It wouldn't matter.
[00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:13.380]   Yeah.
[00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:14.380]   But it sounds like that was one of the features that got cut.
[00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:15.380]   So this…
[00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:16.380]   This stenciling is…
[00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:17.380]   Quick!
[00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:18.380]   Quick!
[00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:19.380]   Can you weave an L or an R into the cup?
[00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:20.380]   Quick!
[00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:21.380]   It's funny.
[00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:24.620]   They learn sourdough and they learn weaving.
[00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:28.420]   You've got artisanal, Brooklyn artisanal weavers making the cups.
[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:36.100]   One of the challenges for Apple is that you discover over time, if you're a little bit
[00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:41.380]   of a power user, that there's a lot that's sort of non-obvious things that these devices
[00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:43.820]   do where it isn't really…
[00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:45.700]   It is apples and oranges in a lot of ways.
[00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:48.140]   I think the HomePod is a good example of that.
[00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:54.820]   Like I've got an old regular HomePod Prime and it really got one down here and it sounds
[00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:56.340]   it does sound amazing.
[00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:59.380]   When you hook it up to the TV, getting all the…
[00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:01.180]   Which you could finally do.
[00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:02.180]   Yeah.
[00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:03.180]   Right.
[00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:04.180]   Which you cannot do with the mini.
[00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:08.700]   But I mean like so for example stuff like I maybe non-obvious to somebody who's just
[00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:12.940]   ordering off of Amazon or whatever that like okay you're also going to get that ability
[00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:16.020]   to get like at most quote unquote through this speaker.
[00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:17.020]   Yes.
[00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:20.780]   But like again the integration with other Apple products.
[00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:25.220]   So it's also maybe non-obvious that this is now going to be your home kit hub.
[00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:28.020]   So the value proposition, I'm going to dumb phrase.
[00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:31.340]   The thing that they need to sell to people in some ways and communicate is not just that
[00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:34.500]   this thing sounds good but it works with all your other stuff.
[00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:40.580]   And to some extent some stuff works better with their stuff than other stuff.
[00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:43.340]   And that could be a source of frustration because now you're like okay this is my old
[00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:44.340]   phone charge.
[00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:47.140]   I'm going to talk with this new phone and that sounds silly to us.
[00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:48.140]   No.
[00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:49.140]   But that drives a lot of people.
[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:50.140]   This will work with the Apple stuff.
[00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:51.140]   This is on principle.
[00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:56.140]   Like you said with not including the cord there are people on some part of the spectrum
[00:33:56.140 --> 00:34:00.220]   who are like very upset about that stuff just on principle.
[00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:01.220]   Other people are not.
[00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:03.740]   And they'll drop the 500 bucks because it's going to work well with Siri because they're
[00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:04.740]   all in on Siri.
[00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:09.020]   But what Apple is selling you and someone's like selling.
[00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:11.740]   Not always succeeding at this kind of integrated lifestyle.
[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:12.740]   Like you're iCloud.
[00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:14.980]   Everything should work together.
[00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:19.940]   But I think that's very difficult to communicate to a garden variety consumer.
[00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:23.340]   You could just say well these are good headphones and they're loud.
[00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:24.340]   Go buy them.
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:28.740]   But if you don't know about let alone then utilize all the things that it can do with
[00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:29.900]   the other things.
[00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:34.020]   I love my Sony WHX them whatever the hell they are.
[00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:36.140]   But they're stupid as hell.
[00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:37.380]   They're so dumb.
[00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:40.580]   You can only be like synced to one thing at a time.
[00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:42.900]   It's a resequet you got to turn it all the way off long press.
[00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:46.980]   Anybody have these the WH the nice Sony ones.
[00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:50.300]   They sound great once they work but getting them to work is just really not fun.
[00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:51.780]   Bluetooth is in my room.
[00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:53.940]   I don't like wireless headphones for that reason.
[00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:56.500]   You can also do the wire but I just think that's a big challenge.
[00:34:56.500 --> 00:35:00.340]   I imagine for Apple is like working across business units with people to try and figure
[00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:04.580]   out how we sell this to people as part of this bigger thing we want you to do.
[00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:07.180]   It's even more complicated because they own beats.
[00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:12.660]   So you have to make something distinguished from the beats products.
[00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:18.380]   You want to charge 550 bucks but you're not really I don't know if you're really I mean
[00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:21.100]   these headphones have features every audio file looks for.
[00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:24.660]   For instance as you're listening to music it will read you incoming text messages.
[00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:26.820]   What more could you want?
[00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:28.100]   I don't think they're selling this.
[00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:29.820]   I think you're exactly right.
[00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:37.180]   You're selling this to a technology first person who wants it to.
[00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:38.980]   I have to know the Apple brand.
[00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:45.380]   It's like we're in World of Warcraft and you get the enchanted armor with the enchanted
[00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:46.940]   helmet and the enchanted sword.
[00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:52.380]   You want the whole the whole kit and so I mean sure there I bet you there are Apple
[00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:55.380]   people who have all of the above.
[00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:58.700]   I know I see my card feed this morning was filled with pre-order picture.
[00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:03.060]   It just one after the rumor is there's a lower.
[00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:06.060]   It's a rumor there's supposed to be a lower end version of these two like if you think
[00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:09.780]   about the Apple watch without the sport aluminum version it's too ridiculously priced.
[00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:13.860]   When you think about the home pod now compared to the home pod mini Apple has been fairly
[00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:18.740]   good at having that like the iPhone 12 versus the max the iPhone 11 was way better.
[00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:23.340]   You know received them the thousand dollar phones but they just they didn't ship the
[00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:27.140]   sport version at the same time and I think that's also a bothers people because if they
[00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:31.460]   saw this said yeah there's a fancy metallic looking one with nice finishes and all this
[00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:34.380]   and that's you know $550 in good for you.
[00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:36.820]   I'm buying the $250 one and I'm happy.
[00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:42.580]   Do you think people now still buy air pods with the AirPods pro in the market like do
[00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:46.860]   people look at the AirPods and go yeah for a hundred bucks more I'll get the pro version.
[00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:48.420]   Because for kids.
[00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:49.420]   I bet for kids.
[00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:50.420]   Yeah.
[00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:52.460]   The other part of this is yeah.
[00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:56.420]   I hope this is the stupidest thing that I say today but another way to look at this
[00:36:56.420 --> 00:37:01.900]   is headphones now you know in a pandemic where people aren't really going places.
[00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:06.300]   Yeah you need you need headphones for like think outside of our circle.
[00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:10.180]   Actually you want them because your roommates are saying turn the music down.
[00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:12.020]   You're living with other people.
[00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:16.580]   I wonder if they feel like I can do that price point because the kind of people who are going
[00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:22.620]   to buy costly headphones when they don't have anywhere to go much might be the people more
[00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:23.620]   likely to pay a little bit more.
[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:26.700]   I don't know if they need to make it on the train you wouldn't wear these on the bus.
[00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:28.380]   I just think about losing stuff.
[00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:33.300]   I mean like or like getting out of a lift in one of my AirPods with back in the day picking
[00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:34.460]   my kid up from school.
[00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:35.460]   Oh it's awful.
[00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:40.340]   It just perfectly bounced off my chest down and here's me.
[00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:47.500]   Hang on as the car is driving away is perfectly placed for the wheel to go right over it.
[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:51.180]   I'm like I don't know man I'm forever trying to find stuff I've lost.
[00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:52.180]   I wouldn't want to lose 500.
[00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:56.060]   How many AirPods have you bought?
[00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:57.860]   I think I bought four.
[00:37:57.860 --> 00:37:59.620]   Yeah right.
[00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:01.620]   Exactly.
[00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:04.700]   It's testimony to the fact because Apple sells them onesie-toucy.
[00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:05.700]   You can buy.
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:07.740]   I really like them stuff.
[00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:08.740]   I really do.
[00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:11.540]   We're in the AirPods for right now.
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:12.460]   These are beautiful.
[00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:15.180]   I think these actually look really nice.
[00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:17.180]   I bet they're very comfortable.
[00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:21.060]   I don't like a medical appliance.
[00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:25.940]   It looks like something like when your doctor walks in with that you're like oh no.
[00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:26.940]   Oh god.
[00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:27.940]   It's not an air-mechanical.
[00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:30.780]   It's an ill-fist please.
[00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:35.140]   The procedure will begin shortly.
[00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:36.140]   Like that cup.
[00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:38.100]   That cup is made of memory foam so it'll go- it'll- it'll- it'll- it'll- it'll- it'll
[00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:42.660]   try to seal around your ear to make an acoustic seal so it can do the computational audio.
[00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:46.620]   But if like me you're wearing glasses and it can't seal you know some of the low end
[00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:47.620]   is escaping.
[00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:50.220]   It's got a microphone inside to detect what you're hearing.
[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:51.220]   Oh my god.
[00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:54.300]   And then it will adjust to compensate for any audio leakage that's happening because
[00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:56.460]   of glasses or something else that you're wearing.
[00:38:56.460 --> 00:39:00.460]   So they're doing I think they said two some ridiculous amount of millions of calculations
[00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:01.460]   per second on audio.
[00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:04.100]   That's why you need a 10 core processor in each ear cup.
[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:05.100]   Yeah.
[00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:08.300]   Well the other AirPods have the same processor but they're only using two of the cores.
[00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:10.260]   So it scales differently.
[00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:13.740]   Does the microphones do anything super special?
[00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:18.700]   Yeah so they I mean they have the bunch of microphones and normally they'll just react
[00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:22.980]   but they have one microphone that's listening for basic noise cancellation and they've added
[00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:26.340]   an extra microphone that's listening just for wind because they found that wind was
[00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:29.060]   something that this goes back to the AirPods Pro.
[00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:32.420]   Wind was a particular annoyance for people so they added an extra microphone just to
[00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:34.180]   detect and cancel out wind sound.
[00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:37.180]   Wind bothers my wife a lot especially at night.
[00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:38.660]   She doesn't like that.
[00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:42.460]   So this is this is for who?
[00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:45.580]   Should I mean you know what this game this could be a game on the show.
[00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:47.660]   Trick Leo into buying these.
[00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:49.660]   Oh we just got to wait.
[00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:50.660]   We just got to wait.
[00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:54.140]   I mean the most basic thing Leo you need it for your work.
[00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:56.020]   No no no no no.
[00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:57.020]   My work is bright.
[00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:58.020]   Try to work.
[00:39:58.020 --> 00:39:59.020]   I can't.
[00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:03.700]   In fact the reason I can't buy this is because we don't have any money so that's not going
[00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:04.700]   to work.
[00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:07.740]   So you're the secret Santa and you truly owe me.
[00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:09.140]   Oh there you go.
[00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:10.140]   No pressure.
[00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:13.940]   I should tell Lisa this is what I want for Christmas.
[00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:14.940]   So who is it for?
[00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:15.940]   Is that the question?
[00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:22.220]   Or is is should I get excited about a unique dual neo-dynamic ring magnet motor?
[00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:23.220]   Sounds good.
[00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:25.220]   How it's rare.
[00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:26.780]   It's rare earth.
[00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:27.780]   It's rare earth.
[00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:28.780]   It's rare earth.
[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:32.660]   You don't know how many children barefoot children in Botswana were involved in the
[00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:33.900]   manufacturer this.
[00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:37.380]   It could have been you know that's expensive stuff.
[00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:42.420]   Actually did Apple say now that they're getting their rare earth in economically and
[00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:49.420]   sustainable ways.
[00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:52.820]   Does it say if it does the spatial thing?
[00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:54.340]   Yes it does spatial.
[00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:55.340]   It's spatial.
[00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:56.340]   I think that is magic.
[00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:59.300]   I mean there's not much stuff you can use it for right now.
[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:04.020]   If I were to watch in the Lord of the Rings on the TV and it would give me atmos in my
[00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:05.020]   head.
[00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:06.020]   It's different.
[00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:07.020]   It's different.
[00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:08.020]   So the TV is static.
[00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:09.020]   It doesn't move.
[00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:12.380]   And the air pods are different because so the TV you're sitting in front of the TV and
[00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:15.700]   regardless of how you move you expect it to come from the TV.
[00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:16.700]   But with the...
[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:19.180]   You find yourself doing this a lot to test it out.
[00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:23.260]   But the crazy part is I turned it and I finally got the firmware update.
[00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:24.940]   I was so excited to try this.
[00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:27.540]   And you notice how it's cool when you go it's not working.
[00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:28.540]   Honestly.
[00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:30.860]   Because at first you go like oh it's not working.
[00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:32.460]   Which means it's so subtle.
[00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:34.820]   But you do this and you're like ah that's a witch.
[00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:36.020]   There's a witch in my iPad.
[00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:37.020]   What's happening?
[00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:39.180]   But it sounds so freaking cool.
[00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:41.500]   And it doesn't feel like a trick.
[00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:42.980]   Like those kinds of things.
[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:47.980]   It's sort of like when 3D movies came out and you could get a TV they mentioned this
[00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:49.900]   on the bike check podcast recently.
[00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:54.620]   Used to be there was like a 3D button where it's simulate 3D on a non 3D film.
[00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:56.460]   And you're like that's not really the thing.
[00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:58.060]   That ain't it chief.
[00:41:58.060 --> 00:41:59.380]   But we put these things in.
[00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:01.020]   You're watching a movie.
[00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:02.940]   It sounds amazing.
[00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:05.180]   I mean subtle in the best possible way.
[00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:06.180]   You've tried it.
[00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:07.180]   Everybody's tried it here?
[00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:08.180]   I have not.
[00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:11.180]   I have AirPods Prose but somewhere.
[00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:12.900]   You can't find them.
[00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:17.460]   Because you've got the sensors in the AirPods and you've got them in the device.
[00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:21.460]   And so the gyroscopes and accelerometers communicate with each other.
[00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:24.100]   And if you're moving the iPad like let's say you're watching like this and then you
[00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:25.340]   lean back.
[00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:28.100]   Your expectation now is that the audio or you're just moving it sideways.
[00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:30.380]   The audio should still come from the person speaking.
[00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:33.940]   The center channel should still be the relative not absolute center channel then.
[00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:37.380]   So as you move it around it is adjusting where the audio is coming from.
[00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:40.180]   So that it still feels like it's coming from the device you're holding.
[00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:43.900]   Which just doesn't have to happen on a television set because that's a big static object.
[00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:45.820]   And it really messes with your brain at first.
[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:48.220]   And then once your brain locks onto it.
[00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:50.780]   That's your new expectation or everything else sounds broken.
[00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:55.980]   I went into my fancy 4K movies that I had on an iOS device.
[00:42:55.980 --> 00:43:00.140]   And I think I was doing Spider-Man into the Spider-Verse.
[00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:03.140]   And it was pretty trippy first time.
[00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:04.140]   So it's like surround.
[00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:06.740]   It gives you surround sound but they're in your headphones.
[00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:09.400]   - Relative, relative, a spatial audio, yeah,
[00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:10.880]   so relative atmos basically.
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.780]   - Relative to what?
[00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:14.920]   - Relative to where you're holding the device
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:15.740]   and turning your head.
[00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:19.100]   So if your head turns, the device stays spatially where it is.
[00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:21.180]   - Well who cares about that?
[00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:22.000]   - Yeah, that was the error.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.900]   - 'Cause it really sounds like it's in the room with you.
[00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:24.740]   It really sounds--
[00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:26.600]   - But it is in the room with you.
[00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:27.460]   Wait a minute!
[00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:30.400]   - It's like my preference is,
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:32.020]   one of the reasons why I put headphones on
[00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:34.960]   is so that it doesn't matter like where my head is
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:38.540]   where I'm turning relative to the actual device itself.
[00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:40.200]   They'll always get beautiful,
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:42.460]   like standard balance separation.
[00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:45.800]   So it's a wonderful piece of technological magic,
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:48.340]   but in terms of placing the audio,
[00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:50.580]   as though it has the illusion of originating
[00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:51.980]   from the device is playing from,
[00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:53.900]   that's not something that I really value.
[00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:56.980]   - You know what stays in place when you move your head around?
[00:43:56.980 --> 00:43:59.220]   TV speakers, final.
[00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:00.060]   - How are you gonna say final?
[00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:01.580]   - Yeah, final.
[00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:05.440]   - I mean, so you see, I thought it was gonna simulate
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:08.320]   a surround system with the left,
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:11.280]   behind me and up above me and, oh it does do that.
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:12.120]   - Yep, that's the part.
[00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:12.960]   - In addition to that--
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:13.960]   - It's hard to describe, it's depth.
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:16.800]   It really, it's, I mean, the words you're using
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:18.520]   remind me of like, oh it's quadriphonic.
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:19.560]   It sounds like it's all around you.
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:20.400]   - Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:22.160]   - And that's true to an extent, but it's just more like,
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:25.000]   it sounds very, it sounds, whatever room,
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.880]   the room sound, what do you imagine the room
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:27.800]   you're watching on TV?
[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:29.400]   That's like what it sounds like.
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:31.200]   And it doesn't feel gimmicky to me.
[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:33.420]   I mean, obviously everybody's got their own preferences,
[00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:36.580]   but I think it's amazing and I can't wait.
[00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:39.060]   I can't, that alongside like being able to add
[00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:42.740]   a second pair of iPods, like when my kid and I are watching,
[00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:45.380]   you know, the kind of media that my wife would just assume
[00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:47.620]   we not be watching, it's gonna be really cool
[00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:49.700]   to get to put those in and watch that.
[00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:52.380]   - I was thinking, I could pair these to my Apple TV, right?
[00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:53.940]   And I could have two sets.
[00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:56.820]   So my wife and I could both be wearing headphones
[00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:58.900]   while we're watching TV, which is something--
[00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:03.240]   - No spatial audio on Apple TV yet, but I think that's--
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:05.400]   - Oh, really, you only get spatial audio?
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:06.400]   - No, it's only on iOS device.
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:07.560]   - That's the frustrating.
[00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:08.720]   - It does the app most, but not,
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:09.720]   so this is where people get confused.
[00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:13.120]   It does the app most, but it doesn't do the relativistic thing
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:14.600]   because the TV never moves.
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:16.720]   So if you just move around, you don't expect
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:19.000]   where the source of the audio to be moving.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.920]   But if you're watching on your iPad and you move it,
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:24.600]   it still wants to come from the same position for you.
[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:27.800]   - You're not convincing me yet, boys.
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:30.900]   And it's been easy to explain to consumers.
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:33.340]   - Exactly, I didn't even know that.
[00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:35.500]   - You know how you wish your TV moved?
[00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:36.800]   Check it out, 500 bucks.
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:38.640]   How many you want?
[00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:39.480]   How many you want to be honest?
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:40.320]   You're free?
[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:41.480]   - You're not.
[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:45.180]   - Plus you'll be happy to know we're not ruining
[00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:48.320]   the environment by giving you a free cable or a free charger.
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:50.380]   - This is extremely, extremely rare Earth.
[00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:52.000]   We recommend that you get one for your desk,
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.160]   one for your house, one for each of your watts,
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:56.420]   your yachts, including the wax yacht.
[00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:57.860]   'Cause you're gonna want to have the separately,
[00:45:57.860 --> 00:45:58.760]   they'll charge separately.
[00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:00.340]   We have a separate charger for that.
[00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:02.040]   And then we have a charge adapter
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:05.380]   that will generate the feeling of power in a room.
[00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:08.660]   That's $35 for the dongle adapter.
[00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:11.300]   - I just want to point out, I could get 15,
[00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:16.300]   no, I'm sorry, 10 neodymium magnets for 15 bucks on Amazon.
[00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:20.100]   So you gotta be careful.
[00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:20.940]   Be careful.
[00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:22.460]   They use those magnets.
[00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:23.300]   - Do not swallow those.
[00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:24.300]   - I know, do not swallow them.
[00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:28.500]   - They will put, I have one here that is terrifying.
[00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:29.980]   - Maybe you can explain this to me.
[00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:32.940]   Why does this come with 10 screws?
[00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:34.260]   Here's the magnet.
[00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:37.060]   Show the, it comes with screws.
[00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:38.620]   What's that for?
[00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:40.800]   Is, oh, just screw them into something?
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:42.220]   Oh, I see you screw them into the wall.
[00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:44.060]   I thought there's some sort of magnetic trick.
[00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:45.860]   Okay, Merlin's got his magnets.
[00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:50.220]   - Okay, I, this one, usually I just keep it in the styrofoam.
[00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:52.300]   - How old are your kids?
[00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:53.380]   - My daughter's 13.
[00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:55.980]   - Okay, she's not gonna swallow these.
[00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:57.780]   Ooh, look at the size of that.
[00:46:57.780 --> 00:46:58.620]   - That is massive.
[00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:00.420]   - If you ever play with one of these, you get an eye,
[00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:01.980]   'cause like the little tiny ones,
[00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:04.940]   the size of like a little dot we use on the refrigerator.
[00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:05.780]   - Right.
[00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:06.940]   - But like you get two of these
[00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:08.740]   and you're gonna get pinched.
[00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:10.180]   Let's watch something non-dead.
[00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:11.660]   - Whack those things.
[00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:13.980]   You could, you could, just do your mic stand,
[00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:15.900]   put it on your mic stand.
[00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:17.340]   Isn't that metal?
[00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:19.140]   - That's, you might just roll the audio waves.
[00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:20.060]   - Look at that.
[00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:22.660]   Wait a minute, you can't get it off.
[00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:25.100]   - Well, I stick it to, yeah.
[00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:27.420]   So basically you could do like this.
[00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:29.100]   So that's a little bit of a, I guess.
[00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:29.940]   - Oh, it's a lot of them.
[00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:30.780]   - Oh man.
[00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:33.380]   - Not a great demo, but they're very fun magnets.
[00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:34.380]   They hold up very well.
[00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:36.380]   - He's kind of attached to his mic.
[00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:37.220]   - You could do this.
[00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:38.340]   You know what, by five.
[00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:39.180]   That's him.
[00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:40.020]   - Yeah.
[00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:42.380]   - If you, it's magnet and it's magnet storage,
[00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:43.820]   all of a sudden, it's fine.
[00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:45.100]   - What prompted you to buy?
[00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:45.940]   - I'm out.
[00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:48.140]   - That's like a one pound neodymium magnet.
[00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:50.620]   What prompted you to buy that?
[00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:53.740]   - You know, I'm a scientist.
[00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:54.580]   - All right.
[00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:56.260]   - I like to have these things around.
[00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:58.020]   And sometimes, you know, maybe you're trying to pick up
[00:47:58.020 --> 00:47:59.900]   some stuff in the rug or whatever.
[00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:01.580]   I, you know, you know, do that.
[00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:03.620]   You ever just get a flight of something from Amazon?
[00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:05.700]   Like, ooh, I want these in all the different sizes.
[00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:06.540]   - Yeah.
[00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:07.580]   - You did see this story.
[00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:10.060]   This actually kicked off the pandemic for me.
[00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:13.540]   Astrophysicists gets magnets stuck up nose
[00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:15.980]   while inventing coronavirus device.
[00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:20.700]   You wanted to build a necklace that would warn you
[00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:22.260]   when you touch your face.
[00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:28.340]   So it would sound an alarm on when you touch your face.
[00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:30.780]   When the mishap occurred on Thursday night,
[00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:33.980]   this is from the Guardian, the 27 year old astrophysicist
[00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:37.220]   who studies pulsars, looks like you, a scientist, Merlin.
[00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:38.380]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:39.220]   - Yeah.
[00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:40.060]   - Said he was trying to liven up the boredom
[00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:45.060]   of self-isolation with the four powerful neodymium magnets.
[00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:48.620]   I'm so electronica-proof, but really no experience
[00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:49.940]   or expertise in building.
[00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:51.220]   I gotta finish the story now, Merlin.
[00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:52.460]   Wait, hold on a sec.
[00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:54.420]   I had a part that detects magnetic fields.
[00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:56.220]   I thought if I built a circuit that could detect
[00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:58.660]   the magnetic field and we wore magnets on our wrists
[00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:00.060]   and it could set up an alarm if you brought it
[00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:02.740]   too close to your face, that's good thinking, right?
[00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:06.220]   However, he realized the electronic part he had
[00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:08.220]   did the opposite and would only complete a circuit
[00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:10.620]   when there was no magnet president.
[00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:13.820]   So he says, "I accidentally invented a necklace
[00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:16.940]   "that buzzes continuously unless you move
[00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:18.100]   "your hand close to your face."
[00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:19.700]   - Isn't it the opposite of a smoke alarm?
[00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:22.460]   Like it just tells us all the time and then when it stops,
[00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:23.300]   you know you're not-
[00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:24.820]   - After scraping that idea.
[00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:27.620]   - A necklace to remind you not to put magnets
[00:49:27.620 --> 00:49:28.460]   in your nose.
[00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:29.300]   - Well, wait a minute.
[00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:31.340]   - Is he related to the CEO of AT&T?
[00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:34.340]   - Yes, after scraping the idea, I was still a bit bored
[00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:35.260]   playing with the magnets.
[00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:37.500]   It's the same logic as clipping pegs to your ears.
[00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:39.140]   I clipped them into my earlobes.
[00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:42.900]   And I clipped them into my nostril
[00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:43.900]   and things went down.
[00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:47.060]   He'll pretty quickly, when I clipped the magnet
[00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:48.580]   to my other nostril,
[00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:50.980]   he placed two magnets inside his nostril
[00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:52.860]   and two on the outside.
[00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:55.900]   When he removed the magnets from the outside of his nose,
[00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:59.420]   two inside went stuck together.
[00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:03.980]   And then he used the remaining magnets to remove them.
[00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:06.140]   At this point, my partner who works at a hospital
[00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:07.420]   was laughing at me.
[00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:08.380]   I was trying to pull them out,
[00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:09.900]   but there's a ridge at the bottom of my nose.
[00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:11.100]   You can't get past.
[00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:12.580]   After struggling for 20 minutes,
[00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:14.380]   I decided to Google the problem.
[00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:15.900]   Found an article about an 11 year old boy
[00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:17.980]   who had the same problem, the solution was.
[00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:21.260]   Put more magnets in your nose.
[00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:22.620]   Oh, geez.
[00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:25.780]   To put on the outside to offset the pull
[00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:26.940]   from the ones inside,
[00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:28.820]   as I was pulling downward to try to move the magnets,
[00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:30.740]   they clipped onto each other, I lost my grip.
[00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:33.620]   And those two magnets ended up in my left nostril.
[00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:35.260]   The other one was in my right.
[00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:38.020]   At this point, and honestly,
[00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:40.740]   this is probably the only bright side of this.
[00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:43.060]   At this point, I ran out of magnets.
[00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:45.540]   Before attending the hospital,
[00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:46.980]   here comes the ambulance now,
[00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:49.180]   reared and attempted to use pliers to pull them out,
[00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:50.540]   but they became magnetized.
[00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:54.420]   The pliers became magnetized by the magnet inside his nose.
[00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:57.140]   Every time I brought the pliers close to my nose,
[00:50:57.140 --> 00:51:00.660]   my entire nose would shift through the pliers.
[00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:02.980]   And the pliers went inside the nose.
[00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:05.540]   It was a little bit painful at this point.
[00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:07.660]   Eventually, he showed up to the emergency room
[00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:09.100]   with about 18 pounds of stuff,
[00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:11.740]   including a refrigerator door on his nose.
[00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:13.020]   Exactly.
[00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:17.740]   So there's a scientist playing with magnets,
[00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:18.580]   just a word of warning.
[00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:20.980]   Well, you know, if you're gonna get into the magnet science
[00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:24.180]   racket, you know, my concern is that sounds like it might be
[00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:26.260]   a cover story for some kind of a sex thing.
[00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:27.660]   Maybe he's like a magnet guy.
[00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:28.860]   Maybe there was a little thing.
[00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:30.380]   North South, North South, North South.
[00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:31.300]   Yes.
[00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:34.580]   Fortunately, I ran out of magnets.
[00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:37.460]   I'm stunned by the size of that magnet you have, Merlin.
[00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:38.300]   I mean, that is--
[00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:40.100]   Yeah, you're sweet to say so.
[00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:40.940]   You're magnetized.
[00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:41.860]   Oh, so you will.
[00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:46.220]   I've never seen such a big magnet with a human.
[00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:49.300]   You might say that's one of the baby ones I've seen
[00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:50.700]   like bigger wide ones in thick.
[00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:52.420]   Oh, wow.
[00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:53.620]   Don't get those.
[00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:56.020]   So adaptive EQ.
[00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:58.500]   So that's what you were talking about,
[00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:02.260]   Renee, with the sound, adjust to the seal
[00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:05.460]   by measuring the sound signal that you're getting
[00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:08.340]   and adjusting the low and mid frequencies in real time.
[00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:10.300]   This is for computer geeks.
[00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:12.260]   It's not for audio files.
[00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:13.940]   Well, though, because there's no real EQ,
[00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:15.740]   because in order to do all the computational stuff,
[00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:18.460]   you can't deal with you moving knobs
[00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:19.700]   and levers around on your own.
[00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:20.300]   That would be bad.
[00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:22.100]   So there's no manual EQ anymore,
[00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:24.460]   which a lot of audio files hate.
[00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:25.380]   That's the very ideal.
[00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:26.660]   They want to control their music.
[00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:29.180]   Active noise cancellation.
[00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:31.420]   The AirPods are not pros are not super good
[00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:32.220]   at noise cancellation.
[00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:33.060]   Are they or are they?
[00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:34.180]   I don't know.
[00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:34.620]   You tell me.
[00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:35.180]   I think so.
[00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:35.580]   You think so?
[00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:37.380]   For an ear there, I think they're on par, yeah.
[00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:39.940]   Have you ever worn them on an airplane?
[00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:40.500]   Yes.
[00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:41.780]   And they cut the background?
[00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:42.740]   Pre-categorism.
[00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:43.260]   Yeah, pre-categorism.
[00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:45.220]   Yeah, I mean, you still hear the rumble of the engine
[00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:46.580]   and the roar, but you don't hear--
[00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:47.060]   It's not as bad.
[00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:49.020]   It takes the rough edges off of it.
[00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:50.380]   And it does the transparency mode.
[00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:52.020]   So if you do need to hear somebody talking to you,
[00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:53.940]   you can just press the button and it does that.
[00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:54.700]   Each ear cut.
[00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:57.660]   It's one of those things where you don't notice it a little bit
[00:52:57.660 --> 00:53:00.300]   when you turn it on, but you really notice
[00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:01.020]   when you turn it off.
[00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:03.180]   You're like, wow, this plane is really loud.
[00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:04.260]   Right.
[00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:05.980]   That's nice.
[00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:08.580]   Transparency mode with AirPods Max,
[00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:09.540]   that's the name of these things.
[00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:13.060]   Users can switch to transparency mode.
[00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:15.020]   Oh, that's the sound.
[00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:17.740]   Uses the microphone so that the ambient sound in while you're
[00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:18.340]   listening to music.
[00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:20.140]   That's what I'm doing right now, so I can hear myself
[00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:21.580]   without needing a monitor.
[00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:22.460]   Ah, yeah.
[00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:23.460]   OK.
[00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:24.020]   Good for that.
[00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:25.940]   Not so good for music.
[00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:30.420]   But I guess if you're running or you're wearing them outside.
[00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:32.340]   And then the spatial audio we talked about, which
[00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:35.860]   supports 5.1.7.1 and Dolby Atmos.
[00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:36.860]   Yes.
[00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:38.740]   OK.
[00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:40.300]   So what has that easy pairing?
[00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:43.420]   And I'm with you, Merlin, with the Sony's or anything else.
[00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:45.540]   Bluetooth is a nightmare.
[00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:49.300]   And Sony always wants to launch their app and do all the stuff.
[00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:51.540]   And I'm like, you know they're just gobbling through data.
[00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:53.860]   I mean, yeah, I'm listening to "Fountains of Wayne."
[00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:54.860]   Have fun selling that.
[00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:55.860]   Yeah, really.
[00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:58.780]   So it's so creepy to just turn it on.
[00:53:58.780 --> 00:54:00.420]   I just want to use the head.
[00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:02.140]   And then it's like, oh, you want to go in here?
[00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:04.620]   It'll understand when you're laying down or walking.
[00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:06.060]   And it's like, who cares?
[00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:08.060]   Yeah, change it.
[00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:09.340]   Jopra does that too with all of their things.
[00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:11.780]   It's really annoying.
[00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:13.780]   Although I have found with the AirPods, one of the reasons
[00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:15.580]   I stopped using them is--
[00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:17.380]   and these are going to do that too.
[00:54:17.380 --> 00:54:18.940]   They like to switch around.
[00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:20.540]   So they say you can be watching TV.
[00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:21.540]   They're promiscuous.
[00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:22.140]   You're promiscuous.
[00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:22.740]   You watch a TV.
[00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:23.780]   Your phone rings.
[00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:25.300]   You can suddenly-- well, switch the phone.
[00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:26.420]   You can have that conversation.
[00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:27.740]   And it'll switch back to the TV.
[00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:29.780]   If that all worked really well, I'd be great.
[00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:31.700]   But sometimes it does it anyway.
[00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:34.220]   And the wording on it, I find very confusing.
[00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:35.780]   Like, I'm not the sharpest knife in the drawer.
[00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:38.380]   But I've read and reread the instructions
[00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:40.260]   on that so many times on the iPhone.
[00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:42.020]   I'm still not sure which one I want.
[00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:42.460]   Right.
[00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:45.620]   Do I want the one where it always defaults to this device?
[00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:49.220]   But yeah, it is very upsetting sometimes.
[00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:52.740]   It's like when I forget that I've linked up all the home pods.
[00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:54.460]   And I think I'm just playing something for me.
[00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:55.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:56.460]   Oh, that's--
[00:54:56.460 --> 00:54:57.300]   Oh, that's--
[00:54:57.300 --> 00:55:01.300]   Oh, that's as hearing Stacey's mom at full blast.
[00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:01.860]   Yeah.
[00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:04.100]   Nice pull.
[00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:09.620]   This is the dopiest thing, the smart case.
[00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:13.460]   So this is a case that does not, in fact, hold the headphones.
[00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:17.180]   It just wraps gently around the cups so that they--
[00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:18.860]   and then there's a magnet, probably, in it,
[00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:21.540]   so that they can go into an ultra low-power state.
[00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:25.420]   They're claiming 20 hours of battery life.
[00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:27.300]   I don't know--
[00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:28.660]   I guess this makes--
[00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:29.100]   I don't know.
[00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:32.300]   I'm used to headphone cases for the whole headphones.
[00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:33.140]   I guess--
[00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:34.180]   Or to protect them, right?
[00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:35.660]   Right.
[00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:38.340]   A third-party opportunity, I think they're calling this.
[00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:38.940]   Yeah.
[00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:39.700]   Well, I have a few.
[00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:42.820]   Well, do you want to play the last one or two in this?
[00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:44.740]   Which is weird, but--
[00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:49.420]   So this is essentially a bra for your AirPods cups.
[00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:51.420]   I thought butts, but I guess it's going to depend.
[00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:52.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:55:52.940 --> 00:55:53.900]   It grew up so fast.
[00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:55.820]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:55:55.820 --> 00:55:57.700]   OK.
[00:55:57.700 --> 00:55:58.620]   So you're not sold, Leo.
[00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:00.100]   You're not going to sign a line in the audit?
[00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:01.220]   I think I probably should.
[00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:01.700]   Is that what I'm getting?
[00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:02.580]   Because here's the question.
[00:56:02.580 --> 00:56:04.180]   And I think anybody before they buy this,
[00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:07.020]   I wish you could go to an Apple store and listen before you
[00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:08.300]   buy it to really make sure that it's
[00:56:08.300 --> 00:56:10.580]   going to give you the audio quality you deserve
[00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:12.980]   if you're spending $550 on a pair of headphones.
[00:56:12.980 --> 00:56:14.980]   Or do you not buy this for the quality?
[00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:17.180]   I mean, for the AirPods Pro, they would let you try them,
[00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:18.100]   but they would clean them.
[00:56:18.100 --> 00:56:19.540]   And I think they would change the tips.
[00:56:19.540 --> 00:56:21.580]   And you can magnetically remove the cups on these
[00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:22.300]   and change them.
[00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:24.620]   And they'll replace them for like $70 if you damage them
[00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:25.380]   or something.
[00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:27.580]   But are they going to have an Apple store with a bag of cups?
[00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:29.860]   If somebody comes in, they put a fresh bear--
[00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:31.820]   a cups on the headphones so they can try them.
[00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:35.300]   People aren't going to be able to try them until after COVID.
[00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:37.100]   Leo, I'm going to guess that if you're not
[00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:40.540]   into stuff like Spatial Audio, these probably aren't for you.
[00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:43.900]   I would imagine that's a kind of a marquee feature.
[00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:47.900]   And Brazier aside, I think probably these are not for you.
[00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:50.740]   Because I could see why it's a very editorial decision,
[00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:51.900]   whether you'd like that or not.
[00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:53.220]   But I don't think these are for you.
[00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:54.900]   I think you should get some--
[00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:56.100]   Now I'm going to buy them.
[00:56:56.100 --> 00:56:56.700]   Answer your question.
[00:56:56.700 --> 00:56:57.220]   It worked.
[00:56:57.220 --> 00:56:57.900]   That worked.
[00:56:57.900 --> 00:56:59.660]   Very strategic.
[00:56:59.660 --> 00:57:01.540]   He went for the don't buy them, Leo.
[00:57:01.540 --> 00:57:04.300]   I'm a magnet scientist and a reverse psychologist.
[00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:06.260]   They aren't for you, Leo.
[00:57:06.260 --> 00:57:08.100]   Don't buy them.
[00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:10.100]   I'm-- what's wrong with--
[00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:11.900]   It's more of a Shelbyville, like you.
[00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:14.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:14.900 --> 00:57:17.380]   Oh, man.
[00:57:17.380 --> 00:57:18.780]   It's the monorail.
[00:57:18.780 --> 00:57:19.860]   I bought it.
[00:57:19.860 --> 00:57:20.300]   OK.
[00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:21.420]   North Haberbrook.
[00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:22.420]   Yeah.
[00:57:22.420 --> 00:57:23.420]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:26.820]   They're really-- it's not for you.
[00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:28.660]   Don't you tell me what's for me?
[00:57:28.660 --> 00:57:29.160]   Yeah.
[00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:30.060]   You know what I'm talking about.
[00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:30.860]   How about that?
[00:57:30.860 --> 00:57:32.700]   Not my internet parent.
[00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:34.780]   You're fired.
[00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:39.700]   What-- well, it's got free engraving.
[00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:41.860]   Yeah.
[00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:43.540]   That's how you know it's mine.
[00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:45.700]   You know it.
[00:57:45.700 --> 00:57:48.020]   Do you-- does it come with a chin strap so that--
[00:57:48.020 --> 00:57:50.100]   it'll make it a little bit harder for people on the subway
[00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:52.380]   just yank it off your head and run out the door with it?
[00:57:52.380 --> 00:57:53.700]   Yunk.
[00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:56.300]   Well, I don't think I'll be going on a subway anytime soon.
[00:57:56.300 --> 00:57:57.220]   So that's probably all right.
[00:57:57.220 --> 00:57:57.780]   I like the red.
[00:57:57.780 --> 00:57:58.740]   That looks the subway is close.
[00:57:58.740 --> 00:58:00.120]   We have a little-- we have a safe--
[00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:01.360]   we have to believe in the future.
[00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:03.960]   They wouldn't let us build a monorail here, unfortunately.
[00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:04.460]   Monorail.
[00:58:04.460 --> 00:58:04.960]   Monorail.
[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:05.460]   Monorail.
[00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:05.960]   Monorail.
[00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:08.160]   There's a lot of questions here.
[00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:10.360]   Like, for instance, how much is it going to cost
[00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:11.840]   to replace the battery and will they
[00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:14.000]   replace the battery on this?
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:14.360]   It's--
[00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:16.200]   As a service, they will.
[00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:17.000]   Yeah.
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:21.960]   So tell me again, it doesn't come with a wire at all
[00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:23.440]   or just doesn't come with the adapter.
[00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:26.480]   It comes with a lightning to USB-C.
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:28.000]   But that doesn't go into the headphone.
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:29.000]   That just charges--
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:29.800]   No.
[00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:30.820]   Yes.
[00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:32.980]   So if you want to listen wired, you
[00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:36.140]   have to buy an extra $30 dongle.
[00:58:36.140 --> 00:58:39.180]   Yeah, $35 for $3.5 million.
[00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:43.180]   A lightning to a stereo of mail check?
[00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:43.720]   Yes, it's $1.
[00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:44.460]   So is it standard?
[00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:48.820]   So if I had a mail to mail thing that I could plug into the lightning
[00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:52.460]   adapter that I got years ago when I could do that, right?
[00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:53.180]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:58:53.180 --> 00:58:54.380]   OK.
[00:58:54.380 --> 00:58:56.780]   But it wouldn't sound like a good audio in those--
[00:58:56.780 --> 00:58:58.160]   in those tiny-- that original thing
[00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:00.900]   that they sold with the iPhone 7, 8--
[00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:02.340]   I forget which ones they were, but they
[00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:03.660]   sold it for like two years.
[00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:04.780]   Those were really, really good.
[00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:06.400]   They had a really good converter in them
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:07.700]   to go from digital to analog audio.
[00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:08.620]   Oh my god.
[00:59:08.620 --> 00:59:13.580]   So it's going to ship in 12 to 14 weeks.
[00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:15.940]   Now it was much faster this morning.
[00:59:15.940 --> 00:59:18.140]   They sold out already.
[00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:18.980]   Yeah.
[00:59:18.980 --> 00:59:20.540]   So forget buying it for the holidays.
[00:59:20.540 --> 00:59:22.620]   12 to 14 weeks is like--
[00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:23.120]   That's fine.
[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:23.740]   --tends on the color too.
[00:59:23.740 --> 00:59:24.980]   I think blue went fastest.
[00:59:24.980 --> 00:59:28.940]   Oh, maybe because I'm Brian the pink one.
[00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:29.940]   I'm not buying it.
[00:59:29.940 --> 00:59:30.420]   I'm just--
[00:59:30.420 --> 00:59:30.940]   I'm looking--
[00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:31.660]   --roost gold.
[00:59:31.660 --> 00:59:34.500]   I'm just-- just to prove that it's worthy of me.
[00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:35.500]   Yeah.
[00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:36.000]   It's not for you.
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:36.740]   Add this to the bag.
[00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:38.420]   I'm waiting on Micah's review of the--
[00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:39.380]   of the pinks.
[00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:41.100]   Yeah, Micah wants the green, actually.
[00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:41.860]   He likes green a lot.
[00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:42.740]   Oh, that's true.
[00:59:42.740 --> 00:59:43.240]   Yeah.
[00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:46.260]   He's all over the-- he was very unhappy to see the green.
[00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:47.660]   I can't wait to hit the high--
[00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:49.700]   I can't wait to hit the high-five forums too.
[00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:53.180]   He's have someone methodically produce
[00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:55.180]   all kinds of charts and spectograms
[00:59:55.180 --> 00:59:57.300]   prove which color has the greatest
[00:59:57.300 --> 00:59:59.620]   like air around the mid-range, which
[00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:01.180]   is a mystical properties of the--
[01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:03.700]   Yeah, get the gold cable.
[01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:06.780]   No, I imagine Elsie is angry as the PC Master Race Forum
[01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:08.540]   was after M1 was announced.
[01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:12.980]   You know, I got so much hate for saying I like the M1.
[01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:15.140]   Yes, kind of stunned.
[01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:16.140]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:17.700]   I can only buy-- I tried to buy them all--
[01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:20.860]   all the colors, but only two can be purchased per customer.
[01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:21.340]   Yeah.
[01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:21.860]   Just because--
[01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:24.100]   I'd buy a much better job at stopping scammers
[01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:27.300]   than Sony or Nvidia or Michael.
[01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:31.540]   So the sky blue is March 5th.
[01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:34.020]   The silver is December 31st.
[01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:36.100]   You can have it for the new year.
[01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:38.300]   The green is March 5th.
[01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:40.140]   The space gray, the ugly colors you
[01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:42.700]   can get by the end of the year.
[01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:44.620]   Wow, they really-- so they sold out right away.
[01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:45.900]   Just shows you.
[01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:47.300]   Depends on any they made too.
[01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:49.180]   Yeah, well, they may have had five, we don't know.
[01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:51.260]   But given that these have been rumored
[01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:53.340]   and we even knew it was going to look like six months ago,
[01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:57.820]   I have a feeling they've been able to produce them, right?
[01:00:57.820 --> 01:00:58.940]   Or did you think it was--
[01:00:58.940 --> 01:01:00.780]   See, the rumor is that they had to change stuff
[01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:03.460]   at the last minute and we're not quite sure what that was,
[01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:04.380]   but they had features.
[01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:05.060]   And that happens.
[01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:06.900]   The difference now is people report on it.
[01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:08.700]   But back, commonly you lose--
[01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:09.020]   Oh, yeah.
[01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:10.540]   --because on your way to the 1.0.
[01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:12.180]   And then they show up at 2.0.
[01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:14.060]   Is there some of the FCC approval?
[01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:17.700]   Is that some of the-- you know, what happens or no?
[01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:20.060]   I think there was a moment that they had a gesture area
[01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:22.340]   and they switched that for the digital crown
[01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:23.620]   and that they were supposed to be--
[01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:25.140]   didn't matter which way you put them on.
[01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:26.540]   They were supposed to automatically detect that
[01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:27.420]   and that didn't work.
[01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:30.180]   So you had to have us all hand stitch our own L&R
[01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:30.820]   into the cups.
[01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:31.500]   Yeah.
[01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:33.100]   And they don't have to get FCC approval
[01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:34.980]   for the entire device just for the component.
[01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:38.180]   That produces the RF so it's possible it's using something
[01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:40.460]   that they've already gotten FCC approval for.
[01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:44.060]   That is not the only new thing Apple talked about today.
[01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:46.660]   No, no Apple TV, no air tags.
[01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:49.420]   Is air tags just dead in the water?
[01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:51.300]   And Samsung is going to ship theirs now.
[01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:52.660]   Like Samsung's heard them announced this,
[01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:54.940]   had the time to build their own version of it.
[01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:57.460]   And now they're going to ship it before Apple ship the air
[01:01:57.460 --> 01:01:58.660]   tags were finished last year.
[01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:01.340]   Yeah.
[01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:02.340]   Well, they are going to--
[01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:04.940]   Samsung's also copying the new AC adapter in the box thing.
[01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:05.940]   Just please stop.
[01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:07.580]   I need someone to take a stand.
[01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:09.780]   This cannot be allowed to be normalized.
[01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:13.780]   Apple Fitness Plus will launch in one week, December 14.
[01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:14.580]   They kind of had to.
[01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:15.820]   They said this year.
[01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:18.700]   So that's pretty much as close to the end of the year
[01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:20.540]   as you're going to get.
[01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:24.180]   Monday, you'll be able to start working out
[01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:26.380]   with your Apple Watch and your Apple TV.
[01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:29.580]   You could do high intensity interval training, hit,
[01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:34.460]   strength, yoga, dance, core, cycling, treadmill,
[01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:38.500]   rowing, and mindful cool down.
[01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:39.980]   And I think that the lay was probably
[01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:41.460]   they were recording all of these, right?
[01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:44.980]   We knew that this was going to have to happen.
[01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:46.020]   Yeah.
[01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:46.740]   I'm interested in this.
[01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:48.620]   I bought the Apple One package when they offered it.
[01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:51.660]   So I'll have this.
[01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:55.900]   I set up a rower in front of the TV just to see.
[01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:57.460]   I mentioned before I have the Peloton.
[01:02:57.460 --> 01:03:01.380]   So I like the idea of having a screen with a trainer running
[01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:03.620]   you through an exercise on a cycle.
[01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:05.580]   And I wanted to do something with a rower.
[01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:06.580]   We have a treadmill too.
[01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:07.700]   And it's going to be crossover.
[01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:09.980]   So like, different trainers will burst into each other's sets.
[01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:12.180]   It'll be like the Avengers Leo or a Mighty Marvel Team.
[01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:14.380]   Oh, please.
[01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:15.500]   I hope not.
[01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:17.580]   Hey, Bob, come try the throwing machine.
[01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:21.980]   This is a hot, this is a well-timed product because of COVID.
[01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:22.780]   Gyms are closed.
[01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:23.660]   People can't work out.
[01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:25.620]   So these, you know, all of these products
[01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:28.060]   are going through the roof mirror and all of those.
[01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:29.820]   I see that mirror add a lot.
[01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:30.260]   Yeah.
[01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:31.740]   There's a lot, a lot on cable news.
[01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:33.300]   And now that's owned by Lulu Lemon.
[01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:33.900]   Is that right?
[01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:37.100]   That's part of the reason I see it.
[01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:40.940]   Because it starts with a young lady in Lulu Lemon.
[01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:41.700]   Oh, I see.
[01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:41.980]   Pants.
[01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:43.060]   Yeah.
[01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:43.860]   That's cable.
[01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:44.380]   Yep.
[01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:46.220]   Yeah, it's kind of hard to turn away.
[01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:47.220]   I'm just saying.
[01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:48.220]   Here's the good looking--
[01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:51.300]   It's-- yes, Brian.
[01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:51.500]   Oh, no.
[01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:53.260]   I'm just going to say, I don't know.
[01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:55.860]   I mean, I guess I should pay more attention to the actual app.
[01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:58.020]   But it seems a little silly.
[01:03:58.020 --> 01:03:58.540]   It does.
[01:03:58.540 --> 01:04:00.020]   It seems-- I always think of when
[01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:04.860]   the wonderful episode of the Office, the dinner party,
[01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:06.100]   maybe the best episode of the Office--
[01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:06.740]   Absolutely.
[01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:07.180]   --US.
[01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:07.700]   Without doubt.
[01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:09.660]   When they go out to the garage--
[01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:11.700]   and remember, he's trying to get them to invest in Jan's
[01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:12.660]   candle company--
[01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:17.300]   his entire pile of old workout equipment, thigh masters,
[01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:19.620]   soloflex, both legs.
[01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:21.540]   I just-- everybody, he said like that mirror.
[01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:23.380]   It's like, well, I guess we still use it as a mirror.
[01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:23.940]   That's cool.
[01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:26.860]   We don't need to subscribe to our mirror even more so.
[01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:28.340]   It's a little mirror, mirror on the wall.
[01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:31.660]   And those ads imply that they can see you, which I don't think
[01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:32.180]   they can.
[01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:33.660]   I think they're prerecorded.
[01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:34.740]   But the ads imply--
[01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:36.180]   I like their hair like that.
[01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:37.580]   I know.
[01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:38.580]   You're not working on that.
[01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:40.300]   You're like a baby when you sleep.
[01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:42.020]   I don't think that's what I'd want.
[01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:44.740]   In my house is a two-way TV.
[01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:46.620]   It's a little 1984.
[01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:49.180]   Here's the good looking bunch of trainers,
[01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:54.420]   all just so happy to be coming into your house via TV--
[01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:56.340]   Apple TV, fitness plus.
[01:04:56.340 --> 01:04:57.540]   Do you have to have an Apple TV?
[01:04:57.540 --> 01:04:59.340]   I guess you do.
[01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:01.220]   I have Apple TV, iPad or iPhone.
[01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:02.580]   Oh, you could put it on--
[01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:04.380]   yeah, yeah, of course you could put an iPad on your iPhone.
[01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:05.180]   OK, that makes sense.
[01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:06.060]   But you need an Apple watch.
[01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:07.260]   You have to have an Apple watch.
[01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:08.820]   It's really a watch product.
[01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:10.820]   Yeah.
[01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:12.860]   OK.
[01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:16.140]   If I look suddenly buff and fit, you'll know why.
[01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:17.140]   Oh, we all are.
[01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:18.700]   We're going to come back into the new year,
[01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:19.900]   looking exactly like those models.
[01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:21.820]   Sorry, I don't think the lady with the pants
[01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:26.060]   comes with the mirror, Leo, just FYI.
[01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:27.380]   We had to get buff on your own.
[01:05:27.380 --> 01:05:30.460]   There's a saying.
[01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:31.140]   I can't remember it.
[01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:33.020]   And even if I could, I probably shouldn't say it
[01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:35.580]   about Lulu Lemon and how they're
[01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:38.780]   designed to make your bottom look good.
[01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:44.500]   And judging by that ad, they work.
[01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:46.500]   Sounds like it was named by Tom Brokaw.
[01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:48.940]   Whoa, whoa.
[01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:50.700]   It's a crowd-cutting company.
[01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:52.300]   Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:57.020]   We got to jump-- we got to jump to top Brokaw today.
[01:05:57.020 --> 01:05:59.260]   Who makes that mirror, Tom?
[01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:02.780]   Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:07.860]   I know an version from a company based in Scottsville, Arizona.
[01:06:07.860 --> 01:06:10.380]   It should not make fun of the poor man.
[01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:13.860]   Arnold-- Arnold-- Arnold Musical Spolesville, Michael Lulu.
[01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:13.860]   Hey.
[01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:22.020]   Those hollering gouts about Lulu Lemon, future,
[01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:24.140]   are regards to the finish.
[01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:24.940]   Lulu Lemon.
[01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:30.300]   All right, let's talk about oblivious DNS when we come back.
[01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:32.020]   Hey, so nice to have you back, Merlin.
[01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:33.220]   I really missed you.
[01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:34.100]   Really appreciated.
[01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:36.300]   Merlin's doing a lot of other people's podcasts.
[01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:37.660]   Actually, they're all yours, aren't they?
[01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:39.260]   That's the point.
[01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:42.540]   I just happen to have a warm place to use the toilet.
[01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:43.100]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:44.620]   I'll show up anyway, really.
[01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:45.540]   It's kind of--
[01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:48.900]   Well, anytime you want to be on the panel, we love having you.
[01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:52.860]   And we've got an empty seat just waiting for you.
[01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:57.180]   Andy and I go, I'll show here, WGBH Boston, and from Renee Ritchie.
[01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:58.580]   Renee Ritchie.
[01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:00.820]   I got to come up with something better than that.
[01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:02.140]   I just like when--
[01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:04.140]   From Mrs. Ritchie.
[01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:04.980]   Yeah, OK.
[01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:06.260]   Mr. and Mrs. Ritchie.
[01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:08.180]   My mom is watching Andy.
[01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:11.020]   I just like it also when the Merlin Cinematic podcast
[01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:13.460]   universe and the Jason Snell Cinematic podcast universe
[01:07:13.460 --> 01:07:14.500]   totally crossover.
[01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:14.980]   It's good.
[01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:17.860]   It's like those once in a lifetime Marvel DC crossovers.
[01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:18.460]   It's good.
[01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:21.060]   Oh, yes, exactly.
[01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:22.060]   Yeah.
[01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:23.060]   Really?
[01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:24.420]   Like a battle world thing.
[01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:25.060]   Yeah.
[01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:26.060]   Oh, that guy.
[01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:26.420]   Amazing.
[01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:27.700]   We could get Snell on with you.
[01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:29.180]   It's easy.
[01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:30.500]   That we can do.
[01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:31.940]   That's like 30 podcasts in the world.
[01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:32.940]   You know.
[01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:33.940]   I know.
[01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:34.460]   I know.
[01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:38.100]   You can think of myself as the cilantro podcast.
[01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:39.020]   You taste like so?
[01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:41.660]   Even if you like-- well, even if you like it a lot
[01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:43.940]   and most people don't, you know, you still just
[01:07:43.940 --> 01:07:44.940]   really want to use a little.
[01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:46.460]   Just a little bit.
[01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:47.780]   A little bit of Merlin.
[01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:48.580]   Everything's better.
[01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:50.220]   We have a little bit of Merlin.
[01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:51.900]   Our show today brought to you by LastPass.
[01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:54.580]   Boy, we have been really grateful to LastPass all year
[01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:54.940]   long.
[01:07:54.940 --> 01:07:56.780]   They bought studio naming rights.
[01:07:56.780 --> 01:08:00.140]   Something I think unheard of in the podcast space
[01:08:00.140 --> 01:08:03.060]   until LastPass came along.
[01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:07.420]   I've been using LastPass for 12 years since they were invented,
[01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:10.580]   I guess, since Joe Seagrist wrote it.
[01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:12.620]   I think it's been 12 years.
[01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:15.380]   It was a couple of years later that I convinced Steve Gibson
[01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:16.180]   to take a look at.
[01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:17.740]   I said, Steve, this is the best password
[01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:19.300]   mantra I've ever used.
[01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:22.500]   It's now been 10 years since he did his security now episode
[01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:27.260]   talking about how LastPass works.
[01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:30.340]   We started using it as a company about six years ago.
[01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:34.700]   Man, with all the employees going home, I'm so glad we did.
[01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:37.860]   Because if you've got employees working at home,
[01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:40.380]   security becomes really important.
[01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:41.500]   I mean, it's always important.
[01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:43.460]   Cyber attacks are a huge problem.
[01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:47.100]   Data loss, data breaches, ransomware.
[01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:51.700]   A good, solid cybersecurity strategy is so important,
[01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:54.780]   especially if you've got employees outside the office
[01:08:54.780 --> 01:08:57.420]   logging in to your most valuable resources.
[01:08:57.420 --> 01:08:59.700]   I might add your bank account, your website,
[01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:03.580]   your databases, your customer records, all of that stuff.
[01:09:03.580 --> 01:09:06.020]   If you're in IT, you love LastPass
[01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:07.420]   because it means you can take back
[01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:08.740]   control of password security.
[01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:10.940]   You've got a central dashboard that keeps you up
[01:09:10.940 --> 01:09:11.860]   on what's going on.
[01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:15.580]   In fact, you can even see for every employee password scores.
[01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:18.180]   So you can know if their master password is up to snuff,
[01:09:18.180 --> 01:09:22.220]   we actually impose there are 100 different enterprise policies.
[01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:24.820]   We require all of our employees to use two-factor.
[01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:26.420]   That's big.
[01:09:26.420 --> 01:09:29.660]   But we also have minimum password requirements, of course.
[01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:31.380]   You can see what accounts are being shared,
[01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:32.700]   what passwords are being shared.
[01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:34.980]   You can monitor group memberships.
[01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:36.700]   You have admin privileges.
[01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:38.820]   There's real granularity in the privileges.
[01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:41.900]   So the people who run one department
[01:09:41.900 --> 01:09:43.900]   can be administrators for that department,
[01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:47.540]   but doesn't give them access to the rest of the organization's
[01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:48.860]   information.
[01:09:48.860 --> 01:09:51.260]   And if you have to revoke access,
[01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:52.900]   you could see security scores.
[01:09:52.900 --> 01:09:55.540]   They even do dark web monitoring to see real-time readouts
[01:09:55.540 --> 01:09:57.180]   of your business's password hygiene.
[01:09:57.180 --> 01:10:00.060]   And alert employees when credentials are at risk,
[01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:04.220]   it's what we call a zero-knowledge security model.
[01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:07.220]   It assumes that everybody has to authenticate,
[01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:09.620]   whether they're inside the network or out.
[01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:14.100]   And it protects us all from the smallest business,
[01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:15.900]   like ours, to the biggest organization,
[01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:17.420]   and of course every individual and families.
[01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:19.660]   We use LastPass family at home.
[01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:21.140]   You no longer need to use passwords.
[01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:24.340]   In some cases, 1,200 plus single sign-on apps
[01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:25.340]   make it easy.
[01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:28.020]   LastPass supports more advanced techniques.
[01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:30.300]   Beyond two-factor, they call it multi-factor
[01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:33.260]   where they're using contextual information
[01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:36.500]   to authenticate as well as the password and the two-factor
[01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:39.300]   things like IP address and geolocation.
[01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:42.100]   Of course, they use the strongest encryption.
[01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:44.180]   Everything's encrypted everywhere,
[01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:48.140]   except on devices, only decrypted on your computer
[01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:50.780]   or your mobile device, wherever you're using LastPass.
[01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:53.940]   Always encrypted before exits and your master password
[01:10:53.940 --> 01:10:56.260]   is never sent anywhere.
[01:10:56.260 --> 01:10:58.940]   That's the beauty of LastPass.
[01:10:58.940 --> 01:11:00.220]   Don't wait till the end of the year
[01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:03.180]   to get strong security for your business.
[01:11:03.180 --> 01:11:05.980]   I know this is a budget decision, but it's not expensive
[01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:08.460]   and it really pays off.
[01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:11.380]   Start solidifying your cybersecurity strategy
[01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:13.260]   with the award-winning LastPass today.

[01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:19.100]   Thank you, LastPass, for supporting Twit
[01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:21.980]   all through a difficult year 2020.
[01:11:21.980 --> 01:11:22.940]   We really appreciate it.
[01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:28.260]   LastPass.com/twit.
[01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:29.860]   Oblivious DNS.
[01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:31.780]   We had DNS.
[01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:32.540]   It's kind of funny.
[01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:37.540]   We had DNS over HTTPS, but no, that wasn't enough.
[01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:41.820]   Now we need Oblivious DNS.
[01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:44.940]   This is something Apple's doing with CloudFlare.
[01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:48.100]   They've developed a new internet protocol
[01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:51.740]   that will make it far more difficult
[01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:56.300]   for internet service providers to know what sites you visit.
[01:11:56.300 --> 01:12:00.900]   So DNS over HTTPS encrypted the DNS queries.
[01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:05.900]   And usually when you're using DOH with Safari or Firefox,
[01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:08.420]   I don't know if Chrome, I think Chrome does it too.
[01:12:08.420 --> 01:12:09.780]   I use it on Firefox.
[01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:11.620]   You would choose a provider.
[01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:16.540]   So it would be encrypted all the way to that provider.
[01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:18.700]   CloudFlare, in my case, next DNS,
[01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:20.300]   where the DNS look up would be done,
[01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:21.700]   completely hiding what you're doing
[01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:24.420]   from your internet service provider.
[01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:26.940]   But the DNS resolver you're using,
[01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:29.980]   whether it's CloudFlare or next DNS,
[01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:31.220]   does get that information.
[01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:37.180]   And that's why this ODOH, Odo or oblivious DNS,
[01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:39.300]   wraps encryption around the DNS query,
[01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:41.340]   passes it through a proxy server.
[01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:46.340]   The proxy server gets the website, passes it along to you.
[01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:48.580]   So the proxy can't see it,
[01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:52.500]   and the DNS resolver cannot see you just the proxy.
[01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:57.060]   So my only concern is it's gonna add some overhead to it.
[01:12:57.060 --> 01:12:58.020]   - You have to perform it.
[01:12:58.020 --> 01:13:00.340]   - Yeah, but I don't know if it does or not.
[01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:03.620]   I've been using DOH for a long time
[01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:04.460]   and it works just fine.
[01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:06.980]   So ODOH is a new thing to look for.
[01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:11.380]   You can use it with CloudFlare's quad 1.1.1.1.1.
[01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:13.420]   But again, it'll have to be put into browsers.
[01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:14.980]   It's presumed because Apple's involved
[01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:18.460]   in this work that Apple will put in Safari.
[01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:24.300]   I have to say, using Safari on an M1 Mac
[01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:28.540]   is orders of magnitude different and better.
[01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:30.540]   I loaded the Twitch, normally Twitch.tv here,
[01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:31.620]   I'll show you, I'll load it right here
[01:13:31.620 --> 01:13:33.500]   without having a cache.
[01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:35.500]   This is, we have a lot of content on this site.
[01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:36.780]   Oh, it's still pretty fast.
[01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:38.340]   Gosh, you guys have done a good job.
[01:13:38.340 --> 01:13:42.260]   But on Apple, it's like this page was already loaded.
[01:13:42.260 --> 01:13:44.180]   And I just opened a tab to show it to you.
[01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:45.020]   It's so--
[01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:48.340]   Got a Stavus Crypt Accelerator built into the Silicon IP,
[01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:50.340]   which is the same one that's been on the iPhone for a while,
[01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:52.140]   which is why you see people like DHH
[01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:53.780]   get uncrankey for a hot minute
[01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:55.260]   and say I'm raising the performance.
[01:13:55.260 --> 01:14:00.740]   It really-- what's making me sad is now in my office at home,
[01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:06.620]   I have a very, very pricey iMac Pro with 10 cores and 64 gig
[01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:07.780]   Xoram.
[01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:08.900]   And it's--
[01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:09.700]   Throw it in the trash.
[01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:10.460]   Hot fire trash.
[01:14:10.460 --> 01:14:11.740]   It's slow.
[01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:13.580]   Burn it.
[01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:14.620]   My-- I-- for a long--
[01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:15.980]   It's slow for those tasks, Leo.
[01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:17.380]   It's still really good for some other tasks.
[01:14:17.380 --> 01:14:18.700]   OK.
[01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:19.220]   I guess.
[01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:22.060]   Yeah, if I were rendering a lot of video or something,
[01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:22.940]   I guess it would be fast.
[01:14:22.940 --> 01:14:25.220]   Anything Adobe will still work way better on the app.
[01:14:25.220 --> 01:14:26.300]   Oh, it's Adobe Adobe.
[01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:30.140]   Actually, though, I guess Lightroom now is out for M1, right?
[01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:30.980]   Or is it a beta?
[01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:31.700]   Not premiere, though.
[01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:33.380]   I saw Sarah Deitchi's video yesterday,
[01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:37.100]   and she's like, it's taking an hour to render a premiere
[01:14:37.100 --> 01:14:39.580]   on this M1 Mac, and it takes two minutes, literally two minutes
[01:14:39.580 --> 01:14:40.940]   in Final Cut.
[01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:43.180]   It's-- just-- just--
[01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:45.380]   So last time we talked, last week,
[01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:49.300]   I was complaining because some of my development tools were not
[01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:51.420]   yet ready for prime time.
[01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:55.620]   In fact, they wouldn't even run under Rosetta.
[01:14:55.620 --> 01:15:00.780]   I'm happy to say that they have rapidly improved.
[01:15:00.780 --> 01:15:02.620]   And a lot of that comes down to the people who
[01:15:02.620 --> 01:15:05.820]   are responsible for them getting a Mac than M1 Mac.
[01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:09.620]   So example, Matthew Flat is a professor of computer science
[01:15:09.620 --> 01:15:10.620]   in Utah.
[01:15:10.620 --> 01:15:14.500]   And one of the team that does the language I use, Racket,
[01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:15.340]   got an M1 Mac.
[01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:18.740]   And within three days, Racket's running on an M1.
[01:15:18.740 --> 01:15:22.220]   It's running so fast again.
[01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:26.180]   I don't want to ever go back to my iMac.
[01:15:26.180 --> 01:15:27.580]   It's the confluence of nerderates.
[01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:30.580]   The nerds who maintain those things want the M1 Mac,
[01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:33.100]   so they are motivated to make their stuff work really well.
[01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:36.100]   We're doing a fundraiser right now for one of the maintainers
[01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:40.180]   of the list by, like, Steelbag Commonless SBCL.
[01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:42.580]   Somebody asked him on Reddit, so when are you making it work
[01:15:42.580 --> 01:15:42.940]   with a Mac?
[01:15:42.940 --> 01:15:43.660]   Because it doesn't work at all.
[01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:44.940]   It doesn't run.
[01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:47.380]   And he said, no, I'm not.
[01:15:47.380 --> 01:15:49.060]   Because I don't have an M1.
[01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:51.380]   So they put together a fundraiser,
[01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:53.180]   and they're raising money for him to get an M1,
[01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:54.980]   because we want that to work.
[01:15:54.980 --> 01:15:58.260]   But what's encouraging to me is it does seem like-- well,
[01:15:58.260 --> 01:16:00.260]   some of like Matthew's a brilliant programmer,
[01:16:00.260 --> 01:16:02.900]   but Matthew was able to take what is a huge package.
[01:16:02.900 --> 01:16:06.900]   There's a lot to Racket and make it work within just a few days.
[01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:08.860]   That was encouraging to me.
[01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:12.900]   And it's not a big sur issue, because it does run fine on big sur.
[01:16:12.900 --> 01:16:15.660]   It's an M1 issue.
[01:16:15.660 --> 01:16:18.940]   Merlin, have you noticed that some of the things that you use
[01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:20.780]   don't work, but then they do very quickly?
[01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:22.260]   Or what's your experience?
[01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:27.380]   I'm still-- I'm on this very old iMac.
[01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:33.620]   And on the 2015, I think, so much feels very old by modern
[01:16:33.620 --> 01:16:34.100]   standards.
[01:16:34.100 --> 01:16:36.620]   It doesn't even have USB-C.
[01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:38.540]   But you know, I'm on the horns of a dilemma,
[01:16:38.540 --> 01:16:40.180]   because on the one hand, people say,
[01:16:40.180 --> 01:16:42.820]   you don't know if the M1--
[01:16:42.820 --> 01:16:45.860]   I would feel really stupid if I bought a Mac Pro--
[01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:47.660]   or excuse me, an iMac Pro.
[01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:48.620]   No, no, no, no.
[01:16:48.620 --> 01:16:50.980]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:51.500]   Yeah.
[01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:52.300]   I can promise you.
[01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:53.420]   There's this stuff I'd like to do.
[01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:54.380]   I know.
[01:16:54.380 --> 01:16:56.060]   That is really tough.
[01:16:56.060 --> 01:16:56.900]   If you have a--
[01:16:56.900 --> 01:16:57.860]   What is it like to focus right?
[01:16:57.860 --> 01:16:58.620]   Well, I'm going to focus right.
[01:16:58.620 --> 01:17:01.260]   But a ton of the value you get out of a focus right
[01:17:01.260 --> 01:17:03.540]   comes from the USB-C connection.
[01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:04.860]   So I would be leaving a lot.
[01:17:04.860 --> 01:17:05.900]   Anyway, it's not critical.
[01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:06.620]   This thing works.
[01:17:06.620 --> 01:17:10.140]   I got to say, I mean, for a 2015 Mac, it still works great.
[01:17:10.140 --> 01:17:13.660]   But I'm very envious hearing people like Marco talk about,
[01:17:13.660 --> 01:17:16.380]   you know, I think even the MacBook Air, if people are saying,
[01:17:16.380 --> 01:17:17.940]   are less crazy fast, right?
[01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:20.300]   And it's $1,700 for the mini.
[01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:22.300]   You can pile us overcast before writing the new code.
[01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:26.020]   It's like it's almost like cackions at this point.
[01:17:26.020 --> 01:17:29.580]   It's pretty--
[01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:30.220]   Here's the thing.
[01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:32.020]   We already-- now Bloomberg, I guess,
[01:17:32.020 --> 01:17:34.020]   Mark Gurman with the rumors that we're
[01:17:34.020 --> 01:17:36.380]   going to see by spring.
[01:17:36.380 --> 01:17:41.500]   We're going to see 32 core M1s on MacBook Pros
[01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:43.340]   and perhaps on iMac.
[01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:46.420]   I mean, I think this is 128 on a Mac Pro.
[01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:49.300]   You're like, I don't know, ludicrous number is that?
[01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:51.340]   And that's what's interesting.
[01:17:51.340 --> 01:17:54.980]   As you have said, Renee, these are the slowest M1--
[01:17:54.980 --> 01:17:55.460]   Yeah.
[01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:57.380]   --arm Macs will ever see.
[01:17:57.380 --> 01:18:00.980]   And they're already like, what's happening?
[01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:03.380]   Just a different general-- just like a different era
[01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:04.700]   of computing.
[01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:06.780]   And I can only imagine what it's going to be like next year.
[01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:07.740]   So yeah, I would say--
[01:18:07.740 --> 01:18:09.340]   People have said like it's all 5 nanometer.
[01:18:09.340 --> 01:18:12.140]   Like it's like a huge once in a lifetime lift
[01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:13.060]   from 5 nanometer.
[01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:13.580]   I don't think so.
[01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:15.060]   No, 4.9 grade on 7 nanometer.
[01:18:15.060 --> 01:18:17.340]   I sense does not run this well on 5 nanometer.
[01:18:17.340 --> 01:18:18.700]   This is a really good architecture
[01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:21.540]   they've spent since the A7 developing.
[01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:24.580]   And they can scale it out over multiple cores, which is great.
[01:18:24.580 --> 01:18:26.340]   But also every new IP generation.
[01:18:26.340 --> 01:18:29.220]   So when there's an A15, there'll be an M2 architecture.
[01:18:29.220 --> 01:18:31.980]   When there's an A16, and you can fund a lot of R&D
[01:18:31.980 --> 01:18:33.260]   off the back of the iPhone.
[01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:35.340]   Because they're doing chipsets every year for that baby.
[01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:38.220]   And it's the same IP that goes into the Mac chip.
[01:18:38.220 --> 01:18:39.540]   And I think this is what's exciting,
[01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:42.140]   because Intel was so far behind on roadmap
[01:18:42.140 --> 01:18:43.860]   and having so many problems.
[01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:46.340]   And now that the Mac will literally get lifted every time
[01:18:46.340 --> 01:18:51.380]   there's a new iPhone, it's just at scale, which is very exciting.
[01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:53.100]   There are a lot of PC people say, oh, it's just
[01:18:53.100 --> 01:18:55.020]   what they call market texture.
[01:18:55.020 --> 01:19:00.580]   It's marketing-- especially that 5 nanometer thing--
[01:19:00.580 --> 01:19:03.180]   is marketing as opposed to actual improvement.
[01:19:03.180 --> 01:19:05.540]   But I don't think so.
[01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:06.820]   It doesn't feel that way.
[01:19:06.820 --> 01:19:08.500]   It's pretty.
[01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:11.060]   It really looks like there's a lot of headroom.
[01:19:11.060 --> 01:19:13.700]   And there's a lot of places for Apple to go with this.
[01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:16.300]   Andy, did you decide to pull the trigger?
[01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:17.060]   Yeah, I did.
[01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:19.500]   As a matter of fact, my M1 MacBook Pro
[01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:22.420]   is arriving on actually a week from today.
[01:19:22.420 --> 01:19:24.260]   So it's possible that I'm going to be--
[01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:25.620]   that would be the middle of saying something
[01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:27.740]   and then leap from my desk to sign for something.
[01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:28.620]   Yeah.
[01:19:28.620 --> 01:19:31.700]   I was actually standing at the door all that day
[01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:33.180]   waiting for the new desk.
[01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:39.220]   So MacBook Pro, just for the sake of argument,
[01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:40.740]   if you had a screen for it and stuff,
[01:19:40.740 --> 01:19:43.660]   a MacBook Pro is a computer you could use instead of an iMac,
[01:19:43.660 --> 01:19:44.340]   right?
[01:19:44.340 --> 01:19:44.820]   It is.
[01:19:44.820 --> 01:19:47.620]   It would be faster than your five-year-old iMac, for sure.
[01:19:47.620 --> 01:19:49.060]   It's hard to find a good screen.
[01:19:49.060 --> 01:19:50.460]   There's very few good screens out there.
[01:19:50.460 --> 01:19:52.220]   I think the LG one is still the only one that's
[01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:53.420]   the same quality as the iMac.
[01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:54.860]   Same panel.
[01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:55.420]   Oh, yeah.
[01:19:55.420 --> 01:19:56.660]   And that's going to cost you, right?
[01:19:56.660 --> 01:19:58.020]   That's a couple of grand.
[01:19:58.020 --> 01:19:58.500]   Yeah.
[01:19:58.500 --> 01:19:59.340]   Well, I think it's 1,000 bucks.
[01:19:59.340 --> 01:20:01.020]   You can use that old iMac.
[01:20:01.020 --> 01:20:03.540]   I think that's old enough that you can use target display mode.
[01:20:03.540 --> 01:20:05.300]   Can you not?
[01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:06.300]   Do you know what TD happens?
[01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:07.260]   I don't know.
[01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:08.340]   You know, I--
[01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:08.900]   It's pre-5K.
[01:20:08.900 --> 01:20:10.420]   Pre-5K.
[01:20:10.420 --> 01:20:10.860]   Yeah.
[01:20:10.860 --> 01:20:11.300]   So that's--
[01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:12.780]   I'm very in love with my Synology.
[01:20:12.780 --> 01:20:15.660]   And that's my main technology fetish right now.
[01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:18.460]   So I should just redirect my energy into Synology.
[01:20:18.460 --> 01:20:19.020]   Stay focused on it.
[01:20:19.020 --> 01:20:21.540]   I upgraded my Synology last year.
[01:20:21.540 --> 01:20:23.940]   And I took the old one to work.
[01:20:23.940 --> 01:20:27.900]   So now I have my Synology with hyper backup syncing.
[01:20:27.900 --> 01:20:30.100]   So I have the one at home and I have the one at work.
[01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:31.220]   It's really nice.
[01:20:31.220 --> 01:20:32.100]   I don't like that much data.
[01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:33.700]   Wait, you see this DSM-7.
[01:20:33.700 --> 01:20:35.900]   It's real pretty.
[01:20:35.900 --> 01:20:36.300]   You just got one.
[01:20:36.300 --> 01:20:39.940]   I would not do it on a production machine.
[01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:40.940]   I ill-advised it.
[01:20:40.940 --> 01:20:43.020]   The first Synology I bought very quickly
[01:20:43.020 --> 01:20:45.340]   is it was a 2-bay Synology, which
[01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:47.540]   is a stupid, stupid idea.
[01:20:47.540 --> 01:20:48.020]   No.
[01:20:48.020 --> 01:20:48.580]   It defeats the--
[01:20:48.580 --> 01:20:49.420]   You need five.
[01:20:49.420 --> 01:20:50.180]   You need five.
[01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:51.020]   Well, you need five.
[01:20:51.020 --> 01:20:52.380]   Yeah, four you can get away with.
[01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:53.740]   Six would be great.
[01:20:53.740 --> 01:20:55.900]   Because then you can get the smaller--
[01:20:55.900 --> 01:20:57.140]   I mean, what are you going to do?
[01:20:57.140 --> 01:20:59.940]   Like 10 terabyte drives.
[01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:02.820]   But then you get five total, 2, 10 terabytes.
[01:21:02.820 --> 01:21:04.260]   You get 10 terabytes out of it.
[01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:05.220]   That's not great.
[01:21:05.220 --> 01:21:06.020]   Anyway.
[01:21:06.020 --> 01:21:08.060]   But yeah, you know, I--
[01:21:08.060 --> 01:21:09.740]   So you're using--
[01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:12.180]   Now this is in beta, right, the DSM-7?
[01:21:12.180 --> 01:21:13.380]   It just came out today.
[01:21:13.380 --> 01:21:16.260]   So anyway, the point being that old Synology that's
[01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:19.100]   just been gathering dust is what I put it on.
[01:21:19.100 --> 01:21:22.700]   And it definitely looks a lot better.
[01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:24.300]   Yeah.
[01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:26.460]   Yeah, it's real cool.
[01:21:26.460 --> 01:21:28.780]   You know what though I got to tell you, man, I'm glad to see
[01:21:28.780 --> 01:21:29.780]   any time--
[01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:32.940]   I think this is sort of a CGP gray-ish idea--
[01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:36.220]   is like you get excited when you see Apple doing something
[01:21:36.220 --> 01:21:37.100]   cool.
[01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:39.420]   But you get really excited when you see Apple doing something
[01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:41.700]   cool over and over and seeing progression.
[01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:44.340]   And that's how you develop this trust.
[01:21:44.340 --> 01:21:46.900]   I think it's one reason we have such a crazy rumor mill
[01:21:46.900 --> 01:21:49.340]   is people are always trying to understand and speculate,
[01:21:49.340 --> 01:21:51.860]   like in some cases, the practical component of what
[01:21:51.860 --> 01:21:53.900]   should I buy, in my case, right?
[01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:56.220]   And then there's just the fun kind of gambling aspect
[01:21:56.220 --> 01:21:57.660]   of what's the future going to look like.
[01:21:57.660 --> 01:22:00.900]   And to state the obvious, I think it's really encouraging
[01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:03.180]   to see them do anything to--
[01:22:03.180 --> 01:22:06.980]   Syracuse says, put some wood behind the arrow with Max.
[01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:11.340]   And any time that it's not just this is an item in our lineup,
[01:22:11.340 --> 01:22:12.540]   I think that's really encouraging.
[01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:13.940]   And to hear them--
[01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:15.860]   this is something that probably would have made Steve proud
[01:22:15.860 --> 01:22:16.980]   a computer that goes this fast.
[01:22:16.980 --> 01:22:18.180]   I think that's really cool.
[01:22:18.180 --> 01:22:20.540]   I was very worried about the Mac as people who watched
[01:22:20.540 --> 01:22:22.260]   the show know over the last few years.
[01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:23.620]   I really thought, oh, we're going to just
[01:22:23.620 --> 01:22:27.900]   be iOS world, so it's very nice to see these chips.
[01:22:27.900 --> 01:22:30.980]   And yeah, they came from iOS, but they really
[01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:33.220]   do a great job on desktop.
[01:22:33.220 --> 01:22:37.580]   And the more I use it, the more I use things that
[01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:39.540]   are written for it, particularly, the more
[01:22:39.540 --> 01:22:41.980]   I appreciate if I am of how much speed
[01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:43.060]   there is under the hood.
[01:22:43.060 --> 01:22:45.340]   And to their credit, they didn't raise prices.
[01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:47.340]   You could still get a MacBook Air for $9.99.
[01:22:47.340 --> 01:22:48.980]   They were never meant to be mobile chips.
[01:22:48.980 --> 01:22:49.900]   I think that was a price.
[01:22:49.900 --> 01:22:52.580]   It's almost a parallel to when Ed Collegant said, oh,
[01:22:52.580 --> 01:22:54.180]   we've been making--
[01:22:54.180 --> 01:22:56.460]   BlackBerry and Palm have been making smartphones for years.
[01:22:56.460 --> 01:22:58.300]   We built them up from pagers and PDAs.
[01:22:58.300 --> 01:23:01.260]   And these computer guys aren't going to walk in and take over.
[01:23:01.260 --> 01:23:03.700]   And it turned out that bringing OS 10 down to mobile
[01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:04.940]   was a really smart move.
[01:23:04.940 --> 01:23:06.500]   And this is the opposite of that, because you
[01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:08.740]   have people saying, oh, Intel and NVIDIA and AMD
[01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:10.940]   have been making big honking desktop chips.
[01:23:10.940 --> 01:23:13.500]   And these mobile people aren't going to walk in and take over.
[01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:15.220]   But Apple was never building mobile chips.
[01:23:15.220 --> 01:23:18.740]   They were using desktop class architecture and performance
[01:23:18.740 --> 01:23:21.860]   and efficiency, because it was all the PA semi and all the AMD
[01:23:21.860 --> 01:23:23.420]   and NVIDIA and Intel.
[01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:24.660]   People that they brought into Apple,
[01:23:24.660 --> 01:23:26.060]   that's what they knew how to build.
[01:23:26.060 --> 01:23:28.260]   They just had to build them for five watts.
[01:23:28.260 --> 01:23:31.260]   And now they're allowed to build them for 10 to 15 watts.
[01:23:31.260 --> 01:23:32.860]   And soon for 30 to 35 watts.
[01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:33.380]   Amazing.
[01:23:33.380 --> 01:23:35.380]   And it turns out they know how to do that really well.
[01:23:35.380 --> 01:23:36.620]   Yeah, these are going to scale.
[01:23:36.620 --> 01:23:38.900]   It looks like, anyway, these are going to scale like crazy.
[01:23:38.900 --> 01:23:40.980]   And that's going to be very interesting.
[01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:42.300]   I feel like I need the Federigulite
[01:23:42.300 --> 01:23:43.300]   when I talk about this stuff.
[01:23:43.300 --> 01:23:46.020]   I feel about M1, the way Craig feels about Instant On.
[01:23:46.020 --> 01:23:46.580]   Yeah.
[01:23:46.580 --> 01:23:47.180]   On that book.
[01:23:47.180 --> 01:23:48.340]   It is Instant On.
[01:23:48.340 --> 01:23:50.940]   But I mean, it's not like it was slow to start.
[01:23:50.940 --> 01:23:53.460]   No, those red lights, you know, that music and the red lights, Leo.
[01:23:53.460 --> 01:23:56.460]   That's what I feel like I need when I talk about it.
[01:23:56.460 --> 01:23:59.660]   I, yeah, I don't want to be too much of a fanboy on this one.
[01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:01.900]   But it is, it's exciting.
[01:24:01.900 --> 01:24:04.500]   And you know, I like desktop computing.
[01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:05.820]   And so I want to see it.
[01:24:05.820 --> 01:24:06.860]   I want to see it go.
[01:24:06.860 --> 01:24:07.540]   And the good news is--
[01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:10.260]   Yeah, that's something that some Dan and I have been saying.
[01:24:10.260 --> 01:24:13.940]   I'm back to work for a while now is that, you know,
[01:24:13.940 --> 01:24:15.340]   and maybe this is a strong man.
[01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:16.140]   Maybe this is not fair.
[01:24:16.140 --> 01:24:17.180]   And you can tell me if it's not.
[01:24:17.180 --> 01:24:20.340]   But I do feel like there has been this sense of, well,
[01:24:20.340 --> 01:24:21.940]   what is it that Apple's very excited about?
[01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:23.380]   What is it that Apple really cares about?
[01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:25.460]   And iOS, I think, has got to be near the top.
[01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:29.860]   It powers their, you know, most successful device.
[01:24:29.860 --> 01:24:33.180]   And then the thought has been, or the implication has been,
[01:24:33.180 --> 01:24:35.740]   like, the Mac is going to become more like iOS.
[01:24:35.740 --> 01:24:37.980]   And I don't know if that's fair to say,
[01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:41.220]   but I feel like I want iOS to become more like iOS.
[01:24:41.220 --> 01:24:43.300]   And I want the Mac to become more like the Mac.
[01:24:43.300 --> 01:24:45.300]   And if there's places where, you know,
[01:24:45.300 --> 01:24:47.220]   coming through the rye, where there's a Venn diagram,
[01:24:47.220 --> 01:24:48.420]   where that works, that's great.
[01:24:48.420 --> 01:24:52.500]   But like, there's so much benefit to those platforms
[01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:53.900]   having their own way of doing things.
[01:24:53.900 --> 01:24:58.460]   In a similar way to iPad, finally getting its own tapping iPad
[01:24:58.460 --> 01:25:01.460]   over here, getting its own operating system to utilize
[01:25:01.460 --> 01:25:03.460]   what it's great at, to lay the groundwork for the future.
[01:25:03.460 --> 01:25:06.020]   And I, you know, I, like I said, this could be a strong man.
[01:25:06.020 --> 01:25:09.900]   But I really, I mean, when I open something like the home app
[01:25:09.900 --> 01:25:13.860]   on the Mac, it just makes me very, very sad at a fundamental level.
[01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:15.300]   I know what you mean.
[01:25:15.300 --> 01:25:19.180]   Using home kit in general is not super fun a lot of the time.
[01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:23.820]   I was just on an episode of a relay FM podcast called Automators
[01:25:23.820 --> 01:25:27.540]   with a resort shirt and David Sparks talking about this stuff.
[01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:31.820]   And, and, you know, it's just, there are times where you're like,
[01:25:31.820 --> 01:25:33.660]   it's sort of like the Warner Brothers thing again,
[01:25:33.660 --> 01:25:36.620]   where you're like, I guess this is a good idea to somebody,
[01:25:36.620 --> 01:25:39.740]   but like, it's anybody, it's like, I used to say,
[01:25:39.740 --> 01:25:41.660]   like we're watching somebody use a blackberry.
[01:25:41.660 --> 01:25:43.660]   It's like always like watching someone drain a wound.
[01:25:43.660 --> 01:25:46.380]   And like whenever I'm using one of those catalyst apps,
[01:25:46.380 --> 01:25:49.460]   I really feel like my life is slipping away from me.
[01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:52.340]   And, and, and they're really, they're just having fun to like,
[01:25:52.340 --> 01:25:53.860]   see what I'll put up.
[01:25:53.860 --> 01:25:55.900]   But with that said, you know, it's a bright future.
[01:25:55.900 --> 01:25:57.260]   I think good stuff is going to happen.
[01:25:57.260 --> 01:26:00.300]   I really want to mark what pro now is a beautiful.
[01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:01.140]   Yeah.
[01:26:01.140 --> 01:26:03.740]   It's fine because when you were looking at the people on the PC forums,
[01:26:03.740 --> 01:26:06.500]   they were like, oh, oh, Geekbench is not a realistic benchmark.
[01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:09.140]   Ignore that. Oh, oh, now you're using Cinebench really.
[01:26:09.140 --> 01:26:10.180]   Well, we don't count that either.
[01:26:10.180 --> 01:26:11.900]   How about some, oh, those, you got render scores.
[01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:14.180]   No, how about compile? Oh, you got compile scores.
[01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:15.660]   But we just don't like it.
[01:26:15.660 --> 01:26:16.660]   Yeah.
[01:26:16.660 --> 01:26:19.460]   And I, so I built, I had to build the language I use racket.
[01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:21.460]   I had to build from scratch.
[01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:24.460]   It's the new version of it, which is based on a new engine,
[01:26:24.460 --> 01:26:25.780]   Shae scheme.
[01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:30.780]   And once it's, once I, because the reason I wanted it is I was doing
[01:26:30.780 --> 01:26:33.260]   the advent of code contest.
[01:26:33.260 --> 01:26:37.300]   And I want, I was had to go sit down at a Dell in order to do that
[01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:40.740]   was making me, you know, bang my head against the wall.
[01:26:40.740 --> 01:26:45.300]   As soon as it was on the M1, it's just like, huh, EMAX running
[01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:47.420]   native on the M1.
[01:26:47.420 --> 01:26:48.780]   And I was really worried.
[01:26:48.780 --> 01:26:53.180]   And you remember a couple of weeks ago, I was very upset feeling
[01:26:53.180 --> 01:26:58.060]   like maybe command line was over on Mac OS and maybe all of these
[01:26:58.060 --> 01:27:00.940]   geeky dev tools and things like this were over.
[01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:04.220]   And I'm much, much relieved to see that they are working now.
[01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:06.860]   And it just takes a little love.
[01:27:06.860 --> 01:27:09.420]   And the development version of EMAX runs in native.
[01:27:09.420 --> 01:27:10.540]   And it's fantastic.
[01:27:10.540 --> 01:27:14.020]   I mean, happy days, you know, it's just great.
[01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:15.300]   It's just great.
[01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:19.460]   We can't let the Mac become just the toy computer that for people
[01:27:19.460 --> 01:27:23.900]   who don't ever want to know what's going on behind the scenes and
[01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:27.660]   don't ever want to customize their experience to exactly what their
[01:27:27.660 --> 01:27:33.380]   needs are, which is we, these are these are givebacks that we deal
[01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:35.900]   with when we're using an iPhone or an iPad.
[01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:42.180]   And we do that with a with with with precise choice because that's
[01:27:42.180 --> 01:27:43.380]   the sort of device we have.
[01:27:43.380 --> 01:27:46.140]   But that's that will always be for me, the difference between a desktop
[01:27:46.140 --> 01:27:49.620]   and a mobile device that there are reasons why for security, for
[01:27:49.620 --> 01:27:52.900]   battery life or thermal thermal envelope for all these other reasons
[01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:56.500]   why I can't do everything I want to do on this $1000 iPhone.
[01:27:56.500 --> 01:28:00.500]   But when I spend $1000 for a laptop and it's been $500 for a laptop,
[01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:04.100]   I feel as though whatever I want to do with this pile of compressed
[01:28:04.100 --> 01:28:08.700]   sand, I get to do anything that's artificial of that.
[01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:09.820]   That's a limitation to that.
[01:28:09.820 --> 01:28:12.500]   That's just a systematic problem with the developer.
[01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:17.300]   Micah is reminding me that Patrick Wardle tweeted yesterday,
[01:28:17.300 --> 01:28:19.380]   my M1 MacBook arrived today.
[01:28:19.380 --> 01:28:21.500]   Step one, install X code.
[01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:23.100]   Step two, clone, build Lulu.
[01:28:23.100 --> 01:28:25.980]   And just like that, Lulu now runs natively on arm.
[01:28:25.980 --> 01:28:29.700]   That's really encouraging.
[01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:32.540]   Lulu, by the way, it was a pick a couple months ago.
[01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:34.540]   Lulu Lemon, this is talking about Lulu Lemon.
[01:28:34.540 --> 01:28:39.740]   Although Patrick has a very nice butt, but we're talking about Lulu,
[01:28:39.740 --> 01:28:42.660]   which is basically an open source free, not open source, but a free
[01:28:42.660 --> 01:28:47.940]   version of a little snitch, which watches outbound traffic and is fantastic.
[01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:52.180]   And the fact that he's got that, he got that within just, you know,
[01:28:52.180 --> 01:28:55.660]   right away after getting an M1 is very encouraging.
[01:28:55.660 --> 01:29:00.700]   I was kind of concerned that the security measures that Apple has put on
[01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:02.900]   the big sir, it feels like it's getting more and more locked.
[01:29:02.900 --> 01:29:05.380]   I do feel feel, though, Lulu, like there was this thing that Groobers said
[01:29:05.380 --> 01:29:07.780]   that I thought was really smart where he said the heaviness,
[01:29:07.780 --> 01:29:10.620]   the lightness of iOS is what lets Mac OS stay heavy.
[01:29:10.620 --> 01:29:13.020]   And you always see nerds push against that.
[01:29:13.020 --> 01:29:15.460]   They're like, we want the iPad to just be a touchscreen Mac.
[01:29:15.460 --> 01:29:17.820]   And I was like, no, like you have all your computers.
[01:29:17.820 --> 01:29:19.380]   You've had them for decades.
[01:29:19.380 --> 01:29:21.140]   This is meant for the other 80 percent.
[01:29:21.140 --> 01:29:21.620]   For us.
[01:29:21.620 --> 01:29:23.580]   Always feel alienated and anautics.
[01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:25.460]   Like they've never been able to relate to a computer.
[01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:27.740]   Finally, they have a computer that they can relate to.
[01:29:27.740 --> 01:29:29.260]   And you better not take that away.
[01:29:29.460 --> 01:29:32.140]   But on the other end, Apple, you have your iPad.
[01:29:32.140 --> 01:29:33.380]   Let the iPad stay light.
[01:29:33.380 --> 01:29:34.580]   Let the Mac stay heavy.
[01:29:34.580 --> 01:29:37.060]   If you're worried about controlled environments, push those
[01:29:37.060 --> 01:29:41.060]   customers towards iPads, make the iPad as amazing as you possibly can for
[01:29:41.060 --> 01:29:43.020]   everybody who doesn't want to ever open terminal.
[01:29:43.020 --> 01:29:45.860]   But just stay away from my terminal on the Mac.
[01:29:45.860 --> 01:29:47.420]   That's our compact agreement here.
[01:29:47.420 --> 01:29:50.780]   Isn't that I can't remember if it was Craig Federighi or I was one of the
[01:29:50.780 --> 01:29:56.340]   executives said, and maybe it was a grouper or maybe it was to somebody else.
[01:29:56.340 --> 01:29:58.780]   But we grew up on the Macs.
[01:29:58.780 --> 01:30:01.100]   We all are here because of Mac.
[01:30:01.100 --> 01:30:02.300]   I'm here.
[01:30:02.300 --> 01:30:03.420]   It's Mac break weekly.
[01:30:03.420 --> 01:30:04.420]   I'm here because of the Mac.
[01:30:04.420 --> 01:30:09.100]   And so it would be heartbreaking for us on the outside to lose it.
[01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:12.780]   But apparently so would it be for the engineers on the inside?
[01:30:12.780 --> 01:30:13.620]   So that's very encouraging.
[01:30:13.620 --> 01:30:17.300]   You've always said, I haven't really kept up with this too much.
[01:30:17.300 --> 01:30:22.380]   But I mean, is it, am I being simple to ask the question, what would you make
[01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:25.540]   iOS apps on and with without a Mac?
[01:30:25.540 --> 01:30:26.580]   No, no.
[01:30:26.580 --> 01:30:28.420]   But isn't that still the case?
[01:30:28.420 --> 01:30:31.060]   That's the least, that's the least of it.
[01:30:31.060 --> 01:30:33.620]   You know, oh, yeah, they could figure out ways.
[01:30:33.620 --> 01:30:37.540]   You know, in fact, many people said the minute X code appears on iPad,
[01:30:37.540 --> 01:30:39.060]   OS, it's all over for the Mac.
[01:30:39.060 --> 01:30:40.060]   No, you're right.
[01:30:40.060 --> 01:30:42.020]   You still need the Mac to do development.
[01:30:42.020 --> 01:30:42.540]   Right.
[01:30:42.540 --> 01:30:44.260]   But we use it for so much more scientists.
[01:30:44.260 --> 01:30:45.380]   I do what the desktop does.
[01:30:45.380 --> 01:30:49.740]   Scientists use it for, you know, massaging numbers and machine learning and statistics.
[01:30:49.740 --> 01:30:53.940]   There's so many people use Macs who want them to continue to be heavy.
[01:30:53.940 --> 01:30:57.020]   So thank goodness they still want to make a truck.
[01:30:57.300 --> 01:31:00.460]   And apparently they still want to make a self-driving car.
[01:31:00.460 --> 01:31:01.980]   Oh, yeah.
[01:31:01.980 --> 01:31:02.340]   Yeah.
[01:31:02.340 --> 01:31:04.260]   By the way, Rosemary Archer.
[01:31:04.260 --> 01:31:05.540]   Sir, you said something.
[01:31:05.540 --> 01:31:05.900]   Go ahead.
[01:31:05.900 --> 01:31:07.740]   This is something I'm so sorry.
[01:31:07.740 --> 01:31:12.060]   Sir, he says something about we're talking about the Mandalorian and to me,
[01:31:12.060 --> 01:31:16.980]   like how honestly, like how it's everything I like about Star Wars without the stuff I
[01:31:16.980 --> 01:31:20.500]   don't like about Star Wars and like, you know, there's been lots of different
[01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:22.820]   Star Wars things that I like to different degrees.
[01:31:23.060 --> 01:31:27.620]   But that, you know, this is the guy who worked on Clone Wars, which was really
[01:31:27.620 --> 01:31:29.300]   terrific and a very fresh take.
[01:31:29.300 --> 01:31:32.260]   But I think he's not the first person to say this, but Syracuse is saying, well,
[01:31:32.260 --> 01:31:35.140]   the thing is these are the people who grew up on Star Wars.
[01:31:35.140 --> 01:31:38.460]   They're now making Star Wars and they have their own taste and their own idea.
[01:31:38.460 --> 01:31:39.940]   And, you know, to quote the Mr.
[01:31:39.940 --> 01:31:42.380]   Show bit, like which Star Wars is your Star Wars?
[01:31:42.380 --> 01:31:44.420]   Is it an empire empire or is it, you know, new hope?
[01:31:44.420 --> 01:31:48.740]   And I wonder, I wonder what that means because I've wondered personally about
[01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:54.900]   kids who grew up with iPods and iPhones where it doesn't seem weird to them to not primarily
[01:31:54.900 --> 01:31:56.260]   want a Mac.
[01:31:56.260 --> 01:31:59.300]   So I wonder if there's a real push and pull inside the company amongst those people.
[01:31:59.300 --> 01:32:00.420]   Obviously, everybody likes the Mac.
[01:32:00.420 --> 01:32:01.900]   It's why we like the company.
[01:32:01.900 --> 01:32:02.860]   But you know what I mean?
[01:32:02.860 --> 01:32:06.900]   That's going to be interesting to see who's tastes and interest emerge over time.
[01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:09.500]   You're the fan of this platform or that platform.
[01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:10.860]   And it's just that's a good point.
[01:32:10.860 --> 01:32:13.340]   And then for somebody who loves it to really make it, make it sing.
[01:32:13.340 --> 01:32:16.300]   But will it ever have a touchscreen?
[01:32:17.540 --> 01:32:21.220]   It will it will when the when the other kids grow up and they think it's broken because it doesn't.
[01:32:21.220 --> 01:32:21.980]   Right.
[01:32:21.980 --> 01:32:24.340]   That's going to be the biggest shift right there.
[01:32:24.340 --> 01:32:28.140]   The first time you tap the top, the first time you tap the top of your Mac
[01:32:28.140 --> 01:32:30.980]   to to scroll to the top of the page.
[01:32:30.980 --> 01:32:32.740]   I'm looking at my brand new.
[01:32:32.740 --> 01:32:33.700]   I do that all the time.
[01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:34.420]   I do that all the time.
[01:32:34.420 --> 01:32:37.620]   And I'm looking at it and I said, where are there's fingerprints all over the screen?
[01:32:37.620 --> 01:32:38.540]   What's the whole of it?
[01:32:38.540 --> 01:32:41.940]   So it's fair to say that, you know, you can have a car and you can have a truck.
[01:32:41.940 --> 01:32:44.540]   But if you have a truck, it doesn't mean you don't want the amenities of the car.
[01:32:44.540 --> 01:32:46.540]   You don't want the leather seats and the cup holder.
[01:32:46.540 --> 01:32:49.020]   And Apple is just bringing over all those amenities.
[01:32:49.020 --> 01:32:51.500]   It's still a truck, but it's got a nice interior finally.
[01:32:51.500 --> 01:32:51.820]   Yeah.
[01:32:51.820 --> 01:32:54.540]   So a couple of other.
[01:32:54.540 --> 01:32:55.540]   Go ahead, Randy.
[01:32:55.540 --> 01:32:57.060]   Just just just a button.
[01:32:57.060 --> 01:32:57.820]   Just a button it up.
[01:32:57.820 --> 01:32:59.020]   It's it's an interest.
[01:32:59.020 --> 01:33:04.580]   It's a great analogy because you can use that to prove or disprove pretty much anything you want to suit
[01:33:04.580 --> 01:33:05.740]   what point you're trying to make.
[01:33:05.740 --> 01:33:12.820]   And so this is why our fear is that we is that instead of instead of the Mac being like the Ford F250,
[01:33:12.820 --> 01:33:15.620]   that is actually like the contractors actually use.
[01:33:15.700 --> 01:33:18.180]   This is like this Toyota Toyota Brat.
[01:33:18.180 --> 01:33:20.460]   Like, OK, technically you took a hatchback.
[01:33:20.460 --> 01:33:23.620]   You ripped that you ripped like the top of the roof back.
[01:33:23.620 --> 01:33:29.780]   It can basically carry five bags of groceries before the suspension bottoms out.
[01:33:29.780 --> 01:33:32.420]   So we don't we don't want like a pickup truck in.
[01:33:32.420 --> 01:33:33.820]   We don't want a truck in name only.
[01:33:33.820 --> 01:33:35.540]   We want like an actual truck.
[01:33:35.540 --> 01:33:40.740]   And I don't think that Apple's putting the the mobile devices on any kind of trajectory
[01:33:40.740 --> 01:33:42.860]   where they can do truck like things.
[01:33:45.460 --> 01:33:47.180]   Couple of points rose.
[01:33:47.180 --> 01:33:51.220]   Mary Orchard will be on next week on Mac break weekly.
[01:33:51.220 --> 01:33:53.860]   Yes, I know we love her.
[01:33:53.860 --> 01:33:56.580]   And I mentioned this briefly.
[01:33:56.580 --> 01:33:58.860]   But let me let me this is breaking news came out.
[01:33:58.860 --> 01:34:03.060]   Mark Gurman published this story on Bloomberg half an hour into the show today.
[01:34:03.060 --> 01:34:08.020]   Apple is shifting the leadership of its self driving car division.
[01:34:08.020 --> 01:34:10.020]   You may remember Bob Mansfield came back.
[01:34:10.020 --> 01:34:14.300]   Was he old COO came back and he replaced and reach you.
[01:34:14.300 --> 01:34:15.020]   Right.
[01:34:15.540 --> 01:34:17.340]   On the car project to run the car project.
[01:34:17.340 --> 01:34:26.100]   He is now fully retired and interestingly the entire car project code.
[01:34:26.100 --> 01:34:27.660]   The code name.
[01:34:27.660 --> 01:34:28.900]   What are they Titan, right?
[01:34:28.900 --> 01:34:31.420]   Titan is under John Gendreya.
[01:34:31.420 --> 01:34:38.020]   Yeah, John Andrea who came over from Google as vice president of AI strategy
[01:34:38.020 --> 01:34:39.060]   machine learning.
[01:34:39.060 --> 01:34:41.820]   He ran Google's machine learning and search teams before.
[01:34:41.820 --> 01:34:43.140]   Can I add something real quick there Leo?
[01:34:43.140 --> 01:34:46.620]   He left Google and came to Apple very vocally because he believed in ethical AI.
[01:34:46.620 --> 01:34:50.380]   And given all the news this year, I'm hoping he gets a bunch more recruits.
[01:34:50.380 --> 01:34:54.820]   Yeah, Google getting a lot of heat over firing at Timne.
[01:34:54.820 --> 01:35:00.580]   Jabru who is a woman they hired a black woman they hired to be an ethics
[01:35:00.580 --> 01:35:03.500]   researcher in AI and ethics proponent.
[01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:06.820]   And they fired her because they didn't like the paper she wrote.
[01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:10.900]   Apparently there's some dispute over what caused the firing.
[01:35:10.900 --> 01:35:12.820]   They say Google said, Oh, no, she quit.
[01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:15.140]   But yeah, you're right.
[01:35:15.140 --> 01:35:17.460]   There's a lot of questions about Google's ethics.
[01:35:17.460 --> 01:35:19.260]   They're union busting of late.
[01:35:19.260 --> 01:35:24.860]   Yeah, maybe you understand now why John Andrea went over to Apple and now he's
[01:35:24.860 --> 01:35:27.860]   running the entire more than a thousand engineers.
[01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:29.900]   No, hundreds of engineers.
[01:35:29.900 --> 01:35:30.220]   Let's see.
[01:35:30.220 --> 01:35:33.540]   It's going to be as important for the next 10 years of Apple as Johnny
[01:35:33.540 --> 01:35:36.060]   Saruji's Silicon team was for the last 10 years of Apple.
[01:35:36.060 --> 01:35:37.460]   I don't think that's an understatement.
[01:35:37.460 --> 01:35:39.260]   And he just keeps expanding.
[01:35:39.260 --> 01:35:42.260]   And it's not like Titan is not an automotive thing.
[01:35:42.260 --> 01:35:43.580]   It's an automation thing.
[01:35:43.580 --> 01:35:47.500]   It's about overlaps with AR because it's about ingesting the world around us,
[01:35:47.500 --> 01:35:49.660]   understanding it and then reacting to it.
[01:35:49.660 --> 01:35:52.620]   And we've already seen a bunch of technologies filter out from that.
[01:35:52.620 --> 01:35:55.260]   You know, like Uber just canceled their car famously.
[01:35:55.260 --> 01:35:58.380]   And I don't know if Apple will ship what we consider to be a car, but just the
[01:35:58.380 --> 01:36:03.100]   amount of cool ideas and functional features that we're getting from Titan
[01:36:03.100 --> 01:36:06.540]   every year already is super interesting and it's going to just get better.
[01:36:06.540 --> 01:36:08.500]   So is it kind of a mistake to label it?
[01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:11.140]   They're self-driving car unit and really just say Titan is there.
[01:36:11.180 --> 01:36:12.500]   It looks good in the headline.
[01:36:12.500 --> 01:36:14.260]   It's yeah, it's clumsy.
[01:36:14.260 --> 01:36:19.540]   It's sort of like how deep mind at Google, they were there.
[01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:23.660]   Brilliant project was the first artificial intelligence that could play
[01:36:23.660 --> 01:36:27.340]   the game of Go to beat one of the greatest players in the entire world.
[01:36:27.340 --> 01:36:28.740]   But that wasn't the end point.
[01:36:28.740 --> 01:36:32.620]   That was just a really good problem to try to solve if you're trying to get to
[01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:34.220]   where they were trying to get to with AI.
[01:36:34.220 --> 01:36:36.260]   Titan, I think, is the exact same thing.
[01:36:36.260 --> 01:36:41.140]   Maybe when it was formed and no company knew exactly how quickly
[01:36:41.140 --> 01:36:46.060]   you could get self-driving car technology to move forward before realizing that, no,
[01:36:46.060 --> 01:36:47.060]   we can't get.
[01:36:47.060 --> 01:36:51.340]   We can't get the car, self-driving car technology to move forward.
[01:36:51.340 --> 01:36:54.700]   But nonetheless, a lot of companies, including Apple have discovered that
[01:36:54.700 --> 01:36:59.060]   it's really, really valuable because if you give engineers practical problems to
[01:36:59.060 --> 01:37:01.900]   solve instead of just simply why don't you work on these?
[01:37:01.900 --> 01:37:02.740]   Not the other guy.
[01:37:02.740 --> 01:37:04.100]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:37:04.100 --> 01:37:08.620]   It's and like Renee was saying, it's you get AI is going to be the future of
[01:37:08.620 --> 01:37:11.620]   pretty much any technology, the backbone of anything that they do.
[01:37:11.620 --> 01:37:14.940]   It's the secret sauce is the bacon on the sandwich that if you're missing it,
[01:37:14.940 --> 01:37:17.380]   you're really not going to be able to compete.
[01:37:17.380 --> 01:37:20.820]   But also you're going to have to do a machine vision.
[01:37:20.820 --> 01:37:26.500]   You're going to have to do the ability to do create to create and build models.
[01:37:26.500 --> 01:37:29.620]   All kinds of things that they're going to need have to build is really,
[01:37:29.620 --> 01:37:34.700]   really well demonstrated by just getting a car to drive one mile from one door to
[01:37:34.700 --> 01:37:39.100]   another door without killing more than a reasonable number of people along the
[01:37:39.100 --> 01:37:39.420]   way.
[01:37:39.420 --> 01:37:44.020]   Well, and to your point, DeepMind was a chess playing machine and a go playing
[01:37:44.020 --> 01:37:44.460]   machine.
[01:37:44.460 --> 01:37:47.420]   And now it's solved protein folding.
[01:37:47.420 --> 01:37:48.860]   Wow.
[01:37:48.860 --> 01:37:56.500]   This is a massive leap in understanding proteins and development of medicines.
[01:37:56.500 --> 01:38:02.260]   And this is an example of where AI that takes you in interesting directions.
[01:38:03.260 --> 01:38:07.260]   So projects like this week, you're trying to fix your code with just by throwing
[01:38:07.260 --> 01:38:09.300]   a bunch of junk at it is terrible programming.
[01:38:09.300 --> 01:38:10.900]   But if you do it fast enough, it's really good.
[01:38:10.900 --> 01:38:19.220]   By the way, let's take a lot of humility, just knowing the tiny bit I know about,
[01:38:19.220 --> 01:38:23.500]   you know, most companies anyway, places I've worked, you know, people at the top
[01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:26.940]   in the middle get pretty committed to what we're doing, how we're doing it.
[01:38:26.940 --> 01:38:28.380]   You got the budgets, all the things.
[01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:32.980]   I bet it's, you know, it's sort of like one of those like accidentally discovering
[01:38:32.980 --> 01:38:34.900]   penicillin sort of things maybe.
[01:38:34.900 --> 01:38:40.780]   But to have the humility to say, well, this project is valuable, not because we're
[01:38:40.780 --> 01:38:44.740]   succeeding at the thing we nominally started doing, but that it's taking us
[01:38:44.740 --> 01:38:47.220]   in directions that could be valuable to other units.
[01:38:47.220 --> 01:38:47.900]   Am I wrong?
[01:38:47.900 --> 01:38:51.500]   I mean, it seems like all kinds of ways that you'd have to be a really, you'd have
[01:38:51.500 --> 01:38:57.140]   to be a really humble and open minded leader to announce that you're going to
[01:38:57.140 --> 01:39:00.260]   do this big shift because there's probably people who came to that company to quote
[01:39:00.260 --> 01:39:02.380]   unquote make a car, not to make.
[01:39:02.380 --> 01:39:07.580]   Do you think it was a shift or do you think really Tim Cook or whoever said we
[01:39:07.580 --> 01:39:13.420]   need this research lab and we're, you know, it could be whatever it's about.
[01:39:13.420 --> 01:39:16.180]   I mean, I know that we're trying to like banging on cars late at night.
[01:39:16.180 --> 01:39:17.620]   It is public.
[01:39:17.620 --> 01:39:21.020]   Like I think a lot of people went there originally as a car project and they had
[01:39:21.020 --> 01:39:24.620]   an alternate agenda of creating the next next, like they were looking at new
[01:39:24.620 --> 01:39:28.820]   interface paradigms, new languages, new systems, like because they, when they hired
[01:39:28.820 --> 01:39:30.380]   those people, did they say to them?
[01:39:30.380 --> 01:39:35.900]   It's about cars or do they say it's cars plus or do they say we're going to do some
[01:39:35.900 --> 01:39:36.260]   real.
[01:39:36.260 --> 01:39:37.420]   No, it's cars.
[01:39:37.420 --> 01:39:40.340]   But I mean, like because they weren't, they were in Sunnyvale and not in the
[01:39:40.340 --> 01:39:43.820]   mothership, they had a degree of freedom that nobody working on internal frameworks
[01:39:43.820 --> 01:39:44.420]   would ever have.
[01:39:44.420 --> 01:39:46.860]   Um, and then that didn't work out so well.
[01:39:46.860 --> 01:39:47.820]   So they got left.
[01:39:47.820 --> 01:39:48.860]   Risha went to Mansfield.
[01:39:48.860 --> 01:39:54.220]   He famously hired a Dan Dodge who was previously the head of QNIX to basically
[01:39:54.220 --> 01:39:57.420]   come to Apple and remake QNIX because you need, you need real time operating
[01:39:57.420 --> 01:39:58.660]   systems for some things.
[01:39:58.660 --> 01:40:02.260]   And he's been running the software component of that.
[01:40:02.260 --> 01:40:06.260]   And they've had various people from the auto industry running the hardware
[01:40:06.260 --> 01:40:06.540]   parts.
[01:40:06.540 --> 01:40:09.540]   And I think it's exactly like Andy said, it's like, this is a problem to solve,
[01:40:09.540 --> 01:40:11.580]   but wow, but that these other things come out of it.
[01:40:11.580 --> 01:40:12.700]   Yeah.
[01:40:12.700 --> 01:40:17.100]   Let's not ignore the fact that they did hire away some people who had just
[01:40:17.100 --> 01:40:19.060]   monster careers in the auto industry.
[01:40:19.060 --> 01:40:22.300]   So the pitch, the Steve Jobs, who really was a car.
[01:40:22.300 --> 01:40:22.700]   Yeah.
[01:40:22.700 --> 01:40:23.220]   Yeah.
[01:40:23.220 --> 01:40:26.580]   Well, yeah, so that they must have given them the famous Steve Jobs.
[01:40:26.580 --> 01:40:29.140]   Do you want to keep making sugar water to kit for kids the rest of your life?
[01:40:29.140 --> 01:40:30.100]   Or do you want to change the world?
[01:40:30.100 --> 01:40:34.460]   But let's see how many of them got converted into AI engineers, as opposed to
[01:40:34.460 --> 01:40:37.860]   really my expertise is more on drive train.
[01:40:37.860 --> 01:40:43.900]   So I don't know if a drive train technology is part of your M1 chip vision, but that if you,
[01:40:43.900 --> 01:40:48.220]   if you want to put a drive train on your next iPad boy, could I help you out there?
[01:40:48.220 --> 01:40:50.140]   And I'm sure that's all you got.
[01:40:50.140 --> 01:40:50.180]   Right.
[01:40:50.180 --> 01:40:52.780]   Like that's the easy problem to solve for this is just make a bunch of AI
[01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:53.460]   corporate shuttles.
[01:40:53.460 --> 01:40:55.300]   I think we're only the answer your question.
[01:40:55.300 --> 01:41:00.380]   Sometimes it's easy for us to anthropomorphize corporations and say, Oh, wow,
[01:41:00.380 --> 01:41:04.380]   that must have been losing face to say we're not going to do cars, but we're going to do
[01:41:04.380 --> 01:41:04.940]   something else.
[01:41:04.940 --> 01:41:08.780]   I think corporations aren't quite as human as we ascribe.
[01:41:08.780 --> 01:41:10.260]   We like to ascribe emotions to them.
[01:41:10.260 --> 01:41:12.180]   It's just a rational decision.
[01:41:12.180 --> 01:41:12.900]   Yeah.
[01:41:12.900 --> 01:41:16.500]   Cars was a bad idea, but we got all this great research and information.
[01:41:16.500 --> 01:41:18.780]   What about that is just, right?
[01:41:18.780 --> 01:41:19.900]   I don't think it takes humility.
[01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:24.980]   I think it just takes attention to the bottom line and the desire to make money
[01:41:24.980 --> 01:41:26.700]   honest, to be honest.
[01:41:26.700 --> 01:41:31.140]   And hey, that kind of thing is going to work more progressive and like a very
[01:41:31.140 --> 01:41:34.140]   progressive organization that would totally make sense.
[01:41:34.140 --> 01:41:38.540]   But again, maybe I've just worked for really retrograde companies, but I do feel
[01:41:38.540 --> 01:41:44.420]   like there's, there may not be a personality or a character on a company level.
[01:41:44.420 --> 01:41:47.100]   That would be crazy to think that even though we do think that way.
[01:41:47.100 --> 01:41:47.900]   We always do that.
[01:41:47.900 --> 01:41:48.300]   Yeah.
[01:41:48.300 --> 01:41:48.900]   We'd like to.
[01:41:48.900 --> 01:41:49.940]   Sure, absolutely.
[01:41:49.940 --> 01:41:52.460]   Like these, like, you know, I used to really feel like a
[01:41:52.460 --> 01:41:53.900]   Tevo is my friend.
[01:41:53.900 --> 01:41:54.340]   Yeah.
[01:41:54.340 --> 01:41:54.820]   Yeah.
[01:41:54.820 --> 01:41:55.860]   Apple cares about you.
[01:41:55.860 --> 01:41:56.540]   It's also interesting.
[01:41:56.540 --> 01:42:02.380]   But like Google, like the way that Google is just forever, you know, they'll
[01:42:02.380 --> 01:42:02.940]   have something now.
[01:42:02.940 --> 01:42:07.100]   Think about all the things that used to be, you know, about Google reader, Google
[01:42:07.100 --> 01:42:07.140]   Google.
[01:42:07.140 --> 01:42:10.940]   So we can even stand down to stuff like all the Google lab stuff, like Google sets,
[01:42:10.940 --> 01:42:14.100]   things that I'm pretty sure I'm the only person that ever used that.
[01:42:14.100 --> 01:42:17.340]   But like, and then they, you know, drop it, the EOL it.
[01:42:17.820 --> 01:42:20.220]   Not just for financial reasons, I imagine, but they've
[01:42:20.220 --> 01:42:21.700]   less to gotten something out of that.
[01:42:21.700 --> 01:42:26.180]   It was on prime in a lot of cities has a thing called prime now where for the
[01:42:26.180 --> 01:42:31.020]   last couple, three, four years, I guess you get two hour delivery on just a ton,
[01:42:31.020 --> 01:42:32.020]   a ton, a ton of stuff.
[01:42:32.020 --> 01:42:32.300]   Yeah.
[01:42:32.300 --> 01:42:35.820]   And at some point during the pandemic, less and less stuff was on there.
[01:42:35.820 --> 01:42:42.420]   And like you go to prime now today and there's a lot of whole foods and like maybe
[01:42:42.420 --> 01:42:47.420]   like, you get like a SD card you can buy, but you could use to be, you could get
[01:42:47.420 --> 01:42:49.100]   almost anything off of there.
[01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:52.260]   So when that happens, I always wondered, what did they learn from this that they
[01:42:52.260 --> 01:42:55.300]   they probably took something away from the prime now experiment.
[01:42:55.300 --> 01:42:57.140]   Any anybody got my back on this?
[01:42:57.140 --> 01:42:59.460]   It's like really changed a lot in the last few months.
[01:42:59.460 --> 01:43:00.460]   Has anybody else noticed that?
[01:43:00.460 --> 01:43:03.980]   I thought it was just like, I thought delivery timeline slipped
[01:43:03.980 --> 01:43:05.540]   tremendously during COVID.
[01:43:05.540 --> 01:43:10.020]   Well, they, they, they, it now seems to be mostly like a temporary storefront for
[01:43:10.020 --> 01:43:10.780]   whole foods.
[01:43:10.780 --> 01:43:14.020]   But then when you go there and you go to prime now, you get an
[01:43:14.020 --> 01:43:18.420]   interstitial saying, why don't you go to the Amazon app to do some stuff?
[01:43:18.420 --> 01:43:18.660]   No.
[01:43:18.660 --> 01:43:19.340]   Yeah.
[01:43:19.340 --> 01:43:21.340]   I mentioned there's always things to be clean, but I don't know.
[01:43:21.340 --> 01:43:23.740]   I'm just always impressed when everybody's willing to say.
[01:43:23.740 --> 01:43:29.740]   Time Warner was chastened by the failure of acquiring AOL so much that, you
[01:43:29.740 --> 01:43:34.700]   know, it's so shamed them that they said, we shouldn't really buy Warner media.
[01:43:34.700 --> 01:43:38.100]   That's, that's the last time we did this.
[01:43:38.100 --> 01:43:40.940]   No, no, they probably, they don't care.
[01:43:40.940 --> 01:43:42.660]   I don't think they're chastened.
[01:43:42.940 --> 01:43:46.420]   I think if you're maybe if you're a Japanese company, there's this concept of losing
[01:43:46.420 --> 01:43:49.740]   face, but I think American companies, it's just this glad Disney didn't buy
[01:43:49.740 --> 01:43:51.300]   accidentally don't 90% of my childhood.
[01:43:51.300 --> 01:43:52.300]   Instead of just 85.
[01:43:52.300 --> 01:43:52.540]   Yeah.
[01:43:52.540 --> 01:43:53.420]   Yeah.
[01:43:53.420 --> 01:43:58.260]   As it, as it is, as it is, I think I've been for weight in other 10 years for the
[01:43:58.260 --> 01:44:04.580]   4K digital restoration and release of the abyss and, and aliens and all the other
[01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:06.020]   Fox, Fox movies.
[01:44:06.020 --> 01:44:07.300]   Hey, I got really good news.
[01:44:07.300 --> 01:44:09.500]   I took a chance last month.
[01:44:09.820 --> 01:44:14.140]   They had a $30 deal on the Lord of the Rings trilogy and the Hobbit trilogy, but
[01:44:14.140 --> 01:44:16.060]   they were you, they were at 1080p.
[01:44:16.060 --> 01:44:20.260]   And I thought, you know, I know they're coming out in December with the 4K.
[01:44:20.260 --> 01:44:21.660]   So there's two possibilities.
[01:44:21.660 --> 01:44:22.860]   One, they're clearing them out.
[01:44:22.860 --> 01:44:27.180]   And then I'll have to buy a 4K because I've already bought these stupid movies.
[01:44:27.180 --> 01:44:27.860]   They're not even that good.
[01:44:27.860 --> 01:44:30.180]   But for some reason, I just keep buying them in all different formats.
[01:44:30.180 --> 01:44:32.340]   Uh, it's like Star Wars.
[01:44:32.340 --> 01:44:32.860]   Yeah.
[01:44:32.860 --> 01:44:33.580]   Exactly.
[01:44:33.580 --> 01:44:34.780]   That's me and Edgar Wright movies.
[01:44:34.780 --> 01:44:37.820]   I just, I think I've just, I can't stop buying Edgar Wright movies.
[01:44:37.820 --> 01:44:39.020]   I like it to me.
[01:44:39.020 --> 01:44:40.780]   The Lord of the Rings is a blue album.
[01:44:40.780 --> 01:44:42.620]   Things like just keep buying it.
[01:44:42.620 --> 01:44:42.820]   Yeah.
[01:44:42.820 --> 01:44:43.100]   Yeah.
[01:44:43.100 --> 01:44:45.380]   I have every Beatles album and 18 different copies.
[01:44:45.380 --> 01:44:49.180]   Uh, but I just figured that the Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit, maybe not good
[01:44:49.180 --> 01:44:51.220]   movies, but they're like the Wizard of Oz.
[01:44:51.220 --> 01:44:54.740]   You wouldn't probably say in hindsight what a great movie the Wizard of Oz was, but
[01:44:54.740 --> 01:44:56.380]   it was, it was an important culture.
[01:44:56.380 --> 01:44:57.620]   Anyway, I took a chance.
[01:44:57.620 --> 01:45:00.740]   I thought there is a possibility that Apple will do what they've done in the past,
[01:45:00.740 --> 01:45:02.300]   which is just upgrade me to 4K.
[01:45:02.300 --> 01:45:04.660]   And I'm very happy to say they did.
[01:45:04.660 --> 01:45:05.020]   Yeah.
[01:45:05.020 --> 01:45:05.900]   Yeah.
[01:45:06.540 --> 01:45:07.940]   So I was watching it this weekend.
[01:45:07.940 --> 01:45:09.660]   It is so, it is so beautiful.
[01:45:09.660 --> 01:45:14.380]   It's really interesting to watch on that 4K HDR screen because it's much more
[01:45:14.380 --> 01:45:18.380]   realistic and they really play up the specular highlights.
[01:45:18.380 --> 01:45:23.580]   Uh, I think Lord of the Rings was probably not, which was probably shot on film, right?
[01:45:23.580 --> 01:45:24.660]   And it was not in 4K.
[01:45:24.660 --> 01:45:25.460]   I think he was it.
[01:45:25.460 --> 01:45:26.020]   Oh, okay.
[01:45:26.020 --> 01:45:28.300]   I'm sure the Hobbit was that came.
[01:45:28.300 --> 01:45:31.980]   What, what you do for kids, such a snooty white guy thing to say, but once you get
[01:45:31.980 --> 01:45:37.660]   into the 4K UHD, especially played from media, there, I mean, like even with like
[01:45:37.660 --> 01:45:40.900]   local files on my plex, it's still not quite the same as like plastic.
[01:45:40.900 --> 01:45:42.660]   You have a UHD disc.
[01:45:42.660 --> 01:45:46.100]   Once you get into 4K UHD, it's really hard.
[01:45:46.100 --> 01:45:47.340]   The floor keeps changing.
[01:45:47.340 --> 01:45:48.420]   That's the HD on time.
[01:45:48.420 --> 01:45:50.100]   It was the HDR.
[01:45:50.100 --> 01:45:55.180]   Like I was watching Mank, the new Fincher movie, which of course, I can't wait to see
[01:45:55.180 --> 01:45:55.460]   that.
[01:45:55.460 --> 01:45:56.060]   Is it good?
[01:45:56.060 --> 01:46:00.460]   Well, it just, I really liked it a lot, but that means you watch Mindhunter again.
[01:46:00.660 --> 01:46:01.660]   Oh, I love it.
[01:46:01.660 --> 01:46:05.140]   It's like so extraordinary, the contrast that you get out of that.
[01:46:05.140 --> 01:46:06.140]   And it sounds dumb.
[01:46:06.140 --> 01:46:07.380]   My family doesn't care.
[01:46:07.380 --> 01:46:09.220]   They can't tell 720 from 4K.
[01:46:09.220 --> 01:46:09.900]   They don't care.
[01:46:09.900 --> 01:46:13.740]   They're because their phones anyway, but like I really, really, really notice.
[01:46:13.740 --> 01:46:19.220]   And in a dark room, like it's, it's, it's a, it's transformative to me in the way
[01:46:19.220 --> 01:46:21.700]   that 1080 was a decade ago.
[01:46:21.700 --> 01:46:22.620]   It's just mind blowing.
[01:46:22.620 --> 01:46:24.260]   Yeah.
[01:46:24.260 --> 01:46:25.660]   In any event.
[01:46:25.660 --> 01:46:27.060]   That's good.
[01:46:27.060 --> 01:46:29.220]   So you got upgraded on the store.
[01:46:29.220 --> 01:46:29.900]   Is that what happened?
[01:46:30.020 --> 01:46:33.820]   You bought the, I bought them and now my copies are 4K and you're right.
[01:46:33.820 --> 01:46:38.100]   They look, it's really, at first you go, I think I could see the spirit gum holding
[01:46:38.100 --> 01:46:42.780]   ganel spirit on, but, but then you learn to sit back and not look so close.
[01:46:42.780 --> 01:46:44.980]   Don't, don't, don't watch the Twilight.
[01:46:44.980 --> 01:46:47.260]   No, don't watch the prequel.
[01:46:47.260 --> 01:46:50.300]   If you watch the Star Wars prequels, they look like PlayStation two graphics now.
[01:46:50.300 --> 01:46:56.260]   You can really even, even on these and these are later, you can tell like, this is,
[01:46:56.260 --> 01:46:59.460]   that CGI, they're walking over that bridge, but that, you know, it's pretty
[01:46:59.460 --> 01:47:02.020]   obvious the distinction between practical effects hold up.
[01:47:02.020 --> 01:47:02.900]   Oh, that's practical.
[01:47:02.900 --> 01:47:03.340]   Looks good.
[01:47:03.340 --> 01:47:04.980]   The original Star Wars looks fantastic.
[01:47:04.980 --> 01:47:04.980]   Yeah.
[01:47:04.980 --> 01:47:06.060]   The practical looks good.
[01:47:06.060 --> 01:47:10.740]   When you see stuff where like, you know, this was never supposed to look, you're
[01:47:10.740 --> 01:47:11.700]   never supposed to see it.
[01:47:11.700 --> 01:47:16.660]   So this might detail on a fake TV or a bookshelf and the bookshelf could just
[01:47:16.660 --> 01:47:19.300]   all be curse words like get on the spines because it was never.
[01:47:19.300 --> 01:47:21.620]   You see now you're like, Oh my God, right?
[01:47:21.620 --> 01:47:23.300]   Everything is so much spirit gum.
[01:47:23.300 --> 01:47:24.820]   So much.
[01:47:25.700 --> 01:47:31.860]   The really wonderful thing is when you get to see like TV, TV specials, animated TV
[01:47:31.860 --> 01:47:36.580]   specials that are now being like, remastered from the original like 35 millimeter prints
[01:47:36.580 --> 01:47:42.660]   and and struck in Blu-ray or 4k because now, whenever I watch those those peanut specials,
[01:47:42.660 --> 01:47:43.620]   they don't.
[01:47:43.620 --> 01:47:48.820]   I use, I grew up seeing them like on like antenna TV with like all kinds of
[01:47:48.820 --> 01:47:50.820]   herringbone and stuff and they looked fine.
[01:47:50.820 --> 01:47:55.620]   But now like every single still frame, it looks like not just, not just a frame
[01:47:55.620 --> 01:47:56.260]   of animation.
[01:47:56.260 --> 01:47:59.220]   It looks like a photograph of a cell.
[01:47:59.220 --> 01:47:59.940]   You can tell.
[01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:01.540]   On top of another cell, what it is.
[01:48:01.540 --> 01:48:04.020]   Shadows next to them on top of the background.
[01:48:04.020 --> 01:48:06.980]   You can see and you can see like edits that they made like in the background.
[01:48:06.980 --> 01:48:11.460]   Yeah, like artifacts and lines that are blurry and yeah, I know exactly what I mean.
[01:48:11.460 --> 01:48:16.020]   I was watching the, I was watching the, I think it was the Halloween special.
[01:48:16.020 --> 01:48:20.740]   And like for the first time I noticed that there's there's scotch tape in the background.
[01:48:20.740 --> 01:48:21.380]   Those things.
[01:48:23.060 --> 01:48:27.300]   Was that like, is that like one of those like avant garde like 1960s animation things?
[01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:30.260]   Or do they really think that look, we're on a deadline.
[01:48:30.260 --> 01:48:33.220]   Nobody's going to see this when the time it gets to their bang-navax,
[01:48:33.220 --> 01:48:35.060]   scene of the Philco in their living room.
[01:48:35.060 --> 01:48:35.460]   Right.
[01:48:35.460 --> 01:48:36.820]   And yeah, but it's it's it's.
[01:48:36.820 --> 01:48:37.700]   They're also edited.
[01:48:37.700 --> 01:48:41.140]   Remember Andy, they were edited within an inch of their life over the years.
[01:48:41.140 --> 01:48:43.220]   Like almost as bad as like Warner Brothers cartoon.
[01:48:43.220 --> 01:48:46.500]   They had to make room for more room for these more hostess, more hostess.
[01:48:46.500 --> 01:48:47.380]   Yeah, more.
[01:48:47.380 --> 01:48:48.420]   Oh, no, no, take out.
[01:48:48.420 --> 01:48:50.100]   Not saying or tell me Madison.
[01:48:50.100 --> 01:48:55.940]   Yeah, not only that though, there's to get the rat home music ready, but not only that,
[01:48:55.940 --> 01:48:59.940]   but there's there's a really wonderful like side by side video of like the Charlie Brown
[01:48:59.940 --> 01:49:02.580]   Christmas was such a rush job.
[01:49:02.580 --> 01:49:04.980]   And they just they got in by the skin of their teeth.
[01:49:04.980 --> 01:49:09.700]   And when it came to success, they got the money to fix problems that were always there or like
[01:49:09.700 --> 01:49:14.580]   do changes things like at the end where the entire peanut gang is like greeting,
[01:49:14.580 --> 01:49:16.580]   greeting Charlie Brown next to the Christmas tree.
[01:49:16.580 --> 01:49:19.380]   The entire gang says, Merry Christmas, Charlie Brown.
[01:49:19.380 --> 01:49:23.860]   And then at some point later on, they realized that, oh, Snoopy is not a talking dog.
[01:49:23.860 --> 01:49:27.780]   Snoopy should not Snoopy's mouth should not be saying Merry Christmas, Charlie Brown.
[01:49:27.780 --> 01:49:32.340]   And so they reanimated that part of it to make sure that he's just like smiling nicely.
[01:49:32.340 --> 01:49:33.940]   And there's all kinds of things like that.
[01:49:33.940 --> 01:49:39.540]   But yeah, I love that such a great point that so especially with movies where nobody was even
[01:49:39.540 --> 01:49:42.500]   like the prince that they were going to be making and sending to theaters.
[01:49:42.500 --> 01:49:48.420]   Nobody was intending people to have this kind of resolution or the ability to stop at any one
[01:49:48.420 --> 01:49:51.620]   given frame and be able to examine things this way.
[01:49:51.620 --> 01:49:57.940]   And like 1960 movies like Matt Payne, I saw a Disney movie that I just ripped last night.
[01:49:57.940 --> 01:50:02.820]   And the Matt paintings are so obvious like there's like a halo around.
[01:50:02.820 --> 01:50:04.340]   This is where the live action is.
[01:50:04.340 --> 01:50:08.100]   This is where the person's gonna this is where the lady walking the dog is going to find an
[01:50:08.100 --> 01:50:13.540]   excuse to stop and pet the dog because in two more steps she's gonna leave the live area of the
[01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:19.140]   Matt painting. And I just, I always wonder how these filmmakers feel about like, you know what,
[01:50:19.140 --> 01:50:24.580]   could we just like down master this? Just like there are these filters when they went
[01:50:24.580 --> 01:50:30.820]   in a rainstorm? Like they do with sometimes when they don't have a big CGI budget, you could like
[01:50:30.820 --> 01:50:35.620]   put it in a snare storm or a rainstorm. Citizen Kane, I think the Matt still look really good.
[01:50:35.620 --> 01:50:41.700]   I got a real version of that. But the openings with like the castle up on the hill, they're just
[01:50:41.700 --> 01:50:45.780]   they're just extraordinary. Look, it's gonna be a new, this is a whole new thing is to rewatch
[01:50:45.780 --> 01:50:51.620]   everything in super high res 4k. And and and and I think to some degree what I ended up doing with
[01:50:51.620 --> 01:50:57.620]   the Lord of the Rings was just kind of defocusing and backing up a little bit and just because
[01:50:57.620 --> 01:51:02.900]   all those movies, you know, with 24 frames a second, it's gonna give a dream like kind of
[01:51:02.900 --> 01:51:08.980]   smoothness and lyrical feeling to it. And so all you know, Citizen Kane is 24 frames. So
[01:51:08.980 --> 01:51:15.620]   you make it more crisp, you make it 60 or 120 frames. Yeah, you're gonna lose all that lyrical
[01:51:15.620 --> 01:51:20.900]   beauty. They would. But you can defocus your eyes is what I'm saying. Yeah, just across them.
[01:51:20.900 --> 01:51:26.260]   But it goes through some of the things that those of us who like her now buying the comics that
[01:51:26.260 --> 01:51:32.420]   we bought in the 1980s that were on cheap terrible newsprint with like cheap, really terrible,
[01:51:32.420 --> 01:51:37.940]   cheap printing that now we get to now we get to do them out see them on on comixology where
[01:51:37.940 --> 01:51:43.060]   they're taking the original stats of the original like the original line art and digitally recoloring
[01:51:43.060 --> 01:51:48.500]   them and you can zoom in like far beyond what you can see on the because I have some original
[01:51:48.500 --> 01:51:52.580]   art pages, but this is like far beyond that. And I'm reading some of my favorite comics again and
[01:51:52.580 --> 01:51:58.500]   then saying, wait a minute, is there three arms on that character that they've three?
[01:51:59.140 --> 01:52:03.060]   How did I not notice there are three arms on that character and the character is supposed to have
[01:52:03.060 --> 01:52:08.420]   two arms by the way? So there's all smudgy and dark after like a month after a month, it was
[01:52:08.420 --> 01:52:13.700]   all just like a party gets the no cries. I want to send that again and see.
[01:52:13.700 --> 01:52:22.980]   Lidobi Lightroom is out now for M1 by the way. As of today, you can upgrade. I shall be going
[01:52:22.980 --> 01:52:28.100]   home and doing that. Actually, I sent a snotty note to Adobe because I wasn't able to install it.
[01:52:28.740 --> 01:52:38.580]   It said, I'm sorry, you can't install on a mixed case, Apple APFS format. You have to have
[01:52:38.580 --> 01:52:46.420]   yeah, it was like, dudes, you can't, you're telling me that case sensitive, you can't, it doesn't work?
[01:52:46.420 --> 01:52:52.260]   Apparently not. So I sent him a note saying thanks, you know, but my subscription was a year long
[01:52:52.260 --> 01:52:57.220]   subscription. So I'll get to try it. You know what, if Lightroom really runs beautifully on an M1,
[01:52:57.860 --> 01:53:04.420]   they may, they may save me after all. But geez, I couldn't upgrade Photoshop because I had foolishly
[01:53:04.420 --> 01:53:11.940]   formatted my hard drive case sensitive and it suddenly wouldn't work. Yeah.
[01:53:11.940 --> 01:53:18.660]   Strange. Yeah. Case sensitive. You know how you can format?
[01:53:18.660 --> 01:53:22.340]   Yeah, I'm trying to think, I don't even know, I feel like I would bollocks that up really bad.
[01:53:22.340 --> 01:53:25.380]   I formatted a lot of stuff lately. I'm trying to, so that means...
[01:53:25.380 --> 01:53:29.620]   One would assume that you would want case sensitive so that, you know, you could have lower case
[01:53:29.620 --> 01:53:34.500]   and upper case and there'd be two different file names, but apparently the Adobe assumes that
[01:53:34.500 --> 01:53:38.980]   something with the file name doesn't matter what the case is, it's the same file and
[01:53:38.980 --> 01:53:45.380]   that was the error message I got. I said, no, I can't install on it. Maybe there's a workaround.
[01:53:45.380 --> 01:53:47.940]   I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. You know what I mean, if you all tried the affinity
[01:53:47.940 --> 01:53:52.740]   things like affinity designer, have you tried that? No, I think that's the thing. That was,
[01:53:52.740 --> 01:53:56.660]   that was the part of the snotty note I sent to Adobe is. Thanks to
[01:53:56.660 --> 01:54:02.980]   Finiti and, you know, Serif and plenty of other wonderful companies doing amazing stuff.
[01:54:02.980 --> 01:54:09.780]   I don't really need you anymore. I wasn't, I mean, what do I subscribe to? I think I subscribe to
[01:54:09.780 --> 01:54:15.300]   Lightroom, which I barely open. It's kind of, I don't say wasted money, but like on the iPad,
[01:54:15.300 --> 01:54:22.420]   I really like Pixelmator photo. I think it's called the one that's got the machine learning stuff.
[01:54:22.420 --> 01:54:26.740]   That's a mind boggling application that I run all my good photos through.
[01:54:26.740 --> 01:54:31.540]   But I realized I love Acorn and that's kind of my Photoshop. I love it. Acorn's fun. I know.
[01:54:31.540 --> 01:54:37.540]   I love it. But I don't, I realized I needed to do something for work. And I realized I don't even
[01:54:37.540 --> 01:54:42.820]   remember the last time that I even owned a vector program. And I asked a bunch of people online.
[01:54:42.820 --> 01:54:47.300]   I said it's an almost every single person said affinity designer. And I opened it up and I was
[01:54:47.300 --> 01:54:53.380]   like, this is bananas. It's just wild to me that like, I wouldn't, I don't want to be mean,
[01:54:53.380 --> 01:54:56.740]   but Adobe in some ways kind of feels like it's become a little bit like Microsoft,
[01:54:56.740 --> 01:55:01.780]   where they really want you to buy like the big ball of all the things and subscribe Adobe 365
[01:55:01.780 --> 01:55:05.860]   for the enterprise or whatever. But like, and these are just so they're, they're, they work on all
[01:55:05.860 --> 01:55:10.340]   the different platforms. They're just happy, easy to use that. I guess what I'm saying is,
[01:55:10.340 --> 01:55:13.860]   I'm so glad there's people out there still hustling. I'm so grateful for the panics.
[01:55:13.860 --> 01:55:18.580]   I'm grateful for the affinities. Obviously, Rogan, me, Bob, you know, rules everything around.
[01:55:18.580 --> 01:55:23.700]   Pixel Mater is amazing. I mean, and these companies are one iPad though with the machine learning
[01:55:23.700 --> 01:55:29.460]   enhancements and stuff like that. You don't like it. Oh, you do like it. No, no, no, for photos.
[01:55:29.460 --> 01:55:32.580]   That's great. Pixel Mater photo. I wish they would release it for the Mac. I don't know why
[01:55:32.580 --> 01:55:39.060]   they haven't. I love Pixel Mater photo. I could do stuff. It's like, what? I'm deleting a fence in
[01:55:39.060 --> 01:55:43.460]   the middle of my photo. It is crazy. Yeah. A lot of my best lizard photos go through that.
[01:55:43.460 --> 01:55:46.500]   Yeah, me too. Yeah. Case sensitive.
[01:55:46.500 --> 01:55:50.820]   Case sensitive lizard. Case sensitive drives not supported.
[01:55:50.820 --> 01:55:56.980]   Their solution installed the product onto an HFS plus or a non case sensitive drive.
[01:55:56.980 --> 01:56:02.500]   Thank you, Adobe. Screw you. I saw a great comment from Thomas Frank on this where he said,
[01:56:02.500 --> 01:56:06.580]   like, since they moved to subscription, they're incentivized to continually add more apps. So,
[01:56:06.580 --> 01:56:10.260]   to make the bundle more valuable instead of fixing the apps to increase the value of the
[01:56:10.260 --> 01:56:14.980]   subscription. And their new icons are indecipherable to me. I can't tell which blue icon is which app
[01:56:14.980 --> 01:56:22.180]   anymore. There's a guy on GitHub who has a fix, but his name is Nacho Libre. So, I'm not sure.
[01:56:22.180 --> 01:56:31.140]   Not even one of the better check. Not sure if I should try this. Actually, it makes sense.
[01:56:31.140 --> 01:56:35.940]   You just make a little sparse bundle volume and you can put it on there.
[01:56:37.140 --> 01:56:39.620]   Oh boy. There's so many stories and we're going to running out of time here.
[01:56:39.620 --> 01:56:43.380]   Because I want more money to come back. I don't want him to think this is one of those shows
[01:56:43.380 --> 01:56:46.740]   that just goes on and on and on forever. Oh, no, no, no. I got nowhere to be.
[01:56:46.740 --> 01:56:53.220]   Real quickly. I'm sure my lizard. You can see my beautiful boy. I want to see lizards. Do you,
[01:56:53.220 --> 01:56:57.860]   what kind of lizards do you have? It's a bearded dragon. He's a very sweet precious angel.
[01:56:57.860 --> 01:57:00.660]   What is it? Is it the kids that made you a footer account?
[01:57:00.660 --> 01:57:06.980]   Same kids that made you do that? Oh, I, you know, to quote,
[01:57:06.980 --> 01:57:11.700]   "Sign fall. They only wake me for the important meetings." I don't really have a role. I find out
[01:57:11.700 --> 01:57:15.780]   about things sometimes on the ride home or something. That's how we got a cat. That's how we get.
[01:57:15.780 --> 01:57:19.380]   The lizard though, I have to say, I was pretty into. What's this? A bearded dragon.
[01:57:19.380 --> 01:57:22.820]   What's this? What's this Twitter handle? Bando Mando.
[01:57:22.820 --> 01:57:26.020]   Bando Mando. M-A-N-N-D-O.
[01:57:26.020 --> 01:57:31.460]   Oh, two ends. Two ends in the Mando. There he is. Like a commando.
[01:57:31.460 --> 01:57:36.100]   It's a great pet. It's a very manageable pet. These are beautiful.
[01:57:36.100 --> 01:57:39.220]   These are beautiful. Yeah, I would probably say through Pixelmator.
[01:57:39.220 --> 01:57:44.420]   Look at that. He just glows. He's glowing right now. He's very sleepy.
[01:57:44.420 --> 01:57:50.500]   He's glowing. Yeah. Is he golden? He's very special.
[01:57:51.300 --> 01:57:55.700]   You take him on walks? Do you have a leash? I don't want to talk about it.
[01:57:55.700 --> 01:58:01.140]   I see him out in the world. Oh, that's my lady friend. Like sticking to the park.
[01:58:01.140 --> 01:58:07.140]   He's like, "It's good to meet you." Good to meet women. Sure. Hello, ladies.
[01:58:07.140 --> 01:58:15.620]   I would have found my lizard. Sir, you should leave. Please be extremely socially distanced from me.
[01:58:15.620 --> 01:58:23.060]   Take your lizard and leave, sir. Bando Mando. He's a precious angel. He's a precious, precious angel.
[01:58:23.060 --> 01:58:29.940]   Yeah. He really gets around too. Are you putting him in the food saver? Are you suveeding him?
[01:58:29.940 --> 01:58:37.140]   Oh, yeah. Yeah. Actually, he finds bats very reliable. He likes those warm bats.
[01:58:37.140 --> 01:58:45.940]   What temperature is what temperature should I set the sous vide for?
[01:58:45.940 --> 01:58:53.220]   Oh, for what? I track this. For a lizard. Not to eat him. Not to cook him. Just to keep him
[01:58:53.220 --> 01:58:57.540]   country. I would say 133 if you want to meet him there. That's rare. That's a medium real
[01:58:57.540 --> 01:59:00.820]   lizard. Okay. Okay. Good. Put in some time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:59:02.820 --> 01:59:12.100]   Big, big, big, big, big security flaw discovered on the iPhone, fortunately patched by Apple back
[01:59:12.100 --> 01:59:17.620]   in May. So we can talk about it now, but it was discovered by Google's Project Zero.
[01:59:17.620 --> 01:59:23.540]   Is this the DOS thing with all the phones getting shut off? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:59:23.540 --> 01:59:30.180]   Lifi packets of death. Dan Gooden and ours. Technica called it one of the most breathtaking
[01:59:30.180 --> 01:59:35.700]   hacks ever because you could do it to anybody without getting their phone, without getting them to do
[01:59:35.700 --> 01:59:40.980]   anything. It could be through a wall as long as you're within wifi access of an iPhone. But
[01:59:40.980 --> 01:59:46.340]   that's not the worst part. That's not the way it was a buffer overflow bug in a driver for the
[01:59:46.340 --> 01:59:53.860]   Apple mesh networking protocol, the thing that makes airdrop work, AWDL. It's of course in Ring Zero.
[01:59:53.860 --> 02:00:02.580]   It's a kernel level driver. And it parses those packets in Ring Zero. So the exploit was transmitted
[02:00:02.580 --> 02:00:08.420]   over the air, but worse, it was wormable because of airdrop. So once you get it on somebody's iPhone,
[02:00:08.420 --> 02:00:15.780]   let's say you want to invade the Israeli embassy, you get it on some low level clerks iPhone while
[02:00:15.780 --> 02:00:22.100]   he's out getting a cup of coffee, he goes back in the embassy and it then exploits every single phone
[02:00:22.740 --> 02:00:26.820]   in the embassy without you doing anything. Yeah.
[02:00:26.820 --> 02:00:32.580]   And Merle wasn't that the most incredible, the most bone chilling demonstration where
[02:00:32.580 --> 02:00:38.340]   we usually post script all these all these explanations with, oh yeah, but the guy has to
[02:00:38.340 --> 02:00:42.340]   would have to have physical proximity, physical access to your phone to be able to plug something
[02:00:42.340 --> 02:00:48.020]   in. No, the demo is here is a pile of phones, a pile of like a dozen and a half phones that are
[02:00:48.020 --> 02:00:52.340]   like launched and running and have the have the launch right on. And then this little this little
[02:00:52.340 --> 02:00:57.380]   apparatus done on piece of phone core, push one button and suddenly each one of them starts to
[02:00:57.380 --> 02:01:04.260]   whenever we see, whenever we see phones arrayed like that, it's usually to demonstrate over time,
[02:01:04.260 --> 02:01:08.900]   how it's faster and faster to turn them on. For example, like you see this YouTubers is amazing,
[02:01:08.900 --> 02:01:12.020]   kind of like ambidextrous YouTubers that are showing you before and after some things,
[02:01:12.020 --> 02:01:15.540]   whenever you see that you're like, Oh, I wonder which one turns on the fastest. This is the opposite
[02:01:15.540 --> 02:01:20.260]   of that. This is like this little PC over here just shoots a signal over here. And then we see how
[02:01:20.260 --> 02:01:26.820]   fast they can all go off. Yeah, terrifying. The good news is Apple fixed this in iOS 13 5.
[02:01:26.820 --> 02:01:33.060]   That's the one where the COVID-19 tracing API was installed. I presume all of you have updated.
[02:01:33.060 --> 02:01:38.900]   I've learned with dismay that Georgia Dao is not updating her iPhone. Does update your iPhone.
[02:01:38.900 --> 02:01:43.300]   If you're on iOS 14, you updated to this. She just doesn't update apps.
[02:01:43.300 --> 02:01:47.220]   Okay, that's fine. You don't have to update your apps. But if you're on iOS 14, you're okay. If
[02:01:47.220 --> 02:01:51.860]   you're on 13 5 or later, you're okay. The emoji updates come out. Everybody updates for the
[02:01:51.860 --> 02:01:57.060]   emotion. Oh, there you go. So we know you've got iOS 14. You're you're good.
[02:01:57.060 --> 02:02:00.740]   Otherwise you have all those little box question mark things and it's just untenable.
[02:02:00.740 --> 02:02:07.460]   The good you know, so here's the deal. The good thing is completely patched. The bad thing is,
[02:02:07.460 --> 02:02:12.900]   this is as bad as an attack can be. Yes. And it and as much as we would like to say,
[02:02:12.900 --> 02:02:18.420]   oh, our iPhones are secure. We're just lucky that this was discovered by projects. I hope it was
[02:02:18.420 --> 02:02:22.100]   discovered by Project Zero before it was discovered by somebody else. I wouldn't be surprised if.
[02:02:22.100 --> 02:02:25.940]   Yeah, this is one of those things where it's really best to say to have two asterisks on
[02:02:25.940 --> 02:02:31.060]   that statement, a lot like quote unquote testing negative for COVID. Right. I think what you say
[02:02:31.060 --> 02:02:38.740]   is the iPhone is secure as far as I know for now. Yeah. Yeah. You know, the Brishnair kind of thing.
[02:02:38.740 --> 02:02:42.180]   Like, you know, just don't act like don't act like as you know, the White House was doing this
[02:02:42.180 --> 02:02:46.900]   God love them, where they would just be like they acted like testing before you meet the
[02:02:46.900 --> 02:02:50.980]   president was like a policy for dealing with this. And it's like, well, no, well, what we're
[02:02:50.980 --> 02:02:55.060]   it's like, it's like using your your backup camera on your car to find out if you're going to get
[02:02:55.060 --> 02:03:00.820]   hit next week. We need to know we're going to find out later. Then the
[02:03:00.900 --> 02:03:05.220]   now you got Rudy Giuliani out there. So take off the bumper because you have a camera for next week.
[02:03:05.220 --> 02:03:11.620]   This is also a demonstration of how important it is to have organizations like Project Zero
[02:03:11.620 --> 02:03:19.780]   and also ample generous like bug bounties because the value of this ex-boy would have
[02:03:19.780 --> 02:03:25.620]   would have been just this is this is like in a this is exactly like one of those when those
[02:03:25.620 --> 02:03:29.700]   hacker movies where one of their friends just suddenly disappears off the face of the earth and
[02:03:29.700 --> 02:03:33.940]   they think they've been killed. But no, it's just that some organized crime or some foreign
[02:03:33.940 --> 02:03:39.300]   government has given them like a 800 million dollars plus a brand new identity in exchange
[02:03:39.300 --> 02:03:44.660]   for the his hack against all encryption known to mankind. This would have been the sort of thing
[02:03:44.660 --> 02:03:49.300]   where yeah, this is this is this is the sort of thing where the government suddenly says, you know
[02:03:49.300 --> 02:03:53.860]   what, we're not going to let you publish this paper. We're actually going to make this a classified
[02:03:53.860 --> 02:03:58.660]   document that only our people get access to because this is way way too valuable for us to let
[02:03:58.660 --> 02:04:02.020]   anybody else have it. And it's also way too valuable for you to do anything.
[02:04:02.020 --> 02:04:06.740]   There's also two valuable for you to do anything naughty like tell apple about it so that they
[02:04:06.740 --> 02:04:10.980]   can close this hole that we absolutely want to be able to exploit without warrants.
[02:04:10.980 --> 02:04:18.100]   Let's get our final break in and then your picks of the week. My friends, this has been so much
[02:04:18.100 --> 02:04:23.700]   fun. Marlin, I love seeing you again. So great. I'll give you a list of questions.
[02:04:24.660 --> 02:04:29.860]   Be with my ex. It's very it's very hard. I never got to podcast much with Marlin.
[02:04:29.860 --> 02:04:34.260]   I'm making up for last time. Yeah. Yeah, you came here. You by the both you guys are the post
[02:04:34.260 --> 02:04:39.860]   Merlin era. Yeah, you guys made the show. No, no, I was at the tail end of the
[02:04:39.860 --> 02:04:46.980]   room. I remember because I remember the producer used to like have a guess both in on the call
[02:04:46.980 --> 02:04:52.100]   before like well, you still have like another 10 or 15 minutes to go. And so you guys were
[02:04:52.100 --> 02:04:56.500]   just like have a side talk. Yeah, that's really nice. Yeah, but like it was like having two two
[02:04:56.500 --> 02:05:02.980]   Robin Williams is just what the world needs. Sounds good. But yeah, you don't want you don't
[02:05:02.980 --> 02:05:10.020]   want that on a plane and you're in the middle seat. Oh, a couple of shows on Dan Benjamin's
[02:05:10.020 --> 02:05:15.860]   five by five network at five by five. TV back to work. You do that with Danny been doing that since
[02:05:15.860 --> 02:05:22.820]   2011. That's awesome. And rek rek, rek, unsilable different. How do you say that over and over
[02:05:22.820 --> 02:05:26.580]   yet? I think that's a show your listeners might like because everybody likes John Syracuse.
[02:05:26.580 --> 02:05:31.220]   You get a whole army of flying monkeys. Yeah, reconcilable differences on relay.
[02:05:31.220 --> 02:05:35.380]   Even you can't say it. And Tom broke out. We'd have so much trouble with it.
[02:05:35.380 --> 02:05:37.460]   We're going to solve it. We're going to solve it.
[02:05:37.460 --> 02:05:45.300]   Shivers. What are I going to? I love these people. There should be word for these people
[02:05:45.300 --> 02:05:49.220]   whose names are perfect for doing like the impression of them like Tom.
[02:05:49.220 --> 02:05:57.860]   Oh, yeah. I'm Tom broke. Oh, and they are all are shown today brought to you by the fabulous
[02:05:57.860 --> 02:06:04.020]   net suite from Oracle. If you are one of those people who is struggling and anybody who's running
[02:06:04.020 --> 02:06:09.140]   a business probably is one of those people is struggling. We had to get Lisa a giant
[02:06:10.020 --> 02:06:16.340]   I think it was a 59 inch screen so that she could look at all the different documents and things
[02:06:16.340 --> 02:06:22.260]   she had to look at all at once so that she could get the job done. If you're struggling with combining
[02:06:22.260 --> 02:06:28.580]   all of the different inputs you need into one's place so you can decide what to do with your
[02:06:28.580 --> 02:06:37.220]   business, then you've got to take a look at net suite by Oracle. And that suite is a wonderful
[02:06:37.220 --> 02:06:44.180]   solution for people who have to deal with. I mean, it's just endless. I watch Lisa doing this.
[02:06:44.180 --> 02:06:51.220]   You got your finance financial reports. You've got your HR. You've got your inventory, your e-commerce.
[02:06:51.220 --> 02:06:56.980]   And you're trying to figure it all out. You may not realize it, but QuickBooks spread sheets
[02:06:56.980 --> 02:07:01.620]   that big wide screen that's slowing you down. If you're tired of working on multiple platforms,
[02:07:01.620 --> 02:07:05.700]   you want to take your business to the next level. Now's the time to upgrade in that suite.
[02:07:06.260 --> 02:07:11.780]   It's enough difficulty these days, especially running a small or medium sized business that's
[02:07:11.780 --> 02:07:17.780]   growing fast. You need a solution that's evolving with you. NetSuite's the number one cloud business
[02:07:17.780 --> 02:07:23.300]   system. It gives you cloud based solutions. It streamlines mission critical business processes.
[02:07:23.300 --> 02:07:28.660]   It reduces IT costs. It allows you to easily scale and future proof your business with an agile
[02:07:28.660 --> 02:07:34.980]   business platform that evolves as your needs change. You can close with confidence, accelerate
[02:07:34.980 --> 02:07:38.820]   your financial clothes, maintain compliance with accounting standards. You can report with
[02:07:38.820 --> 02:07:43.540]   accuracy. Financial accuracy is, well, it's the whole game. Drill down into the underlying
[02:07:43.540 --> 02:07:48.740]   details. Understand what's impacting your business. Get real time information, which will really
[02:07:48.740 --> 02:07:55.060]   improve your ability to make decisions. Real time metrics, role based dashboards, so you're never in
[02:07:55.060 --> 02:08:00.260]   the dark about how your business is going. I'll give you an example. There's plenty on the
[02:08:00.260 --> 02:08:06.420]   website, netsuite.com/twit. Take a look at Comvault. They turned in NetSuite's cloud solution
[02:08:06.420 --> 02:08:11.060]   as a platform that could dramatically reduce complexity and provide much needed agility.
[02:08:11.060 --> 02:08:17.060]   They use the Sweet Cloud development platform and it's let them support their unique processes
[02:08:17.060 --> 02:08:21.940]   and integrate with third party cloud applications. Apps from NetSuite partners
[02:08:21.940 --> 02:08:25.940]   round out the company's updated environment. SolarWinds uses NetSuite. They said,
[02:08:25.940 --> 02:08:29.620]   "We needed more than just a good accounting solution. We had to responsibly manage growth.
[02:08:30.260 --> 02:08:35.220]   And NetSuite provided the business application infrastructure to do exactly that. Stop paying
[02:08:35.220 --> 02:08:41.060]   for multiple systems. Get NetSuite." That's what 22,000 companies now have done. They're already
[02:08:41.060 --> 02:08:45.780]   using NetSuite. Why aren't you? You can find out more. Let NetSuite show you how they'll benefit

[02:08:59.060 --> 02:09:06.500]   We thank you so much for supporting MacBreak Weekly. I thank you for supporting MacBreak Weekly
[02:09:06.500 --> 02:09:14.900]   by using that special address that kind of sends in the signal that you saw out here. NetSuite.com/twit.
[02:09:14.900 --> 02:09:18.100]   I'll let you start, Merlin. You haven't done a pic of the week in a long time.
[02:09:19.700 --> 02:09:23.380]   Take us back to the old days. I want to recommend an app for
[02:09:23.380 --> 02:09:30.420]   today on Woodversion you get long story short for the Mac and iOS called Solver. Soulv-er.
[02:09:30.420 --> 02:09:34.900]   That's solver.app. If you say so.
[02:09:34.900 --> 02:09:43.300]   Sorry, real quick. My wife is texting me. So I love spreadsheets. And spreadsheets are great.
[02:09:43.300 --> 02:09:48.660]   And I really like spreadsheets. It's kind of my spirit animal. I love doing things with spreadsheets.
[02:09:48.660 --> 02:09:54.180]   But there are some instances where it feels a little heavy to have to begin in this cell with
[02:09:54.180 --> 02:09:59.780]   equals that cell. Solver is what do they call it? A playground for math or a playground for numbers.
[02:09:59.780 --> 02:10:03.220]   Does this is what I use spreadsheets for, but I wouldn't have to with this.
[02:10:03.220 --> 02:10:09.700]   What's a very lightweight method for? We'll start at the most basic. You just say 2 plus 2. And then
[02:10:09.700 --> 02:10:13.380]   over on the right side it tells you that's 4. But you can also have variables. You can do
[02:10:13.380 --> 02:10:20.100]   transformations. And that's really where it comes in handy for me. So I don't remember how to transform
[02:10:20.100 --> 02:10:26.020]   things. And so not currency so much because I don't have to worry about that. But for example,
[02:10:26.020 --> 02:10:31.940]   date math. I want to know how many hours between this day and that day. I want to know what's
[02:10:31.940 --> 02:10:38.420]   another one recently. Oh yeah. How many megabits per I want to see show me 550 megabits per second.
[02:10:38.420 --> 02:10:44.020]   And then the key word as as kill a kill a bit. She wants to talk to you now.
[02:10:44.020 --> 02:10:53.620]   Desperately trying to get through. That might ring again. You know another reason of AT&T. If you buy
[02:10:53.620 --> 02:10:59.860]   their their coolest band blocking service, it only works with it if it's on your wrist. If it's
[02:10:59.860 --> 02:11:05.380]   not on your wrist, it uses a regular old number. And then people just bug you. That's a nice thing.
[02:11:05.380 --> 02:11:09.460]   So anyway, but this is it's so fun to play with. And on the one hand, it's great because you can
[02:11:09.460 --> 02:11:13.620]   just jump right in and start using this and it would be very handy to you. But you know,
[02:11:13.620 --> 02:11:18.820]   anything where you think of needing a combination of sort of a calculator, a lightweight calculator
[02:11:18.820 --> 02:11:26.660]   combined with something like a converter of some kind. And Solver 3, which is for Mac only,
[02:11:26.660 --> 02:11:31.460]   now has subtotals, which is amazing. So you basically get like your intape. Go check it out.
[02:11:31.460 --> 02:11:36.340]   Solver. It's great. I love it. I've used this on iOS. Yeah, for a long time. I didn't realize they
[02:11:36.340 --> 02:11:43.060]   even had a Mac app. It's $30 one time only. But you can try it for a week or two free and see if
[02:11:43.060 --> 02:11:49.540]   if you like it. So you L V E R and you informed me before the show, I thought because it's like
[02:11:49.540 --> 02:11:57.140]   solving things. It was a solution tool. It was S O L U. So I've been calling it Solover.
[02:11:57.780 --> 02:12:02.180]   Solver all this time it's over. So you will like it has some soul.
[02:12:02.180 --> 02:12:06.420]   This is the problem with the internet. The problem with the end one of the problem.
[02:12:06.420 --> 02:12:10.820]   Well, one of the problems with the internet, let's be honest, is that I could be very well
[02:12:10.820 --> 02:12:14.580]   acquainted with someone. I would consider them a dear friend. And maybe I don't know how to
[02:12:14.580 --> 02:12:18.660]   pronounce their name, even though I've known them for 10 years. I was there was a time when I just
[02:12:18.660 --> 02:12:23.060]   you never hear a word out loud. And you feel like, oh, I don't know how you pronounce that.
[02:12:23.060 --> 02:12:30.740]   How you say that? Can you do that like handkill now? Oh, it's like books. Sorry, Renee.
[02:12:30.740 --> 02:12:34.900]   So that's like books too. And I read books as a kid. Oh, yeah. The character of the house. And
[02:12:34.900 --> 02:12:38.820]   then you see the movie and you're like, really? You never really? Oh, yeah. I'm reading, uh,
[02:12:38.820 --> 02:12:45.380]   Oh, bem is biography right now. And he says, oh, yeah, he said, yeah,
[02:12:45.380 --> 02:12:51.540]   remember him and Pericabammo. Yeah, yeah, he says that's yeah. Well, actually, it's Bericasein.
[02:12:51.540 --> 02:13:01.460]   A lot of people leave doctors. Hey, I miss your Jerry Lewis. It's been a long time. Hey, I think I'm
[02:13:01.460 --> 02:13:07.780]   going to start specializing in the unnecessary unrequested, one syllable impression of a syllombic.
[02:13:07.780 --> 02:13:10.660]   It's very good. You want to see my brother-in-law? I do a really good impression of my brother-in-law.
[02:13:10.660 --> 02:13:11.060]   Yeah, please.
[02:13:14.500 --> 02:13:17.700]   That's a visual impression for those. Yeah, it's a visual impression. Yeah, sorry.
[02:13:17.700 --> 02:13:24.260]   You can imagine. No, but Obama said that because he was book learned, he did not
[02:13:24.260 --> 02:13:28.580]   apparent anything. And he never bothered looking up the pronunciation. I think that's an uncommon
[02:13:28.580 --> 02:13:31.220]   thing. Renee, what's your pick of the week this week?
[02:13:31.220 --> 02:13:37.140]   So I have two. And they're not by no means are they new picks, but I think like they've been
[02:13:37.140 --> 02:13:42.980]   new and Lee reinvented with M1 Max because they are just so fast. And the first one is Apple's
[02:13:42.980 --> 02:13:48.020]   Final Cut Pro. We've talked about it a lot. It's $300, but they've done, I can't even tell now,
[02:13:48.020 --> 02:13:52.660]   10 years of updates or something for free. So once you buy it, it's basically a one-time purchase,
[02:13:52.660 --> 02:13:57.700]   and then they just keep making it better. But it is so fast on the M1 Max. And of course,
[02:13:57.700 --> 02:14:02.100]   it is because Apple's controlling the silicon, although they threw up the bits through the pixels,
[02:14:02.100 --> 02:14:06.420]   just everything. But when you hit that render button, that export button, when you bounce that
[02:14:06.420 --> 02:14:12.020]   sucker, it is just every atom in that machine firing through the most optimized pipelines
[02:14:12.020 --> 02:14:18.180]   imaginable to get you time to work completion done. If you don't want to spend money on Final Cut Pro
[02:14:18.180 --> 02:14:23.300]   though, DaVinci Resolve has also done a yeoman's job at getting their software moved over and
[02:14:23.300 --> 02:14:30.420]   moving over to M1. And the basic version is absolutely free. I use Final Cut because Resolve
[02:14:30.420 --> 02:14:34.740]   just doesn't fit my brain model of how things should work. But a lot of people love it. They use
[02:14:34.740 --> 02:14:40.020]   it for everything. The color grading is unbelievable in DaVinci Resolve. They have a nodal editor,
[02:14:40.020 --> 02:14:45.460]   and it's just Blackmagic owns it, and they make it available. And some of the biggest YouTube
[02:14:45.460 --> 02:14:51.140]   videos, never mind movies and things are all done through cinematic pipelines on DaVinci Resolve.
[02:14:51.140 --> 02:14:56.500]   And you can get that and use it and learn it for free. And it feels like we're on the verge of
[02:14:56.500 --> 02:15:01.620]   just this massive acceleration of things that used to be bottlenecks. You would edit your movie,
[02:15:01.620 --> 02:15:06.660]   and that was real time. But you'd hit that button and go get not just a coffee, but a coffee shop
[02:15:06.660 --> 02:15:10.900]   while you were waiting for it to edit. And now these things are coming out so quickly,
[02:15:10.900 --> 02:15:15.060]   especially because they're purpose built. And again, it's just the beginning of all the
[02:15:15.060 --> 02:15:19.700]   optimizations for this stuff. So if you've ever had a hankering to move beyond iMovie,
[02:15:19.700 --> 02:15:23.460]   you've got some really, really, really good world-class options available.
[02:15:23.460 --> 02:15:27.780]   I have to say that's when Pitfall of having an M1 is you don't want to use non-native apps anymore,
[02:15:27.780 --> 02:15:32.740]   even with Rosetta. You just want to, is it native? And if it's not, I'll wait. It's
[02:15:33.780 --> 02:15:37.700]   yeah. Premiere is struggling. And Premiere is struggling. A lot of people don't want to use
[02:15:37.700 --> 02:15:41.860]   Premiere, but they want to use After Effects. And the best way to use After Effects is with
[02:15:41.860 --> 02:15:45.700]   Premiere. And so they're sort of bound to it like the dark language and ring-
[02:15:45.700 --> 02:15:46.900]   Is motion native though, right?
[02:15:46.900 --> 02:15:52.660]   Yeah. Motion. All the Apple stuff was updated for launch. And it's just terrific.
[02:15:52.660 --> 02:15:58.660]   Yeah, it's really nice. Pick of the week, Andy and not go. Mine is an oldie, but a goodie.
[02:15:58.660 --> 02:16:04.660]   Congratulations to Fantastical by Flexibets who won one of the app of the year awards,
[02:16:04.660 --> 02:16:09.220]   because they totally, totally redid the entire app. It released it in January of this year. And
[02:16:09.220 --> 02:16:15.140]   they've been just been going bulldozer with it ever since. From the very, very earliest days of
[02:16:15.140 --> 02:16:20.260]   Fantastical, it delivered something so wonderful that you were just sort of, it was just sort of
[02:16:20.260 --> 02:16:24.980]   begging to be bought by Apple and just say, "Tell you what, what you guys, you men and women,
[02:16:24.980 --> 02:16:29.620]   you are now just in charge of all the calendar stuff that we do on macOS and iOS."
[02:16:29.620 --> 02:16:35.620]   Because I've never had a calendar app that I wanted to use before, just by dropping down a menu
[02:16:35.620 --> 02:16:41.940]   and saying, just saying, "Lunch with, lunch with the dark canyon Tuesday at 3pm."
[02:16:41.940 --> 02:16:47.700]   I love that feature. Well, way before Shlomo, way before the assistant. And even today,
[02:16:47.700 --> 02:16:51.780]   it works better than most of those sort of things. The way that it lets you just simply
[02:16:51.780 --> 02:16:57.540]   look at what's going on in your day. They've made it more, a little bit more muscular.
[02:16:57.540 --> 02:17:01.460]   So it still works great as a personal app. And there's still sort of a personal
[02:17:01.460 --> 02:17:07.300]   version of it that's free. Now for, I think it's an annual subscription fee. They've made it into
[02:17:07.300 --> 02:17:13.220]   a much more powerful thing, a bigger monster that works even better. Now that we are spending more
[02:17:13.220 --> 02:17:17.860]   time in front of this one screen, managing so many different people, managing so many different
[02:17:17.860 --> 02:17:26.420]   meetings, so many different Zoom calls and chats and stuff like that. It's frequent that you have
[02:17:26.420 --> 02:17:30.500]   an app that's so good that it gets a lot of attention when it first gets released and it gets
[02:17:30.500 --> 02:17:36.180]   the app of the year award. But for an app like this too, in its third iteration, say, "No, this is
[02:17:36.180 --> 02:17:42.580]   enough of a change." And it's so much of a rethinking of what makes it great and just adding turbo
[02:17:42.580 --> 02:17:48.260]   just to everything makes it great that, yes, guess what? Here's another one. Congratulations for 2020.
[02:17:48.260 --> 02:17:53.540]   That says something really about the team at Flexibits and how good they are keeping their
[02:17:53.540 --> 02:17:58.180]   eye on the ball there. I use that and love it and then pay for it, pay a subscription.
[02:17:58.180 --> 02:18:02.340]   And I think it's native too, as I remember. I don't think Michael and Ken are ever selling to
[02:18:02.340 --> 02:18:08.420]   Apple, which is great. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it works with the Apple Calendar. I mean, I
[02:18:08.420 --> 02:18:12.500]   agree with you, Andy. I wish we would just supplant it, but it doesn't. It doesn't supply.
[02:18:12.500 --> 02:18:16.340]   There's a database. I think all the iOS and macOS apps work off a collected
[02:18:16.340 --> 02:18:21.380]   contact and calendar database, which is great because you can have as many or as few apps as you
[02:18:21.380 --> 02:18:24.900]   want, and they're just always working together, which I think is way better than a bunch of different
[02:18:24.900 --> 02:18:31.380]   data cylinders. Yeah. It's not an answer to your weird. Even though we're not moving around much,
[02:18:31.380 --> 02:18:37.460]   you can also have, by time or location, say, "Okay, when I'm at my office, show these calendars,
[02:18:37.460 --> 02:18:42.660]   when I'm at home, show these calendars," etc. I love that feature. I never go anywhere, so I don't
[02:18:42.660 --> 02:18:47.620]   use it. But if I went anywhere. Remind me about a Zoom call. If you come up in a URL,
[02:18:47.620 --> 02:18:53.060]   we drop into URL for a Zoom call. It has a button. You can click to join. Yeah, it's really clever.
[02:18:53.060 --> 02:18:59.780]   Yeah. No, it's totally what I use on iOS and on macOS. And congratulations. It's like Merlin's
[02:18:59.780 --> 02:19:03.540]   point before. It's by people who love that software, use that software all the time and use it a lot,
[02:19:03.540 --> 02:19:09.140]   and maybe they want it. I got a weird little pic because I had a weird device the other day that
[02:19:09.140 --> 02:19:13.540]   actually I love, but that's not for everybody. The good news is it costs less than AirPods Max,
[02:19:13.540 --> 02:19:19.460]   but the bad news is it's still very expensive. It's called the Remarkable 2. It's a paper
[02:19:19.460 --> 02:19:26.100]   tablet that you write on, but at 400 bucks, I'm not actually not recommending it for anybody.
[02:19:26.100 --> 02:19:32.420]   I love it, but it supports only one PDF or ePub of the two book formats.
[02:19:32.420 --> 02:19:36.340]   So I was looking around for ePubs and I found, and this is the pic, not the remarkable,
[02:19:36.340 --> 02:19:44.180]   standard ebooks.org, free and liberated ebooks, carefully produced for the true book lover.
[02:19:44.180 --> 02:19:51.620]   They've taken Project Gutenberg. Project Gutenberg has all these books hand-transcribed,
[02:19:51.620 --> 02:19:55.140]   but what they've done is they've taken the transcriptions, they've corrected it,
[02:19:55.140 --> 02:20:01.060]   and they've made beautiful editions. And of course, they're all older because they have to be
[02:20:01.620 --> 02:20:08.020]   open source public domain. This is like free as in beer? Yeah.
[02:20:08.020 --> 02:20:12.900]   That's so cool. And they're beautifully produced. This is a book I grew up with.
[02:20:12.900 --> 02:20:15.460]   Project Gutenberg is amazing, but it's not very pretty.
[02:20:15.460 --> 02:20:19.380]   It's just plain text. I end up looking stuff in caliber and trying to clean it up with caliber
[02:20:19.380 --> 02:20:24.580]   units and some formatting options, but this is amazing. Yeah. So I'll show you,
[02:20:24.580 --> 02:20:30.820]   this is a book I grew up with called Five Children in it. I don't know if this is going to
[02:20:30.820 --> 02:20:35.140]   render well on. I can't. Yeah, it's not doing it on the website very well, but
[02:20:35.140 --> 02:20:42.340]   really they've done a nice job, I think, of, let me see if I can find it. Yeah. I mean,
[02:20:42.340 --> 02:20:49.860]   the typography is well done. And then they have illustrations and stuff. So I just think if
[02:20:49.860 --> 02:20:55.460]   you're looking for free books to put on your reader, there's some really wonderful books,
[02:20:55.460 --> 02:20:58.980]   just because they're old doesn't mean they're not great books. And they're ragged right. They're
[02:20:58.980 --> 02:21:03.380]   not justified. I know I was almost going to say that. I know I hate it when they do that.
[02:21:03.380 --> 02:21:07.620]   Something from from my Kindle in it. You can't turn off full justification.
[02:21:07.620 --> 02:21:13.140]   What monster would make that the default book and not like, sorry, not hand-curved,
[02:21:13.140 --> 02:21:18.980]   not hand-justifiable, but like machine, you got rivers and forget. Yeah, it's just awful.
[02:21:18.980 --> 02:21:26.820]   No, yeah, this is this is just left justified. And it's not. It looks and then it's all beautiful.
[02:21:26.820 --> 02:21:30.420]   So if you're looking for some classics, they have quite a few books in here,
[02:21:30.420 --> 02:21:35.140]   and they're looking for volunteers will take the project Gutenberg version of it, correct it,
[02:21:35.140 --> 02:21:40.740]   and make a nice production. Here's the Man in the Brown suit by Agatha Christie.
[02:21:40.740 --> 02:21:41.380]   That's awesome.
[02:21:41.380 --> 02:21:44.340]   Yeah, some great stuff. Some great stuff.
[02:21:44.340 --> 02:21:52.580]   So just to mention, I wanted to give them a plug, standard ebooks.org. Hey, we have had fun.
[02:21:53.220 --> 02:21:57.460]   Yeah, early when you come back from time to time or every week, if you want, I got an empty seat.
[02:21:57.460 --> 02:22:02.100]   No, no, no, no, you don't want that. You don't want that. I think a couple times a year is enough.
[02:22:02.100 --> 02:22:08.980]   I love cilantro. I want to make a cilantro pesto out of this show.
[02:22:08.980 --> 02:22:09.860]   I don't make a bowl of it every morning.
[02:22:09.860 --> 02:22:17.780]   I might. I've been known. I could. I do love it. And you can bring Bando by any time.
[02:22:17.780 --> 02:22:21.620]   We appreciate that. Oh, I might bring him on. That would be great. Thank you so much.
[02:22:21.620 --> 02:22:24.420]   And it's nice to see everybody. Thank you. And everybody out there. Hi.
[02:22:24.420 --> 02:22:30.980]   Thank you. Merlin man.com. And you can get all the podcasts and everything he's up to.
[02:22:30.980 --> 02:22:34.260]   Do you work on staff or you a freelancer?
[02:22:34.260 --> 02:22:37.220]   At what?
[02:22:37.220 --> 02:22:43.140]   Do you have? Are you gainfully employed? Are you in points?
[02:22:43.140 --> 02:22:46.100]   What? What is this? No.
[02:22:48.660 --> 02:22:51.300]   You know, I got a lot of ends, a lot of hours, a lot of what have you.
[02:22:51.300 --> 02:22:58.980]   No, I just did podcast, you know, and it's I fell ass backward into it. I got so lucky,
[02:22:58.980 --> 02:23:03.460]   especially now. I mean, my God. So you are a slacker, sir.
[02:23:03.460 --> 02:23:05.780]   He's one of us.
[02:23:05.780 --> 02:23:08.740]   Oh, one big slacker. Slacker, slacker, slacker, slacker.
[02:23:08.740 --> 02:23:14.660]   Yeah, no one else. Nobody. Nobody can tolerate me. And I even need.
[02:23:14.660 --> 02:23:16.980]   We can tolerate you. We believe you. Thank you for being here.
[02:23:16.980 --> 02:23:18.740]   Very Christmas and happy holidays.
[02:23:18.740 --> 02:23:23.220]   Christmas. Have a wonderful holiday. Thank you, Andy and Akko. When are you going to be on GBH
[02:23:23.220 --> 02:23:30.580]   next? I'm on day early. I'm on tomorrow at one 20 p.m. Until like one 40, one 45 p.m. Go to
[02:23:30.580 --> 02:23:35.380]   wgbhneuis.org to stream it live or about three hours later to stream it later.
[02:23:35.380 --> 02:23:39.700]   Very nice. They're saying bring back. You look nice today, Merlin.
[02:23:39.700 --> 02:23:44.820]   We did. I thought you did. Yeah. Yes. Are you still doing it or?
[02:23:45.620 --> 02:23:50.740]   Yes, we are. It's mostly video. Well, you could listen to it as audio, but the video is more
[02:23:50.740 --> 02:23:56.980]   fun. I'm going to count lonely sandwich or California. Yeah, or California King.org is
[02:23:56.980 --> 02:24:01.620]   technically the new kind of offshoot. Yeah. The other way. Up in the top, go to California.
[02:24:01.620 --> 02:24:06.420]   California King. So you have many, many shows.
[02:24:06.420 --> 02:24:08.820]   Yeah. Yeah. It's talking.
[02:24:08.820 --> 02:24:11.860]   Because they speak with those boys again. I missed doing that show.
[02:24:11.860 --> 02:24:14.660]   Yeah. I love that show. One of the funniest shows ever.
[02:24:15.620 --> 02:24:21.780]   And of course, Renee Richie, youtube.com/ReneeRitchie. And we had Georgia down on Twitter on Sunday.
[02:24:21.780 --> 02:24:27.380]   And that was a good show. Apple Talk. Your podcast you do with her is also on YouTube.
[02:24:27.380 --> 02:24:33.060]   Yeah. It was fun to have George on. She is so much smarter than just every episode.
[02:24:33.060 --> 02:24:38.660]   I learned so many things about like, I understand what in technology, but she explains why.
[02:24:38.660 --> 02:24:41.220]   And it makes such a critical difference to my understanding of everything.
[02:24:41.220 --> 02:24:44.820]   I hope it's not inappropriate, but I said you brought the brains. She brought the heart.
[02:24:44.820 --> 02:24:50.900]   She brought home. I love Simone de Rochaure as well.
[02:24:50.900 --> 02:24:53.780]   Simone from Georgia. Yeah. Like where it's like, you know, you, you,
[02:24:53.780 --> 02:24:59.620]   Georgia and just they're the cure. Like they're laugh. Just make sure.
[02:24:59.620 --> 02:25:01.540]   I know. That's a good way to get it.
[02:25:01.540 --> 02:25:06.820]   It's a frickin for the frickin smart and fun and like just whatever they're on.
[02:25:06.820 --> 02:25:10.820]   And they're one of those like Harry Dean Stanton kind of people were like, like Ebert said,
[02:25:10.820 --> 02:25:14.820]   Annie, we're like, you know, it can't be all or, or Emmett Walsh. Like if they're in this movie,
[02:25:14.820 --> 02:25:16.980]   it can't be all bad. Like whatever they're on always.
[02:25:16.980 --> 02:25:22.660]   YouTube.com you don't have a name yet. That's good.
[02:25:22.660 --> 02:25:23.940]   Yeah. Slash Apple talk show.

[02:27:29.860 --> 02:27:36.500]   Oh, this is going to be fun. You know, I was looking for the rat hole music and I think it is somewhere.
[02:27:36.500 --> 02:27:46.660]   Oh, this is the short one. I want the long one.
[02:27:46.660 --> 02:27:53.700]   Are you pre-opling rat hole? There's a really long, oh, he could play it again. He could play it.
[02:27:54.660 --> 02:28:02.820]   Like an estimated rat hole. There's a long one that goes on.
[02:28:02.820 --> 02:28:14.420]   It's just open in the rat hole. You know he's open in the rat hole.
[02:28:22.740 --> 02:28:26.660]   All right. Let's say we got that. We got it. We got it. We got it. Okay.
[02:28:26.660 --> 02:28:34.020]   That's exactly how it went. Can we use the theme song from rat patrols?
[02:28:34.020 --> 02:28:41.060]   If you got that, take it, put it a button, put it in a button, then we got it. Okay.
[02:28:41.060 --> 02:28:45.220]   Okay. Put a button on it. Put a button in it. Put it on a button.
