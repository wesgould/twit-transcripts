[00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.860]   We'll do a roundup of the last minute rumors.
[00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.300]   Some not so credible.
[00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.940]   Talk about what we might be seeing next week and next month.

[00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.460]   the Macintosh and iOS news.
[00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.260]   And joining us, we've got a panel of experts, of course,
[00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.500]   Andy and Notco, always here, always the best from Chicago
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.700]   Sun.
[00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.820]   Time's great to have you once again, Andy.
[00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.580]   You'll be scying out here next for next week's show.
[00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.060]   I will be great-howing my way all the way over there.
[00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.020]   It's going to take 23 hours, but I think it's going to be worth
[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.260]   what we gave you.
[00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.780]   You said you were-- we gave you the hotel
[00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.340]   and you said that you had air miles.
[00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.060]   But I guess, grayhound miles is almost as good.
[00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.140]   I found out they got those seats that reclined two clicks,
[00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.420]   not just one anymore.
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.580]   So it's actually an upgrade from the L1011.
[00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.020]   Very relaxing.
[00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.580]   Very relaxing.
[00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.380]   Also joining us from the UK, from Liverpool,
[00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.180]   it's Don McAllister of ScreenCastsOnline.com.
[00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.180]   Hey, Don.
[00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.940]   Hi, Leo.
[00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:41.540]   How's it going?
[00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.340]   Always great to see you.
[00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.140]   Haven't seen you in ages, and I apologize.
[00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.100]   It's been a while.
[00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.900]   It has been a while.
[00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.700]   You sent me an email saying, do you remember me?
[00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.500]   Well, it's a much better follow-up of getting a bit worried
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.020]   in case we'd fallen out or something.
[00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.580]   No, no, no.
[00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.460]   They know how cranky Leo can get.
[00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.740]   I've got people on my list.
[00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.140]   You're not on it yet.
[00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.940]   Yeah, well, I won't be over there next week.
[00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.700]   I didn't actually get an invite to the event,
[00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.260]   so I won't be flying over next week.
[00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.100]   But I put it down to the fact that I'm over here in the UK,
[00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.820]   and it's a bit too far to travel just for that.
[00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.780]   Well, I shall see you in Sydney,
[00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.300]   on November 7.
[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.500]   And we will set sail for adventure, aka New Caledonia.
[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.980]   Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.
[00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.340]   But it's creeping up very, very quickly.
[00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.300]   And I've still got lots of words.
[00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.060]   How many talks are you doing?
[00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.620]   I'm doing seven.
[00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.820]   Seven, nine, nine, seven.
[00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.060]   Captain Neil likes to punish Don McAllister.
[00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.940]   Seven talks, but it's a 14-day cruise.
[00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:35.940]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.100]   I mean, we've spaced them out this time, so it's not too bad.
[00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.660]   And I've got moves to the outline sort of that.
[00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.740]   It's just all the key, you know,
[00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:41.900]   it's stuff I'm going to have to hammer through
[00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.260]   in the next couple months, you know.
[00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.580]   But no, it's good fun.
[00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:45.140]   It's good fun.
[00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.180]   I'm used to it now as well.
[00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.660]   We're talking Macmania 15, the Insight Cruises yearly
[00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:51.620]   Macintosh cruise.
[00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.380]   And I understand there's a good number of people
[00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.780]   showing up for this one.
[00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.300]   It's a long cruise.
[00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.820]   Two weeks, we go to Sydney, then Brisbane,
[00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.780]   and we sail out to the Great Barrier Reef.
[00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.460]   And then at some point in the middle of the ocean,
[00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.420]   there's going to be an eclipse of the sun.
[00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.380]   And then we come on.
[00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.380]   Yeah, like we go over to the Caledonian Islands,
[00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.100]   which to be honest, I've never heard of before.
[00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.540]   But we actually go from Australia across the Caledonian Islands,
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.860]   do a circuit around and then come back.
[00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:15.860]   And I think it's on the way back
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.020]   we're in the middle of the ocean.
[00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.780]   That's going to be fun.
[00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:18.700]   It's going to be the saltbird eclipse.
[00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.580]   November 7th through 21st.
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.100]   And I think we're going to do a meet up in Sydney
[00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.020]   on the 6th, the evening of the 6th,
[00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.420]   unless I'm completely wasted.
[00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.180]   And then we'll do a quick one in Brisbane, too,
[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.180]   on the evening of the 8th or the day of the 8th,
[00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.740]   because we leave in the evening.
[00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:36.980]   So join us, if you'd like.
[00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:37.420]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:38.980]   Well, we'll be getting there two or three days before.
[00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:39.500]   Oh, good.
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.940]   It's a smart.
[00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.060]   It's a long way from England,
[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.500]   obviously what's a long way from the States as well.
[00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.940]   But yeah, I think it's a 20 hour flight.
[00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.620]   It's longer for you than us.
[00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:49.620]   Yeah.
[00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:50.620]   Wow.
[00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.340]   It will be worth it.
[00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.620]   Also with us from Macworld Magazine, the editor in chief
[00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.260]   and an off time cruiser.
[00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.940]   Although I don't think you're going on this one, Jason Snow.
[00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:59.580]   No, I was.
[00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.460]   And I sadly had to bail out because I've
[00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.500]   got some more responsibilities here at the office.
[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.420]   And I was looking at that two weeks.
[00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.820]   Like, I really want to go to Australia.
[00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.620]   But my family couldn't go on this one.
[00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.060]   It was going to just be me and that works.
[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.660]   That came up.
[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.100]   So oh, well, next time.
[00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.420]   Yeah, we should say Jason is now editorial director
[00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.180]   for the entire--
[00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.540]   I don't know what-- everything.
[00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:19.940]   The IDG chain.
[00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:20.540]   I don't know.
[00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.300]   Tell us what you do now.
[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.620]   Well, I'm basically-- I'm being burned by the light of the sun,
[00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:25.140]   right?
[00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.140]   I can see that.
[00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.940]   It's good.
[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.660]   It's just all of a sudden, the giant--
[00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:29.460]   your lighting guy.
[00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.700]   [SINGING]
[00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:31.260]   I know.
[00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.780]   I know.
[00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.620]   I'm speaking to you, Kevin.
[00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.780]   I'm the editorial director for IDG's consumer stuff.
[00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.660]   So Macworld and PCworld and a new site
[00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.660]   that we're launching called TechHive that's launching next week.
[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:43.700]   So how exciting.
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:44.860]   That's going to keep you--
[00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:45.340]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.220]   It's going to be really busy.
[00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.260]   But it's going to be good.
[00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.540]   It's all the people who work on Macworld and PCworld
[00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.380]   are also going to build this other site that's not Mac or PC,
[00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:54.380]   but just general tech.
[00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.260]   And we're doing that all together.
[00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.620]   I have it on my screen now if you want to show it, Chad.
[00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:59.700]   This is TechHive.
[00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:00.260]   This is the beta.
[00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.780]   It's the beta.
[00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.220]   And the real full site will be up next week sometime.
[00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.660]   So stay tuned for that.
[00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.940]   But we did a beta over the summer just to try some stuff out.
[00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.740]   Is it going to be kind of like a tech blog?
[00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:11.780]   Is that the idea?
[00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.380]   Yeah, except not as much.
[00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.780]   We don't want to be a news blog.
[00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.500]   I think there are plenty of tech news blogs out there.
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.180]   So we're going to try to do--
[00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.380]   just like Macworld and PCworld, we'll do some analysis.
[00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.260]   We'll do how-tos.
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.340]   We'll do product reviews.
[00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.660]   And we'll cover the news too.
[00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.260]   But we don't want to replicate and be another verge
[00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.740]   or in gadget.
[00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:29.580]   We want to do something--
[00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.420]   I think there's so many opportunities.
[00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.580]   And I like seeing people push the envelope a little bit.
[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:36.380]   There's so many opportunities.
[00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.820]   The web is-- it could be anything, right?
[00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:39.100]   Yeah.
[00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:39.940]   Exactly.
[00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:40.460]   Is that huge?
[00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.980]   There's a nice picture of me at AHA Team.
[00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:47.820]   A gigantic nerd using his Apple II-E.
[00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.860]   So it would be nice to do something a little bit broader
[00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.980]   with the PCworld and Macworld teams working on TechHive
[00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:57.820]   and trying to do something that can bring some of the expertise
[00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.860]   that we've always had in looking at products
[00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.540]   and try to-- we always come up against the,
[00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.700]   why are you talking about cameras or cell phones
[00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.940]   or something if you're Macworld and PCworld.
[00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.460]   So we're trying to find a place that's a little bit broader
[00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:10.860]   where we can do that.
[00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.300]   But we're definitely not trying to be another news blog,
[00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.860]   trying to be a little bit different.
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:15.220]   Flipboard.
[00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.100]   Well, you'll be flipboard--
[00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.900]   I'm sure you'll be flipboard compatible.
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:18.820]   We're talking to those guys.
[00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.860]   Those guys are-- we're trying to work with them.
[00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:21.380]   Yeah.
[00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.860]   Because this could be a great flipboard page to--
[00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:24.460]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:25.620]   We're in a bunch of already.
[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.420]   So I hope we are in Flipboard, too.
[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.340]   I've known Jason.
[00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.660]   Gosh, we've been friends since the old days at Call for Help
[00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.660]   when you'd come on as doing a Mac tip of the week.
[00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.060]   Tip of the day, yeah.
[00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.100]   Exactly.
[00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.300]   It's been a long time.
[00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:38.940]   That's awesome.
[00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:40.900]   Well, it's great to have you all.
[00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.700]   The news came out from this.
[00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:48.100]   Let the word go out from this continent to all the others.
[00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:52.580]   There is going to be an event on the 12th.
[00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:53.660]   Wow.
[00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.940]   So I guess Jim Dalrymbo got it right and everybody else.
[00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:58.940]   Yep.
[00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.740]   Apple confirmed September 12th event.
[00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:01.940]   Now, this is the invitation.
[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.620]   Andy, you got yours, right?
[00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:04.300]   I did get mine.
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.700]   Oh, thank God.
[00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:06.380]   Great.
[00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:07.980]   I'm just waiting for him to be tainted
[00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.660]   by his association with me.
[00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:11.580]   I'm so relieved, Andy.
[00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:12.820]   And of course, Jason, you'll be there.
[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.660]   And Don, you won't be there because it's kind of far away.
[00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.380]   But it's a long time away.
[00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:22.220]   So tell us about the invitation, Andy.
[00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:26.460]   We have to parse it like it was a Kremlin missive here.
[00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:32.100]   Yeah, there's only one item to really start to obsess about.
[00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.420]   It's, of course, the 12th for the 12th.
[00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:37.940]   But the shadow is in the shape of a letter of a number five.
[00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:38.700]   Ooh.
[00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.580]   So that could mean that they're calling it the iPhone 5.
[00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:43.100]   It could just simply be a nod to the fact
[00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:46.220]   that it's fifth generation or could be just as simple as, well,
[00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:49.340]   this is the fifth year since they've been iPhones.
[00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:50.620]   Ha ha ha.
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.220]   You thought we're going to be calling it the iPhone 5.
[00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:54.700]   And we actually were calling it Exidor.
[00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.220]   The Apple Exidor and said computer.
[00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:00.020]   No, don't you think this-- I mean, they're not going to do that.
[00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:02.620]   Jason Snell said it could be misdirection.
[00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:04.900]   They don't do misdirection, do they, Jason?
[00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:05.660]   Oh, they do.
[00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:06.180]   Sure they do.
[00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:07.500]   They have fun with those little things.
[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.100]   It would not surprise me at all if they called it the iPhone 5.
[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.220]   But it would also not surprise me if they just said, hey,
[00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.620]   it's the fifth anniversary of the iPhone.
[00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:15.380]   We love the iPhone.
[00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:16.500]   Here's the new iPhone.
[00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:17.980]   And it wasn't the iPhone 5.
[00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:19.340]   So we'll see.
[00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:21.220]   But I wouldn't put it past them.
[00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.580]   It makes me wonder now, I was sure they weren't
[00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.260]   going to call it the iPhone 5.
[00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.340]   And now I am wondering.
[00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:29.460]   So they've mission accomplished, Apple.
[00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:30.300]   Ha ha ha.
[00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:30.820]   I was--
[00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.580]   I was--
[00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:33.100]   Sorry, Andy.
[00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:37.020]   It was probably the fuss over the new iPad.
[00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:38.740]   And that threw everyone sideways.
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:41.220]   There was so much fuss and discontent
[00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:44.460]   that they've either decided, well, no, let's not go through that
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:45.860]   again with just the new iPhone.
[00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:47.580]   Let's actually give it a number this time.
[00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:48.660]   So it wouldn't surprise me.
[00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:51.100]   But again, it wouldn't surprise me if they did pull something
[00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:52.020]   else out of the bag at the same time.
[00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:53.780]   Why not the new iPhone?
[00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.740]   Well, because remember that Apple currently
[00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:00.500]   has what four different iPhone models that are in current play.
[00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:01.460]   This would make five.
[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:02.620]   Five?
[00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:03.100]   Five?
[00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:03.580]   Wait a minute.
[00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:06.140]   OK, the 3GS and the 4s.
[00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:07.100]   Those are the three.
[00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:08.940]   You can get any of those three right now.
[00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:09.780]   They've got three, right.
[00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:13.100]   So they need one that's the hot new phone you paid top dollar
[00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:13.420]   for.
[00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.300]   They've got to have the $99 phone.
[00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.020]   And now they have to have the free with contract
[00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:18.900]   or the prepaid model phone.
[00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:19.780]   So they need--
[00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:21.340]   I think there's a greater need for them
[00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:23.700]   to have a distinction between which of these three phones
[00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:26.500]   are they talking about when they talk about this new hot
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:27.420]   model of it.
[00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.340]   So I don't know if they're going to call it the iPhone 5.
[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.620]   But I wouldn't be surprised if they decided that, nah,
[00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:32.540]   we don't want that--
[00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:35.100]   we don't want that bag of hurt known as referring to making
[00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.580]   everybody call this the new iPhone.
[00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:40.780]   I mean, everybody calls the new iPad, the iPad 3 anyway.
[00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:45.020]   And remember that when Apple is really good at that misdirection,
[00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:46.580]   they really do think they enjoy it.
[00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:48.580]   I think that there are a lot of games, magazines,
[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:52.820]   subscribers, and the people who put together these invitations.
[00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.140]   Remember the one where they, last year's event,
[00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:56.660]   where they called it back to the Mac?
[00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:57.860]   And we thought, OK, that's great,
[00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:59.740]   because they're going to return focus back
[00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:01.540]   to improving the Macintosh.
[00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:02.820]   When actually the whole theme was,
[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:05.060]   we are taking iOS features and putting them back
[00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:06.860]   into the Mac so that they're--
[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:14.860]   OK, so now the next question, which everybody seems to agree,
[00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:20.900]   the next question is, is this going to be a Mac mini?
[00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:22.820]   I mean, iPad mini as well as iPhone event,
[00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:24.660]   or is Jim Dalrymple--
[00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:27.180]   well, Gruber Dalrymple and Pachowski
[00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.020]   all say second event.
[00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:29.860]   Right.
[00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:30.540]   Why not?
[00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:32.100]   I mean, the iPhone is so huge.
[00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:34.860]   And all of us in the media, we see this in our servers.
[00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.780]   Whenever there's-- we think Apple events are big,
[00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:37.980]   and then there's an iPhone event.
[00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.460]   And the interest in the iPhone is enormous.
[00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:40.940]   Right.
[00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:43.340]   And if it's the biggest thing, it's the biggest part
[00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:45.300]   of Apple's business, it's the one that everybody cares
[00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.540]   about around the world, then they don't need something else.
[00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:52.140]   If they've got another place to roll out an iPad later,
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:54.500]   why split the attention in the media?
[00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.020]   Why have two sets of reviews or a review that
[00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:59.900]   mentions every new story mentions two products instead of one?
[00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:01.340]   Why not wait a couple of weeks?
[00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:03.580]   It could be that soon, two, three weeks.
[00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:06.100]   And then still have plenty of times to sell to the holidays
[00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.020]   and have a second big bang.
[00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:09.340]   We've got all these other tech companies
[00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:11.300]   that are trying to announce their products around Apple
[00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:13.540]   because they don't want to get swamped by Apple.
[00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:16.380]   And imagine Apple saying, well, we're going to do it twice.
[00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:20.100]   We're going to have two big boom kind of events.
[00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.420]   It makes sense to me that why they don't need anything
[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:23.460]   more than the iPhone.
[00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:26.100]   The iPhone is enormous on its own.
[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:27.580]   I honestly don't know.
[00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.380]   I see the argument for them actually putting them both
[00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:31.580]   in the same event.
[00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:34.300]   Because the interest in the smaller iPad
[00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:35.220]   isn't at the same--
[00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:36.500]   Jason's absolutely right.
[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:37.980]   I mean, the interest in the new iPhone
[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:39.140]   crosses every relationship--
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:39.740]   It's sufficient.
[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:41.460]   --every order, everything.
[00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:43.420]   And if Apple wants to really make sure
[00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.540]   that everybody has the most attention on everything
[00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:47.420]   that's possible, that might be a good place
[00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:50.740]   to have an iPad event to say, oh, by the way, we have a new iPad.
[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.820]   We're releasing the price to $250.
[00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:54.580]   There were $199 even.
[00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:56.740]   I think it really depends on how threatened they
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:00.580]   feel the Google Nexus 7 tablet is
[00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:03.660]   or how threatened they feel about what Amazon might do
[00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:06.100]   with whatever announcement they're going to make on the 6th.
[00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.220]   It might be valuable to them to simply say,
[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:08.620]   you know what?
[00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.460]   We're not even going to make people wait two weeks.
[00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:12.700]   We're going to basically kill the market for all these devices
[00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.740]   right now and then move forward.
[00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:19.420]   So I honestly don't know if Dal Rumpel gives a yup
[00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:21.100]   to the two event--
[00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.740]   His Dal Rumpel's response was that Gruber's
[00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:24.860]   a pretty smart guy.
[00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:27.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:28.780]   Which is a total of an app.
[00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:31.180]   You don't like to download the message to do that.
[00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:34.340]   Yeah, but OK, here's the argument in Andy's favor.
[00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:36.260]   Here's the argument.
[00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:37.180]   If you--
[00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:38.180]   If you--
[00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:39.540]   What do they gain?
[00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:40.860]   What do they gain?
[00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:42.980]   Well, my one difficulty with it is that, OK,
[00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:49.020]   so they've got one hour to talk about the new iPad mini.
[00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:50.140]   How are they going to fill that time?
[00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:51.660]   Unless they also fill it with--
[00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.380]   unless they really dilute that event with it.
[00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:54.780]   And here's the new version of iTunes.
[00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:56.420]   And here's the new partnerships that we've made.
[00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:57.580]   I think that's what it is.
[00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:59.860]   There's not much you can say about the iPad, except for it's
[00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:00.860]   smaller than the iPad.
[00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:02.060]   It runs all the same apps.
[00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:04.620]   It's $200 or $250.
[00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:05.500]   And it's available now.
[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.620]   Now, I see it very much as a positioning thing.
[00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.580]   I mean, the iPhone is not a holiday product.
[00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:12.700]   The iPhone is an individual product
[00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:14.300]   that has the attention of the world.
[00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:18.140]   And they've positioned it to come out
[00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:19.700]   round about this time of year.
[00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.860]   Whereas the iPad mini, I see them more focusing
[00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.900]   on the holiday market, on the Christmas market.
[00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:27.380]   And I could well imagine them rolling up the mini iPad
[00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:29.740]   as an entertainment device, as a gaming device,
[00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.540]   rolling new versions of the iPods themselves, which
[00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:36.740]   have been updated for ages, and make an event all about the media,
[00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:39.340]   all about gifts for Christmas, although they won't obviously
[00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:40.020]   phrase it like that.
[00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:42.380]   But that will be the intention to get everything in place
[00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:45.620]   so that the iPhones are separate events.
[00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:46.500]   It's global.
[00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:47.260]   It's for businesses.
[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:48.420]   It's for all around the world.
[00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.300]   And then this separate media event, which they used to have--
[00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:52.220]   I mean, they used to have it later on in the year--
[00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.940]   used to have a media event all about music and entertainment.
[00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:56.620]   And I can see them actually bringing that back
[00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:59.700]   and having the iPad mini as the sort of flagship device
[00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:00.700]   to kick that off.
[00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:01.740]   But here's what's changed.
[00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:04.420]   I mean, the world now kind of knows--
[00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:08.260]   or it's interesting how much people are aware of all of this.
[00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.220]   First, I thought, oh, it's just us tech journalists.
[00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:13.860]   But the world knows that this iPad mini is about to emerge.
[00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:15.820]   Does that not kill iPad sales?
[00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:16.940]   And people say wait and see.
[00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:19.660]   Just as iPhone sales have been killed, people say wait and see.
[00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:23.140]   Why would Apple then expand that pain another month?
[00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:25.020]   When you've got the product, you could announce it now.
[00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:26.300]   Well, they don't have the product.
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:27.340]   That's part of it.
[00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:30.940]   And I think it's different enough that it's not a new iPad.
[00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:33.140]   It's another different kind of iPad.
[00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:35.540]   And that makes the calculation, I think, a little bit different.
[00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:39.100]   And I think what Don says about having that music event,
[00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:42.060]   you do iPhone and iOS 6 release.
[00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:43.820]   And then you come back three weeks later,
[00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:48.260]   and you have new iPods and the iPad.
[00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:49.780]   And that's your holiday kind of focus.
[00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:52.100]   And maybe iTunes, please, please, new iTunes.
[00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:52.620]   It's not--
[00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:54.740]   Boy, we could really use that, can we?
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:55.260]   Yeah.
[00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:56.500]   I want to take a break and come back.
[00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:57.660]   I want to talk about the mini.
[00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:02.060]   We also have a picture from a Dutch blog, iPhone News blog,
[00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:03.380]   that is interesting.
[00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:04.860]   We'll talk about that in just a second.
[00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:10.060]   But first, a word from our friends at squarespace.com.
[00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:12.060]   Got to be very clear when I say squarespace.
[00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:14.140]   Because I often talk about this great content management
[00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:15.940]   software that they use, and it is great.
[00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:17.620]   But it's hosting, too.
[00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:19.380]   So what you're getting--
[00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:21.060]   and I think this is the best way to do it--
[00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:24.140]   is a tight integration between the hosting server,
[00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:27.340]   where your site lives, and the software that's running.
[00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:28.580]   There's a real advantage to that.
[00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:30.260]   Security upgrades, automatic.
[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.500]   They take care of it.
[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:36.460]   Your site is so tightly integrated
[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:38.860]   that this is why squarespace sites never go down.
[00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:41.700]   They're using a very sophisticated virtual server
[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:45.140]   technology that automatically throws more power
[00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:48.100]   at your site the minute-- the second, the instant it's
[00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:48.860]   required.
[00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:50.780]   So you just cannot bring a squarespace site down.
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:51.820]   Go ahead and try.
[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:53.980]   Our inside Twit blog is on squarespace.
[00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:55.700]   Inside.twit.tv.
[00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:58.740]   Everybody flood there, and you can't bring it down.
[00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:01.180]   There's a lot to be said for that, especially if you're
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:03.700]   going to have a site that maybe we will mention.
[00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:07.500]   You cannot slash dot it is the old way of putting it.
[00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.340]   It's also an incredible software.
[00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:10.420]   I want you to take a look at it.
[00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:11.540]   Go to squarespace.com.
[00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:13.500]   The new squarespace 6 is here.
[00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.340]   And it is just beautiful.
[00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:17.140]   One of the things they've decided to focus on
[00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:20.940]   is modern web technologies, HTML5, CSS3.
[00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:22.340]   And this thing now that everybody's
[00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:24.540]   doing called responsive design.
[00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:26.780]   The idea is more and more people are visiting your site
[00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:27.620]   with mobile devices.
[00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:30.380]   In many cases, more mobile than desktop.
[00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:34.980]   So you really can't have a dinky mobile version of your site.
[00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:38.460]   I'm sure that techhive.com has what's called responsive
[00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:42.740]   design, where the site looks the same on every platform.
[00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:44.460]   So you see, when you put an image up,
[00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:45.780]   they make seven copies.
[00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:49.700]   So it looks the same on a 27-inch iMac, iPad, iPhone,
[00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:53.380]   even an iPod, because the idea is that your site should
[00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:54.140]   be consistent.
[00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:56.540]   So the responsive design, make sure it is.
[00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:59.220]   You can completely control the look and feel drag and drop.
[00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:02.580]   You don't need to know JavaScript, HTML5, or CSS.
[00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:04.100]   If you do, of course, they've got great things,
[00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:06.140]   like colored code syntax and so forth.
[00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:06.860]   But you don't have to.
[00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:08.580]   You could just drag and drop stuff.
[00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.940]   Incredible integration.
[00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:13.860]   If you have an existing site on Tumblr, WordPress, or Blogger,
[00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:15.220]   it just sucks it right up.
[00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:16.660]   By the way, you can always export out to.
[00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.180]   You are never trapped.
[00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:20.300]   And then the integration into the social media,
[00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:23.740]   like LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, the Google Maps
[00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:26.180]   that you can embed right on your site automatically,
[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:30.860]   all of this makes it possible to make a very rich media site
[00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:34.700]   that is easy to use for you, but very powerful.
[00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:37.540]   And the best part is you could try this free right now.
[00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:39.620]   The all new Squarespace 6 is ready to run.
[00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:42.180]   If you go to squarespace.com, you don't even need our offer
[00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:43.100]   code.
[00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:46.140]   You just need to go to squarespace.com.
[00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:47.460]   And click the Get Started button.
[00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.700]   You've got two weeks to use every feature of the site
[00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:51.260]   to really bang on it.
[00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.380]   Import all your stuff if you want.
[00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:55.100]   And really see what it would feel like and look
[00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:58.500]   like, the great templates, 300 plus Google plus fonts.
[00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:03.340]   Then if you decide you want to buy the pricing,
[00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:04.380]   they've really simplified.
[00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:05.500]   They just have a number of tiers.
[00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:07.860]   It's very straightforward, the pricing now.
[00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:10.620]   $8 for the standard, $8 a month.
[00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:13.260]   If you want-- and this is the one I would get--
[00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.460]   for $16 a month when you buy annually,
[00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:18.780]   you get unlimited bandwidth, unlimited storage,
[00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:21.380]   unlimited page, just no limits.
[00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:23.620]   That's for a podcaster, this is huge.
[00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:27.260]   This is everything you need, $16 a month.
[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:30.260]   And this is when you're going to use the offer code, 10%
[00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:33.540]   off that first purchase when you use Mac break 9,
[00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:37.300]   Mac, B-R-E-A-K, and the number 9.
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:39.900]   That'll give you 10% off whatever your first purchase is.
[00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:41.540]   That's why the annual purchase is worth it.
[00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:43.500]   Plus another thing to get when you do an annual purchase,
[00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:46.060]   you get a custom domain absolutely free.
[00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:49.020]   So you can make it my hot blog, techhive.com.
[00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:50.140]   I think it's taken.
[00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:52.260]   And then apply it.
[00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.220]   And they'll do all the behind the scenes wiring.
[00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:56.300]   So people go to that domain, and that's your Squarespace
[00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:56.500]   site.
[00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:57.700]   It's really nice.
[00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:59.260]   If you're looking to start a new website,
[00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:01.100]   maybe you want a purpose-built site, somebody who
[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.900]   knows getting married, or maybe you're having a baby.
[00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.780]   Really, you've got to get the name of the baby.com, right?
[00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:08.420]   And then have that site, that baby site.
[00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.180]   What a great idea.
[00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:11.140]   Somebody was doing this.
[00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:12.380]   I thought this was great.
[00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:13.540]   It was a Google ad, right?
[00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:16.220]   They were gmailing all the stuff to the kids.
[00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:18.380]   The great creative gmail address for the kid,
[00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:19.380]   and gmail it all.
[00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:20.900]   You can have it all go to the blog.
[00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:23.420]   And then the kid, when the kid's 18, you go, oh, by the way,
[00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:25.540]   the whole time I've been blogging.
[00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:27.740]   Here's your site.
[00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:29.660]   That would be mean.
[00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:33.180]   I wish I could have done that, though, when my son was born.
[00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:35.060]   They didn't have-- the web wasn't around.
[00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:36.740]   I don't think 18 years ago.
[00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:40.100]   Squarespace.com, Macbreak 9.
[00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:40.700]   That's the offer.
[00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:41.580]   I'll give it a try.
[00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:44.140]   The new Squarespace is entirely redesigned.
[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:45.980]   Give you the best.
[00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:47.300]   The best you can get.
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:49.100]   So here's a picture.
[00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:50.380]   I don't think this could be a fake.
[00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:53.660]   I mean, somebody's put a lot of effort into this if it's a fake.
[00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:59.980]   And if we zoom in, this is clearly some box the packaging for.
[00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:01.780]   And it says, the--
[00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:05.460]   I think it says the new iPhone.
[00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:08.540]   The new iPhone.
[00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:11.140]   I don't know, because--
[00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:12.740]   Does that not look credible?
[00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:16.900]   Does the new iPad have any packaging that says the new iPad?
[00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:17.780]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:18.740]   I'm not forgotten.
[00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:19.660]   That's interesting.
[00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:21.140]   I don't recall that, but--
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:22.020]   No, I don't think so.
[00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:22.740]   I think that's--
[00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:25.660]   It's just iPad.
[00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:26.900]   It's a confirmed fake.
[00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:29.860]   They're telling me in the chatroom, the icons are wrong.
[00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:33.260]   Wow, somebody's really examined this in detail.
[00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:36.180]   Wow, the icons are wrong, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:36.940]   That's a good fake.
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:39.940]   Somebody put a lot of effort into that fake.
[00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:43.180]   I guess you could do a one off, though, just printing press.
[00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:45.820]   Also, I used to work on the MarvX 41A,
[00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:49.140]   and the blue switch should be next to the red switch, so--
[00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:50.220]   Those icons are wrong.
[00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:51.700]   This does know what they're talking about.
[00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:53.060]   It's a fake printing press.
[00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:58.380]   By the way, we were talking about the fact that, oh, there's
[00:21:58.380 --> 00:21:59.380]   the tech high vlog.
[00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:00.700]   Yeah, free plug, thankfully.
[00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:01.340]   Free plug.
[00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:03.260]   I love it.
[00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:06.100]   I'm excited, because it's something different.
[00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.180]   And I do think that--
[00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:08.780]   I'm sorry, I am giving you a free plug right now.
[00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:11.820]   But I do think in tech journalism, what's exciting now
[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:12.940]   is not the news.
[00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:17.220]   The news has become a commodity.
[00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:18.820]   Facts are commoditized, right?
[00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:20.900]   It's analysis, it's understanding, it's depth.
[00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:23.700]   And that's really-- there's an opportunity there.
[00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:25.940]   And with sites like the Verge doing such a good job
[00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:28.300]   on just the breaking news, I wouldn't
[00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:31.100]   want to go up against the Verge anymore.
[00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:31.740]   That's just--
[00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:32.500]   No.
[00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:33.460]   Yeah, like that side, I--
[00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:35.620]   Yeah, we don't need another one of those.
[00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:37.540]   We don't.
[00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:38.020]   We don't.
[00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:42.340]   I mean, they've done-- they're breaking more stories now.
[00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:43.940]   What apples are going to vent?
[00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:45.460]   Well, my--
[00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:46.820]   Breaking news.
[00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:52.140]   So anyway, this is-- the fact that it has the five there
[00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:55.300]   does kind of lend one to believe this is an iPhone event.
[00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:57.020]   Not a iPad mini event.
[00:22:57.020 --> 00:23:00.500]   I'll bet you $4 that it's an iPhone event.
[00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:02.220]   Yeah.
[00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:03.220]   Not five?
[00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:04.900]   Not five.
[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:06.860]   10 AM, Urbobuina Center for the Arts.
[00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:09.900]   So let's tell you right now that Mac Break Weekly next week
[00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:10.980]   will not be on Tuesday.
[00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:11.820]   It'll be on Wednesday.
[00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:13.700]   We're going to flip flop with security now.
[00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:16.660]   Andy Inaco is flying out for the event.
[00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:18.860]   Jason, I hope you'll join us too after the event.
[00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:19.700]   And what we'll do--
[00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:21.220]   If I can, yes, absolutely.
[00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:23.300]   I have arranged for a Tim Cook puppet
[00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:27.660]   to be created by Brian Hogg, who's the master of puppets.
[00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:28.940]   He does the--
[00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:30.740]   Walt Moss puppet.
[00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:34.180]   And we're going to put him on a green screen.
[00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:36.060]   I'm going to take pictures from the live blogs,
[00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:37.620]   put it up behind him.
[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:38.940]   And he's going to read the text.
[00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:41.460]   So we are going to do basically a reenactment.
[00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:47.260]   So for those of you who can't get into the live event,
[00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:51.660]   since Apple does stream it, we've decided to reenact it.
[00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:52.740]   What's wrong with that?
[00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:53.780]   There's a phrase for this Leo.
[00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:54.940]   It's the puppet cast.
[00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:57.220]   Puppet cast.
[00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:04.140]   So our crack team will be here analyzing the Tim Cook puppet.
[00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:05.340]   As he gives us--
[00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:06.740]   I hope, God, I didn't think of this.
[00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:09.780]   We should get a Scott Forest Hall puppet as well.
[00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:11.100]   Yeah.
[00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:12.220]   Shoot, I forgot.
[00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:13.220]   Who else would be on stage?
[00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:14.220]   Let's feel the rest of it.
[00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:15.860]   Get a big Bob Mansfield puppet, because that would be a great puppet.
[00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:17.500]   Hey, Bob Mansfield.
[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:18.940]   And then--
[00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:19.460]   Who?
[00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:20.060]   I'm going to meet.
[00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:21.940]   And probably Bob Mansfield talks like this.
[00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:25.140]   But I just-- I think he talks like this.
[00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:26.020]   No, he's a big guy.
[00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:27.820]   He talks like this.
[00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:28.660]   I'm glad he's back.
[00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:30.380]   We needed a blue collar bob in there.
[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:32.020]   So we'll have a blue collar bob puppet.
[00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:33.780]   We'll have a Phil Schiller puppet.
[00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:36.500]   We'll have-- oh, we got to get-- I got a good call, Brian.
[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:40.380]   I only had a make-- maybe the Tim Cook puppet could just do it all.
[00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:42.180]   We don't have to do puppet changes.
[00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:45.380]   Just one puppet that does it all.
[00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:47.220]   We do have the I CEO somewhere.
[00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:49.300]   Did Sarah take it home, finally?
[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:51.060]   OK.
[00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:55.140]   Now, you can't just make a generic puppet that, like, with enough no features
[00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:57.900]   and just like stubble on it so that you put one set of eyes on it.
[00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:58.500]   There you go.
[00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:02.300]   You put like a white sort of wig on it and your glasses and it's Tim Cook.
[00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:05.060]   I think it's a good investment because if Apple does two events--
[00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:05.900]   You're walking.
[00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:07.660]   We'll be using it again.
[00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:09.940]   About like an anthropomorphic Apple.
[00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:12.540]   Like the talking Apple tells you what it's going to--
[00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:13.740]   Annoying Apple.
[00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:15.620]   What about Annoying Apple?
[00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:17.420]   Let's make one of those two.
[00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:18.220]   That's easy.
[00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:20.380]   We just put lips on an Apple.
[00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:22.460]   Yeah, we're going to switch them out every once in a while.
[00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:24.420]   Otherwise, he'll get rotten.
[00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:25.340]   Right.
[00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:25.820]   Let's do that.
[00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:27.700]   Use a fresh Apple.
[00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:28.700]   I'll be Annoying Apple.
[00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:30.660]   You can put my lips on an Apple.
[00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:32.300]   And I'll-- and I'll heckle.
[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:32.740]   Sounds good.
[00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:34.380]   I'll heckle from the audience.
[00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:35.220]   I like the S3.
[00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:35.980]   You got the S3.
[00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:37.020]   What about the Android, Tim?
[00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:38.020]   What about the Android?
[00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:38.540]   Well, it'd be good.
[00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:39.380]   It'd be great.
[00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:40.820]   It'd be really annoying.
[00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:43.780]   And at the end, you could squish it with a mallet.
[00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:47.220]   Actually, I do think this is not something that Android should celebrate.
[00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:52.780]   But according to the story today, the Galaxy S3 did, in fact, outsell the iPhone
[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:54.340]   for the first time ever last month.
[00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:59.620]   But of course, because everybody's waiting for the iPhone 5, that doesn't mean anything.
[00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:05.140]   Actually, aren't you kind of annoyed by all these people who are like, oh, well, this
[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:06.620]   phone didn't sell as much as this one.
[00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:08.260]   So this one is this phone is a failure.
[00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:09.980]   It's horse race journalism.
[00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:12.380]   And it's the lowest form in journalism.
[00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:13.940]   But it's easy.
[00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:20.500]   It's like people who keep growing about how Jane Leno keeps beating David Letterman and
[00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:21.500]   late night ratings.
[00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:22.500]   You know what?
[00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:25.300]   CBS had absolutely no nothing going on at 11.30.
[00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:29.620]   We let him in like built a business where nothing but like, arid ground stood.
[00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:34.200]   I'm sure that CBS is pretty happy to be second in a business where they had 20 year old
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:38.260]   Colombo reruns before he came along.
[00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:41.340]   I guess we can do another roundup of iPhone 5 rumors.
[00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:43.300]   This is our last chance.
[00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:44.300]   It's good.
[00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:47.140]   So I'm going to remember these days.
[00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:48.540]   I'm going to treasure these days.
[00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:50.140]   These iPhone 5 rumor days.
[00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:52.300]   Oh, those were the good old until iPhone.
[00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:56.460]   If you're stuck with a topic for a column and you're an hour away from deadline, just
[00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:58.940]   make some stuff up and it'll be fine.
[00:26:58.940 --> 00:26:59.940]   Yeah.
[00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:02.220]   Well, I don't even want to go through this.
[00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:03.220]   Yeah.
[00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:04.220]   Why bother?
[00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:05.220]   Why bother?
[00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:06.220]   You know, and we'll find out.
[00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:09.420]   We're going to find out in a week.
[00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:12.940]   Everybody's still on board with the idea that it will be available nine days after the
[00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:14.580]   event on the 21st.
[00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:16.580]   Any reason to think otherwise?
[00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:17.580]   That's the pattern.
[00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:22.260]   The pattern is they announced on a Wednesday the embargoed first reviews from the people
[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:25.260]   on the kind of A list show up the next Wednesday.
[00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:26.260]   Mossberg.
[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:28.580]   And it goes on sale on Friday.
[00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:31.100]   And then Jason, are you on that A list?
[00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:33.820]   Man, I've been recently.
[00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:35.420]   So cross fingers.
[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:36.420]   Yeah.
[00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:39.580]   Those are the people who get iPhone 5's right away.
[00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:40.580]   Those that day.
[00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:42.380]   Or actually they haven't by now.
[00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:43.380]   They've had them by now, right?
[00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:44.380]   No, no, no, no.
[00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:47.140]   No, that's the like spruh presidents get that.
[00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:53.180]   But most of the pattern they do is that they that after the event, certain reviewers end
[00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:57.100]   up with demo units, review units that they take away under embargo.
[00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:59.700]   So, but it doesn't happen before the announcement.
[00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:04.860]   That's a super if anybody that would only be your Walt Mossbergs or David Poggs of the
[00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:05.860]   world.
[00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:06.860]   Right.
[00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:12.940]   I don't buy this video that there will be new earbuds.
[00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:17.620]   This is his bogus is that pretty pressing, right?
[00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:19.500]   Or no, it could be from anywhere.
[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:21.340]   It could be packaged for anything.
[00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:23.340]   She looks like a cop.
[00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:24.340]   Yeah.
[00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:25.340]   I mean, they look kind of cool.
[00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:26.900]   I don't know how they work outside.
[00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:27.900]   They don't look comfortable.
[00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:28.900]   No.
[00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:29.900]   Do you want to insert that?
[00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:32.500]   The existing earbuds aren't very comfortable.
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.300]   No, they actually they deserve they.
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:36.220]   We need an updated earbud.
[00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:37.980]   There's no question about that.
[00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:41.900]   But there's a good there's a good brisk market and third party earphones for the iPhone.
[00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:48.660]   In fact, that's I would say the iPhone and iPod have created a market for third third
[00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:49.660]   party earbuds.
[00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:53.940]   The thing with that particular model though is that there's no microphone on the cord.
[00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:57.780]   But I hope people say there might be microphones built into the actual earbuds themselves.
[00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:01.780]   But I can't really see that because also on the microphone, you've got the controls as
[00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:03.620]   well, which you know what there is a microphone.
[00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:07.060]   What is that thing at the bottom of the of the plastic?
[00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:10.060]   There's an opening there that could be.
[00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:12.660]   Yeah, I can find some things in it.
[00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:13.660]   Yeah.
[00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:14.660]   It's okay.
[00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:15.660]   I didn't report on this.
[00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:16.660]   I didn't want to report on this.
[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:17.660]   But yeah.
[00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:20.460]   So these things are getting even more suspicious because now it's pretty much a given that
[00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:26.180]   if you really want to get lots and lots of clicks, come up with an half big credible rumor
[00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:29.340]   one week before you know that the announcement is going to come because that's when people
[00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:32.540]   are sort of expecting really interesting rumors to come out.
[00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:36.260]   That's the point where there are a lot of leaks that are kind of impossible for Apple
[00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:40.260]   to really prevent because now the information is in way too many sets of hands.
[00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:43.540]   So yeah, I mean, it's I got a credit with Mac rumors.
[00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:45.940]   I got a credit Mac rumors for this though.
[00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:51.460]   This video they made of what a new iPhone screen would look like based on and they put
[00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:52.780]   nice music behind.
[00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:57.540]   So and actually they put some effort into it because they had to simulate a taller screen.
[00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:02.540]   Now this is if it were the 1136 by 640 screen.
[00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:05.100]   So this is at least they're not even pretending that this is a real one.
[00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:10.260]   They're just saying this is what it would look like if it's true, if that's true.
[00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:13.140]   And all good stuff, not much of a surprise.
[00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:15.980]   It is more 16 nine, isn't it?
[00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:18.140]   That's the rumor is that it's exactly 16 by nine.
[00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:19.140]   Yeah.
[00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:22.820]   And Apple's never done a 16 by nine device ever, right?
[00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:23.820]   Right.
[00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:27.180]   They've always done four three.
[00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:31.020]   So there's some advantage to having it for content anyway.
[00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:34.780]   Well, the iPhone's always been slightly widescreen, but not widescreen enough.
[00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:40.500]   So you have to double tap to lose the letterboxing and the iPad's been four by three.
[00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:43.500]   And then I think they might have had a 16 by nine laptop at some point, but it's not
[00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:46.460]   going to focus for them to go and embrace 16 by nine.
[00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:47.460]   Right.
[00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:51.380]   I think it really is a future trend that every new device has to be at least informed by
[00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:56.420]   the presence of tighter connectivity with with an actual regular HD TV.
[00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:58.460]   So if it's possible to do that without.
[00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:02.780]   And I don't see how they I've used 16 by nine tablets before, and they always just seem
[00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:06.580]   like you're holding a legal document as opposed to like a workable tablet.
[00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:07.900]   I don't think it would come to that.
[00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:11.580]   But I think that there's always that part of the design process where it's like how good
[00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:15.540]   is this going to be to drive content to drive games off of an Apple TV?
[00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:21.660]   And if you can put a 69 display on there, why go with some oddball display that you have
[00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:23.260]   to manufacture yourself?
[00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:27.740]   I think the reason that they didn't do 16 by nine on the iPhone initially is that it's
[00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:31.780]   just it does change the shape of the device and it makes it longer.
[00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:34.980]   And it makes it, you know, when you're holding it, the weight is pulling, you know, pulling
[00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:36.180]   in your hand a little bit more.
[00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:40.140]   And these devices are getting so light now that for something like a phone, it maybe
[00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:41.140]   doesn't matter.
[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:43.380]   But I think that was part of it is that they thought the shape you don't want it to be
[00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:48.740]   too long in direction or you end up with a big, you know, like stick.
[00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:49.740]   And that's no good.
[00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:53.420]   That's great for video producers though, because, you know, 16 by nine, I've always produced
[00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:56.420]   all my content in 16 by nine since, well, since I started.
[00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:59.740]   And whenever you do see it on the phone, the phone at the moment, because it does let a
[00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:03.620]   box in, it's just a little bit too small to actually watch a screencast comfortably.
[00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:07.620]   But you know, with that extra little bit of width so that it pops out a bit further,
[00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:09.420]   I'm really looking forward to that.
[00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:15.780]   The Don Cornelius in our chatroom, the late host of Soul Train points out that it probably
[00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:20.820]   says it like this, that Apple's displays used to be 1610, but are now 169, the, the
[00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:22.340]   cinema displays.
[00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:23.500]   So I guess I take it back.
[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:25.820]   Apple has done 169 products.
[00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:30.420]   And also the 11 inch because 16 by nine, so I guess it is.
[00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:31.420]   Huh?
[00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:33.020]   Look at what the world is going.
[00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:34.020]   Yeah.
[00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:35.820]   No, it makes sense.
[00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:40.380]   Of course, I think Samsung and Nokia and Amazon are all going, I'm glad Apple's having
[00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:44.900]   that event because we moved everything over so we can beat them to the punch.
[00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:47.980]   It would have been embarrassing if Apple didn't have that event in the 12th.
[00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:54.060]   Samsung last week had its big at EFA, the big announcement of the Samsung Galaxy Note
[00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:56.780]   2.
[00:32:56.780 --> 00:33:03.220]   Apple's response was to file in court for a, to block the Note 1 and the Galaxy S3.
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:09.500]   They also announced new Windows phones and Windows RT tablets and new Windows 8 computers
[00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:12.340]   because why not?
[00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:15.860]   Nokia has an events tomorrow, right?
[00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:22.500]   Nokia World and which they'll announce their new Windows phones and maybe other stuff.
[00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:25.980]   Motorola and Google have their announcement tomorrow as well.
[00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:28.580]   And then Amazon is Wednesday or Thursday.
[00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:29.580]   Thursday, yeah.
[00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:33.660]   Yeah, they're going to announce, I think it's probable Kindle Fire since the Kindle Fire
[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:37.020]   suddenly is out of stock on Amazon.com.
[00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:39.900]   Yeah, all new Kindle's I think.
[00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:41.980]   All new Kindle's probably, yeah.
[00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:46.540]   And all of this because they would announce it now anyway, but it just, but also once the
[00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:52.460]   Apple announced the iPhone and the mini, there's the news cycle is all, there's a vacuum.
[00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:54.540]   Right now, so they're going to fill that vacuum.
[00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:58.260]   Yeah, but the danger is that they're going to, you know, they come out before Apple and
[00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:01.140]   then Apple gets to drop the bomb of whatever they've got.
[00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:04.380]   And, you know, I could argue the other side that they might want to wait.
[00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:08.180]   The problem is that it's not just Apple owning a day, Apple owns that day and the whole next
[00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:11.380]   week and then the reviews come out and then it gets released in their lines and it's like
[00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:15.660]   a week and a half before you can even say anything if you're one of these other companies.
[00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:17.060]   So I see why they do it.
[00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:18.060]   It is interesting.
[00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:19.060]   HTC, I guess, is coming out.
[00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:21.620]   They're doing an event after the Apple event.
[00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:23.340]   So they're taking the other approach.
[00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:24.340]   Oh, good.
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:25.500]   Well, we can test your thesis.
[00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:29.020]   I'm not sure if that's a big deal.
[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:35.220]   I think they all know how big any new iPhone announcement is going to be, how big any new
[00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:37.300]   iTunes announcement is going to be.
[00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:39.820]   And they know that they're really not going.
[00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:45.460]   I think that they can see that as an inevitability and it's not as though they feel as though by
[00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:46.900]   jumping them by one week.
[00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:50.380]   I think by jumping them one week, if there's any effect whatsoever, they know that they
[00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:54.420]   have that little extra push to get into the coverage of Apple.
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:57.500]   So many of us are writing about Apple a week beforehand.
[00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:00.660]   Like editors are saying, hey, can you give us some content about the iPhone 5?
[00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:02.660]   Can you give us some content about this, that, the other?
[00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:04.380]   It's a good chance to talk about, well, let's see.
[00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:07.180]   Now, Kindle is coming out with is doing something on August 6th.
[00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:08.540]   Excuse me, September 6th.
[00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:10.100]   Here's what it seems likely they're going to do.
[00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:14.500]   I don't think we're going to see an Android phone, but yes, we're going to see at least
[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:18.740]   a better version, a less complaining version of the fire.
[00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:20.860]   And that's a good way to piggyback on a coverage.
[00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:24.980]   So it's not a case of being clobbered so much as wanting to be part of the conversation.
[00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:25.980]   Yeah.
[00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:27.820]   I think also as well it's the response.
[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:31.700]   I mean, if they do come after the event, there's not really a lot they can do to respond
[00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:32.700]   to Apple come out with.
[00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:36.220]   I mean, possibly it's like tweaking the pricing, but as far as the technology and the actual
[00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:39.900]   products, I mean, they're already sort of sealed down.
[00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:45.940]   So, you know, for instance, let's say Samsung decided to talk about the Note 2 after Apple.
[00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:47.580]   They could say Apple, four inch screen.
[00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:49.380]   We've got five and a half inches.
[00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:51.100]   Apple, dual core processor.
[00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:52.620]   We have quad core processor.
[00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:55.140]   They say Apple, we have 512 megs of RAM.
[00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:56.540]   We've got two gigs of RAM.
[00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:58.820]   They could say, I mean, there's a lot they could say.
[00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:01.820]   There's a huge amount they could say.
[00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:06.180]   And the thing is they can't say that until after the iPhone 5 comes out.
[00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:11.380]   On the other hand, the big bomb that's hovering in the air is still the price of the iPad
[00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:15.180]   Mini that there are three pricing levels for that device.
[00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:18.620]   And if it's $199, that is a neutron bomb.
[00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:19.620]   That's it.
[00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:20.620]   That's the whole class of devices.
[00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:22.100]   250 is competitive.
[00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:24.100]   300 is like, okay, great.
[00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:27.260]   We could definitely compete with a $300 iPad Mini.
[00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:31.300]   So yeah, well, I'm sure.
[00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:37.020]   I think maybe that Amazon is just hoping they could sell as many Kindle fires as possible
[00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:38.500]   until next month.
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:40.700]   And they're going to say, okay, it's okay.
[00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:45.140]   Amazon is in a great position because it's like every place where people can do it.
[00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:46.540]   It's going to be going online to shop.
[00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:48.340]   Really it's just Amazon.com.
[00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:51.020]   And that's going to be on the front page everywhere.
[00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:52.020]   Yes.
[00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:55.580]   And it's going to be a very, very easy purchase for a lot of people to make, especially people
[00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:59.660]   who don't define a tablet as a post PC computer.
[00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:01.780]   They define it as, here's what I read my books on.
[00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:03.020]   Here's what I get my movies on.
[00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:09.300]   And here's what I order my arm salve, my heel and elbow salve with.
[00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:15.540]   I go on medical powder.
[00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:17.260]   Yeah, I mean, it'd be interesting to see if they actually...
[00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:21.260]   I was cracking as you like, Alan, I ordered three boxes, Ron Amazon Prime.
[00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:26.260]   It'd be interesting to see if they can actually go international with it this time because
[00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:27.820]   they failed on the last one.
[00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:28.820]   Really?
[00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:29.820]   What happened internationally?
[00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:31.220]   We have the fire in the UK.
[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:32.220]   Never saw it.
[00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:33.220]   Never saw it.
[00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:35.980]   We saw the, we saw the Ying Kindle.
[00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:39.460]   They came across eventually, but we never actually got to see the fire.
[00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:41.900]   So it'd be interesting to see whether or not they're actually going to go international
[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:43.100]   with it this time around.
[00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:47.860]   See, I, we forget this here in the US that this is not an international product.
[00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:52.220]   Did they not have the fire in Canada either?
[00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:53.220]   No.
[00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:54.220]   No, not in Canada either.
[00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:55.220]   It was US only.
[00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:56.900]   Yeah, I think this is there.
[00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:58.580]   I think they made the first fire.
[00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:01.660]   They tried to do it quickly and it was US only because that was easier for them.
[00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:07.780]   But I would be shocked if this fire doesn't roll out much more broadly internationally.
[00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:10.140]   And let's throw in also the E-ink models.
[00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:13.180]   You can buy them cheaper if you agree to see ads on them.
[00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:17.140]   And it wouldn't surprise me if they used that model to push the fire price down even
[00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:22.580]   further, maybe the 179 or 159 or 149.
[00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:25.740]   You know, that really could be a fantastic price.
[00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:29.060]   A little tablet like that, even if Apple does come in at 249.
[00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:32.460]   Don, what is Amazon's reputation in the UK?
[00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:34.260]   I mean, do people shop at Amazon?
[00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:35.260]   Is that a?
[00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:36.260]   Yeah, no, it is.
[00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:37.260]   It is.
[00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:41.780]   They got a lot of bad press a couple of months ago because of the tax situation they've got
[00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:45.820]   various offshoots and various parts of Europe where they pay very little tax or hardly any
[00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:46.820]   tax.
[00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:49.020]   So they charge value out of tax in the UK?
[00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:50.020]   Yeah.
[00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:51.020]   Yeah, they have to say.
[00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:52.020]   20%.
[00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:53.020]   20%.
[00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:54.020]   Yeah.
[00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:56.020]   But I'm pretty sure they do.
[00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:57.020]   Yeah, no, but they do.
[00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:58.020]   Yeah.
[00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:00.620]   It's a huge chunk change.
[00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:02.620]   I would buy anything.
[00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:05.900]   It's like, I'm not going to pay 20%.
[00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:06.900]   That's worse than our gas.
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:08.060]   That's like gas tax here.
[00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:10.460]   It's done even start on petrol prices.
[00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:11.460]   Come on.
[00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:12.460]   It's like done.
[00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:14.420]   Every time you fly over here, isn't it?
[00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:18.860]   Doesn't it make more financial sense for you to basically throw away all of the clothes
[00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:22.700]   that you wore during your week here in the US, fill it with electronics and then just
[00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:27.780]   use the savings you made on VAT to just use that to buy new clothes when you get home?
[00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:28.780]   Yeah.
[00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:30.380]   See, the thing is they don't add the VAT.
[00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:33.540]   Normally in the shops, when you see a price, that's the price including VAT.
[00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:35.620]   So you sort of just used to it.
[00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:36.620]   You just get used to it.
[00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:41.620]   And if I go to a wholesalers or, you know, we have cash and carry places here that do
[00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:44.900]   add VAT on, but they give you the cost price and you go into it, well, that's cheap.
[00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:47.140]   And then you realize that they have that's included the VAT on it.
[00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:48.700]   20% of a shot.
[00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:54.500]   But you do get used to it because it's always included in the price whenever you go in normal
[00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:55.500]   retail.
[00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:56.500]   It's anyway.
[00:39:56.500 --> 00:40:02.500]   That's just in from 9 to 5 Mac, an exclusive iPod's likely to share the stage with iPhone
[00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:04.700]   5 at next week's Apple event.
[00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:08.860]   This is Mark Gurman writing.
[00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:13.260]   He says the new iPad, he's they think will still have its own announcement, but they'll
[00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:14.260]   put iPods.
[00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:15.260]   What?
[00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:16.940]   It makes no sense.
[00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:17.940]   I don't know.
[00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:22.940]   I don't know where he gets where he gets this story.
[00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:25.980]   But maybe it's just, you know, it's I have to say.
[00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:29.260]   It's all about link bait at this point.
[00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:30.260]   Likely.
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:31.260]   Likely.
[00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:32.260]   Yeah.
[00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:33.260]   Yeah.
[00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:37.860]   No, because nobody's going to remember after next week that 9 to 5 Mac said, Hey, where's
[00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:39.020]   the iPods?
[00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:43.780]   You know, it's just, it's just, I don't, I mean, maybe they got a good source.
[00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:45.780]   I know.
[00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:48.340]   It's you want to, you know, it's, it's all about reputation.
[00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:50.540]   It's not about how you do in September.
[00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:52.620]   It's like year after year after year.
[00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:55.380]   Did you how many times do you cry wolf and how many times do you actually deliver the
[00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:56.380]   goods?
[00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:57.380]   Yeah.
[00:40:57.380 --> 00:41:00.380]   Well, and also let's remember this, this minute, not be the case in this particular
[00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:03.780]   story, but Apple does make changes at the last minute.
[00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:08.620]   There are often things that are in a keynote and you, you see sometimes you'll be like,
[00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:10.020]   why didn't that get mentioned?
[00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:13.060]   It's in a press release later or it comes out a couple of weeks later.
[00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:16.140]   And I've heard that several times that there are products that are into the keynote up
[00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:17.140]   to the night before.
[00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:18.140]   Right.
[00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:19.140]   I don't know if this is still true.
[00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:22.060]   Certainly was true when jobs was charged where they would just yank it out and say, no,
[00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:23.060]   we're not going to even bother.
[00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:24.460]   We're, we've got enough here.
[00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:25.460]   Let's just dump it.
[00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:26.460]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:30.060]   So sometimes you can see these reports that end up being wrong that might have been possible.
[00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:34.820]   I mean, it may be that there's a chance that they're considering putting iPods in the event.
[00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:37.580]   And there, so they've got it in there for now and they'll decide later whether they're
[00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:39.620]   going to, they're going to rip it out because they do.
[00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:43.300]   Apple, you'd be surprised how stuff can change at the last minute without.
[00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:44.900]   No, no, you're absolutely right.
[00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:48.940]   I've said before about a story that I had that was absolutely dead cold.
[00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:51.580]   I had it locked with multiple sources.
[00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:54.540]   And then two weeks before the announcement, it just fell apart.
[00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:57.740]   There was sort of a change of decision saying, you know what, we decided this, this partnership
[00:41:57.740 --> 00:41:59.980]   is not, does not work for our strategy.
[00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:01.500]   And so we're not going to go ahead with this.
[00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:03.540]   And it's like, okay, good.
[00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:04.540]   Yeah.
[00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:08.940]   Good, good, good thing that good thing that I'm not like writing like 8000 words exclusive.
[00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:09.940]   I got this.
[00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:10.940]   I got this.
[00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:11.940]   Oh, dear.
[00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:12.940]   Yes, that would have been very embarrassing.
[00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:14.700]   It must be hard.
[00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:17.420]   I'm glad that we don't have to worry about our reputation.
[00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:18.420]   It sucks.
[00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:24.740]   I'm sure your Apple is CEO puppet show is going to turn that right around.
[00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:26.220]   I can't wait.
[00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:27.980]   You really don't want to go to another event.
[00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:28.980]   Do you really?
[00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:30.420]   Oh, I gave up that long ago.
[00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:31.420]   That's never happened.
[00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:32.420]   Although I haven't checked my email.
[00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:33.420]   Maybe I did get it.
[00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:34.420]   Wouldn't that be funny if I got an email?
[00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:37.220]   This is such a thing as PR suicide by cop.
[00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:41.620]   You just want to make sure that you can no longer say Apple hates me.
[00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:44.060]   You can say, no, no, it's because I did the puppet show.
[00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:45.060]   That's why I'm not.
[00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:46.060]   Why would they hate that?
[00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:47.420]   That's, that's, that's, I don't know.
[00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:49.420]   I'm not guessing one way or another.
[00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:55.260]   I'm just saying that's what, what, what is the, what is the from address on your, on
[00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:59.620]   your invitation and then the other puppets are not going to be making out with each
[00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:00.620]   other.
[00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:01.620]   That's all I'm asking.
[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:02.620]   All I'm asking.
[00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:03.620]   All I'm asking.
[00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:06.220]   In the subject, it's RSVP in the subject.
[00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:07.720]   Oh, in the from.
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:08.720]   From is RSVP.
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:09.720]   Wow.
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:12.220]   RSVP like RSVP dot Apple dot com.
[00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:13.220]   Yeah.
[00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:16.260]   I haven't received anything from RSVP in the last five years.
[00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:18.260]   So I think I'm safe.
[00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:22.820]   That's what the five means.
[00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:23.820]   You're five years up.
[00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:24.820]   Five years is up.
[00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:26.820]   I'm in, I'm in, I don't care.
[00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:27.820]   I like it.
[00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:30.780]   There's a certain, it's a certain badge of honor.
[00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:34.500]   Oh, I don't, I don't, I don't like that designation either.
[00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:36.580]   It's like I'm making lemons out of lemonade.
[00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:38.140]   Andy, give me a break.
[00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:39.860]   I'm throwing, I'm throwing you a bone.
[00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:42.180]   I, I, you're, you're a lovely person.
[00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:44.700]   Then how, I would anybody not want you in an event.
[00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:46.860]   You are the Mary Tyler Moore of any tech event.
[00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:49.060]   You turn the event on with your smile.
[00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:53.100]   You can take a nothing release and suddenly make it all mean seem worthwhile.
[00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:54.900]   It's me, and you should know it.
[00:43:54.900 --> 00:44:00.460]   And I should know it with every little something I show it.
[00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:01.460]   All right.
[00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:07.140]   Let's take a break and I'm going to continue to search for an invitation.
[00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:11.300]   Well, I, well, Leo searches for an invitation to an Apple event.
[00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:12.300]   Nothing.
[00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:13.300]   Motorola mobility.
[00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:18.540]   That's it.
[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:20.780]   Let us talk about hover.com.
[00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:23.220]   When's the last time you registered a domain name?
[00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:25.220]   Can I tell you about the best place to do it?
[00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:26.740]   This is, we love these guys.
[00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:28.900]   This is two cows.
[00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:32.300]   And I'm just such a fan of Elliot Noss, who's been around since it used to stand for the
[00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:35.980]   ultimate collection of Windows software, but they've really branched out great Canadian
[00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:43.940]   company and they decided to be the company that kind of reinvents businesses that need
[00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:44.940]   reinventing.
[00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:45.940]   They started with domain names.
[00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:46.940]   They're doing cell phones now.
[00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:48.940]   Let me talk about hover.com.
[00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:52.260]   Simplify domain name management.
[00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:55.820]   The best domain management tools in the industry.
[00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:59.180]   A clean, simple registration process.
[00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:01.660]   You got to love that.
[00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:03.740]   Built in who is privacy.
[00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:05.620]   It's part of the cost.
[00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:10.340]   So that way your personal information isn't available in public.
[00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:13.220]   Unlimited domain forwarding advanced DNS management.
[00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:14.700]   It really is great.
[00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:15.700]   Now they don't do hosting.
[00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:16.700]   And I kind of like that.
[00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:19.700]   They're not upselling you on hosting or anything like that.
[00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:26.460]   You can get of course all the really popular domains like .com.net.co.ca.org, but also country
[00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:27.500]   specific domains.
[00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:32.700]   You can use .it.asia.es.us.de.
[00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:37.340]   And they have some of the newer domains.pro.triplex.tv.
[00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:40.860]   When you call for customer support, you're going to get great support from hover.
[00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:46.340]   They have a no hold policy for customer service calls Monday through Friday, 9am to 8pm eastern
[00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:47.340]   time.
[00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:54.540]   And if you go to Macbreak.hover.com, we're going to get you 10% off your new domain.
[00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:59.140]   So if you're one of those people, I know many of them like Dick D. Bartolo, who just every
[00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:00.740]   time you hear something, oh, that's a good domain.
[00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:02.220]   They just register it.
[00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:03.220]   I do that too.
[00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:06.260]   I have quite a few domains that don't have any sites attached.
[00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:09.020]   This is the place to not only save, but then make it very easy.
[00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:13.220]   If you're ready to transfer away from your current registrar, they make that easy too
[00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:15.100]   with the concierge service.
[00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:18.700]   Normally they charge 25 bucks for that, but I am told if you mention us, they'll waive
[00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:19.980]   that fee.
[00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:25.060]   And it's $10 for the transfer, but that gives you an extra year on your domain.
[00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:27.180]   So it's a very good deal.
[00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:34.860]   You can call 866-731-6556 or use Macbreak.hover.com and make sure you use Macbreak as the offer
[00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:39.060]   code if you make a purchase because you'll get 10% off any of your purchases.
[00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:43.820]   The best domain registrar in the business, hover.com.
[00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:44.820]   People tweet me all the time.
[00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:45.820]   What was that registrar?
[00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:46.820]   I don't know why it's hard for them to remember.
[00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:54.580]   Think of a hummingbird hovering over your new website, hover.com.
[00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:55.580]   They're very good.
[00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:56.580]   We lose Jason.
[00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:57.580]   We lost Jason.
[00:46:57.580 --> 00:46:58.580]   We lost Jason.
[00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:01.340]   Yes, he is standing by on Skype.
[00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:06.740]   So if I had my Jason puppet, he could like just Skype as covers to me.
[00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:08.860]   I did that once with John C. de Vorak.
[00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:11.020]   We could never get him back in the earliest days of Twitter.
[00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:15.100]   And so he was in the instant message and I did an imitation of him.
[00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:22.100]   It didn't work again.
[00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:24.420]   I'm going to not say anything about the Apple Samsung trial.
[00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:27.780]   I already mentioned that Apple is now trying to get an injunction against the Galaxy S3
[00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:30.300]   and the Galaxy Note.
[00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:32.580]   They are trying to, okay, I lied.
[00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:35.300]   I am going to say something about it.
[00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:41.100]   The original date for Injunctive relief was December and they really don't want to wait
[00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:42.100]   that long.
[00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:47.340]   So Apple has filed a request for permission to bring a motion for reconsideration of the
[00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:50.620]   scheduling.
[00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:58.580]   Apple complains the court has asymmetrical schedules for its decision on Samsung in September
[00:47:58.580 --> 00:47:59.580]   versus Apple.
[00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:01.100]   I tried that one on one of my college teachers.
[00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:02.100]   It didn't work.
[00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:06.740]   You know, you have asymmetrical grading policies.
[00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:12.020]   But it is important because December is a long time in the tech world.
[00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:16.700]   But you know, the courts are on a different kind of schedule.
[00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:21.260]   Almost as though they are not owned by a company and don't serve to do their bidding.
[00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:24.380]   That crazy talk.
[00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:29.420]   I learned in college when I covered a murder trial actually that the wheels of justice
[00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:30.420]   do spin.
[00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:33.140]   They spin incredibly slowly.
[00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:35.300]   So slowly has to be almost imperceptible.
[00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:37.100]   It's a different world.
[00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:43.340]   The tech world is moving light speed and the justice system is not.
[00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:50.820]   So if you want the discussion, the pros and cons on this, best place to go, Fospatence.com.
[00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:57.700]   And she's got a great discussion of why Apple is probably right in this request because
[00:48:57.700 --> 00:49:01.700]   it does in fact, it is asymmetric apparently.
[00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:07.740]   But it's complicated like everything else.
[00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:08.740]   Not she.
[00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:15.180]   And Mueller, is this possible?
[00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:19.740]   Apple and Google CEOs in secret patent talks.
[00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:22.340]   I love secret talks.
[00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:24.540]   Are they in Malta?
[00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:26.980]   Larry Page, you can't talk at all.
[00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:32.260]   I think Larry's writing it on a piece of paper and Tim Cook had been conducting according
[00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:36.940]   to Reuters behind the scenes talks about a range of intellectual property matters,
[00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:40.660]   including mobile patent disputes between the company.
[00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:45.300]   If you listen to what the judges have all ruled in this, the judges have said to Apple
[00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:51.540]   and Samsung and Google to an extension here, it's always in this business, it's come on,
[00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:52.540]   cut a deal.
[00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:54.020]   Don't make this go to trial.
[00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:56.380]   Don't make this go to the jury cut a deal.
[00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:57.380]   This was Samsung.
[00:49:57.380 --> 00:49:59.260]   It was a rare case where it actually went to the jury.
[00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:06.620]   But so often, and my sister is an intellectual patent attorney, it doesn't go to the jury.
[00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:09.940]   Even if you're in trial, they always settle.
[00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:15.500]   So this was one of those things where I think a lot of people feel that Steve Jobs, he wanted
[00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:18.180]   to go through a nuclear on Google.
[00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:24.420]   And that may be true, but Tim Cook is in charge now and maybe he's looking at this and saying,
[00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:28.020]   look, we're going to do what the judges suggest we do and what everybody else does in these
[00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:31.140]   situations, which is we're going to see if we can cut a deal.
[00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:33.980]   They may not reach a deal, but they should be talking.
[00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:36.180]   Absolutely, they should be talking about this.
[00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:41.020]   If nothing else is a really good idea for executives at that level to have some sort of
[00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:42.980]   a pipeline communication line between them.
[00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:47.180]   Remember that even Reagan and the Kremlin had a hot phone between each other.
[00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:52.460]   So I think one of the reasons why Samsung went through Renu clear like that was that
[00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:56.340]   really, as far as I could tell, there really was no line of communication between those
[00:50:56.340 --> 00:50:59.540]   two that was any productive, ongoing nature.
[00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:04.620]   So it was difficult for it to, not that these two companies would ever get together for
[00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:08.340]   beer and say, well, how about you take this patent and we'll take this patent and we
[00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:11.220]   just, here's a dollar, you got a dollar, great, let's sign this bar napkin.
[00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:12.220]   Great.
[00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:17.460]   We have friends again, we do the dance of joy, but it really is part of these casual relationships
[00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:22.260]   that are ongoing where there is at least a basic level of cordiality that you build
[00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:26.340]   upon that prevents these things from getting to exactly the sort of level.
[00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:29.180]   So if this rumor is true, I'm glad that happens.
[00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:34.060]   I really think that the only way for this to, and these, the situation and productively
[00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:39.340]   for consumers is for there to be at least some sort of a back channel in which in which
[00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:44.580]   at some point someone says, actually this patent, we weren't trying to copy this, this
[00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:46.940]   iPhone feature, but this is how it turned out.
[00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:50.980]   Let's talk and see if there's a way we can give this, these guys like a dollar 12 per
[00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:53.980]   handset and just avoid problems in the future.
[00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:58.100]   And maybe it would be a way to, I think it's a good way to make sure that good features
[00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:03.380]   that are too good not to copy as well as features that are kind of obvious that anybody would
[00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:08.740]   come up with on their own don't wind up crippling the future of handset development.
[00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:14.140]   And she does remind me those photos that were, remember when jobs met with Eric Schmitz,
[00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:16.620]   and I think it was when things were turning nasty as well, there were those photographs
[00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:20.580]   that were in the coffee shop, whether we're just having a chat over a cup of coffee, you
[00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:24.340]   know, it's that sort of level, whether it's sort of lines are communicating, they try
[00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:25.340]   to establish a thing.
[00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:31.460]   And also keeping in mind that the Apple Samsung deal was not just about, I mean, Google and
[00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:35.420]   Apple could come to some agreements and it doesn't stop a phone maker from adding their
[00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:38.300]   own skin on top that infringes on Apple's patents.
[00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:42.220]   I mean, Samsung, a lot of the issues in that case were not things involving Android per
[00:52:42.220 --> 00:52:46.220]   say, they were involving Touchwiz and they were involving the hardware.
[00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:49.660]   And so Google might end up making nice with Apple and it still might be a problem for
[00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:51.260]   individual phone makers.
[00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:56.620]   Well, I think there's, I would like to think there's at least agreement that both Google
[00:52:56.620 --> 00:52:58.460]   has the goods on Apple.
[00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:03.460]   Apple has the goods on Google that they can either decide to die with their hands wrapped
[00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:06.420]   around each other's throats like Jekar and Jabash.
[00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:07.420]   Jekar and Londo.
[00:53:07.420 --> 00:53:08.420]   Right.
[00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:12.580]   And Londo or they can simply agree that we can't, we, we, this is not a productive way
[00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:14.220]   for either of us to do business.
[00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:16.780]   I didn't know we'd be making Babylon five references today.
[00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:19.460]   Well, I saw, I saw you on the list.
[00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:23.380]   I figured that, you know what, I bet that together we could make that happen.
[00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:24.540]   And so we have.
[00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:26.780]   Enzyme and catalyst.
[00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:31.380]   Meanwhile, Mark Gurman of nine to five Macs saying, what, what do you did?
[00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:35.300]   Somebody told him you've been dissing him about the, I said, no, I just said, I didn't
[00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:37.380]   think there've been any iPods now it's next week.
[00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:38.380]   We shall see.
[00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:41.420]   Mark, you and I will make a bet, you know, a case of beer or something if they announce
[00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:44.900]   iPods next week.
[00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:52.220]   Just to get back to the Google Apple CIO, CEO conversation, Reuters has a single source
[00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:56.220]   who says the conversation last week did not result in the formal agreement.
[00:53:56.220 --> 00:53:58.700]   The two executives agreed to continue talking.
[00:53:58.700 --> 00:54:00.420]   I think that's doing the jobs.
[00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:04.220]   It's exactly Eric Schmidt and as Steve Jobs going to the coffee shop.
[00:54:04.220 --> 00:54:05.220]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:09.740]   And I was going to say, was it, was it coincidence that they decided to choose a table that was
[00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:11.660]   on the sidewalk in public view?
[00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:12.660]   Look at us.
[00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:15.940]   There's a lot of levels to why they want to get together and have these sort of talks.
[00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:24.100]   And exactly as you said, Jason, I think that the billion dollar judgment against Samsung
[00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:25.860]   is a clarion call to everybody.
[00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:29.060]   Let's just stop this and work it out.
[00:54:29.060 --> 00:54:32.980]   And I think in some ways that's the patent system actually working properly.
[00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:37.820]   Yeah, I don't know if it's working, but the, you know, there are two ways to go.
[00:54:37.820 --> 00:54:41.380]   You can go thermonuclear and forget about it.
[00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:45.980]   And everything explodes or you can realize that this is all about deterrence and making
[00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:50.980]   deals and that, you know, your nuclear stockpile is meant there as a talking point and for
[00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:53.780]   leverage and not ever meant to truly be deployed.
[00:54:53.780 --> 00:54:54.780]   It got overheated.
[00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:55.780]   It got overheated.
[00:54:55.780 --> 00:54:56.780]   Yeah.
[00:54:56.780 --> 00:55:02.140]   And somebody pushed the button and now let's everybody stand down and talk.
[00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:04.220]   You know, we'll work, we can work this out.
[00:55:04.220 --> 00:55:08.860]   A billion dollars, that's enough to get somebody's attention, I think.
[00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:13.100]   Speaking of that, Apple rejects an app that tracks US drone strikes.
[00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:17.900]   I don't know why they would reject that.
[00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:19.940]   Although I will.
[00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:23.980]   So you can pilot a drone with an iPhone, but you can't track it.
[00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:24.980]   Right.
[00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:25.980]   Send users a pop.
[00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:27.020]   There's a lot of taste in there.
[00:55:27.020 --> 00:55:31.020]   So this is the idea of this app and it actually seems political that they rejected it, but
[00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:32.020]   maybe not.
[00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:37.660]   It would send users a pop up notice whenever a drone killed somebody in, you know, Afghanistan
[00:55:37.660 --> 00:55:39.620]   or somewhere.
[00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:44.180]   But this is called drones plus as opposed to drones minus.
[00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:45.180]   I don't know.
[00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:48.180]   See, it's worth paying the dollar nine and I to get rid of the ads.
[00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:50.940]   Apple says it's objectionable and crude.
[00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:51.940]   Yeah.
[00:55:51.940 --> 00:55:56.100]   Well, just getting it, getting an alert every time someone dies.
[00:55:56.100 --> 00:55:58.380]   That's, yeah, but somebody's dying.
[00:55:58.380 --> 00:56:02.220]   I mean, I think that there's, I see the point of, I see the point of the app though.
[00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:03.220]   Doesn't.
[00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:06.500]   It seems to me that it reaches both soft potentially, right?
[00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:09.740]   It's people who want to cheer on drone strikes and people who want to say, you know, that
[00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:10.740]   this is bad.
[00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:12.420]   And here's another one that just happened.
[00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:13.420]   Right.
[00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:15.340]   Wherever drones were in the news, it's all, but oh no, it's surveillance.
[00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:18.860]   It's just getting video and making sure that our troops are safe and no, actually it's
[00:56:18.860 --> 00:56:24.180]   going to get the data from the UK's Bureau of Investigative Journalism, which compiles
[00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:27.300]   media accounts of the strikes.
[00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:30.180]   It doesn't present grizzly images of corpses or anything like that.
[00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:35.140]   It just pops up an alert saying a strike has occurred according to this public database.
[00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:41.020]   Here's an example on the screen now.
[00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:45.260]   U.S. drone strike kills seven in North War, Zikistan.
[00:56:45.260 --> 00:56:50.340]   Why is this not just a news app and why is Apple even bothering to get involved in this?
[00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:53.580]   Because, you know, by entering this, then they are making it political.
[00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:56.340]   They're making a judgment that this is something that people shouldn't see.
[00:56:56.340 --> 00:56:58.860]   And, you know, I don't think it's worth their time.
[00:56:58.860 --> 00:57:01.540]   I think it's the bad publicity.
[00:57:01.540 --> 00:57:03.460]   I said, why?
[00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:07.460]   Unless, if it's something really grotesque, then I could see it maybe.
[00:57:07.460 --> 00:57:10.340]   But this seems to be about information and just let it happen.
[00:57:10.340 --> 00:57:11.340]   Yeah.
[00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:15.900]   Josh Bakley, the guy who does the program is a student at Clay Shurkey's lab at the NYU
[00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:19.100]   Interactive Telecommunications Program.
[00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:22.380]   I'm curious how far up the chain this decision went, though.
[00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:26.140]   We keep paying indications that a lot of these decisions are not really huge decisions
[00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:27.140]   are made.
[00:57:27.140 --> 00:57:30.820]   It's like some guy who gets to process so many of these apps every hour or people who
[00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:36.780]   have to, it's that it's, I just wonder what salary level was the decision made to get
[00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:38.580]   rid of this app.
[00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:43.260]   The, okay, so it's been rejected three times.
[00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:46.460]   The first time it was kind of a basic version, Apple said it's too blah.
[00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:50.700]   The features and/or content of your app were not useful or entertaining enough.
[00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:53.460]   Or your app did not appeal to a broad enough audience.
[00:57:53.460 --> 00:57:58.100]   The final version, which was rejected on August 27th, quote, "We found that your app
[00:57:58.100 --> 00:58:01.980]   contains content that many audiences would find objectionable, which is not in compliance
[00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:03.620]   with the App Store review guidelines."
[00:58:03.620 --> 00:58:04.620]   Wow.
[00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:07.620]   I think it is a news app.
[00:58:07.620 --> 00:58:10.260]   I think that that, if you say, "Hey, this is a news app."
[00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:11.260]   Yeah.
[00:58:11.260 --> 00:58:17.220]   Well, anyway, it's just too bad that sometimes your app review is in the hands of someone
[00:58:17.220 --> 00:58:23.860]   who might have a very, very subjective opinion of what your app does, right?
[00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:26.380]   And the other side, and I talked a little bit about this on the radio show over the
[00:58:26.380 --> 00:58:27.380]   weekend.
[00:58:27.380 --> 00:58:30.420]   It's really complained about the way Apple does things.
[00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:38.180]   Somebody wanted a message, an app that could turn off SMS messaging when you're driving.
[00:58:38.180 --> 00:58:42.260]   And the problem is that Apple doesn't give you access or actually would send an auto response.
[00:58:42.260 --> 00:58:44.300]   So you get a text message.
[00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:45.340]   This is a great idea for an app.
[00:58:45.340 --> 00:58:50.660]   You get a text message and a program's running on your iPhone that says, "No, he's driving
[00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:53.620]   and sends a message back, sorry, I'm driving, but I'll respond to you when I stop."
[00:58:53.620 --> 00:58:54.900]   This is a great idea.
[00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:59.780]   The problem is Apple doesn't give third-party programs access to the SMS API.
[00:58:59.780 --> 00:59:01.100]   You can't do that.
[00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:04.580]   And my point was, if you're playing in the Apple sphere, Apple makes the rules.
[00:59:04.580 --> 00:59:05.580]   You can't complain.
[00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:07.780]   This is the way it is.
[00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:08.780]   And there's choice.
[00:59:08.780 --> 00:59:09.780]   You can go do it on an Android.
[00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:10.780]   If you don't like it.
[00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:17.140]   I mean, I've had recent experience of app projections with my SEO tutor apps.
[00:59:17.140 --> 00:59:20.140]   But I won't hit a bad word set against them because they reversed their decision in the
[00:59:20.140 --> 00:59:21.140]   end.
[00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:23.500]   So is there an appeal process?
[00:59:23.500 --> 00:59:24.500]   Yes.
[00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:25.500]   Yeah.
[00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:30.020]   I mean, basically I had about half a dozen apps in the iOS app store.
[00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:34.100]   So I have half a dozen in the Mac app store and half a dozen in the iOS app store.
[00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:37.420]   And I just put a routine update in for one of them.
[00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:38.780]   And it got rejected.
[00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:42.380]   And it got rejected on the basis that it was a movie, which I thought was, you know, there's
[00:59:42.380 --> 00:59:45.220]   a clause in there that if it's a movie, it should be in iTunes.
[00:59:45.220 --> 00:59:48.220]   If it's a book, it should be in the app bookstore.
[00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:51.340]   And I just thought someone had just read the rules a bit too strictly because it was
[00:59:51.340 --> 00:59:52.340]   a video tutorial.
[00:59:52.340 --> 00:59:53.340]   It wasn't a theatrical release.
[00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:54.540]   You know, it wasn't a movie.
[00:59:54.540 --> 00:59:56.260]   It was a video tutorial.
[00:59:56.260 --> 01:00:02.620]   So I just appealed against it fully expecting to have it approved and it got rejected again.
[01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:07.860]   And unfortunately, they said, oh, we've had a closer look at the app and we're actually
[01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:11.140]   going to withdraw all your other applications as well because they're all movies as well,
[01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:14.460]   which was a bit uncomfortable.
[01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:19.020]   But after about three months of reengineering the applications to add additional functionality
[01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:23.860]   and resubmitting them and talking to Apple, we finally managed to get the decision reversed.
[01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:26.220]   So they're going back in and next week or so, which was a good thing.
[01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:30.420]   But you know, initially I was fully supportive.
[01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:32.900]   What they said, if the rules said it shouldn't be a movie, fine.
[01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:39.020]   But you know, I felt it was a misinterpretation of the rules because my content wasn't a theatrical
[01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:40.020]   release.
[01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:43.700]   But also there was, you know, there's four or 500 other video tutorial apps in the app store
[01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:45.620]   and they hadn't been withdrawn or rejected.
[01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:50.380]   So as long as the fair, it's their store, they can set whatever rules they want, but
[01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:52.780]   they need to be fair and consistent across the board.
[01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:53.940]   That's fair to say that.
[01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:54.940]   Yeah.
[01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:57.300]   You can make the rules Apple, but they've got to be applied consistently.
[01:00:57.300 --> 01:00:58.300]   I agree with 100%.
[01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:01.020]   And they have reversed the ruling in this case, which is great.
[01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:02.020]   So good.
[01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:03.020]   Good.
[01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:04.220]   What's the name of it?
[01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:05.220]   It's the SEO tutor apps.
[01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:09.100]   There's one in there at the moment, which is SEO tutor for iBooks author, but there's
[01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:10.620]   another four or five coming along.
[01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:13.380]   They've been in there before, but they'll be reinstated hopefully in the next week or
[01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:14.380]   two.
[01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:15.380]   Good job.
[01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:16.380]   I'm not going to.
[01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:18.180]   No, no, that's something separate.
[01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:22.860]   That's in fact, in some ways it was sort of brought on or accelerated by the problems
[01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:24.540]   I was having in the app store.
[01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:28.340]   And as you know, I've got the podcast and I deliver video tutorials through the podcast
[01:01:28.340 --> 01:01:29.340]   via iTunes.
[01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:32.940]   And I've always felt that that was a bit of a barrier to some people because, you know,
[01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:36.380]   most people understand the concept, but it is sometimes difficult to get head around,
[01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:38.220]   you know, how is it being delivered to you?
[01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:42.340]   So I always wanted to go ahead and put a magazine together, a new standard, you know,
[01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:44.820]   that had some of my content and other things.
[01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:45.820]   What a good idea.
[01:01:45.820 --> 01:01:47.460]   So at Newstane instead.
[01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:48.460]   Yeah.
[01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:53.260]   So I've now got just published issue number two of Screencast Online Monthly.
[01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:56.980]   And basically it's about four hours worth of video content.
[01:01:56.980 --> 01:02:02.140]   So last month's tutorials, in streamable format, interspersed with articles and hints and
[01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:06.460]   tips and other stuff from some of my Mac colleagues and friends, you know, people like David
[01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:11.140]   Sparks and Alison Sheridan and Katie Floyd and Wally from MacMania, Wally's doing a video
[01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:12.140]   column in there.
[01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:13.140]   And it's great.
[01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:14.780]   It's really interesting.
[01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:16.380]   So that app is now in there.
[01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:20.060]   So people can subscribe to it like they do with the Screencast Online website or they
[01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:24.700]   can buy individual copies or, you know, it's a really nice system.
[01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:29.980]   It's based on a platform called MagCast, which is one of these back-end systems that are
[01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:32.780]   allowed to publish new stand apps very, very easily.
[01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:34.620]   And they sort out the application for you as well.
[01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:40.220]   I produce the content, they produce the platform and the app and we sort of co-produce it in
[01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:41.220]   Newstane.
[01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:42.220]   It's works great.
[01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:43.820]   See, that's the other side of this.
[01:02:43.820 --> 01:02:46.700]   You say, you know, you got it, Apple's way or the highway, but on the other hand, it
[01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:52.060]   is an ecosystem that for a single entrepreneur like you is hugely, the potential is huge.
[01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:54.660]   You've got, you know, the Screencast Online website.
[01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:58.900]   You've got the SCO Tutor apps and now you've got a Mag in the Newstane.
[01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:01.220]   And this is all you just by yourself.
[01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:02.220]   It is.
[01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:03.220]   Yeah.
[01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:04.860]   Me and my team of one.
[01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:05.860]   No.
[01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:09.540]   And I think that that, so that's what's really appealing about it.
[01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:12.140]   And you just have to understand if you're doing that, that well, Apple makes the
[01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:16.460]   rules and I agree with you, they should be applied fairly, but they are Apple's rules
[01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:17.460]   to make or.
[01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:21.900]   I mean, to be fair, I mean, I do have guest contributors to the magazine, but most of
[01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:23.020]   the content is the video.
[01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:27.460]   You know, it's another way of, it's sort of whenever we used to refer to a podcast, we
[01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:30.700]   used to always say, well, it's like a magazine that you subscribe to.
[01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:32.140]   And now it is actually a magazine.
[01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:35.380]   So people can subscribe to the magazine and that sort of breaks down a lot of the barriers
[01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:38.860]   of people's trying to understand, you know, what is it you're actually doing?
[01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:42.500]   You know, I'm not producing my cuisine as well as producing the podcast.
[01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:43.860]   We're going to take a break, come back.
[01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:46.500]   There is a big breach.
[01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:47.500]   And I'm not sure what it means.
[01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:53.460]   So I'm going to get you guys to explain why I should worry if my UDID has been exposed
[01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:55.100]   to the world.
[01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:56.100]   Mm.
[01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:58.700]   Scary sounding.
[01:03:58.700 --> 01:04:02.580]   An FBI laptop has been hacked.
[01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:05.220]   But first, a word from FreshBooks.
[01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:08.820]   Fresh, but if you're a small business owner, you know that the big, the worst
[01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:11.460]   day of the month is just, well, you just had it.
[01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:15.540]   Although if it were me, I would have put it off and I'd probably be doing my invoices
[01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:19.100]   right around now, because nobody wants to do invoices at the end of the month.
[01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:20.100]   It's a pain in the butt.
[01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:21.100]   But you know what?
[01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:22.100]   You don't do them.
[01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:23.100]   You don't get paid.
[01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:24.500]   That's why I love FreshBooks.
[01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:30.820]   I discovered FreshBooks in 2004 with Akba Zamber MacArthur, who introduced me to FreshBooks.
[01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:33.500]   And I'll tell you, this is the way cloud accounting.
[01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:35.700]   You know, now we call it cloud accounting.
[01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:41.140]   But when, you know, 5 million people have been using it since 2004, and it's just fantastic.
[01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:44.380]   It's easy to use.
[01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:48.460]   It's not, you know, it's accounting for non-accountants, but if it's getting you paid,
[01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:53.220]   which is the key to all of this, and by the way, your accountant will love it too, because
[01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:57.220]   FreshBooks makes the reports they need when it comes tax time.
[01:04:57.220 --> 01:05:01.220]   You can create invoices easily, email them to your client.
[01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:04.460]   Your clients can view the invoices online and pay you on the spot.
[01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:11.660]   And now they've got this new iPhone app that lets you do it all from the iPhone, including
[01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:16.620]   if you do time in hours, keeping track of the hours, and automatically porting them into
[01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:19.700]   your invoices.
[01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:25.780]   So hit the road and start making a little bit more money with FreshBooks.
[01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:26.780]   Here's the deal.
[01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:32.860]   30 days of unlimited use waiting for you right now at freshbooks.com.
[01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:36.020]   You can use your iPhone app as free.
[01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:39.500]   You can use the iPhone app to do invoices with it.
[01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:42.460]   I mean, this is changing everything to log your expenses.
[01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:47.860]   Really, they're moving into the direction of really full bookkeeping, but for people
[01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:50.300]   who are not professional bookkeepers.
[01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:55.420]   3.5 million FreshBooks users have been sending and paying invoices at freshbooks.com.
[01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:57.380]   Now you can join them free for 30 days.
[01:05:57.380 --> 01:06:04.980]   Go to freshbooks.com and rocket power your small business.
[01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:06.580]   Big fan.
[01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:08.020]   Big, big fan of FreshBooks.
[01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:11.100]   It's just a neat story and a neat company.
[01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:13.100]   Another Canadian company.
[01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:14.100]   Right on.
[01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:16.260]   We've got a couple of Winnipegers in the audience.
[01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:19.580]   That's two half of our sponsors today are Canadian companies.
[01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:20.980]   I love that.
[01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:21.980]   Freshbooks.com.
[01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:24.500]   Give them a try today.
[01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:29.580]   If they ask you, do me a favor and say, "Yeah, I heard Leo talking about it on the Mac break
[01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:30.580]   weekly."
[01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:34.420]   Yeah, we call them snowbirds.
[01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:38.140]   The people from Winnipeg, they're visiting now because winter has hit.
[01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:41.100]   Or will, any minute now.
[01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:45.660]   I remember talking to a friend of mine who plays in the band, Metallica.
[01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:49.220]   He said, "The coldest place we ever played in our life was Winnipeg."
[01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:51.860]   He said, "Winipig in the winter."
[01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:52.860]   No.
[01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:53.860]   No.
[01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:54.860]   No.
[01:06:54.860 --> 01:07:04.980]   So, FBI, allegedly, FBI's laptop hacked.
[01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:10.260]   Hackers have released 1 million and 1, so they could say more than a million, unique
[01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:15.620]   device identifiers, UDIDs from IOS devices.
[01:07:15.620 --> 01:07:21.540]   The hacking group Antisec says they came from an FBI owned laptop.
[01:07:21.540 --> 01:07:23.140]   Why the FBI had these UDIDs?
[01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:24.580]   I don't know.
[01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:29.260]   The group published a file containing UDIDs as well as push notification tokens, device
[01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:35.300]   names, and more last night promising that they have, in fact, 12 million.
[01:07:35.300 --> 01:07:36.940]   12 million.
[01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:42.700]   And some of them have some very personal data, full names, cell phone numbers, home addresses.
[01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:48.940]   There has been no confirmation from the FBI, but the Antisec folks claim to have remotely
[01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:50.740]   accessed.
[01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:57.420]   Supervisor agent Christopher K. Stangles data in March using a Java vulnerability.
[01:07:57.420 --> 01:08:00.180]   There's a few of those.
[01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:06.780]   Atomic reference array says a well-known vulnerability, which was patched in February.
[01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:11.460]   Apparently, agent Stangle didn't know that.
[01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:13.380]   Wow.
[01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:19.380]   So what, maybe, Jason, maybe you can explain what these UDIDs are.
[01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:24.020]   And is it of value to anybody to have your UDID?
[01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:27.340]   I mean, they're like serial numbers, essentially.
[01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:29.820]   And every iOS device has one.
[01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:35.980]   And they used to be used to identify you through apps to a server so that they could
[01:08:35.980 --> 01:08:39.940]   tell who you were and say, "Oh, yes, I already know who this iPhone is and I can send the
[01:08:39.940 --> 01:08:41.100]   data back to it."
[01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:43.740]   And Apple deprecated that and said, "You can't do that."
[01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:47.780]   So in fact, they've been rejecting apps since March that use UDID.
[01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:48.780]   Right.
[01:08:48.780 --> 01:08:51.380]   So the question is, I don't think they have much value.
[01:08:51.380 --> 01:08:56.500]   I mean, I guess it means somebody could put you on their ad hoc beta list and layback
[01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:57.500]   test.
[01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:58.500]   Wow.
[01:08:58.500 --> 01:08:59.500]   Wow.
[01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:00.500]   Oh my God.
[01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:01.500]   Yeah.
[01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:04.420]   But beyond that, I think the only question that really makes sense here is who has a
[01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:05.420]   list of these?
[01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:09.100]   How did they get them and why did they have them?
[01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:11.740]   Beyond that, I don't really know.
[01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:16.300]   I mean, that's the real question is, was there some government agency that had these
[01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:20.100]   UDIDs and why and how did they get them and what does that mean?
[01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:22.540]   Because I can't think of anything recent.
[01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:29.300]   You'd actually need a UDID unless maybe, I don't know if UDIDs ever get passed in network
[01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:33.180]   traffic in any way.
[01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:38.620]   So I don't think I can, I have a hard time guessing how these would be used unless it's
[01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:43.500]   something that goes to the level of like government wiretap kind of stuff.
[01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:48.540]   And that's the claim by some is that Apple gave these numbers out, but there's no evidence
[01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:50.260]   of that.
[01:09:50.260 --> 01:09:52.220]   But where would you get 12 million UDIDs?
[01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:56.540]   I think probably that's what anti-sec is, that's between the lines of what anti-secs
[01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:59.460]   up to is they're saying, hey, look, the FBI had these.
[01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:07.940]   Now there is a tool, chemosabi.net, K-I-M-O-S-A-B-E.net/test.html.
[01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:09.420]   You can enter in your UDID.
[01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:10.420]   Now I don't.
[01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:14.980]   He promises he's not going to use it.
[01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:19.180]   I mean, I don't think it's worth anything anyway, but if you could at least see if it's
[01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:22.820]   in that database or not.
[01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:27.980]   It could be that this was stolen from somebody who keeps it from the days when apps did send
[01:10:27.980 --> 01:10:32.020]   UDIDs, some app developer or server side, you know, that kept them all and that there
[01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:33.460]   was a breach.
[01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:37.580]   It is possible whether, you know, like a gaming service or something like that where
[01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:41.740]   all these games used this service and they all sent the UDID to verify it.
[01:10:41.740 --> 01:10:42.740]   So it's possible.
[01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:47.820]   There are places other than Apple that have big databases of UDIDs potentially at least.
[01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:51.700]   Yeah, if you were, well, it would have to be an app with a lot of users.
[01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:53.740]   It would have to be like Instagram, right?
[01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:57.540]   Or a shared, you know, or shared surface like OpenFaint or something like that.
[01:10:57.540 --> 01:10:58.900]   Ah, of course, OpenFaint.
[01:10:58.900 --> 01:10:59.900]   Yeah.
[01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:04.660]   That was the predecessor to Game Center, the third-party predecessor to Game Center.
[01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:07.020]   That would presumably have a lot of them.
[01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:11.620]   Or maybe a big purchaser like the US government, if they do, they log all the UDIDs of all the
[01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:13.500]   iOS devices that they purchase.
[01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:14.500]   I don't know.
[01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:15.500]   They might.
[01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:22.180]   But again, having your UDID in and of itself is completely worthless, right?
[01:11:22.180 --> 01:11:23.940]   It's like, what's the serial number of my iPhone?
[01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:27.460]   It's like, I suppose it's only useful if it's linked to some of the personal information,
[01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:30.700]   perhaps, or if it's just part of a, you know, it's a field in a database which contains
[01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:36.300]   other personal information, but the UUID itself, I mean, I only ever use mine, you know, if,
[01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:40.420]   you know, subscribing to test flight or something, if someone wants to send me some demo software
[01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:43.220]   and that, or they want me to get to test it, just giving you a UID.
[01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:46.540]   And that's, that's the route to your machine so they can properly identify you.
[01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:49.740]   But on its own, I don't think there's really much people can do with it.
[01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:50.740]   Well, yeah.
[01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:52.460]   It is all about identifying you.
[01:11:52.460 --> 01:11:59.460]   I mean, there was, I looked up a, there's a report from last year on a site called Corte.si
[01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:05.900]   is a security blog that analyzed, like, what, who are the leading aggregators of UDIDs?
[01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:17.420]   And it's a list that includes Amazon.com, TapjoyAds.com, a lot of ad networks with network, analytics.localidics.com.
[01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:23.220]   It's just, as we found out in the latest breach with Apple IDs, it's not so much that this
[01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:26.580]   one thing is the key to that unlocks the entire castle.
[01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:31.300]   But it is one more piece of information that everybody supposes is private that you don't
[01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:33.060]   know what it could happen with in the wrong hand.
[01:12:33.060 --> 01:12:37.580]   So no one can be pleased that there are 12 million out in the field like that.
[01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:41.220]   But the good slash bad news is that, well, this is nothing new.
[01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:46.540]   Believe not, if you used an iPhone before 2011 or before, it's already in the field.
[01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:48.460]   People are already been grabbing them.
[01:12:48.460 --> 01:12:49.460]   Have a good day.
[01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:50.460]   Yeah.
[01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:52.700]   I mean, it raises more questions than it answers is.
[01:12:52.700 --> 01:12:54.340]   So why does the FBI have it?
[01:12:54.340 --> 01:12:55.340]   What's the point?
[01:12:55.340 --> 01:12:56.340]   Who is this?
[01:12:56.340 --> 01:12:59.220]   That's probably related to getting warrants because you have to be, when you, when you
[01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:02.940]   want wiretap, you have to be specific, you can't simply say any phone that this suspect
[01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:06.020]   has, you have to say, we want to tap on this specific device.
[01:13:06.020 --> 01:13:07.900]   And here are the terms that we wanted for.
[01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:09.740]   So that's probably, I'm taking a guess.
[01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:11.140]   Take a phone number and be safe.
[01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:12.540]   Obviously, if I had previously.
[01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:13.540]   Fishy.
[01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:14.540]   Yeah.
[01:13:14.540 --> 01:13:15.540]   Yeah.
[01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:16.540]   But now phone numbers are malleable.
[01:13:16.540 --> 01:13:19.500]   If you want, you are talking about a tracking device, you're talking about a warrant that
[01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:21.300]   applies to a specific device.
[01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:25.900]   If I'm remembering conversations that I had with law enforcement about 10 months ago
[01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:29.180]   accurately, you do need to be specific about what device you want.
[01:13:29.180 --> 01:13:30.180]   I want to warrant on.
[01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:34.740]   It makes me wonder if this is, this information might have actually been one of the reasons
[01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:39.540]   why Apple did disable UD for apps, right?
[01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:44.020]   They knew there was a leak or they knew that there could be a leak and that they didn't
[01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:47.900]   want that information to be sent out there in the future.
[01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:53.180]   The notion of a UDID was already a little bit controversial, although there's MMEIs,
[01:13:53.180 --> 01:13:57.340]   every device has some sort of, has to have some sort of uniquely identifying number on
[01:13:57.340 --> 01:13:58.340]   the network.
[01:13:58.340 --> 01:14:01.060]   And there's reasons why you want that, right?
[01:14:01.060 --> 01:14:02.660]   I mean, it's friendlier.
[01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:07.020]   If you go to a, you know, you run an app and then you run it again on your same device,
[01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:10.140]   having the app server be able to be like, "Oh, I remember you."
[01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:13.300]   Even though you didn't create an account or log in, that could be, I mean, that's why
[01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:15.780]   people used it is because it was this convenient thing.
[01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:19.700]   It turns out they also did things like embed those in their ad network packages that they
[01:14:19.700 --> 01:14:23.220]   put in their ads so that they would say, "Hey, we already know who you are," because
[01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:24.500]   you use these other apps.
[01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:28.540]   And now I think that's why Apple put the kibosh on it.
[01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:32.100]   We're going to take a break, come back with more, your picks of the week, an audible ad,
[01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:36.500]   and a few other things, but I think it'd be kind of fun to look at what you might have
[01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:41.860]   missed if you missed any of our shows in the preceding week.
[01:14:41.860 --> 01:14:43.860]   Previously on Twitch, NSFW.
[01:14:43.860 --> 01:15:04.860]   [MUSIC]
[01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:05.860]   Triangulation.
[01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:06.860]   Unbelievable.
[01:15:06.860 --> 01:15:07.860]   Yes.
[01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:08.860]   Right.
[01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:13.820]   It's basically a service where lazy reporters go on and they say, "Hey, I need a service."
[01:15:13.820 --> 01:15:16.940]   It's a source for this story I'm doing about boats.
[01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:21.620]   And someone says, "I'll be your story as long as you mention my boat in company or you
[01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:24.260]   mention my boat sales website."
[01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:25.260]   Windows Weekly.
[01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:26.260]   Look at there.
[01:15:26.260 --> 01:15:27.260]   Look at there.
[01:15:27.260 --> 01:15:28.260]   Paul and shorts.
[01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:29.260]   Paul, put your pants on.
[01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:34.460]   Paul, I hear one joke about how I just came out of the closet.
[01:15:34.460 --> 01:15:35.460]   In shorts.
[01:15:35.460 --> 01:15:37.180]   In shorts.
[01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:38.180]   All about Android.
[01:15:38.180 --> 01:15:39.180]   Hello.
[01:15:39.180 --> 01:15:40.180]   Hello, Eric.
[01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:45.180]   It's a book.
[01:15:45.180 --> 01:15:47.180]   It's a book.
[01:15:47.180 --> 01:15:50.180]   It's a book.
[01:15:50.180 --> 01:15:52.780]   You know, Android users are so easily amused.
[01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:56.860]   If you missed this week on Twitch, you missed all of them.
[01:15:56.860 --> 01:16:02.300]   I wanted, if you missed NSFW last night or Sunday night, we did NSFW and it's not on
[01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:08.180]   there because it was out of Psycholantis, NSFW from Dragoncon.
[01:16:08.180 --> 01:16:09.180]   Yep.
[01:16:09.180 --> 01:16:16.780]   And that'll be re-run in its normal location today after all about Android if Tony finishes.
[01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:21.020]   Did you get any footage of the parade?
[01:16:21.020 --> 01:16:26.300]   I actually, so I didn't, not for Twit, but Bill Meakes who's out there for Bleeding Cool
[01:16:26.300 --> 01:16:28.780]   asked me to do some footage for them.
[01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:30.620]   Oh, you got footage for another company?
[01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:31.620]   I did.
[01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:36.860]   I was unaware that I would be asked to do that.
[01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:38.780]   Hey, no, it's okay.
[01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:39.780]   But it wasn't live.
[01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:40.780]   We do stuff live.
[01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:45.900]   It's all pre-recorded and SD and, you know, no big deal.
[01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:52.180]   Sorry if I hurt your feelings, Leo.
[01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:54.820]   First Apple doesn't invite me to their events now this.
[01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:59.940]   And then Chad goes on and just covers the parade without you.
[01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:03.460]   Walmart is checking in iPhone app checkout feature.
[01:17:03.460 --> 01:17:06.420]   Everybody wants to be, everybody wants to be an Apple store.
[01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:07.740]   That's the new thing, right?
[01:17:07.740 --> 01:17:12.300]   JCPenney got Ron Johnson and now Ron says, "We're going to get rid of all the clerks
[01:17:12.300 --> 01:17:13.820]   and we're going to have instant check out of this."
[01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:17.420]   JCPenney, Ron ran Apple stores for years.
[01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:22.500]   Walmart is testing an iPhone app checkout feature that would allow shoppers to scan items
[01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:30.700]   using their iPhones and pay it a self-checkout counter, eliminating employees.
[01:17:30.700 --> 01:17:32.860]   I never liked these things anyway.
[01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:35.020]   But maybe if it's an iPhone.
[01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:39.940]   I really wish that every receipt at a self-checkout Kia said, "And here's how much money we knocked
[01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:43.780]   off your bill because you checked yourself out instead of using an employee to do it
[01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:44.780]   for you."
[01:17:44.780 --> 01:17:45.780]   We gave you here.
[01:17:45.780 --> 01:17:49.580]   It's only 17 cents, but at least we acknowledge that your time and your frustration is worth
[01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:50.580]   money.
[01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:51.580]   Yeah.
[01:17:51.580 --> 01:17:56.620]   Samsung says, "If Apple releases an LTE event, which they will almost certainly do on the
[01:17:56.620 --> 01:18:00.420]   12th, they will sue them immediately."
[01:18:00.420 --> 01:18:04.860]   Good luck with that.
[01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:09.020]   So there.
[01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:11.780]   I guess they have three G-pens.
[01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:15.980]   Apparently they also have LTE-pens.
[01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:17.900]   Okay.
[01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:19.820]   Let's see.
[01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:20.820]   What else?
[01:18:20.820 --> 01:18:23.420]   New Apple connectors.
[01:18:23.420 --> 01:18:24.420]   Unavailable.
[01:18:24.420 --> 01:18:26.620]   Now, this worries me a little bit.
[01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:30.260]   Of course, we've heard all the rumors now that Apple is going to replace the 30-pin connector
[01:18:30.260 --> 01:18:34.140]   with a new 9-pin connector.
[01:18:34.140 --> 01:18:39.660]   And of course, key for many of us who have existing cables and docks is some sort of adapter.
[01:18:39.660 --> 01:18:48.500]   According to Jeremy Horowitz, editor-in-chief of the Eyelounge, new Apple connectors are
[01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:49.500]   unavailable.
[01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:53.340]   Third-off party add-ons may miss the holidays.
[01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:56.980]   I don't know how you would know this since they haven't even announced this new connector,
[01:18:56.980 --> 01:18:57.980]   but apparently...
[01:18:57.980 --> 01:19:03.940]   Well, that's what they're talking about is that because no one has seen this new connector...
[01:19:03.940 --> 01:19:05.820]   How could they possibly even get it out in time?
[01:19:05.820 --> 01:19:06.820]   Exactly.
[01:19:06.820 --> 01:19:12.540]   So because the specs haven't been released on how these connectors are used, third parties
[01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:14.940]   will not have enough time to turn around for holidays.
[01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:18.460]   So you're not going to have any docks for the holidays is his argument.
[01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:19.460]   Yikes.
[01:19:19.460 --> 01:19:23.700]   I'm sure Apple will have some accessories.
[01:19:23.700 --> 01:19:24.700]   Apple.
[01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:25.700]   Apple will sell them.
[01:19:25.700 --> 01:19:28.100]   Do you think the bundle them in the box?
[01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:29.100]   No.
[01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:30.100]   No.
[01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:31.100]   No.
[01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:32.100]   Everything's extra now.
[01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:33.100]   29.
[01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:34.100]   Yeah.
[01:19:34.100 --> 01:19:36.940]   Original iPod had like 10 different things in that box and now it's...
[01:19:36.940 --> 01:19:37.940]   Nothing.
[01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:44.700]   Is there going to be a new iPad Hi-Fi device?
[01:19:44.700 --> 01:19:46.700]   I have one in my...
[01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:48.420]   Actually, there'll be only one left who has one.
[01:19:48.420 --> 01:19:49.420]   You know what they could do.
[01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:50.420]   In the kitchen.
[01:19:50.420 --> 01:19:55.940]   Somebody in the chatroom's got the idea that Apple might deprecate connecting the iPhone
[01:19:55.940 --> 01:19:57.860]   entirely, right?
[01:19:57.860 --> 01:20:04.100]   Zeph in the chatroom says they'll be pushing airplay and over the air Wi-Fi syncing.
[01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:06.380]   Yeah, it's long as they do over the ear charging.
[01:20:06.380 --> 01:20:08.460]   This is a Tesla generator that they're going to be making.
[01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:09.460]   I don't think they'll ever have.
[01:20:09.460 --> 01:20:10.460]   Well, maybe they will.
[01:20:10.460 --> 01:20:12.460]   A lot of phones now have wire free charging.
[01:20:12.460 --> 01:20:14.860]   No, you have to be a US charging.
[01:20:14.860 --> 01:20:16.340]   You think they'll do inductance charging?
[01:20:16.340 --> 01:20:19.060]   There'll be a USB cable in the box on the record.
[01:20:19.060 --> 01:20:20.060]   Will there be a USB cable?
[01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:21.060]   Oh, yeah.
[01:20:21.060 --> 01:20:24.220]   There'll be a USB cable with a new connector and a standard USB connector.
[01:20:24.220 --> 01:20:25.220]   Definitely.
[01:20:25.220 --> 01:20:26.860]   They couldn't ship it without that really otherwise.
[01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:29.660]   Yeah, that would be pretty annoying.
[01:20:29.660 --> 01:20:31.500]   You get the phone, but no charger.
[01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:33.900]   It's a journey of phones.
[01:20:33.900 --> 01:20:34.900]   You're in three hours.
[01:20:34.900 --> 01:20:38.260]   We drive back with $30 to buy the cable we didn't include.
[01:20:38.260 --> 01:20:40.380]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[01:20:40.380 --> 01:20:42.300]   Come back with our picks of the week.
[01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:44.180]   Andy Inako is here from the Chicago Sun.
[01:20:44.180 --> 01:20:45.180]   Time's he will be.
[01:20:45.180 --> 01:20:46.580]   Now, how are we going to do this?
[01:20:46.580 --> 01:20:48.900]   You're flying out Sunday?
[01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:50.100]   I'm flying out on Monday.
[01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:51.100]   I'll be here Monday night.
[01:20:51.100 --> 01:20:52.100]   Just be there Monday night.
[01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:53.100]   Okay.
[01:20:53.100 --> 01:20:55.180]   I'm not leaving until like late Saturday.
[01:20:55.180 --> 01:20:56.180]   So.
[01:20:56.180 --> 01:21:01.420]   Go to the event on Tuesday, Wednesday, at 10 a.m.
[01:21:01.420 --> 01:21:02.420]   We'll cover the event live.
[01:21:02.420 --> 01:21:06.540]   I guess when you come out of the event, I'm hoping that they'll do the hands on thing
[01:21:06.540 --> 01:21:11.260]   and you've brought your helmet cam and the backpack with the antenna, right?
[01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:15.740]   I'll bring my Al Franklin mobile uplink with a big dish on the head and everything.
[01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:19.180]   And then you could you could come and go in the demo room and they won't notice the
[01:21:19.180 --> 01:21:21.700]   fact that you are recording everything.
[01:21:21.700 --> 01:21:23.980]   I'm sure that I'm not really paying close attention.
[01:21:23.980 --> 01:21:27.980]   Apple's not known to be very, very controlling about how they handle the PR.
[01:21:27.980 --> 01:21:31.500]   So I'm sure that last time we did this Becky Worley.
[01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:38.420]   Uh, uh, wasn't last time as a couple of years ago, jumped Steve Jobs for an ad hoc interview.
[01:21:38.420 --> 01:21:41.860]   Uh, she's not been invited back yet again.
[01:21:41.860 --> 01:21:42.860]   Easier.
[01:21:42.860 --> 01:21:46.140]   So still they're totally worth it.
[01:21:46.140 --> 01:21:51.340]   They're basically I have to, I have to, I have to, I have to defend her at that point.
[01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:55.460]   Oh, you got like a pleasant interview with Steve Jobs ad hoc.
[01:21:55.460 --> 01:21:56.460]   Totally worth it.
[01:21:56.460 --> 01:22:01.580]   Wasn't pleasant, but she got the, well, you know, she didn't get anything thrown at her.
[01:22:01.580 --> 01:22:03.220]   No, no, he didn't hit her.
[01:22:03.220 --> 01:22:08.940]   PR people swiftly, swiftly intervened, but I don't believe punches were thrown.
[01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:13.020]   They know they're, they carry zip ties, but hey, we learned something.
[01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:14.100]   And mace.
[01:22:14.100 --> 01:22:16.380]   Um, and Jason, you'll be in there too.
[01:22:16.380 --> 01:22:18.380]   So maybe we can grab you afterwards.
[01:22:18.380 --> 01:22:22.220]   We'll do Mac break weekly right after the event.
[01:22:22.220 --> 01:22:25.420]   Um, and, uh, so that's going to be fun.
[01:22:25.420 --> 01:22:26.780]   So Wednesday will be our time then.
[01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:30.020]   Uh, we'll, we'll do what begin our live coverage around 10 a.m.
[01:22:30.020 --> 01:22:31.020]   Pacific.
[01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:32.100]   That's a 1 p.m.
[01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:36.940]   Eastern time on the 12th and shortly after the event concludes, we'll do Mac break weekly.
[01:22:36.940 --> 01:22:38.020]   Right.
[01:22:38.020 --> 01:22:42.420]   And we will have, uh, Brian Hogg assures me we will have a Tim Cook puppet for the reenactment
[01:22:42.420 --> 01:22:43.420]   during the event.
[01:22:43.420 --> 01:22:44.660]   We're going to put him on green screen.
[01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:46.060]   Whose puppets here for that?
[01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:47.060]   Brian will.
[01:22:47.060 --> 01:22:48.060]   Oh, good.
[01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:49.060]   Oh, wonderful.
[01:22:49.060 --> 01:22:53.340]   So we'll put him in here in a green screen and then we'll match it in.
[01:22:53.340 --> 01:22:56.700]   What I want to do is, you know, follow the live blogs and Matt in the images.
[01:22:56.700 --> 01:23:01.020]   We should add some, some red curtains to the sides of our, of our avatar.
[01:23:01.020 --> 01:23:02.020]   We got to work on that.
[01:23:02.020 --> 01:23:03.020]   Right.
[01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:07.340]   So he'll just be here and we'll just go to him as, and, and he'll read the quotes from
[01:23:07.340 --> 01:23:08.340]   the live blogs.
[01:23:08.340 --> 01:23:10.780]   You'll act them out.
[01:23:10.780 --> 01:23:13.660]   I think it's going to be far better than actually being at the event.
[01:23:13.660 --> 01:23:14.660]   That'll be really professional.
[01:23:14.660 --> 01:23:18.380]   What do you should also, you should, you should green screen like a, like a red velvet opera
[01:23:18.380 --> 01:23:19.380]   box.
[01:23:19.380 --> 01:23:23.420]   And then you and Devorak could be like, stat learn wall.
[01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:25.100]   I will be statler.
[01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:26.100]   I will.
[01:23:26.100 --> 01:23:29.780]   Oh, no, I'm going to the annoying apple.
[01:23:29.780 --> 01:23:31.340]   I'm going to the annoying apple.
[01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:32.340]   Right.
[01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:33.340]   Whoa.
[01:23:33.340 --> 01:23:34.340]   Yeah.
[01:23:34.340 --> 01:23:35.340]   No, yeah.
[01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:36.820]   Annoying apple be there throwing a hurling epitet.
[01:23:36.820 --> 01:23:41.580]   Tom Merritt will be the objective journalist in this scenario.
[01:23:41.580 --> 01:23:43.060]   We'll see what happens.
[01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:44.660]   That could possibly go wrong.
[01:23:44.660 --> 01:23:46.460]   Nothing can possibly go wrong.
[01:23:46.460 --> 01:23:49.460]   Jason Snow is also here from Macworld Magazine.
[01:23:49.460 --> 01:23:52.820]   He's editor chief there editorial director of consumer publications for IDG.
[01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:58.780]   And now the guy in charge of the new tech hive blog, which emerges next week at tech
[01:23:58.780 --> 01:23:59.780]   hive.com.
[01:23:59.780 --> 01:24:01.940]   Next week, you said Jason next week.
[01:24:01.940 --> 01:24:02.940]   It's exciting.
[01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:04.580]   Oh, yeah.
[01:24:04.580 --> 01:24:06.860]   Very excited.
[01:24:06.860 --> 01:24:08.580]   Next week's will be, there'll be some stuff to talk about.
[01:24:08.580 --> 01:24:10.060]   This is going to be some stuff to talk about.
[01:24:10.060 --> 01:24:11.060]   Yeah.
[01:24:11.060 --> 01:24:12.060]   It's going to be a busy week.
[01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:14.140]   This way you avoided the whole rumor cycle.
[01:24:14.140 --> 01:24:16.340]   You have to repeat those things.
[01:24:16.340 --> 01:24:18.260]   We didn't get to unfortunately.
[01:24:18.260 --> 01:24:20.580]   And I'm a callister screencast online.
[01:24:20.580 --> 01:24:27.020]   Now the new SCO screencast online tutor apps and the new magazine on the that is available
[01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:29.300]   on the newsstand for iPhone and iPad.
[01:24:29.300 --> 01:24:30.620]   What's that called?
[01:24:30.620 --> 01:24:34.420]   It's a screencast online monthly, but you can just go into iTunes and search the iTunes
[01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:35.420]   store.
[01:24:35.420 --> 01:24:36.420]   It'll pop up.
[01:24:36.420 --> 01:24:37.420]   You don't have to go into new, stand to find it.
[01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:38.420]   Perfect.
[01:24:38.420 --> 01:24:39.420]   Screencast online.
[01:24:39.420 --> 01:24:41.780]   Just look for it and buy everything that Don does because it's really great.
[01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:46.100]   No, seriously, if you want to learn specific apps or how to use the Mac, he's really great
[01:24:46.100 --> 01:24:47.100]   at that.
[01:24:47.100 --> 01:24:50.660]   Well, the nice thing is with the magazine is you can, there's a free episode.
[01:24:50.660 --> 01:24:51.660]   There's a free issue in there.
[01:24:51.660 --> 01:24:55.060]   Anyways, you can just download that and have the apps free and download the free issue.
[01:24:55.060 --> 01:24:59.620]   And if you subscribe, you get the first one to free anyway, so you can get tons of stuff.
[01:24:59.620 --> 01:25:05.500]   Our show today brought to you by our good friends at Audible audio books for the masses
[01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:08.180]   of 100,000 plus titles.
[01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:15.300]   I am a big, I always loved reading, but who has time nowadays with everything we do so
[01:25:15.300 --> 01:25:18.700]   that when I'm now when I'm in the car driving the kids to school, I don't have much of a
[01:25:18.700 --> 01:25:19.700]   commute anymore.
[01:25:19.700 --> 01:25:23.540]   I almost regret that because I used to get two hours of reading every single day guaranteed.
[01:25:23.540 --> 01:25:27.820]   But at the gym, walking the dog doing the dishes, I listen all the time.
[01:25:27.820 --> 01:25:33.060]   In fact, with my sonos, I have my audio books piped throughout the house.
[01:25:33.060 --> 01:25:36.100]   I can't do it if anybody's home, but if it's just me, man, I'm listening.
[01:25:36.100 --> 01:25:37.140]   I love it.
[01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:38.140]   I really love it.
[01:25:38.140 --> 01:25:39.140]   So Audible.com.
[01:25:39.140 --> 01:25:47.780]   Now, if you go to audible.com/macbreak, you can sign up for the gold plan, which is a
[01:25:47.780 --> 01:25:53.580]   book a month, but that first month is free and your first book is free.
[01:25:53.580 --> 01:25:57.540]   Now, we're going to get recommendations from Jason and Andy, but I have to point out that
[01:25:57.540 --> 01:26:04.580]   the new book that's been very controversial, US government wanted to stop this book by
[01:26:04.580 --> 01:26:12.380]   the name, one of the Navy SEALs, SEAL Team Six member who was part of the raid on Osama
[01:26:12.380 --> 01:26:15.020]   bin Laden has written a book called No Easy Day.
[01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:18.100]   It is now available in Audible.com.
[01:26:18.100 --> 01:26:23.260]   Certainly going to be on my next listen.
[01:26:23.260 --> 01:26:27.140]   He's not narrator on this, but boy, that'll be very dramatic.
[01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:30.700]   This is the kind of book you want to listen to, I think, because the drama comes out.
[01:26:30.700 --> 01:26:33.700]   Andy, what are you listening to right now, Audible?
[01:26:33.700 --> 01:26:37.820]   This on deck sounds like a really, really interesting book.
[01:26:37.820 --> 01:26:42.100]   You start off with the description of the book from Amazon and you start off by saying
[01:26:42.100 --> 01:26:47.940]   it's a collection of short stories that celebrate the life and the works of Ray Bradbury.
[01:26:47.940 --> 01:26:54.220]   You find out that it's got stories by Margaret Atward, Dave Eggers, Neil Gaiman, Joe Hill,
[01:26:54.220 --> 01:26:58.420]   Jack Lemichard, all these people that you would want to read short stories from.
[01:26:58.420 --> 01:27:01.060]   Then you say, okay, well, I wonder if the audio book is any good.
[01:27:01.060 --> 01:27:04.740]   I mean, sometimes it gets sort of a half-baked narrator.
[01:27:04.740 --> 01:27:11.260]   The narrators are George Tk, Edward Herman, Kate Mulgrew, F. Murray Abraham, Neil Gaiman,
[01:27:11.260 --> 01:27:14.780]   and James Urbaniac from The Venture Brothers.
[01:27:14.780 --> 01:27:15.780]   And that was like, done?
[01:27:15.780 --> 01:27:17.780]   What was that done?
[01:27:17.780 --> 01:27:19.780]   Should I put, nope, buy it.
[01:27:19.780 --> 01:27:20.780]   Okay, done.
[01:27:20.780 --> 01:27:21.780]   What's it called?
[01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:26.180]   I'm sorry, it's called Shadow Show, All New Stories in Celebration of Ray Bradbury and it's
[01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:29.660]   edited by Sam Weller and Mort Castle.
[01:27:29.660 --> 01:27:33.540]   Good 14 hours enough to get you through a few weeks of stale commutes.
[01:27:33.540 --> 01:27:35.740]   So these are not, are these Ray Bradbury stories?
[01:27:35.740 --> 01:27:37.700]   No, no, no, these are not Ray Bradbury stories.
[01:27:37.700 --> 01:27:40.780]   Each one is sort of a celebration of his work.
[01:27:40.780 --> 01:27:47.220]   Something like Neil Gaiman's story is about a guy who remembers everything about Ray Bradbury's
[01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:50.620]   stories, but can't remember his name.
[01:27:50.620 --> 01:27:54.260]   They sort of like intersect with like the world that Ray Bradbury created.
[01:27:54.260 --> 01:27:56.540]   So they aren't, they aren't Ray Bradbury short stories.
[01:27:56.540 --> 01:28:01.500]   Each one is an original, but again, anything, anything was read by George DeK.
[01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:03.620]   You know, that's going to be worth your click.
[01:28:03.620 --> 01:28:04.620]   This sounds great.
[01:28:04.620 --> 01:28:09.660]   Shadow Show in celebration of Ray Bradbury, of course, who recently passed away.
[01:28:09.660 --> 01:28:10.660]   That sounds great.
[01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:12.940]   What are you with with a forward by Ray Bradbury, by the way?
[01:28:12.940 --> 01:28:14.460]   Oh, he knew he was going to die.
[01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:16.460]   So he rode the forward.
[01:28:16.460 --> 01:28:17.460]   He was a planner.
[01:28:17.460 --> 01:28:18.460]   Johnny Deadline.
[01:28:18.460 --> 01:28:19.460]   That's what he was.
[01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:22.700]   Obviously they planned this book before his pee pass away.
[01:28:22.700 --> 01:28:23.700]   Thank you for the introduction.
[01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:25.700]   Now you must die.
[01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:28.140]   Anyway, I can't wait.
[01:28:28.140 --> 01:28:29.140]   That sounds great.
[01:28:29.140 --> 01:28:30.140]   Shadow Show.
[01:28:30.140 --> 01:28:31.140]   What about you, Jason?
[01:28:31.140 --> 01:28:32.900]   You said you had something you wanted to do with plug.
[01:28:32.900 --> 01:28:33.900]   I do.
[01:28:33.900 --> 01:28:38.220]   This past weekend was the Hugo Awards, which is the annual awards for the best in science
[01:28:38.220 --> 01:28:39.220]   fiction.
[01:28:39.220 --> 01:28:40.540]   It's blocked by you stream.
[01:28:40.540 --> 01:28:42.780]   And it was, oh, that was so fascinating.
[01:28:42.780 --> 01:28:46.980]   Yes, they showed the clips for the winning TV shows and movies, the nominees and you stream
[01:28:46.980 --> 01:28:49.260]   shut them down because of the content patrol.
[01:28:49.260 --> 01:28:50.260]   Well, they're right.
[01:28:50.260 --> 01:28:51.260]   This is copyrighted.
[01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:52.260]   They're right.
[01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:53.260]   So unbelievable.
[01:28:53.260 --> 01:28:57.540]   This is how crazy it is.
[01:28:57.540 --> 01:29:04.660]   The winner, your winner for best novel is called Among Others by Joe Walton.
[01:29:04.660 --> 01:29:07.740]   She is a Welsh writer who now lives in Montreal.
[01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:08.740]   Great book.
[01:29:08.740 --> 01:29:09.740]   I voted for it for the Hugo Award.
[01:29:09.740 --> 01:29:10.740]   I'm glad it won.
[01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:13.580]   It's one of the best books I've read in recent years.
[01:29:13.580 --> 01:29:16.020]   It's available on Audible, unabridged.
[01:29:16.020 --> 01:29:17.540]   I can't recommend it enough.
[01:29:17.540 --> 01:29:19.300]   It's actually kind of a funny mixture.
[01:29:19.300 --> 01:29:20.300]   It's a book.
[01:29:20.300 --> 01:29:23.140]   Anybody who's read a lot of science fiction will love it because it's about science fiction
[01:29:23.140 --> 01:29:24.140]   novels.
[01:29:24.140 --> 01:29:30.700]   It's about a girl who is growing up in England and she kind of seeks refuge in reading.
[01:29:30.700 --> 01:29:35.820]   And then it's also got a fantasy element to it because her family is magical, actually.
[01:29:35.820 --> 01:29:38.460]   So it's sort of a fantasy novel about science fiction.
[01:29:38.460 --> 01:29:39.700]   It's just so charming.
[01:29:39.700 --> 01:29:42.100]   Joe Walton's a great writer.
[01:29:42.100 --> 01:29:45.660]   She's a big sci-fi fan, but she's also just a fantastic novelist.
[01:29:45.660 --> 01:29:48.140]   And it's definitely a worthy winner.
[01:29:48.140 --> 01:29:51.700]   I think it's going to sweep all of the major sci-fi and fantasy novel awards.
[01:29:51.700 --> 01:29:54.380]   And I cannot recommend it enough.
[01:29:54.380 --> 01:29:58.780]   And I have to say it's narrated by one of my favorite Audible narrators, Katherine Kelgram,
[01:29:58.780 --> 01:30:00.580]   and play a little sample of the audio on this one.
[01:30:00.580 --> 01:30:06.420]   The Fernasite Factory in Abercumboy killed all the trees for two miles around.
[01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:08.940]   She's got the most beautiful Welsh accent.
[01:30:08.940 --> 01:30:09.940]   Fantastic.
[01:30:09.940 --> 01:30:11.580]   Oh, I just love her.
[01:30:11.580 --> 01:30:15.820]   And it's a Welsh school girl in an English boarding school.
[01:30:15.820 --> 01:30:18.620]   And so she's completely isolated away from her family and miserable.
[01:30:18.620 --> 01:30:21.740]   And so to have that Welsh voice telling the story is perfect.
[01:30:21.740 --> 01:30:23.860]   Oh, I can't wait.
[01:30:23.860 --> 01:30:24.860]   I can't wait.
[01:30:24.860 --> 01:30:26.140]   OK, that's going on my next listen.
[01:30:26.140 --> 01:30:28.100]   You have this wish list, which you can add.
[01:30:28.100 --> 01:30:31.580]   And the problem with this show is I add things to my wish list, like constantly.
[01:30:31.580 --> 01:30:33.900]   So I'm way behind on books.
[01:30:33.900 --> 01:30:36.900]   But this one's definitely going on my wish list.
[01:30:36.900 --> 01:30:39.420]   This sounds wonderful, among others, by Joe Walton.
[01:30:39.420 --> 01:30:44.340]   And I'm going to add the Ray Bradbury tribute as well.
[01:30:44.340 --> 01:30:45.660]   Si.
[01:30:45.660 --> 01:30:46.740]   So you get one book.
[01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:47.740]   This is the challenge.
[01:30:47.740 --> 01:30:48.740]   You can go to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:30:48.740 --> 01:30:50.780]   You'll be signing up for the gold account.
[01:30:50.780 --> 01:30:51.780]   Book a month.
[01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:52.780]   It plays back on everything.
[01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:53.780]   All your iOS devices.
[01:30:53.780 --> 01:30:58.740]   There's a great audible app, which I recommend for, of course, iOS, but also Android and
[01:30:58.740 --> 01:30:59.900]   Windows phone.
[01:30:59.900 --> 01:31:03.580]   And that's a nice app because you see everything you've ever purchased on Audible.
[01:31:03.580 --> 01:31:04.580]   Your entire library is there.
[01:31:04.580 --> 01:31:05.580]   You can list it any book.
[01:31:05.580 --> 01:31:10.700]   A great way to keep track of your Audible reads.
[01:31:10.700 --> 01:31:11.700]   You know what's neat?
[01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:15.900]   This is an audible frontiers, which means it was not-- the publisher did not want to
[01:31:15.900 --> 01:31:17.500]   make an audiobook out of among others.
[01:31:17.500 --> 01:31:19.420]   But Audible said, no, this is worth recording.
[01:31:19.420 --> 01:31:20.580]   So they recorded it themselves.
[01:31:20.580 --> 01:31:22.500]   It's an Audible frontiers production.
[01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:24.460]   And that's one of the things I love Audible for.
[01:31:24.460 --> 01:31:25.620]   They are just great.
[01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:27.860]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[01:31:27.860 --> 01:31:29.420]   It's your first book free.
[01:31:29.420 --> 01:31:32.820]   But I warn you, you're going to get hooked.
[01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:34.900]   Time for our picks of the week.
[01:31:34.900 --> 01:31:37.740]   Let's start with Don McAllister, your pick, sir.
[01:31:37.740 --> 01:31:38.740]   OK.
[01:31:38.740 --> 01:31:42.900]   Well, I'm going to pick-- it's not a bundle, but it is a bundle of applications that are
[01:31:42.900 --> 01:31:44.260]   currently on special offer.
[01:31:44.260 --> 01:31:46.460]   Let's get back to mail.
[01:31:46.460 --> 01:31:50.900]   It's about-- well, it's actually 12 Apple mail tools that the developers have all bandied
[01:31:50.900 --> 01:31:53.420]   together and decided to put discounts on them.
[01:31:53.420 --> 01:31:54.900]   And it's got some of my favorites in here.
[01:31:54.900 --> 01:32:01.260]   It's got mail tags, mail act on, mail perspectives, doc star, mail hub, take control of Apple,
[01:32:01.260 --> 01:32:02.260]   mail.
[01:32:02.260 --> 01:32:04.100]   That's a good book by Joe Kistle.
[01:32:04.100 --> 01:32:07.100]   Some of the ones that I've not seen before-- oh, Spam-Siv is another one.
[01:32:07.100 --> 01:32:08.700]   They're all fantastic mail applications.
[01:32:08.700 --> 01:32:11.540]   And they're all-- well, they're up to 50% off at the moment.
[01:32:11.540 --> 01:32:12.780]   So it's just for one week.
[01:32:12.780 --> 01:32:15.380]   But if you go across to it, I've got to get this.
[01:32:15.380 --> 01:32:18.300]   Now, these will work with Mountain Lion mail.
[01:32:18.300 --> 01:32:20.540]   Yeah, I've just downloaded one, actually.
[01:32:20.540 --> 01:32:22.340]   One I've not seen before, mail hub.
[01:32:22.340 --> 01:32:23.820]   And they have got a Mountain Lion version there.
[01:32:23.820 --> 01:32:25.420]   But I would imagine most of these.
[01:32:25.420 --> 01:32:29.060]   In fact, yeah, Spam-Siv, I've just downloaded an update for Spam-Siv.
[01:32:29.060 --> 01:32:32.340]   I know mail tags and mail act on there to admire the favorites as well.
[01:32:32.340 --> 01:32:33.580]   The others I haven't played with.
[01:32:33.580 --> 01:32:36.660]   Doc stars, another one I've installed and use quite a lot.
[01:32:36.660 --> 01:32:38.900]   So there's some great applications in there.
[01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:40.260]   If you're a heavy mail user.
[01:32:40.260 --> 01:32:41.860]   And they're all hand priced.
[01:32:41.860 --> 01:32:42.860]   As little as three bucks.
[01:32:42.860 --> 01:32:44.180]   Yeah, I say it's not a bundle for the whole lot.
[01:32:44.180 --> 01:32:46.580]   It's you can selectively go in and buy individual ones.
[01:32:46.580 --> 01:32:49.020]   But they're all 33% off or 50% off.
[01:32:49.020 --> 01:32:50.380]   Offer this week only.
[01:32:50.380 --> 01:32:53.340]   It's at getbackthenumber2mail.com.
[01:32:53.340 --> 01:32:53.980]   Good pick.
[01:32:53.980 --> 01:32:55.500]   Thank you.
[01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:56.300]   Dom McAllister.
[01:32:56.300 --> 01:32:58.180]   Jason Snell, your pick of the week.
[01:32:58.180 --> 01:32:59.780]   My pick is an app called Mixle.
[01:32:59.780 --> 01:33:03.380]   And you may have heard about it before, because there was an iPad app called Mixle.
[01:33:03.380 --> 01:33:06.700]   That was kind of a collage tool, a collaborative collage tool.
[01:33:06.700 --> 01:33:08.580]   You'd find a bunch of images and throw them together.
[01:33:08.580 --> 01:33:12.380]   And you could sort of cut around them and slide them around on screen.
[01:33:12.380 --> 01:33:13.660]   And it was kind of fun.
[01:33:13.660 --> 01:33:14.660]   I used it for a while.
[01:33:14.660 --> 01:33:15.380]   And I stopped.
[01:33:15.380 --> 01:33:17.060]   And it turned out everybody else did too.
[01:33:17.060 --> 01:33:20.100]   So what the creators of the service did is they shut it down.
[01:33:20.100 --> 01:33:22.540]   And they made a new app called Mixle that's on iPhone.
[01:33:22.540 --> 01:33:25.020]   And it's a much more practical app.
[01:33:25.020 --> 01:33:28.780]   And it's like Instagram, except it lets you make collages.
[01:33:28.780 --> 01:33:31.140]   So you take pictures in your camera roll.
[01:33:31.140 --> 01:33:33.300]   And then you can choose a photo style.
[01:33:33.300 --> 01:33:35.100]   And you can shuffle around the different shapes.
[01:33:35.100 --> 01:33:37.820]   And you can actually touch and drag.
[01:33:37.820 --> 01:33:39.260]   So you can get the right crops.
[01:33:39.260 --> 01:33:42.180]   And you can drag and drop different photos to different places.
[01:33:42.180 --> 01:33:43.140]   And then you can share them.
[01:33:43.140 --> 01:33:45.220]   So you can create instead of a single image,
[01:33:45.220 --> 01:33:51.940]   it's a really fast, fun way to make the image a multiple image thing.
[01:33:51.940 --> 01:33:56.500]   And then share that with everybody on their social service, which is kind of like on Instagram,
[01:33:56.500 --> 01:33:59.260]   where you can like people's photos on their service.
[01:33:59.260 --> 01:34:03.380]   But you can also share it to Instagram, on Twitter, Facebook, and the lot.
[01:34:03.380 --> 01:34:04.340]   And it's great.
[01:34:04.340 --> 01:34:11.220]   Over the weekend, my family and I went to the first game at the new stadium at UC Berkeley,
[01:34:11.220 --> 01:34:13.380]   the California Memorial Stadium upgrade.
[01:34:13.380 --> 01:34:19.300]   And while I was there, I put out a picture, if you can see that vaguely, of my family.
[01:34:19.300 --> 01:34:21.580]   And it's a little collage in Mixle that I did instead.
[01:34:21.580 --> 01:34:22.780]   And it looked great.
[01:34:22.780 --> 01:34:26.300]   So it was a lot of fun and more than just a single Instagram.
[01:34:26.300 --> 01:34:28.500]   I believe it's free, too.
[01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:32.740]   So you can get it in the app store or go to mixle.cc, I believe.
[01:34:32.740 --> 01:34:34.620]   And it's iPhone only, not iPad.
[01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:35.620]   iPhone.
[01:34:35.620 --> 01:34:37.100]   Yes, the original was iPad.
[01:34:37.100 --> 01:34:39.020]   And then this one is an iPhone product.
[01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:44.420]   And it really is sort of like imagine Instagram, except you can do multiple photos in a collage.
[01:34:44.420 --> 01:34:46.260]   And it helps make you build the collage.
[01:34:46.260 --> 01:34:47.260]   Interesting pivot.
[01:34:47.260 --> 01:34:49.700]   I really liked the old Mixle, but this looks actually better.
[01:34:49.700 --> 01:34:53.580]   MIXEL, if you want to download that.
[01:34:53.580 --> 01:34:56.900]   My pick of the week this week is something free.
[01:34:56.900 --> 01:35:02.540]   I was a big fan of Avid Studio, which was kind of an eye movie replacement for the iPad.
[01:35:02.540 --> 01:35:07.220]   It's been acquired by Corel and they've switched it with Pinnacle Studio.
[01:35:07.220 --> 01:35:10.900]   But the good news is this-- I think it's normally $10.
[01:35:10.900 --> 01:35:13.820]   This program is for now free.
[01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:17.380]   So if you were an Avid Studio user, you'll still have it, but they're not going to update
[01:35:17.380 --> 01:35:18.380]   it anymore.
[01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:23.740]   And the new program is called Pinnacle Studio by Corel.
[01:35:23.740 --> 01:35:25.900]   And I was a big fan of Avid Studio.
[01:35:25.900 --> 01:35:29.100]   It looks like many of the features, if not all the features of Avid Studio have been included
[01:35:29.100 --> 01:35:30.100]   in this.
[01:35:30.100 --> 01:35:32.060]   In fact, it looks like it's the same program.
[01:35:32.060 --> 01:35:34.060]   And really, I thought a very nice editor.
[01:35:34.060 --> 01:35:35.940]   It was a little buggy, had a little quirks.
[01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:42.540]   So maybe having Corel pick it up and update it as Pinnacle Studio will improve the program.
[01:35:42.540 --> 01:35:47.740]   Certainly, this is your chance to get it now for free and have it on your iPad for future
[01:35:47.740 --> 01:35:48.740]   reference.
[01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:50.980]   Andy and Ico, your pick of the week.
[01:35:50.980 --> 01:35:55.620]   My pick is a free app called Grand View that might be wonderful and it might be completely
[01:35:55.620 --> 01:35:56.620]   bonkers.
[01:35:56.620 --> 01:35:57.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:35:57.620 --> 01:36:00.180]   I tried it a few days ago.
[01:36:00.180 --> 01:36:02.820]   I'm still going back and forth on the point of this.
[01:36:02.820 --> 01:36:06.300]   You've heard about these distraction free word processors that better than full screen
[01:36:06.300 --> 01:36:07.300]   mode even.
[01:36:07.300 --> 01:36:10.540]   They just try to remove all user interface, let you focus just on the writing.
[01:36:10.540 --> 01:36:15.220]   What Grand View does is once you hit a hotkey in any application and you enter this mode
[01:36:15.220 --> 01:36:21.540]   where you see nothing except the word that you're typing, not the words, the word that
[01:36:21.540 --> 01:36:22.540]   you're typing.
[01:36:22.540 --> 01:36:26.380]   If you see, I wish I'm sorry I couldn't get this.
[01:36:26.380 --> 01:36:30.020]   I'll put it on here and we'll end up doing it.
[01:36:30.020 --> 01:36:35.220]   If you type the word the first you see the big letter T and then a slightly smaller T
[01:36:35.220 --> 01:36:40.460]   H and then the word the, then we tap the space bar it blanks again and then you stop typing
[01:36:40.460 --> 01:36:45.380]   quick from Fox jumps over the lazy dog.
[01:36:45.380 --> 01:36:47.860]   When you hit the period, you see the entire sentence.
[01:36:47.860 --> 01:36:53.340]   But as soon as you start typing another sentence, you go, "Jack does love my big sphinx of
[01:36:53.340 --> 01:36:54.340]   quartz."
[01:36:54.340 --> 01:36:55.340]   That's bizarre.
[01:36:55.340 --> 01:36:56.340]   It's bizarre.
[01:36:56.340 --> 01:36:59.780]   You're focusing so much on each individual word.
[01:36:59.780 --> 01:37:03.460]   It's distracting you from the sentence you're actually writing.
[01:37:03.460 --> 01:37:09.100]   There's also a mode where you can, it will act more as a basic distract, excuse me, when
[01:37:09.100 --> 01:37:12.380]   you hit the hotkey to get out of there, the text you typed is in the clipboard.
[01:37:12.380 --> 01:37:15.420]   You can paste it into whatever app you're actually in.
[01:37:15.420 --> 01:37:19.660]   There's also a more conventional full screen editing mode which is rather nice.
[01:37:19.660 --> 01:37:22.500]   It's kind of nice to have this thing that's in every single, that would work in every
[01:37:22.500 --> 01:37:24.300]   single app that you use.
[01:37:24.300 --> 01:37:29.660]   So the other, I've been told by some people that they're people with low vision problems
[01:37:29.660 --> 01:37:30.660]   that this is absolutely one for you.
[01:37:30.660 --> 01:37:33.460]   This would be great if you had Mac, Macular to Generation, for instance.
[01:37:33.460 --> 01:37:34.460]   Yeah.
[01:37:34.460 --> 01:37:39.140]   And you don't want to use some of the assistive technologies that are already in the Mac.
[01:37:39.140 --> 01:37:43.660]   And it's weird because it was so bizarre that I had to start looking at other people's
[01:37:43.660 --> 01:37:45.340]   opinions of this.
[01:37:45.340 --> 01:37:49.580]   And there are some people who feel as, "Well, I've never been more productive, man."
[01:37:49.580 --> 01:37:53.540]   Also, it's a great way if you're writing in Starbucks to make sure that every single
[01:37:53.540 --> 01:37:57.420]   person in the entire room can see everything that you write.
[01:37:57.420 --> 01:37:58.420]   So...
[01:37:58.420 --> 01:38:01.860]   They're going to use this in the remake of The Shining, right?
[01:38:01.860 --> 01:38:02.860]   Wow.
[01:38:02.860 --> 01:38:12.740]   All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
[01:38:12.740 --> 01:38:13.740]   Boom.
[01:38:13.740 --> 01:38:14.740]   Oops.
[01:38:14.740 --> 01:38:15.740]   I forgot the period.
[01:38:15.740 --> 01:38:19.300]   So what's weird is you can backspace.
[01:38:19.300 --> 01:38:20.300]   Yeah.
[01:38:20.300 --> 01:38:23.100]   That's very strange.
[01:38:23.100 --> 01:38:25.100]   It is very strange.
[01:38:25.100 --> 01:38:26.100]   Yeah.
[01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:27.700]   Well, it's free.
[01:38:27.700 --> 01:38:29.020]   It's free.
[01:38:29.020 --> 01:38:30.780]   It's fun.
[01:38:30.780 --> 01:38:34.620]   I suppose that if I were giving a presentation, I needed to type things out.
[01:38:34.620 --> 01:38:38.060]   That would be a lovely way to sort of clear where I am from the slide.
[01:38:38.060 --> 01:38:41.060]   I am to write something that everybody can copy down.
[01:38:41.060 --> 01:38:45.300]   So on that basis, it seems like a nice thing to have installed.
[01:38:45.300 --> 01:38:51.140]   I'm not sure that I would want to start National Novel Writing Month with this as my word processor.
[01:38:51.140 --> 01:38:53.740]   I think this would be a challenge at best.
[01:38:53.740 --> 01:38:56.620]   Well, I think you make it a little bit harder.
[01:38:56.620 --> 01:38:58.020]   Great for my coos.
[01:38:58.020 --> 01:38:59.020]   Yeah.
[01:38:59.020 --> 01:39:00.020]   Exactly.
[01:39:00.020 --> 01:39:01.020]   Wow.
[01:39:01.020 --> 01:39:05.500]   I mean, the classic problem with writing is that you obsess too much over the paragraph
[01:39:05.500 --> 01:39:08.260]   that you're writing that you never actually finished the book.
[01:39:08.260 --> 01:39:11.020]   This lets you obsess over every letter of every word.
[01:39:11.020 --> 01:39:14.860]   I'm not sure if this is a key towards productivity and finishing your novel.
[01:39:14.860 --> 01:39:15.860]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:39:15.860 --> 01:39:20.100]   That's all I'm suggesting I could be wrong.
[01:39:20.100 --> 01:39:21.980]   You can select fonts.
[01:39:21.980 --> 01:39:25.020]   You can select green on black if you like.
[01:39:25.020 --> 01:39:26.340]   There are options here.
[01:39:26.340 --> 01:39:30.380]   I'm glad that we live in a world in which somebody thought of this app and someone actually
[01:39:30.380 --> 01:39:31.380]   wrote it.
[01:39:31.380 --> 01:39:33.340]   I will say that without irony, without certifies.
[01:39:33.340 --> 01:39:37.620]   I'm glad I live in a world in which this app exists.
[01:39:37.620 --> 01:39:38.980]   It's probably just an API call.
[01:39:38.980 --> 01:39:41.260]   It's probably a very straightforward API call.
[01:39:41.260 --> 01:39:43.860]   So Command Shift A, brilliant.
[01:39:43.860 --> 01:39:45.780]   What have you just written is now saved in your clipboard.
[01:39:45.780 --> 01:39:46.860]   Paste the text wherever you'd like.
[01:39:46.860 --> 01:39:51.100]   You can also reopen the note by clicking the logo in the menu bar and then you can change
[01:39:51.100 --> 01:39:53.220]   the font and all of that stuff.
[01:39:53.220 --> 01:39:54.620]   This is very interesting.
[01:39:54.620 --> 01:39:59.620]   I think you should pick a particularly unusual font to make it really fun.
[01:39:59.620 --> 01:40:00.620]   Cairo.
[01:40:00.620 --> 01:40:01.620]   Cairo.
[01:40:01.620 --> 01:40:02.620]   Yeah.
[01:40:02.620 --> 01:40:06.180]   You can have a cursor, auto-saved-aclyber, run-on-system startup, mass-activates.
[01:40:06.180 --> 01:40:08.620]   A cursor for your one letter.
[01:40:08.620 --> 01:40:11.700]   Where am I typing next?
[01:40:11.700 --> 01:40:12.700]   Let's see.
[01:40:12.700 --> 01:40:16.700]   This is next.
[01:40:16.700 --> 01:40:17.700]   Next.
[01:40:17.700 --> 01:40:18.700]   Letter.
[01:40:18.700 --> 01:40:20.700]   Weird, weird, weird.
[01:40:20.700 --> 01:40:21.700]   Weird.
[01:40:21.700 --> 01:40:22.700]   Weird.
[01:40:22.700 --> 01:40:23.700]   Okay.
[01:40:23.700 --> 01:40:26.620]   I think that would be doubly awesome if you've got like AirPlay mirroring on.
[01:40:26.620 --> 01:40:28.580]   You've got that 60-inch television.
[01:40:28.580 --> 01:40:29.580]   Yeah.
[01:40:29.580 --> 01:40:33.340]   So, Dad, can we please watch cartoons?
[01:40:33.340 --> 01:40:35.020]   Do we have to watch you?
[01:40:35.020 --> 01:40:37.740]   Type one letter at a time.
[01:40:37.740 --> 01:40:41.740]   This is how your father makes money to put food on the table.
[01:40:41.740 --> 01:40:46.180]   You're going to watch me write this thousand word review of this new watch band.
[01:40:46.180 --> 01:40:47.180]   Wow.
[01:40:47.180 --> 01:40:48.180]   Grandview.
[01:40:48.180 --> 01:40:49.940]   Let me type this here.
[01:40:49.940 --> 01:40:50.940]   Command-shift-A.
[01:40:50.940 --> 01:40:51.940]   Okay.
[01:40:51.940 --> 01:40:53.420]   So anyway, oh, I'm sorry.
[01:40:53.420 --> 01:40:54.740]   I'm having too much fun.
[01:40:54.740 --> 01:40:55.740]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:40:55.740 --> 01:40:56.740]   Yeah.
[01:40:56.740 --> 01:40:57.740]   Stop.
[01:40:57.740 --> 01:40:58.740]   Stop now.
[01:40:58.740 --> 01:41:01.980]   See, the fact that we have so much fun using this thing means that this thing definitely
[01:41:01.980 --> 01:41:02.980]   has value.
[01:41:02.980 --> 01:41:05.740]   We've all used lame apps that are just lame apps.
[01:41:05.740 --> 01:41:06.740]   Right.
[01:41:06.740 --> 01:41:07.740]   This is a fun lame app.
[01:41:07.740 --> 01:41:10.340]   Well, it depends how long the fun lasts, though, doesn't it?
[01:41:10.340 --> 01:41:11.340]   I think it's free.
[01:41:11.340 --> 01:41:12.340]   It's free.
[01:41:12.340 --> 01:41:13.340]   Exactly.
[01:41:13.340 --> 01:41:18.420]   Just like 50 bucks for a lottery ticket gives you three days worth of thoughts about how
[01:41:18.420 --> 01:41:22.140]   you're going to spend your $300 million, even though it only lasts three days.
[01:41:22.140 --> 01:41:23.140]   That's a dollar well spent.
[01:41:23.140 --> 01:41:24.140]   This is free.
[01:41:24.140 --> 01:41:26.380]   How can you do better than that?
[01:41:26.380 --> 01:41:28.980]   Andy Enocha writes for the Chicago Sun times.
[01:41:28.980 --> 01:41:32.660]   And when I say write, I mean, right, he is a writer's writer.
[01:41:32.660 --> 01:41:33.820]   Great stuff.
[01:41:33.820 --> 01:41:36.060]   Always fun to read.
[01:41:36.060 --> 01:41:39.700]   And you can, of course, catch his blog at CWOB.com.
[01:41:39.700 --> 01:41:41.140]   And he joins us every week.
[01:41:41.140 --> 01:41:43.620]   He'll be out here next week covering the Apple event.
[01:41:43.620 --> 01:41:45.420]   I hope to have my first visit to the brick house.
[01:41:45.420 --> 01:41:46.580]   You haven't been out here.
[01:41:46.580 --> 01:41:47.580]   Oh, yeah.
[01:41:47.580 --> 01:41:49.460]   We'll get you up here for sure.
[01:41:49.460 --> 01:41:50.460]   Somehow.
[01:41:50.460 --> 01:41:51.460]   Somehow.
[01:41:51.460 --> 01:41:55.980]   Jason Snell, now editorial director for the entire IDG world of consumer publications,
[01:41:55.980 --> 01:42:01.260]   including Macworld, PCworld, and the new tech hive.com, which goes out of beta next week.
[01:42:01.260 --> 01:42:02.260]   Can't wait.
[01:42:02.260 --> 01:42:03.260]   Great to have you always, Jason.
[01:42:03.260 --> 01:42:04.820]   It's always great to be on.
[01:42:04.820 --> 01:42:06.460]   I'm sorry I couldn't be in pedal.
[01:42:06.460 --> 01:42:07.460]   That's okay.
[01:42:07.460 --> 01:42:08.460]   I'm busy down here.
[01:42:08.460 --> 01:42:09.460]   But I'll be back.
[01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:10.460]   You got work to do.
[01:42:10.460 --> 01:42:11.460]   You're not going to be on the cruise.
[01:42:11.460 --> 01:42:12.460]   I'm more sorry about that.
[01:42:12.460 --> 01:42:13.460]   Yeah.
[01:42:13.460 --> 01:42:14.460]   Me too.
[01:42:14.460 --> 01:42:15.460]   Next time.
[01:42:15.460 --> 01:42:18.900]   Don McAllister and I will be on the next Mac Mania cruise in November.
[01:42:18.900 --> 01:42:20.180]   I don't know if there's any room left.
[01:42:20.180 --> 01:42:23.500]   I think it's sold out very quickly because it's a solar eclipse cruise, but you could
[01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:26.420]   check it in site cruises.com.
[01:42:26.420 --> 01:42:32.060]   Both of us will be giving lectures more Don than I than me.
[01:42:32.060 --> 01:42:34.420]   But you know, it's I'm doing four.
[01:42:34.420 --> 01:42:35.420]   That's fair.
[01:42:35.420 --> 01:42:36.420]   That's good.
[01:42:36.420 --> 01:42:37.420]   For me is good.
[01:42:37.420 --> 01:42:38.420]   I'm pretty lazy.
[01:42:38.420 --> 01:42:39.420]   And I'm going to do the genius bar again.
[01:42:39.420 --> 01:42:44.180]   Or we call it the ingenious bar to avoid copyright problems.
[01:42:44.180 --> 01:42:49.340]   And basically the nice thing about the Mac Mania genius bars is it actually had a bar.
[01:42:49.340 --> 01:42:50.340]   Oh yeah.
[01:42:50.340 --> 01:42:51.340]   True.
[01:42:51.340 --> 01:42:52.340]   Yeah.
[01:42:52.340 --> 01:42:54.940]   Every time you can answer that.
[01:42:54.940 --> 01:42:57.740]   Every time you can't answer a question, you got to do a shot.
[01:42:57.740 --> 01:42:58.740]   Drink.
[01:42:58.740 --> 01:43:04.140]   So Sal Sequoian and you and I and the gang will be sitting at the crow's nest just before
[01:43:04.140 --> 01:43:05.340]   dinner.
[01:43:05.340 --> 01:43:09.260]   And if you have a question, come and see if you can get us to speak.
[01:43:09.260 --> 01:43:11.180]   I'll type it out in Grandview.
[01:43:11.180 --> 01:43:12.180]   It'll be great.
[01:43:12.180 --> 01:43:14.180]   Don is also at screencasts online.com.
[01:43:14.180 --> 01:43:16.260]   That's where you find all those other great stuff.
[01:43:16.260 --> 01:43:17.260]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:43:17.260 --> 01:43:19.220]   We really appreciate a lot of fun.
[01:43:19.220 --> 01:43:22.940]   We will be at a different time next week so we can cover the Mac event live.
[01:43:22.940 --> 01:43:29.100]   Tune in Wednesday, September 12th, 10 AM Pacific 1 p.m. Eastern time 1700 UTC for the live
[01:43:29.100 --> 01:43:30.100]   reenactment.
[01:43:30.100 --> 01:43:38.860]   I'm so happy about this of the Tim Cook and et cetera announcement of the new iPhone.
[01:43:38.860 --> 01:43:41.300]   And then shortly thereafter, Mac Break Weekly.
[01:43:41.300 --> 01:43:43.140]   At this time next week, it will be security now.
[01:43:43.140 --> 01:43:45.300]   We'll flip-flop with Steve Gibson.
[01:43:45.300 --> 01:43:46.300]   Thanks for joining us now.
[01:43:46.300 --> 01:43:48.980]   Get back to work because break time is over.
[01:43:48.980 --> 01:43:58.980]   [MUSIC]
[01:43:58.980 --> 01:44:01.560]   (upbeat music)
[01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:04.140]   (lively music)
