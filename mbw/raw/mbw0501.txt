[00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.580]   Do you miss it when you come down south of the 49th parallel? Do you miss the horse?
[00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:11.180]   No, I go to bitter and sweet and fills and blue bottle and I drink in your marvelous coffee
[00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.300]   And I'm super jealous and sad when I go home
[00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.420]   Which is your favorite because there's a battle in San Francisco between fills and blue bottle?
[00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.580]   So they're so different fills is the is the hippie pour over and blue bottle is the hippiest brussel base beverage
[00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.420]   I like both of them
[00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.780]   So I'll go for a nice pour over at fills and then in the afternoon go to blue bottle and get an espresso
[00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.900]   Nothing wrong with any kind of coffee at all wondrous diversity Leo
[00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.540]   And coffees like sex even a bad cup is better

[00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.380]   Hello pixel core calm. What is that on your over your left shoulder looks like a
[00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.300]   award
[00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.020]   Sculpture hold it looks like a special what do they call it?
[00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:04.100]   Yeah, this is the special special award. Oh, that's neat. It's cool. Is that from a what Rwanda?
[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.780]   It's from Kenya Kenya. So it's
[00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.740]   Hard to fit in here. Yeah, it's great. It's it's kind of amazing
[00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.100]   This stuff is this I mean you literally you drive down the drive down the road and this is everywhere
[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.100]   Nice, you know buy it and so it's it's cool
[00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.900]   Yeah, and you know we've moved you know the whole blue bottle thing is all you know blase
[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.820]   Hey, you know, we're all past that you know, yeah, it's now trouble coffee trouble trouble coffee don't even know trouble next time
[00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.940]   You're here. Well, you bring me trouble. I'll bring you some trouble
[00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.900]   See and that's the best part you they all I'm gonna bring you some trouble
[00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.860]   And then I tell one of our producers who lives near it. I'm like I'm out of I'm finally out of trouble
[00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.060]   And then that usually means I have to get back into trouble. Who's the guy from Arrested Development? He has a new Netflix
[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.900]   Original
[00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.900]   show
[00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:55.900]   And but it's all about the Santa Monica hipster losers and then there's a cut there's a coffee the coffee place
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.240]   It isn't is called free coffee. I was gonna say daredevil but that doesn't not daredevil
[00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.440]   Free coffee and they owe it and it's like a running joke
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.020]   But is this on the house free free or is this free those free is a liberated man?
[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.500]   $5
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.540]   Free coffee
[00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.420]   Hey folks, let's talk about Apple
[00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:24.140]   You know the reason I made that snarky snide comment about Macintosh at the beginning is I realized that here
[00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.140]   We are new iOS devices
[00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.140]   you know iPhone SE
[00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.780]   iPad Pro Junior
[00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:38.660]   No word at all about new Mac books OS 10 anything. It's as if it didn't exist summer Leo summer
[00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.940]   I'm getting depressed. Oh, just wait for the summer. He'll be happy. I'm getting so depressed
[00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.580]   I've installed Linux on all my old Windows machines
[00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:51.260]   That's how depressed I am. I'm worried. I shouldn't worry I
[00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.720]   Mean like when you look at how Skylake has worked so far and you look at things like this
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:01.360]   I'm happy for them to wait. I think so I think like they're a smart company
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.880]   Originally like you look at the Mac pros
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.080]   Intel didn't really create the chips that Apple would use for some of those devices
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.080]   They did do a sky like I think in the 27 inch
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:16.320]   I'm Mac but it's not clear that all the right chips were available at all the right times and I'm not sure exactly how much
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:21.960]   Difference it'll make and looking at the surface book and the problems. I mean Paul Therat was really good at documenting those problems
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.020]   Yeah, as was I both of us purchase surface books
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.000]   I am just as I'm just as soon happy to get a really really good Mac book at the WDC
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.600]   Then a really fast one at the beginning of the year. I've been reassured
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:40.600]   I'm again by Microsoft which clang which thought they had patched this in February the sky like power issues in February
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:47.800]   That no, no, we know there's still problems and we think we have it this time. So maybe Apple did the right thing
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:53.060]   It's a hard like when you look at it's taken Intel so long to move to 10 to 14 nanometer
[00:06:53.060 --> 00:07:00.020]   Nevermind 10 nanometer and now Samsung and Taiwan semiconductor are basically fabbing at the same the same size now as them
[00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:07.180]   It's it's the world has changed the whole the whole way that chips are made and produced has changed and it hasn't been an easy transition
[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.180]   I do have to say that
[00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:16.620]   one of the things that using Linux on a Windows machine besides giving me the great pleasure of them eliminating windows is
[00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.460]   I feel like the
[00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.480]   What cut leaps to mind is the right tool for the right job?
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.880]   And I'm sure Andy you agree on this because you're not all Mac all Apple
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:35.040]   And and I have the s7 I love it the iPad the new iPad Pro 9.7 inch has really proven to be
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:39.580]   Exactly what I kind of wanted which is the ultimate kind of super portable
[00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:46.720]   Like blogging tool this keyboard is fine, and it's so light and small. I keep it in my my backpack
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.300]   It's great
[00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:54.340]   But it's you know, it's it's definitely different than and they're the command line Linux
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:58.620]   But that's what I like on the laptop. So it's kind of like the right tool for the right job
[00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:02.580]   Yeah, absolutely. I was just thinking about
[00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:06.340]   Perrier I've now of course I take the Mac
[00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:11.820]   but excuse me the iPad Pro with me wherever I go whenever I leave and now I'm sort of thinking that perhaps the ultimate
[00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:16.280]   Street bag is now going to be the iPad Pro and the
[00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:22.340]   iPad mini that I bought early last year and thinking about you carry two iPads
[00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:28.860]   Because I'm thinking about like all the the only thing I don't like about the iPad Pro is that if I'm like on a bus
[00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:33.580]   That's gonna take me 40 minutes or I'm a train is gonna be like an hour out like on the subway
[00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.900]   I'll take it. I'll take out the pro on the commuter rail
[00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:40.020]   I will not take it out on the subway because you're holding a lunch tray
[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:46.820]   And so I just sort of got enamored with the idea of like starting an audio editing project Jason Snell
[00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:48.820]   Was on on iOS today yesterday
[00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.780]   And he really got me
[00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:56.260]   I should really try to see if I can edit audio on this thing the idea of picking up a project where I left off like on this
[00:08:56.260 --> 00:09:00.380]   tiny little portable device and then when I get back to a place where I'm at a desk and
[00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:06.740]   Desk in a keyboard actually use that sort of thing as as you say though. It really is the right device for the right job
[00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:12.140]   I could easily decide that I'm going to be using this as my canonical. I'm on the subway sort of device
[00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:19.980]   I I was even tempted to get a surface pro for because of the things that it can do that would fill the need of
[00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:23.620]   Grid 13 inch super slim tablet and fortunately
[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:29.980]   We now live in a world in which you could really split your world between Mac OS iOS windows and Android because
[00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:34.660]   Everything that's a serious players now so multi-platform and so heavily
[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:42.220]   Conceived as a mobile cloud based thing that it basically almost makes you can basically choose just the thing that you want and
[00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:47.860]   Know that it'll somehow work together and if it's a VR you want you're gonna be you're gonna be using Windows 10
[00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:52.740]   Yeah, and we've been playing with the Oculus Rift and people can't keep their hands off of it. It's uh, yeah
[00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:57.140]   It's been so much fun, and I can't wait to over their heads. Yeah, I can't wait to get the vibe
[00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:59.180]   Which should come pretty soon?
[00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:02.700]   The first time you use a real good headset that has
[00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:09.100]   Has zero latency and high frame rate every single moment the stuff that the Samsung is doing
[00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:13.180]   It's one it's really quite nice the stuff that Google's doing with cardboard also really quite nice
[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:20.500]   But the first time you're strapped into riff or HTC's new headset and you're like oh, I'm now actually here
[00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:27.580]   There's someone someone that there's a pinball game that's available for this release day and date with the new Oculus
[00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:34.540]   Somebody created a pinball controller that they essentially just built the first foot of a pinball cabinet
[00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:38.940]   So it's on it's on the same metal legs the same height and it's got flipper buttons on the side
[00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:41.980]   And so just and it seems silly until
[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:48.060]   Norm at tessa.com had a video about it where he's but you're just you get to lean over the table
[00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:52.980]   This is you would to see like from left to right where the ball is going and that's the difference between hey
[00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:56.460]   I'm playing a neat computer game to know I'm having a pinball experience
[00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:03.020]   And I've had I've had so many different experience with VR gear that just gets me so excited
[00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:08.780]   It's the ultimate demo. It really is the ultimate demo. Well and one of the things I wonder about is is whether some of the
[00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:16.060]   Comments made about dropping the Mac platform for Oculus and so on so forth. Yeah, what was it the Palmer lucky said?
[00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:21.100]   I'll make it will make Oculus as soon as Apple makes a this was it. Yeah, I think he used the word garbage
[00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:25.020]   Doesn't it and I know that that kind of stuff comes off, you know
[00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:31.820]   But people should I mean I've been in on the other side of what happens when people do that with Apple and it's look
[00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:35.820]   Maybe a little different than when jobs was there because that would have lit jobs up, you know
[00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:45.100]   the because when I was at Lucasfilm when when the avid marketing guys said they were going to drop the Mac platform and
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:49.660]   It was pretty exciting. We got a lot of machine a lot of machinery really fast, you know
[00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:56.540]   Like Apple, you know immediately flipped into a different gear than it than it was the week before about
[00:11:56.540 --> 00:12:01.180]   Final cut Final Cut was like this little test for them and then it just became you know an avid killer
[00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:06.700]   You know and and and so it's interesting as as Apple starts to dip its toe into this process as to whether
[00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:12.380]   You know attacks on it or or a dropping of the platform may accelerate, you know some of their plans
[00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:15.820]   You know down the road if they're gonna if they're gonna get into that market
[00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:17.820]   I mean they have announced anything of course
[00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:24.300]   It's uh, it's definitely a platform on the move
[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:28.940]   Hard to say if it's going to be the next big thing in capital letters
[00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:33.260]   But it is definitely one of some strong contenders for the next
[00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.300]   platform
[00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.780]   Including by the way messaging and that's another thing apple
[00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:44.140]   Has a toe in the water, but hasn't really they don't do anything cross platform right yet
[00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:46.940]   And I think that keeps that's gonna make it
[00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:50.460]   It's a old blackberry game where you keep bbm
[00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:56.220]   Proprietary because you think it helps you and then one day it's detrimental and what's happened sold for 17 billion dollars
[00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:01.100]   Speaking of what's at big announcement from what's app just broke this morning
[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:06.700]   They are switching on encryption for everything
[00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:09.580]   messaging
[00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:11.580]   audio video
[00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:13.900]   phone calls end-to-end encryption
[00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:18.380]   And it's going to be good encryption because it's being implemented by
[00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:25.420]   Uh, a hacker whose name is not only memorable but well known to people who listen to securely not security now moxie marlin spike
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:34.700]   Uh, he they have added end-to-end encryption on what's app now to every form of communication on their so great service
[00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:41.740]   Uh, and I can only imagine how law enforcement is going to react to this remember there already being
[00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:46.380]   Uh, is it sued by the department of justice over it?
[00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:53.500]   Messages that they they say we can't tell you what's in the message. We have no way to access it
[00:13:55.020 --> 00:14:00.940]   Um, so this is uh, really and I think this was a PR mistake by the FBI by turning this the switch on
[00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:04.700]   They I think they definitely accelerated all these companies looking at trying to build
[00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.580]   Basically things that are already going to be out there that are not
[00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:12.860]   Figu if you can't go back. I mean, I think that it is created in arms race that they didn't need to create
[00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:18.220]   Um that maybe what we would have gotten to anyway, but I think that they definitely accelerated the whole process by
[00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:20.620]   Uh pushing something that they ended up dropping
[00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:22.460]   in the end
[00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:28.620]   It already had encryption was since 2013 in fact that's uh, I guess it is it it's not an active
[00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:30.940]   lawsuit, but
[00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:34.380]   Uh, the government has asked for a wiretap
[00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:41.500]   They uh, they're considering a court case after a wiretap order ran into what's apps end-to-end encryption according to the New York times
[00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:49.100]   Um, the the joseph demarcos of federal former federal prosecutors said the government doesn't want to stop encryption
[00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:53.100]   But the question is what do you do when a company creates an encryption system that makes it impossible?
[00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:59.820]   For court authorized search warrants to be executed. What is the reasonable level of assistance you should ask for from that company?
[00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:05.820]   And uh, yeah, here you this is a facebook owned company. So they have plenty of resources to defend themselves
[00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:13.420]   They are a united states company widely used though. In fact more widely used outside the us than inside the us
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:16.700]   That's interesting because what do they do when other countries ask for that?
[00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:20.620]   I mean was it what's app that had to turn off service because of a legal dispute in one country?
[00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:25.660]   Yeah, but Brazil briefly Brazil said if you don't hand this over we're going to shut you down
[00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:32.940]   What they didn't take into consideration is that 93 percent of all resilience use what's app sms messaging
[00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:39.500]   Prohibitively expensive in that country. So after 24 hours that the government backed down
[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.300]   And said ah, sorry never mind
[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:50.620]   And of course telegram one of the other competitors to what's app had a boon of over a million sign-ups in that 24 hours in brazil
[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:53.900]   Marx Marxie does open whisper systems
[00:15:53.900 --> 00:16:02.380]   Um, and I think it's off the record o tr encryption that they implement which is very strong. Well, steve will talk about this no doubt next show
[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:05.660]   Um, but bringing in marxie marlin spike
[00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:09.020]   Reassures everybody in the crypto community
[00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:12.620]   That unlike telegram which rolls its own encryption
[00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:15.980]   This will be real true strong encryption
[00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:23.340]   That the government not only the government can get into but it presumably will be implemented properly so that what's app can't get into it
[00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:25.900]   And that's going to be the key
[00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:31.740]   Now what will have to happen if this if this goes forward is the guy this will be the showdown where the government has to say
[00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:35.980]   We demand and we we don't i don't hold i think they would do it
[00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:39.580]   We demand of what's app is a us company to provide us with the backdoor
[00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:42.860]   And that will be an interesting case
[00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:50.380]   And you're right. I think maybe a misstep on the department of justice is part because of the high profile of the apple case
[00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:55.660]   The I think it almost forced everyone to to go down that path like you know, you had to now be you know
[00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:58.860]   If you're gonna do it you the key is is you want to it's kind of like
[00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:04.220]   Uh, when you have records the key is you can't destroy them after the government asked for them
[00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:07.420]   You know, you can only destroy them legally before the government asked for them
[00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:11.500]   So so a lot of these companies before the government starts to legislate
[00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.140]   Uh rules of encryption. I think a lot of these
[00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:22.300]   Uh companies are trying to get things into place, you know and and make it more and more difficult to uh to manage that process
[00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:24.620]   Uh
[00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:26.700]   You know one billion people use what's app
[00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:32.780]   Yep, this is the case. This is the time for zeolio and we have put it back as if we chose to
[00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:34.780]   Cora you're everybody use it
[00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:40.780]   No, we should find out that rene is an expert in brazilian jiu-ditsu
[00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:43.820]   I have been yelled at by a lot of really famous brazilian people
[00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:46.940]   So so he has respect
[00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:50.780]   For the brazilians which ball which cosado
[00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:56.540]   Uh, and I I really I'm I'm actually thrilled and I will now start using what's app right
[00:17:56.540 --> 00:18:01.820]   Um because this is exactly how it should be there have been other of course many others
[00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:04.860]   Including open signals, uh, uh, whispers on open signal
[00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:09.660]   Uh before this but what's happened everybody you gotta use a messaging system that everybody uses
[00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:13.820]   It does no good to use threma a secure messaging system if no one else is using it
[00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:17.340]   And the more the better because if it's one company you can bring all the resources of the government against it
[00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:21.660]   But if everybody is much harder to you know, people will just move around between services
[00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:23.260]   Yeah, google you want to stay in with apple
[00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:26.620]   Uh facebook you want to stand with apple. This is how you do it
[00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:31.020]   Just encrypting one. I think that's what that's the direction they're going
[00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:37.900]   It's a it's strong public public key crypto. Um actually the founders actin and kum
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:44.300]   Of what's app have deep roots in the security, uh, and crypto community as it is and bringing in marxie marxie
[00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:46.300]   My own spike just makes it even uh
[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.260]   Even more credible
[00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:52.860]   And we have so much I mean right now is messaging but everything is going to be tied to these services
[00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:55.980]   They're so popular as payments some of them, especially the far east
[00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:59.420]   They're they're used as gaming platforms. They used as commercial platforms
[00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:03.660]   They they are the platform on top of the smartphone and it's having those be vulnerable
[00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:06.700]   It's just not acceptable to anybody it'll it'll limit the growth of them. Yeah
[00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:10.140]   Well, uh as uh wired points out
[00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:16.620]   What's app is probably the largest if not one of the largest not the largest communications network in the world
[00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:22.060]   Yep, so this is a big one. This is bigger than at and t say they're doing it. This is bigger than this is big
[00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:24.620]   1 billion
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:26.620]   active users
[00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:30.860]   Uh, let's take a break. We're gonna move on lots to talk about
[00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:33.340]   I want to get your reactions to the new hardware all of you have
[00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:39.020]   I don't know if all of you do some of you one of you as tiny little as a tiny little phone
[00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:48.060]   So small Jason snell brought it by uh yesterday and it's like well, let's see. I found five. I know I I mean it's exactly the same
[00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:50.780]   Welcome back
[00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:55.740]   It's real. Uh, we'll find out why market watch says apple's about to get a lot more of your money
[00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:59.180]   I don't think they could have more of my money. They have so much already all of it
[00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:01.740]   Mm
[00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:05.100]   And uh and a lot more and of course, it's the 40th birthday of apple
[00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:09.900]   We celebrated on uh triangulation yesterday with a marathon three hour interview
[00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:15.660]   with bill Atkinson one of the uh original mac team members a creator of quick draw the
[00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:21.340]   Fundamental drawing routines that made the mac possible mac paint the first painting program hypercard
[00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:24.540]   He found a general magic with Andy Hertzfeld
[00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:29.980]   Uh and was incredibly generous in fact so much so
[00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:34.940]   I said well i'll go as long as you can go. He said well how long let's go all day
[00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:41.420]   So we did uh three hours and we'll we'll we'll splitting it into two different triangulations the first one went up
[00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:44.380]   Of course yesterday. We'll talk a little bit about that
[00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:52.620]   But first a word from it pro tv a lot of you are in it or want to get into it if you love technology
[00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:54.700]   Why wouldn't you want to do it for a living?
[00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:59.980]   But there is this roadblock this barrier to get it in a job in it called the cert
[00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:03.820]   The certifications and there are lots of certifications out there
[00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:06.700]   You know
[00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:13.100]   Doesn't you don't have to have a cert to have to know stuff right? Obviously not I don't have a cert none of these guys have certs
[00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:18.060]   But it is imperative in many cases to get that job
[00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:22.940]   And I have to say it pro tv is a great way to prepare for the certification tests
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:27.260]   And to get real useful knowledge not just study for the test but to actually
[00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:32.460]   Learn stuff you need to know go to it pro dot tv slash mac break right now
[00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:36.940]   They have over a thousand hours a thousand hours of content
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:41.660]   And they're doing 50 hours a week now two studios
[00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:44.620]   Running full-time nine to five monday through friday
[00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:48.300]   You could stream them live you don't even have to pay for an account to watch live
[00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:53.100]   But if you pay for an account then you can watch on demand and your crumb cast your roku
[00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:57.580]   Your fire tv your apple tv. Yeah, they just added an apple tv app. It's really nice
[00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:59.260]   Your pc
[00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:05.020]   You pay for a year at a time you can even download them and take them on the go without an internet access without internet connection
[00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:10.940]   Everything from mac integration basics mac management basics apple certified support professional
[00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:18.540]   apple certified technical coordinator of course sisco and isc square the certified ethical hacker cert
[00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:22.300]   You could study for it all
[00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:29.180]   Microsoft certs and there's lots more if you're for instance learning how to use a windows server and you don't have a windows server who does
[00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:32.220]   Many many of us can't afford to do that
[00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:37.020]   They have these virtual machine labs all you need is an html5 compatible browser
[00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:41.100]   And you can set up a windows server set up multiple clients
[00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:45.420]   Do it all and that's part of the subscription. They also have the transcender practice exam
[00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:48.540]   So you could take the exam before you take the exam. That's worth 109 bucks
[00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:54.780]   That's part of your low monthly subscription price and by the way, they're geeks. They know they're not going to hide
[00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:59.660]   The cancellation box they make it easy to cancel when you get the cert
[00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:02.380]   You're not going to want to they know that because it's really it's like having
[00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:09.340]   It buddies always available to answer any question. They have full transcripts. They have q&a sessions
[00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:13.740]   Which are like study groups corporate and group pricing is available
[00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:20.060]   I they told me the other day when they were here that the entire harvard it department now has an it pro tv subscription

[00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:03.660]   Mac break weekly
[00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:06.380]   What's app just put out their white paper on the security Leo? I stuck it in the
[00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:08.620]   Oh, show notes. Let me take a look at it
[00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:13.900]   I presume it's oh, dude. Look, you know what it's coolman actin and mar and marlin spike
[00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:16.860]   Yes, that's all you need
[00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:22.300]   Uh, that's I I'm satisfied. I mean with the real question of course and i'm sir stevel go over this himself is
[00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:27.500]   Not that it is a strong encryption. We know that but but are the keys
[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:35.180]   Totally yours are the keys stored in any way at what's happened. It doesn't look like they are yeah, it's super detailed. It's really nice
[00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:42.700]   So man transport security everything and it yeah, and it's uh on all messaging
[00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:46.540]   Yeah, they're using uh, otr. It looks like it's on all messaging. Well, that's great
[00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:50.380]   Oh, man. Wow
[00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:52.940]   That is a shot across the bow
[00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:57.100]   More like this, please. Yeah. Yeah, every that's you you nail it
[00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:59.100]   If everybody did this
[00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:01.660]   Then what are you gonna do? It's like done
[00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:08.860]   Well, the problem is then it becomes a conversation about competitiveness of us companies because if you have international companies and us companies and everyone
[00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:16.140]   Addin it all it becomes this this Pandora's box. That's very hard to put all back together in a for from an encryption perspective. Yeah
[00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:22.700]   Um, you know steve was gonna do a crypto solution steve gifts in the host for security now
[00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:24.860]   And he saw this was a couple of years ago
[00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:27.580]   He saw this coming and he said i'm not gonna make it because I don't want to be
[00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:30.300]   like lava bit
[00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:35.180]   Yeah, and and have to go out of business because I refuse to help the government and that's what lava bit did
[00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:43.580]   Pulling like reddit and pulling your canary out of here. Oh, there's another one right. Yeah last week reddit had a what they call a um
[00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:49.500]   Ask me anything. No, they had a canary what do they call him? I a uh, uh, uh,
[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:52.140]   nsl canary, yeah
[00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:53.420]   so uh
[00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:56.140]   Other companies apple does as apples canary still there?
[00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:59.580]   I don't think so i'll check but I think they lost it. I think it is
[00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:06.460]   So the idea is uh, you can't you're not allowed when you get a national security letter in most cases to say you got a national security letter
[00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:09.660]   These are the letters that are issued by the the secret fice court
[00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:13.740]   saying hand over the goods on user x
[00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:20.540]   Uh, and uh, oh and by the way, you may not tell user x or anybody else that we just asked you for this
[00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:23.500]   under penalty of going to jail for the rest of your life
[00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:27.980]   So you can't do this reactively you can only do it proactively
[00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:32.460]   So what they what reddit did and what apple did is they put in their transparency reports to date
[00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:37.260]   We have not received an nsl request from a any federal agency. Oh, right? Yeah
[00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:43.100]   But it disappeared from reddit's transparency report last week which means they did
[00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:50.140]   Yeah, and i don't apple did this first that i was aware of yeah, i think they lost there's a couple of years ago. That's a double check
[00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:52.220]   And
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:57.500]   And the great and the cool thing is that of course, uh, reddit can't talk about anything like that themselves
[00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:59.740]   So a couple of people did an ama
[00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:03.020]   Oh really about about the about the about the what that means
[00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:09.180]   Not someone inside inside reddit but to uh intellectual intellectual property safety security experts
[00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:15.020]   Basically said here's everything that we can that can be told about their their interaction with this
[00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:17.500]   so it's
[00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:23.580]   There's it's it's it's it's it's it's going to blow up to a point where this really has to be an open discussion
[00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:28.780]   And it's going to end with deciding is this going to be a principle or is this just going to be something we're going to deal with?
[00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:30.060]   um
[00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:31.420]   meaning that
[00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:40.060]   Do users have the ability to encrypt things and have a secret that the government cannot get at or is that not something that people have the right to have?
[00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:45.980]   And either way you're going to have to accept some bad stuff that goes with whatever way your the issue went for you
[00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:50.220]   Yeah, at the lost theirs in september 2014. Oh, was that long ago?
[00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:52.220]   That was the most well ago
[00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:53.260]   Uh
[00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:55.020]   Well, I really think this is going to be a lot more
[00:27:55.020 --> 00:28:01.420]   A lot less secrecy behind nsl from now on it really the the number of national security letters
[00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:07.420]   I've been issued over the path since 2006 numbers in the high thousands of things since something like 12,000 13,000
[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:09.740]   It's not something that is a very special
[00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:15.740]   We must go to the special oak paneled roman our robes and make this plea to someone and it's like no
[00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:18.220]   It's a real beer. It's turning to a real beer
[00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:21.100]   Bureaucratical procedural thing where if you want it you get it
[00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:25.260]   They basically basically it might have been hard to get initially
[00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:30.940]   But now the process is so well trodden that if you you know how to get the nsl if you actually
[00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:33.340]   Definitely want to get it. Uh, and so
[00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:40.140]   It's once people realize exactly how much power a national security letter has and how little oversight there is
[00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:43.980]   And how little visibility there is. I really think that's one of these tipping points
[00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:45.980]   That's going to be part of that long
[00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:49.420]   It's almost like we're going to have like a vatican to sort of council
[00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:56.940]   Of discussion of because they're two different forces that are very very important that seem to have absolutely completely
[00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:59.980]   incompatible goals with each other
[00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:03.420]   And it's just going to have to be a long conversation that so maybe even
[00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:08.860]   Amends the constitution to really define this in such a way that it informs every law that comes after it
[00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:13.900]   And I think that one of the one of the real challenges here is also that
[00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:17.820]   Uh, I I think that to do this you have to do it internationally
[00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:22.300]   They're going to have to get all the countries to have some kind of charter that says that they're not going to do this
[00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:25.820]   And it's going to be so hard to corral that in we're talking five to eight years
[00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:30.860]   And at the same time you're gonna have software companies and hardware companies trying to do everything they can to get to a point where they've sold
[00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:32.620]   200 million phones
[00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:37.260]   By then or 300 million phones that are already so far down the path that it would be very difficult to
[00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:43.180]   You can't roll them back. I think that's that the key is trying to get it under the bridge before you can do anything about it
[00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:47.260]   A lot of quantum computing research being done right now. Yeah. Yeah, yeah
[00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:51.180]   Really, that's what's gonna have to happen right? They're just gonna have to get faster computers
[00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:54.300]   And they're working on ways of protecting against quantum breaking too. So
[00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:57.100]   catamouse continues
[00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:02.940]   I've been hearing a lot of people talking about how the next the next step for encryption or for for data security
[00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:10.220]   Is gonna be stuff like artificial intelligence where you can actually go you can actually go ahead and say that
[00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:16.940]   We we the makers of the security product literally do not know how this product works because we're using this
[00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:19.420]   We're using machine intelligence to create it
[00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:25.500]   This is the same way that the at google the developers of the go app that made headlines a few weeks ago by
[00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:31.820]   Being the first really competitive and successful go app the developers will tell you we do not know what this app strategy is
[00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:36.540]   We did not come up with it because this app is creating its own playing strategy. What's what's whatever?
[00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:41.420]   Uh, it's amazing that a lot of this the roadmap for these products is going to be
[00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:47.500]   It's going to be more and more important that we the makers of this product do not even have the ability to access this data
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:50.460]   Otherwise, we are it's not just a principle thing
[00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:55.820]   It's we do not want to spend 40 percent of our of our of our time every single week
[00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:58.220]   dealing with and and
[00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:05.260]   Responding to the demands of law enforcement the only way to prevent that is to say we literally do not know how to get at this data
[00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:09.740]   Incidentally that appears to be what what's app has done
[00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:16.220]   I've been reading through the white paper and they're doing something that three men does as well, which is a qr code that allows you to
[00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:20.700]   In person verify so the next time you guys are out here. We should exchange qr codes
[00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:25.660]   And here's what they say what's app users additionally have the option to verify the keys of other users
[00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:29.180]   With whom they they are communicating so they're able to confirm that
[00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:35.340]   An unauthorized third party including what's app has not initiated a man in the middle attack
[00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:41.340]   This can be done by scanning a qr code by comparing a 60 digit number. This is a way to uh
[00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:44.860]   Fully verify that you and only you and your
[00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:46.540]   uh
[00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:48.540]   correspondy have the keys
[00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:53.100]   And that eliminates what's app's ability to do anything, which is what they want
[00:31:53.820 --> 00:32:01.820]   Which anybody should want I guess but what do you think though of the very real and legitimate desire for law enforcement to protect us against criminals
[00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:06.460]   It will go it will it will get worse until it
[00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:09.980]   That what we can't ignore the fact is that uh
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:15.500]   Law enforcement above and all wants to do things that are in the end good for us
[00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:19.740]   Even if sometimes the way that they do that is bad for us that we are gonna it's there
[00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:23.660]   There is no one right answer to all of this where I do believe that in principle
[00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:28.140]   The right of the individual to have a secret from the government is really important
[00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:33.820]   It's how you wind up with a government that you feel as though you're proud to be part of a part part to be a subject of
[00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:39.820]   However, we are going to have to be okay with a time three five years from now
[00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:44.700]   Maybe even three or five days from now where we're gonna have there's going to be no bones about it
[00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:50.540]   Here are where all of these peoples all the people who killed those 500 people the plans were right
[00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:56.220]   They put it on a public server the FBI law enforcement international law enforcement had a copy of all their plans
[00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:59.260]   But they could not get at it and now they when they
[00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:02.620]   After the the disaster happened and they got the guys
[00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:06.300]   They're responsible and they decrypted the stuff they saw that nope
[00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:09.340]   This was if we had we had the file itself if we get inside it
[00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:13.980]   We could definitely stop this thing from happening and then we're gonna have to say
[00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:18.380]   Where's terry? It's a horrible thing that happened. We are so
[00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:23.740]   Sorry for the loss of lives. We still believe that the principle is an important principle
[00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:28.940]   I I would like to think that when that time comes I will be clear voiced and say I
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:33.580]   We went we didn't just simply weren't we were just hippies waving flags about hey, you know
[00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:35.660]   The government get our get your hands off of our data
[00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:39.900]   You have to understand that this is going to be this is going to cost human lives at some point
[00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:43.020]   You have to be okay with that this is not wrong to be okay with that
[00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:46.940]   But you have to understand this is one of those principles that will have far-reaching
[00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:51.820]   Implications just like the principle of citizens do not have a right to have a secret
[00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:56.220]   We'll also have far-reaching implications and you have to be okay with that too if you support that side
[00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:58.140]   We deal with that now with moranda
[00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:00.780]   I mean like would be much easier if police didn't have to use moranda, right?
[00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:03.500]   You weren't presumed innocent. I mean there are countries where you aren't presumed innocent
[00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:07.660]   That's right forms where you aren't and all these things are greatly convenient and guilty people do go free
[00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:13.420]   But we decided as a society that there were certain rights that were so important that I forget what the cliche is but better
[00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:17.420]   You know for for a hundred guilty people to go free than one innocent man to go to jail
[00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:20.860]   Or one is in person to go to jail and this might be one of those things
[00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:23.420]   It's like the fifth amendment is
[00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:24.780]   it's a
[00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:28.380]   Fifth amendment has always been that that sort of thing that makes me want it makes me
[00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:31.180]   Recite the fact that the law is hysterically funny
[00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:36.780]   But the law but the fifth amendment is all there to say we do not have the right to force things out of your head
[00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:38.460]   If there's something that you know
[00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:42.620]   You we don't have the right to demand that you say it one of the ways to demand you to say something
[00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:46.860]   You don't want to have to say that it basically puts yourself in a vulnerability is
[00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:49.100]   is a
[00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:52.140]   Basically is to say things are going to incriminate yourself
[00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:57.420]   and one of the reasons why this all this sort of stuff is so it gets so interesting is because
[00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:03.820]   You the law basically says that if if you have the passcode
[00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:11.500]   But the thing that you want to keep secret is actually a file the government cannot force you
[00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:13.580]   serily
[00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:14.700]   to
[00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:21.900]   Tell them what the password is but they can force you to give them the contents of that document because that document is not inside your head
[00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:24.460]   It's a file that you decided to create and take out of your head
[00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:33.580]   So that's why in some in some jurisdictions it's turned into we will uh, we can force you to by this court order to go inside a private locked room
[00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:37.900]   Tap in your passcode in such a way that none of us can see it will ever know it
[00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:41.740]   But then unlock your phone and hand the phone to us so that we can see it
[00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:44.700]   Uh, because again, the document is not controlled by the fifth amendment
[00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:51.740]   But something that is secret inside your head is it's the reason why they can take a dead man's fingerprint and use that to unlock
[00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:57.500]   Someone's phone or basically co-course and compel you to put your fingerprint on a fingerprint reader because again
[00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:04.620]   That's not private information. That's not something you created and just sort of thought of but again if there's something that you decide to memorize and just decide to
[00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:07.740]   Memorize this 81,000 word
[00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:14.300]   Piece of piece of piece of information. They can't get it out of you all because there is a there is an amendment to the constitution
[00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:16.700]   That said that something that's inside your head is
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:22.700]   You have the right to have it inside your head and there are ways to get there are ways to compel you to tell that secret despite your rights
[00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:25.500]   Uh, there's a i've been reading a lot of stuff
[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:34.380]   Now that basically says that really they can just decide to hold you in contempt of court until you agree to do something that they want you to do
[00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:38.140]   So yeah, many kinds of journalists still in jail today for not revealing their sources
[00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:42.380]   Wouldn't it be amazing if your phone became something like a priest or a lawyer or a doctor where there's privilege
[00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:48.780]   Because we decided that's exactly what obama said. You know, you said let's not fetishize these phones
[00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:53.260]   I think that's exactly what he's saying is what the question is is if your phone is capable of giving you psychological
[00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:58.700]   Advice does that make it your psychologist or legal advice? Does that make it your lawyer?
[00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:01.100]   You know when you get to an ai or a life?
[00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:05.900]   Position there it could change the nature of what that phone that's an interesting point
[00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:09.180]   Yeah, again. Again. These are these are such deep deep issues one of the problems
[00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:10.940]   I've been doing a lot of research into ai now
[00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:11.420]   but
[00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:11.900]   uh
[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:16.860]   A lot of law enforcement are kind of concerned about some of the tools they're using because ai based tools are
[00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:23.740]   Exceptionally good at taking a terabyte of information and turning into one or three names. They're going to be very interesting for their purposes
[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:25.580]   but nonetheless
[00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:30.540]   At some point they might not at the not at the local jurisdiction level
[00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:34.860]   But at like the federal appeals level or the supreme court level
[00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:38.380]   They're going to have to prove that here is how we got this information
[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:43.100]   And if they're using an ai where they don't know how this works because it's a machine learning thing
[00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:48.620]   That might make it difficult for them to defend this piece of evidence or to defend this technique
[00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:51.260]   And it's all because of again basic principles
[00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:57.020]   We are we are a society that has decided that if you are even if you are declared guilt found guilty
[00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:00.300]   You have a right to appeal you have a right to know who your accuser was
[00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:06.540]   No, you have the right exactly you have the right to know how this material how this uh evidence was brought against you
[00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:13.100]   And this can be a big pain in the bud. It's the reason why a lot of absolutely completely guilty people go free
[00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:17.020]   Because we don't have we know who did it. We know how he did it
[00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:22.940]   This person was all but bragging about it. We have video of someone doing something that's not exactly the same thing
[00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:25.420]   But it's sort it's we we've got them
[00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:29.500]   There's no question about it, but we can't convict them because we have to go by the rules in order to do it
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:32.780]   Like I said, it's incredibly inconvenient. It's not necessarily even
[00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:39.260]   Objectively the only way we can have a justice system, but this is the system that we just this this is the we decided that
[00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:42.700]   This is going to be an expression of the sort of society that we want to create
[00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:46.060]   And that's why we pick this with its problems intact
[00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:49.980]   Well, and we in our constitution is written by people who are pissed off about the government and said
[00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:55.260]   You know, they they they focus the first 10 things on these are the things we don't want the government to do to us
[00:38:55.420 --> 00:39:00.540]   You know that that was you know, so so the you know, our you know, because other countries don't have you know a lot of these rules and and
[00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:02.940]   You know, there are a lot of things, you know
[00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:07.020]   The our pictures and everything else are not the only thing that they get from our phones
[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:10.220]   So, you know, there's a lot of things, you know there I was talking to somebody about
[00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:15.340]   You know, someone we had something stolen in another country and it was returned to us very quickly
[00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:20.860]   And I was kind of curious on how you do that and they said well, you just have to look at what phone doesn't belong here
[00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:24.060]   You know like I know where all these phones are what phone doesn't belong here
[00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:27.500]   And then I just follow that phone back and then I say one of these phones is not like the other
[00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:33.580]   Identify what phone doesn't belong there and then he goes and then you identify all the phones that that phone hung out with
[00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:37.260]   And then you identify all the phones that they hang out with and he said what's important
[00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:40.860]   And this is why the the whole thing is important. This wasn't in our country. It was another country
[00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:45.180]   That's why being able to log all that data. That's why metadata is so valuable
[00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:48.540]   Yeah, because they don't care about your actual I mean they care about your conversations
[00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:49.660]   But that's too much data
[00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:55.660]   What they really want is just who was talking to who and what was there because then you find out that this person does something in san Bernadino
[00:39:55.660 --> 00:40:02.540]   And now you can back up to every every every person they talked to on their phone or texted or where all the places that they were
[00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:06.700]   For the last and that that data is actually and that is why the nsa was so
[00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:12.860]   Much more apo flectric about that than breaking into someone's phone because a lot of these people are using burners and they're using all kinds of other things
[00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:15.740]   But even with that burner phone, I can still tell where you were
[00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:19.180]   You know for the last two days, you know, and so so that is
[00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:23.020]   You know, there's a lot of data that they're already pulling from our phone and I think that
[00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:29.660]   Um where it got to be even for me, you know beyond that that edge was compelling accompanying not not breaking into the phone
[00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:32.140]   I think the FBI has the right to try to break into a phone
[00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:35.820]   It was the it was the compelling a company to write new code
[00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:39.580]   Like I think that is a point where we have to say okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa
[00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:43.980]   You know that's the point the point of which a couple point was the government says we don't care
[00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:47.020]   How would you have to do to get this data? That's your problem not ours
[00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:50.460]   It also creates an it also creates a problem where
[00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:57.740]   How do how can apple prove that they are complying with this court order if they can't actually do this again?
[00:40:57.740 --> 00:41:01.500]   They're creating systems in which it is not possible for them to
[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:05.260]   Ideally not possible for them in any way shape or form to work around this
[00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:10.620]   If they if there is a way they can get around the passcode that means that there is a way that they kind of screwed up
[00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:16.060]   Uh even even on some level so what happens when someone says look
[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:18.940]   I don't care that that the that the suspect
[00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:23.100]   Through this document into a cross-cut shredder and then
[00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:33.020]   Doused it in hot water boiled it into a pulp and then basically spent 10 10 miles on i95 throwing clumps of this what pulp out
[00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:39.820]   It is your we've collected we think all of the pulp it is your responsibility now to figure out how to reconstruct that document
[00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:45.260]   What happens when a company can say no we don't know how to do that? It is not possible for us to do that
[00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:47.980]   I
[00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:52.860]   Vatican two men we're going to need a it's it's it's going to be as as fundamental as saying
[00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:56.460]   Is it okay to do let do masses in english instead of laughing anymore? Right?
[00:41:56.460 --> 00:42:00.380]   I mean they're very interesting. Yeah, yeah, well
[00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:06.460]   I for one have downloaded and installed what's app. Uh, I encourage you all to do so
[00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:10.220]   Uh to find anything just saying them for and doing the right thing
[00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:14.300]   And the main reason that I don't use I mean I have what's up on my phone and the main reason that I don't
[00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:17.500]   Uh use it very often the the I guess for me
[00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:22.860]   I the irony of the whole thing is because it what's app is attached to a specific phone number and I have full devices
[00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:23.820]   Yeah, me too
[00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:27.980]   The funny thing is I attach it to my google voice number though that way I can have it on a bunch of devices
[00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:30.940]   Because I was just like you know that what kills me is is that I can't you know
[00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:35.580]   I put that in that you know because I'm in other countries and I use different phones in different countries and and
[00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:39.500]   And uh, and suddenly it's not available. You probably can't use google voice either then right?
[00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:42.620]   Yeah, so I use in roanda. I have a roanda phone
[00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:47.100]   You know and and so and everyone in roanda uses what's app so you can't talk to them any other way
[00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:49.260]   You're gonna text, you know, and so
[00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:52.860]   Like everybody like there's no I mean, you just can't talk to anyone
[00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:57.900]   Do you think facebook I mean it is phone by facebook then we'll use this as an opportunity not to encrypt messenger
[00:42:57.900 --> 00:43:01.420]   And say well look, you know, we give we give you the choice
[00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:03.420]   I don't think so
[00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:06.220]   Encrypt messenger. Yeah, I think they'll figure it out with what's happened in
[00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:10.700]   I would love it if they encrypted facebook and messenger and everything keep ever, you know
[00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:14.060]   I guess you can't they're not going to be able to do that with a facebook
[00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:16.860]   site
[00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:18.860]   Too late there
[00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:24.940]   Um, yeah, just messenger would be a big step forward believe it or not
[00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:30.620]   A credit swiss analyst says the market the stock market is undervaluing
[00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:35.020]   No
[00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:39.340]   The isn't it pretty highly valued right now, maybe not
[00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:41.420]   um
[00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:44.780]   Uh, according to uh called min dargaracha
[00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:52.300]   He says investors might be underestimating and under appreciating the growth potential of services like apple pay apple care
[00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:54.380]   That's the new one they announced
[00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:56.380]   apple music and icloud
[00:43:56.380 --> 00:44:03.900]   He estimates gross profit related to services has grown to about 14 and a half billion dollars
[00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:07.180]   It was three and a half in 2010
[00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:13.100]   And says that should double to nearly 34 billion by 2020
[00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:17.500]   The amount of all of us each of us spends on services
[00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:25.260]   He expects to skyrocket by 85 to 113 dollars a year. It's currently 61 bucks a year
[00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:28.380]   So yeah, okay. Maybe I pay Comcast more, but that's about it
[00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:33.180]   Um, and if apple were to for instance launch a tv service he says well
[00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:37.420]   Even more this would uh, this would increase apples
[00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:41.500]   share of this would increase the share of services
[00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:47.500]   Uh percentage of apples profit from which is currently 15 to a 30 percent
[00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:54.460]   Is it possible to like still not care about anything that a financial analyst says but also think that they happen to have some
[00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:59.180]   Yeah, no you always and you're really good about this point out that the financial analyst have a different
[00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:02.460]   Audience they're not journalists. They're they're talking to investors
[00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:05.740]   They're trying to figure out if it's worth buying the apple stock
[00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:11.100]   But they're told their custody they're told their clients a couple days ago to do something and not want to see what they can do to move it for
[00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:13.500]   But but gartia
[00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:15.260]   I think is not far off right?
[00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:20.140]   Well apple was very careful at the last conference called tim cook especially was very careful to position apple
[00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:22.700]   Uh, you know and look on my street as well as a services company
[00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:29.100]   Right because the narrative previous narrative about apple just being an iphone company was running thin as as there were less and less markets
[00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:32.220]   For them to conquer and they had to start getting into this more segmented approach
[00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:35.340]   So the service narrative the service's narrative is huge for them
[00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:41.180]   And I think apple is undervalued. You know, look at the price earnings ratio of a lot of other tech companies
[00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:44.940]   Some of them who have very little profit or a very little historical amazon
[00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:50.060]   Totally like amazon. I mean if apple had a similar price earnings ratio is amazon
[00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:52.540]   It I don't know what three trillion trillion dollar company
[00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:56.700]   Uh, so there is definite room just for investor confidence if nothing else to grow
[00:45:56.700 --> 00:46:01.340]   And I think the I think the number that was interesting in that article was the five I think it's 585
[00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:08.540]   million active users, um and almost a billion users and and more than half of them active
[00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:11.020]   Right and and uh
[00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:15.180]   A very large number of them being considered affluent, you know and so the thing is
[00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:18.860]   When you're trying to value a company that is, you know, it's not just everyone's using it
[00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:23.660]   It's people that spend money, you know that you know that and so I think that that's something that he outlined in the article
[00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:27.660]   And I think that that is part of what makes that value, you know as they roll out new services
[00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:29.420]   They already have a built-in
[00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:32.620]   clientele, um that uh is already interested in it
[00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:38.540]   That's a that's very good news for the company because at 40 years old. It's long in the tooth for a tech company
[00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:44.700]   Um, but everybody microsoft amazon, you know, microsoft is no longer an operating systems company
[00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:49.820]   It's a software as a service company amazon's no longer selling you know a merch at a store
[00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:53.900]   It's a software as a service this company google is no longer an advertising company
[00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:56.780]   It's a software as a services company though everybody's making this move
[00:46:56.780 --> 00:47:01.580]   We're trying to at least position themselves to make this move because that's the future, isn't it?
[00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:07.660]   Well an apple has this pro this historical problem with a coin flipper, uh, you know fallacy where everyone looks at apple and they say
[00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:10.220]   Well, they're doing well this year, but that just means they're gonna tank next year
[00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:13.500]   Oh, they didn't tank this year. They're gonna tank quite, you know twice as bad that you're after
[00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:17.340]   Oh, it's like watching a good gambler at vegas when he's just winning hand after hand
[00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:21.340]   And saying all the next one absolutely is gonna bust when the odds of each one is the same
[00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:22.780]   There's no real difference
[00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:25.260]   Uh and every year apple does something and they say well the next iphone
[00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:28.540]   That's gonna be the last one, but you can't judge things based on that
[00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:32.220]   Uh yet wall street is filled with human beings who really do want to judge things that way
[00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:33.740]   So it would be hooves apple
[00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:38.140]   To really change this narrative something that's much more easily understandable by them, but we have said
[00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:41.260]   Many times that apple sucks at services
[00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:49.020]   So what's the answer here? Is it is it true? Does apple have to get better at services? Are they good enough?
[00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:51.740]   It depends on definition like they've sucked at cloud infrastructure
[00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:56.780]   But like apple store provides phenomenal services and there's ways to parlay a lot of that and whether or not they say they
[00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:59.580]   So far apple pay has been a tremendously good service
[00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:03.180]   Which is not reliant as far as I know on some of the same things that maybe mobile me was
[00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:09.020]   Was reliant on so I think we have to break it down and look on a service by service basis is what they've been successful with
[00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:11.500]   Yeah a company at the scale of apple and google
[00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:16.540]   There's so many moving parts to it. They make money in so many different ways and not all of them are consumer visible
[00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:22.860]   So it's always fun to take a look at like if you're taking a look at amazon and saying oh god
[00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:24.860]   Look at it. Look what their profits are look at their money as well
[00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:28.540]   Actually, maybe they're making money off of their back end and off of their servers and it's on top of all that
[00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:33.340]   Google is gosh all their all their money is coming off of advertising what happens when people advertise someplace else
[00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:37.420]   Well, they're also like one of these immense and that's investment funds
[00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:41.980]   That basically is making money off of so many other industries and so many other companies
[00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:45.980]   Even apple it is always alarming when you look at that pie chart
[00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:50.780]   You see how big the pac-man of the iPhone is and wonder what happens if apple ever
[00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:56.460]   forgets why people like iPhones and doesn't come up with something new to replace it in time
[00:48:56.460 --> 00:49:02.940]   But they are now they are diversifying into so many different areas right now that it's hard to imagine a point in which
[00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:05.980]   How many years could they suck before they start to
[00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:08.700]   go to a
[00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:11.180]   Lesser quality of coffee in the free break room
[00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:17.340]   Is a touch to pay let's talk about apple pay and touch to pay in general is it really
[00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:23.420]   Huge or is it all about the future there's I have conflicting articles here
[00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:30.700]   This is one from the next web benwood's opinion piece saying real users don't care about apple pay and contactless
[00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:33.260]   mobile payments
[00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:35.260]   And he offers some statistics
[00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:40.860]   Well, but here but i've watched no and then here's the other article
[00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:45.900]   This is contactless payments surge five fold in the uk and apple pays about to come to the uk
[00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:47.420]   It's not even there right now
[00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:53.500]   And they're using the same stat they're saying half of all payments in the london underground or touch or contactless payments
[00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:55.900]   It's like it's amazing when I go to the u.s
[00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:57.660]   And I see people like there are a lot of people who cover it
[00:49:57.660 --> 00:50:02.700]   In the u.s and they say how horrible it is and the nightmares that they have and people don't know how to use the chips
[00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:06.620]   And it's slowing down cash registers and I don't even remember that time in canada
[00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:10.780]   All I know is that almost anything that I do I go in I tap a card and I leave like I
[00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:15.420]   Tap to pay that tim horton's coffee that I have here it took two seconds. I tapped it
[00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:19.100]   Another coffee shop someone was still trying to fish change out of their purse
[00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:23.580]   I got up ordered my coffee got it paid and left while they were still fishing for change and it
[00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:28.860]   I just never see anything else here and I forget what it was like but you're an early adopter
[00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:32.380]   So the question is will normal people your mom uses it? Okay?
[00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:37.260]   Yeah, like the only thing that we have here that's a problem is that we were so early we have a complete lack of
[00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:40.380]   Consistency amongst user interfaces for the terminals
[00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:43.660]   But tap eliminates all that because you never have to see the interface
[00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:47.500]   You just literally tap the card and go and when I was in south bay
[00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:51.180]   They had those little square terminals everywhere and I was just tapping everything in sight
[00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:53.340]   And again, it made the transaction seamless
[00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:57.660]   So I think that a lot of these might be looked at through the lens of of the very painful transition
[00:50:57.980 --> 00:51:03.500]   In america right now and aren't looking at what that economy looks like in canada or the uk or something
[00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:06.780]   That's five or ten years into this I thought by now in the u.s
[00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:09.820]   Because of the new rules from the credit card companies
[00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:12.460]   Putting the burden on the merchants for fraud
[00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:17.340]   We'd see tap to pay everywhere and and and it's still far from everywhere
[00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:21.420]   But you know, I've been you here's an interesting tidbit. I was at the airport
[00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:24.540]   Uh with my sam's song and so I use sam's
[00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:31.180]   A sam's song pay which is tap to pay if the if the terminals there and if it's still a swipe terminal
[00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:35.740]   You still tap and it magically magnetically tells it that you swipe to card
[00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:41.340]   And I was a little I had some trepidation about using it because I thought people are going to think i'm stealing from them or something
[00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:44.220]   Yeah, but because of sam's song's incredibly
[00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:51.020]   Preval and ads the first time I used it at the airport the guy said oh it really does work everywhere
[00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:56.460]   Just like the ads is and and then I've used it subsequently and everybody had seen the ad
[00:51:56.460 --> 00:51:59.100]   So it was it was actually really easy
[00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:02.780]   Maybe that might might have been why they had to run the ad is to make sure that exactly
[00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:06.460]   No, there was there was actually a really interesting article
[00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:12.060]   I'll see if I can find it in my in my history of someone who actually kind of was detained by store security
[00:52:12.060 --> 00:52:16.140]   You have the cops called on them because because she thought because
[00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:20.780]   Uh the way that it worked is she she held her phone near the reader it did it work
[00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:25.180]   And and basically told it and basically there's it was the receipts that was printed
[00:52:25.180 --> 00:52:29.020]   I would say okay, you paid to your to your master card, but the manager said no
[00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:30.940]   We know you're you're a hacker you had to you
[00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:31.740]   Oh lord
[00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:34.860]   Sort of mojo on the thing and we're not going to let you leave with our doo doo doo doo doo
[00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:37.500]   And the and even the cops like had to
[00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:42.860]   Have it explained to them that no no no no look here is a receipt that says that I paid for it with a manager saying no no look
[00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:45.420]   She suspiciously held her phone near the reader
[00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:52.460]   Exactly so and and I agree with you that's something that I all this stuff has to there's a there's a there's a trust
[00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:55.100]   fence that has to be climbed over that
[00:52:55.100 --> 00:53:00.860]   That android pay has gotten for me and that apple pay has gotten for me because I know the technology chips inside it
[00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:03.500]   That this really really super super hard encryption
[00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:08.060]   But there are a lot of people that are going to have problems in trusting that until the first time goes
[00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:11.580]   But the the missing link here is that this isn't something where
[00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:17.660]   A whole infrastructure has to be thrown away and upgraded in order to make these things happen
[00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:24.060]   Essentially it cost about as much for these pos manufacturers to put nfc into their readers as not
[00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:26.300]   Not this it's not a one-to-one
[00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:33.180]   But it's it doesn't cost them much to basically put the added hardware into basically and also a lot of their transactors are going to demand
[00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:36.780]   That their readers have the ability to do the most secure connections possible
[00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:42.540]   So it really is not that much that much of a difference. It's just that all of these things are going to be out there in terminals
[00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:47.180]   And then people are going to start to have phones that without having to really pay any extra for it
[00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:51.740]   Have phones that have nfc built into it and it's just a question of
[00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:57.180]   Training people to want to use it. I mean I will I will never be as a self deprecating
[00:53:57.180 --> 00:54:03.260]   But brutally honest thing about myself. I had android pay in my nexus five for like nine or ten months
[00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:07.420]   And had totally forgotten about it until apple pay came out and that's when I
[00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:10.620]   I wrote about it. I tested it and work. Okay, uh-huh
[00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:15.900]   But then I just forgot about it and it wasn't till apple pay that I reactivated what was then google wallet because oh
[00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:18.700]   That's right. I've been able to do this for ten months
[00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:20.780]   But I just totally forgotten that was a that was an ability
[00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:24.060]   I'm mocks sam sung pay when it first came out of the oh come on sam
[00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:29.420]   So who's gonna use that now I use it everywhere because there are lots of places still don't have tap to pay
[00:54:29.420 --> 00:54:32.860]   But I can use it everywhere and it's very it's easy isn't it?
[00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:35.580]   Funny for me because here my credit my normal credit card
[00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:38.380]   Here's my apple credit card and they all work the same for me because they all have that
[00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:40.940]   I don't know if you can see it, but they have this little you have a chip in there
[00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:43.660]   Yeah, there's a wave icon and that's an nfc
[00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:48.060]   So you just tap it and you leave and it was scary at first, but now everybody's super used to it
[00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:51.500]   It's just once it's once you're used to it. It is gonna. It's just the default
[00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:54.540]   I mean the watch still freaks people out when I pay with my watch like oh my god
[00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:57.900]   I've never seen a watch before that's amazing and then they get over really quick
[00:54:58.060 --> 00:55:01.420]   I swear to god, that's the only that's the only thing that I know that would make me
[00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:06.060]   Sometimes want to have like an apple watch on this race in addition to the android wear because
[00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:11.740]   The the times over the summer last year when I was especially going through an airport where everything takes tap to pay
[00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:14.060]   And I could get out of bed
[00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:15.500]   At at 6 a.m
[00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:17.500]   And checking at my hotel at 4 p.m
[00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:21.740]   And have bought all kinds of things and never taken my phone out of my pocket to do it once
[00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:24.780]   That is the sort of that that's what makes a fan out of some of you you
[00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:30.780]   You want to create those features that immediately and in a material way improve people's lives
[00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:32.220]   This is not
[00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:34.620]   Philosophical and it's not aspirational. It's like no
[00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:38.460]   How about instead of having to take out your wallet and take out your card to a swipe
[00:55:38.460 --> 00:55:44.140]   And how and worry about your your data being compromised you have this thing that's 100 percent better
[00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:45.660]   I just had to
[00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:50.140]   I got back from my trip to Yosemite and tried to book a hotel in dc for a wedding
[00:55:50.460 --> 00:55:56.940]   And it wouldn't go through and then called the bank and he said, oh, well, we canceled your card because your your number was involved in some sort of a
[00:55:56.940 --> 00:56:00.220]   Data breach three weeks ago and I had to wait four days to get a brand new one
[00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:06.460]   And this is why it's like we want something better than an embossed number on a mag strip because we need stuff
[00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:08.620]   This is that and hockey barriers just replaced itself
[00:56:08.620 --> 00:56:13.180]   He was out one day his his watch said new credit card arrived and he went and checked and said oh your old one was compromised
[00:56:13.180 --> 00:56:17.260]   We automatically pushed the new one to your watch and he knew he was on vacation never stopped spending
[00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:23.500]   The previous time with a Home Depot breach that happened automatically
[00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:26.940]   This time for some reason I had to be without a card for like three or four days
[00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:29.420]   Uh, and I had to now I have to manually
[00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:31.260]   manually
[00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:32.220]   Anyway
[00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:35.180]   Go for that once and you'll make a make a fan of life for tap to pay
[00:56:35.180 --> 00:56:38.460]   I want to by the way stand corrected. I guess I guess apple pay is in the UK
[00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:43.100]   But it's Barclays bank which for a long time wouldn't do it now has done it so
[00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:48.140]   Uh after nine months they finally gave in and the onion takes it which everyone says is fantastic
[00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:53.420]   The onion I think well the underground. Oh, well, they've had oyster cards there for a while
[00:56:53.420 --> 00:56:55.420]   I'm not onion oyster
[00:56:55.420 --> 00:56:57.660]   You've been the oyster
[00:56:57.660 --> 00:56:59.100]   Oh food
[00:56:59.100 --> 00:57:05.100]   And eventually we can be able to use you know instead of you just use your phone instead of using the pazmo card or the oyster card or the
[00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:07.260]   Well, that's right. Why do I know?
[00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:08.060]   Right, right?
[00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:11.900]   But but I think that one of the things that that they're talking about that I think would be very exciting is
[00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:14.940]   Peer-to-peer payments of being able to go apple pay to apple pay
[00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:17.900]   I want to give somebody a little bit of money. I want to give my daughter 20 bucks or something
[00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:21.420]   She's sitting there, you know being able to do that back and forth also, you know
[00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:26.620]   Trust with small businesses, you know being able to just buy stuff from them and not feel like you're giving a credit card
[00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:31.420]   You know over and then web web purchases where I don't have to get all that information from you
[00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:33.340]   I'm you know and the question is how you do that
[00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:37.020]   You know how you set up the web purchases it might be on mobile only at the beginning
[00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:41.980]   But what if I'm you know linked to my computer and I'm able to hold down on my phone and it tells the computer
[00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:43.260]   Go ahead and make that order
[00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:47.180]   And I think a lot of those things could reduce a lot of friction when it comes to purchasing
[00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:51.100]   I know that you know 90 percent of the time I order from Amazon because
[00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:56.860]   Partially because of prime and all those other things but a big reason is I don't want to fill all that stuff out again
[00:57:56.860 --> 00:57:59.580]   Like they have my credit card they have you know
[00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:02.940]   They have almost everything I need to order and I'm just too lazy to go try to figure it out again
[00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:05.740]   There's so many basic concepts that we
[00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:07.740]   That are
[00:58:07.740 --> 00:58:14.140]   Revolutionized by how good these little pocket supercomputers are and a lot of them require us to read it for to redefine our understanding
[00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:17.580]   I got a demo at uh from a Volvo engineer of their new keyless
[00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:22.620]   Entry system for their for their cars and I agree to the briefing because I've never
[00:58:22.620 --> 00:58:29.740]   It was I'll admit it at least 60 because I wanted an excuse to go to New York and get into the Hamilton lottery again
[00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:38.380]   Okay, okay, that's that's that's the secret if you if I were if I lived as close to New York as you I would do the same thing
[00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:41.900]   My my train ride home from the wedding is like I've taken the train
[00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:46.060]   Because I always take the train to anywhere DC or closer and I'm actually like
[00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:51.020]   I've actually scheduled the return one so that if I board the train now
[00:58:51.020 --> 00:58:56.460]   I can enter the lottery at 11 a.m. While I'm in transit and if I find out that I win at four
[00:58:56.460 --> 00:58:59.420]   I can still get off the train at New York and uh anyway
[00:58:59.420 --> 00:59:03.980]   But so so I'm getting the stem on ice because I assumed it was oh, okay
[00:59:03.980 --> 00:59:05.100]   so
[00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:11.180]   You approach with your phone and there's a secure transaction and so it knows that your phone is that your phone is your key or I tap my
[00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:14.620]   My phone on the door handle. No, it's this amazing infrastructure
[00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:20.620]   They've got so that you can essentially create and distribute digital keys that have rules attached to them
[00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:25.980]   So of course you can have your your phone be be a key. That's fine. That's that's easy
[00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:29.500]   But you can also if you're uh, if you've got a house guest
[00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:33.020]   And you're away at work and you commute it in and your house guess is okay
[00:59:33.020 --> 00:59:35.180]   Bar your car because I want to go out and run some errands
[00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:38.700]   You can create a burner key for them that goes on to their phone
[00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:45.260]   That will be that you can revoke at any time or you can create a key for your kids that only works from
[00:59:45.260 --> 00:59:47.660]   3 p.m. To 7 p.m
[00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:49.260]   And when it stops working
[00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:53.580]   It's not that they'll leave them stranded, but they will not be able to start the car again with that key if they decide to
[00:59:53.580 --> 00:59:57.020]   Go to stop at a somewhere at at 8 p.m
[00:59:57.020 --> 01:00:00.780]   And even the ability to manage like a fleet of corporate cars
[01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:06.540]   We can continue to create and revoke keys at at will that's such a it's such a mind freak
[01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:10.780]   When you are when you grew up with the idea of a key as a physical metal object
[01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:13.340]   You had to go to the hardware store to have duplicated
[01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:16.700]   The idea of creating something that's not only more secure than that but can be
[01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:23.500]   A malleable malleable object that has rules attached to it and you can just simply disintegrate at a whim
[01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:28.060]   That requires a real shift in your brain even no matter how wonderful this thing is
[01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:31.020]   Well, and and when you start realizing how much more secure it is
[01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:35.100]   I mean the idea that you have a bunch of these physical keys and you have to re-key it if you you know
[01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:42.540]   Let someone go that was scary, you know, and you know all of those things are are when you start rethinking all of that
[01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:46.140]   We're in the process that we know we were getting you know, we have a lot of locks right now
[01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:47.740]   We're gonna get
[01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:51.740]   You know, we're looking at passes with fobs and each one of those things is thousands of dollars
[01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:53.580]   I was like, we're just gonna do this with our phones
[01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:56.540]   I mean, I'm not gonna you know, I'm not gonna keep on you know going down that path
[01:00:56.540 --> 01:01:00.780]   Is there such a thing because in their studio we should do that so there is like touch you just do
[01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:05.580]   Security use yeah, there's definitely security where you can I mean you can do it even when you get close
[01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:07.980]   We're not looking at the outer door, which is a little bit more secure
[01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:11.660]   But once you get in deciding where you can get to in the office and so on so forth
[01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:13.660]   And there's a lot of lock systems that are already built now
[01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:16.380]   We're gonna we're actually replacing some of the doors with a couple of things
[01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:20.700]   And so when we do that we're gonna build it in and we're still trying to decide which lock we want to use
[01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:26.540]   Autumn makes one that that I've been playing with in my house and but there's a couple other solutions and and
[01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:30.700]   Yeah, we use fobs right now, but it'd be great. Just yeah, I'm done
[01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:33.980]   At first I thought I was gonna be done with keys by the end of this year and now I'm really
[01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:39.180]   I'm really focused on being done with like everything except for maybe my car. I'm gonna hang on hang
[01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:42.060]   Gonna get a Tesla. So I have to wait
[01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:47.980]   For you know 10 years to actually have a car. Did you did you uh get on that list? I haven't gone on list yet
[01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:50.700]   I soon like well forget it. It's too late now. It's like 300
[01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:54.940]   It would be number 300 thousand. I did it like I saw it in so I'm gonna be like three months later
[01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:56.940]   Did you do it? Did you do it? Absolutely
[01:01:56.940 --> 01:01:58.220]   Nice
[01:01:58.220 --> 01:02:02.300]   I I thought the number I was like, oh right. I was supposed to do that and then I then I saw the number and I was like
[01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:04.700]   It's probably easier to get a Hamilton ticket at this point
[01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:08.780]   Or easier to get a maw. Yeah, yeah, that's gonna be uh
[01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:13.500]   It's gonna be interesting. I would not I would not be uh, I would not be buying futures of oil right now
[01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:15.020]   That's all I can say
[01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:16.540]   Can I ask you a question though?
[01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:17.980]   Did you uh?
[01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:23.420]   Did you get that did you put down that thousand dollar deposit because you intend to buy a Tesla or
[01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:27.740]   Basically as a way to if you want to buy Tesla a year from now
[01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:31.500]   You'll be able to get one but still you'll be able to get your thousand bucks back if you
[01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:37.740]   Decide that you don't want one a year for I was thinking like in three or four years when I 20 20. Yeah. Yeah
[01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:39.980]   And by then I
[01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:44.860]   So close to putting down that deposit for that reason. No, that's a perfectly good reason. Yeah, but it's like
[01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:49.180]   I mean when you think about it, that's the problem. They have your thousand
[01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:53.900]   Does Elon does Elon must need an interest free loan from a freelance journalist? That's all I was asking
[01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:57.260]   Great. Just kickstarter in history. Hey when I put when I ordered the x
[01:02:57.260 --> 01:03:02.140]   Uh, that was even though it was five thousand that that kind of was the idea was well
[01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:06.940]   I guess I can get it back if I don't want it because it is refundable right up to the point where they start making it
[01:03:06.940 --> 01:03:11.660]   Well, I mean if you look at it, you can you can actually you can put your thousand dollars down and go through an entire
[01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:15.420]   Other lease with a whole another car. Right and then get your new car
[01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:21.500]   I just want to know if I can trade it in for my apple car in five years or just the the deposit maybe
[01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:26.620]   You know the thing that's kind of interesting about the model one and model three and tests and uh,
[01:03:26.620 --> 01:03:32.860]   Elan's tweets have kind of indicated this it's kind of very weird dashboard. There is no dashboard. There's no speedometer
[01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:34.860]   There's no controls. It's all on one
[01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:38.780]   computer one 15 inch computer screen in the middle of the dash
[01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:44.380]   And the and a number have people have including uh, uh, um
[01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:49.180]   I'm gonna say I sweezy again. I don't mind him stevens
[01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:51.900]   Uh of the roadshow. Uh, calm
[01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:57.740]   On twit this uh sunday said he thinks it might be that this will be a fully autonomous vehicle
[01:03:57.740 --> 01:04:02.300]   He said about the x right that the x was really ideal. Yes has the capability
[01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:05.340]   Yeah, but I think that maybe he's thinking by 20
[01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:08.620]   You know 18 or 19 when you get your model three
[01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:13.100]   It might be time for fully autonomous. I don't know if it I don't know if it needs to be fully autonomous
[01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:15.100]   I don't know if I'd want to buy a car that was fully autonomous
[01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:20.700]   But I do like the idea that the the driver or whatever would you buy a car that had no speedometer?
[01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:23.260]   There's no gauges
[01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:25.340]   Did you look at the dashboard?
[01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:27.340]   That's green can hold a gate
[01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:28.940]   But it's over there
[01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:35.340]   I know but you don't need to know it every at every moment and I think that but I think that specifically the the issue is is that um
[01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:39.660]   What what i'm really interested in is i'm i'll drive the country roads. I'll drive all
[01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:43.260]   I don't need you to figure that out what I really just wanted to it's once I get on the highway and again
[01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:48.700]   You know, I just want you to just figure this out and I'm gonna go back to tweeting, you know or texting or whatever
[01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:50.620]   The VR is all around you
[01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:54.380]   Exactly. I'm gonna put a VR goggles on and you tell me when I get to when I need to pick up the you know
[01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:55.100]   The drive again
[01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:58.940]   But but the point is is that I think that it is and you talk to most of these engineers
[01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:01.660]   They'll tell you that it's the last it's getting off the highway
[01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:04.780]   It's the high most of them will tell you the highway is very easy to manage
[01:05:04.780 --> 01:05:07.900]   You know, you know as far as you know how the how that system works
[01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:11.500]   It's it's all the side streets and it's all the things that can happen with pedestrians
[01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:12.460]   And it's all the levels
[01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:14.300]   You know those are the things that make it really complicated
[01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:18.620]   And so I think that that it's much faster to market to have something that you can control
[01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:22.140]   Um and then and I think google is swallowing a lot
[01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:24.700]   I mean, you know to do to try to take it take it all on
[01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:30.940]   And i'm not that I think that's gonna be a harder sell to the consumer that i'm never going to be able to actually grab onto the steering wheel that
[01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:32.540]   That uh
[01:05:32.540 --> 01:05:34.540]   Well, there's even me
[01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:36.940]   We can get there incrementally though
[01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:41.180]   Fortunately, I haven't I haven't had to have a on godly highway commute
[01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:47.020]   But there was a a year and a half where I had to drive like an hour hour and a half two and back in
[01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:52.060]   Total of three hours a day like three to five times a week to visit somebody
[01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:57.260]   And that was boy again to that place where my brain is home
[01:05:57.260 --> 01:06:01.500]   But my body and my car are still 38 minutes away from my driveway
[01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:02.460]   This is bad
[01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:03.980]   And if I if there were I would buy
[01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:06.460]   If I were in that position where I had that kind of commute
[01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:10.860]   I would buy a car that could only do that only worked on highways where if you could just simply say
[01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:13.420]   Okay, now that we're on the highway and at speed
[01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:18.700]   Please take over keep me in my lane keep me from getting to an accident and then alert me
[01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:24.700]   When we're 10 miles or five miles from my exit, which is the point where I will take over and do the do all the local driving
[01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:31.340]   Even if even just in a way if if we knew that if we had one lane, let's say a dedicated lane that was just for autonomous vehicles
[01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:33.980]   where everybody in this lane is
[01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:37.580]   Not a jerk. They're not drunk. They're not angry
[01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:42.060]   And they're not they don't take it personally that someone is two car links ahead of them
[01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:44.460]   I think that would be the fastest moving lane
[01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:49.500]   Well, and I think that I think that I think at some point I think when I I think I talked about this in a couple episodes ago
[01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:52.460]   Where you know that they're gonna eventually want cars to drive themselves
[01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:56.780]   Managed as a mandatory thing because I think on the size three cell take a long time
[01:06:56.780 --> 01:07:00.780]   But I could definitely see a point on a highway where you can't enter certain highways without being
[01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:05.340]   That's probably how economists act up. Yeah, you know like you can't enter this highway without being
[01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:09.260]   Uh, you know, there's some highways right now that you can't get on if you don't have a fast track
[01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:13.580]   You know in some in some had a autonomous vehicle expert. I think it was I can remember who it was
[01:07:13.580 --> 01:07:19.340]   But uh on the new screen savers who said where you're gonna see it first is in the highly congested downtown areas
[01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:22.140]   They already have no drive zones in many big cities, right?
[01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:27.980]   And uh, so what you'll do is you'll get to the perimeter of the no drive zone in manhattan or san francisco
[01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:32.540]   And you'll just get into a uber autonomous vehicle to get the rest of the way
[01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:40.540]   I honestly believe that the next important revolution is to make it as hard and inconvenient and as expensive
[01:07:40.540 --> 01:07:45.500]   As possible to drive a car in the city. It's already happened. Have you not been to the city?
[01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:50.060]   I know i'm i'm serious you have no, no exactly me. It's obvious. It's like almost
[01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:55.660]   Even as a cloud i would do almost i would do almost anything to avoid having to drive
[01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:59.420]   Yeah, it's horrible, but the thing is you have to make you have to basically
[01:07:59.420 --> 01:08:05.500]   convince people that the only reason why i'm going to take a car into this really congested area is because there is
[01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:07.900]   Absolutely no alternative and it's definitely worth it
[01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:13.260]   And you have of course have to back that up by saying that we're going to make sure we we give you the best public transportation
[01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:19.500]   Network that exists to make sure that you wouldn't even want to even if they're even if it were only the the second circle of hell
[01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:23.580]   And not the sixth circle of hell driving into into boston. We're going to make it so that well
[01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:28.220]   Why would you want to do that? I'm feeling that myself where it's like when i've first moved here
[01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:31.900]   Which was not it's not far away from boston that i've ever lived
[01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:35.500]   But uh, it was i would have to drive like about 45
[01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:39.580]   If i had a meeting in town after drive like 45 to 50 minutes to pick up a train someplace else
[01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:42.860]   And then the commuter rail extended a couple of stops
[01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:49.660]   And now i could do that same thing i'd much rather rearrange my entire day so that my commute can consist of
[01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:55.100]   A 45 minute walk or 20 minute bike ride to commune a rail and then i do nothing for an hour
[01:08:55.100 --> 01:08:58.780]   It's better. I don't care if it's cheaper. I don't care if it's better for the environment
[01:08:58.780 --> 01:09:02.300]   It's i just like it more even if it takes even a little bit more time to do it
[01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:04.540]   That's how that's the next revolution not figure out
[01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:10.220]   Whether you get more cars in and out of the city but to remove parking spaces and turn
[01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:17.180]   Two lanes in the middle of a city to one lane of cars and a green lane for pedestrians wheel vehicles and electric vehicles less than 20 miles an hour
[01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:21.340]   Make it so compelling to not drive that people will prefer to not drive
[01:09:21.340 --> 01:09:25.580]   When we're doing when we're training people to do 3d for instance, or you know 3d production actual, you know
[01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:27.740]   animation and so and so forth
[01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:31.980]   One of the things we have to just beat into them and it often takes you know almost physical beating
[01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:36.380]   Is is that uh, it doesn't matter how long it takes as long as you're not there
[01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:38.140]   You're not doing it
[01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:38.940]   You know, you know
[01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:43.660]   So the thing is is that you you know you you do all the things you want to be everything should be very interactive and very easy
[01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:46.620]   You should keep your texture map small and your render small and everything else
[01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:50.220]   So that you can move quickly and iterate and then when you go home at night
[01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:54.140]   I don't care if it takes 12 hours or we can run it on 40 computers and have it done tomorrow or whatever
[01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:59.820]   But the point is is that you know, I don't care how long my trip to san francisco is is if I don't if i'm not fully dedicated to it
[01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:01.820]   And I think that that's what people really care about
[01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:06.380]   That's that's why i'm taking that's why i'm taking uh, there's dc is the is the
[01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:13.420]   Border between my flying and taking the terrain because actually I can get there's a regional airport that
[01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:18.300]   Has direct flights and it actually will take me three hours longer to get there
[01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:23.820]   But it's the difference between do I want to sit in a comfortable train for six hours and walk around
[01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:29.900]   Have have had my notebook have have internet access get a snack whenever I want it or do I want to have the
[01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:36.060]   Hour and a half two hour flight bookended by an hour of crap that I don't want to have to deal with that's
[01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:40.300]   Quality of experience counts that entire corridor
[01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:47.100]   Is I you know anything from boston to dc any of those cities in between i'm only going to use the train because it's it's so great
[01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:49.180]   And for some reason i've really gotten a taste for those little burgers
[01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:54.940]   You got to put it you got to put the you got to put the infrastructure there people will use it and the and the funny thing is
[01:10:54.940 --> 01:11:02.140]   Uh, where uh, you see more people on a bicycle or on foot as you're driving past them
[01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:07.980]   You then takes you take it into your mind that wow it is possible to actually run a bicycle
[01:11:07.980 --> 01:11:13.820]   I see someone who is just as middle aged and lumpy in out of shape as I am who was on a bicycle and they don't appear to be
[01:11:13.820 --> 01:11:19.660]   Dying and little kids don't appear to be like chasing them and throwing bruise apples at them and making fun of them
[01:11:19.660 --> 01:11:25.420]   Maybe I should try writing a bicycle sometime again put it out there and that that's that's why I keep saying that
[01:11:25.420 --> 01:11:31.740]   I don't think that I would be disappointed if all apple did with the electric vehicles was they have made their own electric car
[01:11:31.740 --> 01:11:33.820]   That's not a big idea. That's an obvious idea
[01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:36.860]   And that's just basically entering into a market with a lot of different people
[01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:44.140]   I want them to create a solution that solves a problem like again creating a thousand dollar or fifteen hundred dollar electric bicycle
[01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:48.860]   That's so cool that everybody will want to get this instead of a second car
[01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:52.780]   Instead of making a bicycle for the mind. They can make it a bicycle for your ass
[01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:56.220]   Exactly in once we all we did that. I would get a million
[01:11:56.220 --> 01:11:58.780]   wheels for your ass
[01:11:58.780 --> 01:12:02.300]   Now perfect perfect now the apple is 40
[01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:05.900]   We're getting old and lumpy too
[01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:10.220]   We want it. We're happy with the time we spent trying to change the world and
[01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:12.940]   People
[01:12:12.940 --> 01:12:15.340]   We just want to make a bike now
[01:12:15.340 --> 01:12:18.460]   Fills for the ass. I'm making a tricycle actually
[01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:20.460]   Is why i would have to make this available
[01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:28.540]   Let's take a break. We're going to come back with more. I have a new video from duncanson felt he is field
[01:12:28.540 --> 01:12:30.700]   He is the guy who has been slowly
[01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:33.420]   videoing the building of the apple campus every month
[01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:36.940]   A new video every month a more major production this time
[01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:40.860]   Not only 4k, but tim cook makes an appearance. It's gotten crazy
[01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:42.540]   Well
[01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:44.780]   Running outside shaking a broom stop
[01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:47.180]   Go away with your drone you kids
[01:12:47.180 --> 01:12:49.180]   You deploy the anti-drone's
[01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:53.580]   Drone defenses waving a bro say all right kids. I warned you you're not getting this frisbee back
[01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:58.140]   You play ball in your own neighborhood. You kids
[01:12:58.140 --> 01:13:00.940]   Get off of my campus
[01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:05.500]   Our show today brought to you by wealth front someday you're going to be an old koot like me
[01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:12.780]   And when you get there, you're going to be glad you put some money aside for the long term doing a little savings for your retirement
[01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:19.740]   The kids college fun. Maybe a down payment on a house. You know there's lots of stuff you you should be saving for at least for a rainy day
[01:13:19.740 --> 01:13:20.940]   You know
[01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:24.620]   And uh, but the question is well, how do you do that? Do you gonna you're gonna put it in your mattress? No?
[01:13:24.620 --> 01:13:27.020]   Of course you're not gonna do that are you gonna um
[01:13:27.020 --> 01:13:30.460]   I don't know put it in the savings account or a cd I
[01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:37.260]   If you looked at rates lately, it almost seems like you're paying them for the privilege of using the bank
[01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:42.460]   All right, well, I think investing right. That's the way to make money nowadays
[01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:45.980]   You got to put money in the in the market in the bonds and to stocks
[01:13:45.980 --> 01:13:48.780]   well
[01:13:48.780 --> 01:13:49.500]   Ah
[01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:52.780]   That's tricky because if you're gonna do it right you gotta read a lot and study it up
[01:13:52.780 --> 01:13:54.540]   And and I did that I read all the books
[01:13:54.540 --> 01:13:58.780]   I read the random walk down wall street bert and malkeel so classic and
[01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:03.660]   Charles de ellis's investors guy and you know there's lots of great stuff out there
[01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:07.180]   You study it all up like that the winning the losers game, but
[01:14:07.180 --> 01:14:15.420]   It's not just reading those books and buying the right stuff to start with then you have to monitor it and continually rebalance it and think about it
[01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:21.900]   You know 10 years later. I kind of looked at my investments. I went. Oh, I probably should have paid closer attention to them
[01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:26.540]   Oh, okay. I got it. I got it. We're gonna go out. We're gonna get a pro. We're gonna get an expert to this
[01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:29.660]   We're gonna go down the street and get a stock advisor
[01:14:29.660 --> 01:14:36.940]   You know how much you pay those guys the financial advisors between one and three percent of what they manage every year
[01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:41.180]   That means you would have to make three percent more to break even
[01:14:41.180 --> 01:14:44.140]   And that is not easy
[01:14:44.140 --> 01:14:46.620]   So this is what I want you to do take a look at wealth front
[01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:51.740]   This is really a good idea those guys. I mentioned charles ellis and bert and malkeel
[01:14:51.740 --> 01:14:55.260]   They're on the they're on the advisory board. They help put the software together
[01:14:55.660 --> 01:15:01.740]   Yeah, it's software that keeps an eye on your account not just you know every every three months when you come visit
[01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:04.380]   but all the time every minute of every day
[01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:10.940]   They rebalance they they they they're they're based on this is based on um
[01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:18.380]   not only the best investment practices and no bell prize winning academic research, but
[01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:22.060]   You got to read about this because it's a very sophisticated
[01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:26.860]   Stuff I can't remember where they call it. There's up. There's a name for this
[01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:34.620]   Um, but all of this costs you so little because it's a computer what a computer doesn't need much a one quarter of one percent a year
[01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:40.220]   Nothing and never any additional charges for transactions or hidden fees
[01:15:40.220 --> 01:15:44.060]   They've got a new thing you can go there right now. This I would do this anyway
[01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:49.180]   Go to wealthfront.com/macbreak and do the portfolio review show them what you're investing in right now
[01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:54.540]   Uh and see how you know what they think how diversified it is what you're losing to fees
[01:15:54.540 --> 01:15:56.060]   That's an eye opener
[01:15:56.060 --> 01:16:01.260]   Minimize your taxes if you decide to invest and by the way, I want you to read this all and you know
[01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:06.140]   You've heard the disclaimers read before investing, but I really think that's true. You want to understand what they're doing
[01:16:06.140 --> 01:16:09.580]   Uh, but you can get started with as little as $500
[01:16:09.580 --> 01:16:14.300]   And they're doing something really nice for mac break listeners if you sign up to invest
[01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:22.700]   At wealthfront.com/macbreak they're going to manage your first 15 thousand dollars free of charge forever
[01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:24.780]   Not one quarter of one percent, but zero
[01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:27.740]   wealthfront.com/mac
[01:16:27.740 --> 01:16:33.020]   Break i've heard from so many of you who've heard the ads who've tried it and who are really happy i
[01:16:33.020 --> 01:16:36.540]   I really think you got to try it se
[01:16:36.540 --> 01:16:39.340]   You're going to say oh, well leo are using it. I can't
[01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:47.180]   SEC regulations prohibit customers from doing testimonials on advertisements for products like this
[01:16:47.180 --> 01:16:49.500]   So I would be
[01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:57.020]   So they told us you can't do it wealthfront.com/macbreak your free portfolio analysis waiting for you
[01:16:57.020 --> 01:16:58.700]   and
[01:16:58.700 --> 01:17:00.700]   a great deal
[01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:03.420]   For your future you'll be an old koot like me someday soon
[01:17:03.420 --> 01:17:07.820]   And you can look back and thank your your present day self and say
[01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:10.940]   Young me you were smart
[01:17:10.940 --> 01:17:18.060]   You did a good thing wealthfront.com/macbreak there was an article in the journal just a couple of weeks ago
[01:17:18.060 --> 01:17:20.140]   I I noted that said that
[01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:23.020]   human investment advisors are terrified
[01:17:23.020 --> 01:17:28.540]   Because these the computers do so much frankly they do so much of a better job, but it's like whoa
[01:17:28.540 --> 01:17:31.500]   They can win it go if they can win a chest
[01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:34.220]   Right. This is easy compared to go
[01:17:34.860 --> 01:17:38.060]   Yeah, that gets back to what we were talking about earlier when when when we were all
[01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:41.580]   Kids just entering the workforce that was it was a big
[01:17:41.580 --> 01:17:45.580]   You have to go inside a bank and you have to do a really grown-up thing
[01:17:45.580 --> 01:17:51.100]   Which is to start an investment strategy at age 19 or age 20 and planning it a set you don't have a suit
[01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:56.780]   You don't have a tie it's so intimidating as opposed to like if I were if I were young now and just oh, I
[01:17:56.780 --> 01:18:02.380]   I heard I saw and recommended this thing on reddit or I saw this mad and just wall screw around that gee I got
[01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:08.300]   My my my my ski trip just got canceled. I got a hundred four hundred dollars that I don't know what to do with
[01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:12.300]   Let's see what happens with this boy. I would have I would have started planning so much
[01:18:12.300 --> 01:18:16.540]   I know there's a lot and you could do a lot do it on your phone. You don't even have to
[01:18:16.540 --> 01:18:19.020]   I have to sit down
[01:18:19.020 --> 01:18:23.100]   Do it in the subway even even just the banking app on my phone. I became I was not this
[01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:25.100]   I don't like banking. I don't like
[01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:30.940]   Numbers I don't like this sort of thing and it wasn't until like I had the ability to simply on the at the drop of a hat
[01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:33.420]   Check my balances and move money around and do stuff like that
[01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:36.940]   That really was checking my accounts like at least once a day
[01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:42.220]   It used to be at the worst once a month when I opened up all those envelopes that I hate to open
[01:18:42.220 --> 01:18:48.380]   So, you just love we talk about microprocessors. We talk about and nanometers
[01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:54.460]   We talk about devices, but it really is these little changes in the way that big things can be handled
[01:18:54.460 --> 01:18:56.780]   That is the real revolution
[01:18:56.780 --> 01:19:00.300]   Let's watch Duncan Sinfeld. He's added again post these every month
[01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:04.460]   Apple campus too. This is the april 2016 update
[01:19:04.460 --> 01:19:09.420]   And for sialtron the music too for some reason he's decided to include Tim Cooks
[01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:14.300]   It's something that apple had talking about the campus for over 40 years
[01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:19.740]   Is this from the most recent event? Probably it is last product introduction
[01:19:19.740 --> 01:19:23.020]   In the town hall that you're sitting in today
[01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:27.580]   We've had a lot of important announcements. Feel free to take a seat with you
[01:19:29.900 --> 01:19:31.900]   This is like a hoop concert
[01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:38.380]   Yeah, that room has a lot of history
[01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:41.260]   The ipod socks
[01:19:41.260 --> 01:19:48.380]   Next year in 2017 we're looking forward to moving
[01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:53.180]   So I that's by the way
[01:19:53.180 --> 01:19:56.540]   That means the ipon 7 announcement will still be somewhere else, right?
[01:19:57.260 --> 01:20:02.780]   Yeah, they need a big venue. Yeah, although this one's coming along this uh this uh town hall
[01:20:02.780 --> 01:20:05.740]   They've got the roof on now looks pretty doesn't it?
[01:20:05.740 --> 01:20:08.300]   Although that's interesting. I maybe I should correct myself
[01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:12.460]   Maybe wouldn't be interesting if they decided we're gonna complete the hall right first
[01:20:12.460 --> 01:20:16.460]   Right, especially because you would expect it to be not quite so deep inside
[01:20:16.460 --> 01:20:20.460]   That would be interesting the roof is on and what better way to kind of
[01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:23.660]   Showcase the progress they're making on the campus
[01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:28.620]   Then to have a bunch of journalists come and and as far as I could tell it's close to the road
[01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:31.020]   I mean, it's not not like you have to drive through this. Yeah
[01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:37.820]   To get there look at that all the underground uh parking they don't want to get any journalists on them while they're building lio
[01:20:37.820 --> 01:20:39.260]   No
[01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:40.060]   Yeah
[01:20:40.060 --> 01:20:44.300]   There I all I gotta say is you watch this and you're just like this is gonna be the coolest place
[01:20:44.300 --> 01:20:45.900]   I know
[01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:53.180]   Well this and then and then the new gig effectory that tesla's building which is the what did you learn must say the largest freestanding building in the world
[01:20:53.660 --> 01:20:54.620]   Yeah
[01:20:54.620 --> 01:20:58.860]   Mean amazing. Have you any have you seen the googles like new campus where it's just
[01:20:58.860 --> 01:21:03.820]   It's like a establishing shot in a movie that's set in 21
[01:21:03.820 --> 01:21:04.540]   17
[01:21:04.540 --> 01:21:10.140]   Like we have to aggressively point out you see you see how no buildings today look even remotely like that
[01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:12.060]   It would be impractical to have anything
[01:21:12.060 --> 01:21:14.700]   Yeah, although google got cut back, you know the city of mountain view
[01:21:14.700 --> 01:21:20.140]   Cut them way back. So google's ambitions are a little bit less
[01:21:20.700 --> 01:21:26.060]   Only on earth lio the orbital station is tiny. I know I know you now know why larry page wants an island
[01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:31.420]   There's so this is the this is the he's doing more before and after now. This is october
[01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:33.420]   This is the theater, but the lids on that now
[01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:37.980]   Uh, you see the theater's underground and the around part is the lobby
[01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:41.420]   Uh, which gives you apparently a 360
[01:21:41.420 --> 01:21:46.220]   It's like an apple store in a big big staircase that you go down into the theater
[01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:50.380]   And I got a really start to kiss ass over at apple
[01:21:50.380 --> 01:21:57.020]   I will I was I was thinking I was thinking more like I want my first exposure to this to be like visiting a friend there
[01:21:57.020 --> 01:22:02.220]   Because if it's an event I will actually have like 81 hours of work to do in four hours of time
[01:22:02.220 --> 01:22:06.060]   I was I was every time I've been there. I've been lucky to just have like 10 minutes in the store
[01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:11.580]   I want to just have nothing to do but to walk around and try to look as appily as possible so that they don't
[01:22:11.580 --> 01:22:14.460]   You theory is getting out of here
[01:22:14.460 --> 01:22:18.380]   Find the mario car track that I know is at the bottom of that loop actually, you know, so
[01:22:18.380 --> 01:22:20.540]   I've
[01:22:20.540 --> 01:22:22.540]   I've been in the apple campus numbers of times
[01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:27.260]   After my whatever that is that I know it get invitations anymore
[01:22:27.260 --> 01:22:29.660]   um and uh
[01:22:29.660 --> 01:22:32.940]   Because the idea I met with the itunes people they love us steve high
[01:22:32.940 --> 01:22:36.780]   Um, and so I probably can get I probably can get down there somehow
[01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:42.460]   Leo did you see the uh report last week from new york times about google and apple being the hi tech hippies of the silicon?
[01:22:43.260 --> 01:22:46.060]   Yeah, not silicon let's get it right silicon
[01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:55.180]   They're they're not they're not made of rubber talking about all the construction projects. They're doing yeah, but see it's it's unfortunate because
[01:22:55.180 --> 01:23:00.540]   That is not what the google campus is going to end up looking like now because mountain view shut them down
[01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:05.820]   There's still only going to be one building the the tent's not going to be quite the same didn't hpc
[01:23:05.820 --> 01:23:07.820]   They're going to make a much thinner building
[01:23:11.740 --> 01:23:14.700]   Actually, I really did you see I sent this to you jason
[01:23:14.700 --> 01:23:19.260]   Clanthes because I I know you're in the market for a windows pc shame on you. I know
[01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:28.700]   But hp just announced a new laptop that is um kind of pretty is very pretty it's really it's thinner than anything else
[01:23:28.700 --> 01:23:31.500]   They say now the world's thinnest laptop and it's coppery
[01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:35.100]   On the only thing wrong you have to run windows 10 on it
[01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:41.500]   And it's like 1,300 bucks all of us that you need an ex you need an external pullout antenna to get through the copper shielding
[01:23:42.460 --> 01:23:46.860]   So they only copper that part that little back this is very much a apple
[01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:51.340]   Video that they're showing and by the way, totally a macbook ripoff
[01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:54.300]   notebook that we've ever made
[01:23:54.300 --> 01:23:58.140]   A marriage
[01:23:58.140 --> 01:24:01.020]   Engineering you need a guy with an english accent if you're gonna say that
[01:24:01.020 --> 01:24:08.380]   Jamme the word chamfer chamfer. I do like the hinges. Yeah, and notice by the way type c ports real
[01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:11.820]   Three of all great and chocolate three
[01:24:11.820 --> 01:24:19.580]   We had a new team member join i'more yesterday michael gartenberg previously of apple and he did one of his first articles on
[01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:25.340]   Competing with apple and you see you know apple often does really great design and they figure out what the product needs in battery life
[01:24:25.340 --> 01:24:26.940]   Is it a good size?
[01:24:26.940 --> 01:24:30.860]   Uh, and is it you know what what the competitors tend to focus on one dimension?
[01:24:30.860 --> 01:24:35.420]   So you're going after apple on thinnest, but is that the thing that people care most about and what are you sacrificing?
[01:24:35.660 --> 01:24:41.980]   To get there. Yeah, that's pretty it's it's hard. It's hard to compare the two though because remember that apple is
[01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:46.780]   Only apple is the only manufacturer of these devices. They don't compete with anybody
[01:24:46.780 --> 01:24:49.660]   And anytime hp makes a line of notebooks
[01:24:49.660 --> 01:24:53.020]   They have to basically make every notebook that everybody could possibly want
[01:24:53.020 --> 01:24:58.060]   Other people who there you gotta you gotta make a specter line of notebooks for people who want
[01:24:58.060 --> 01:25:03.980]   To have a really great notebook to carry into a meeting that bespeaks their authority and their position without the company
[01:25:04.220 --> 01:25:07.260]   But then you also need to make the blister pack of 12
[01:25:07.260 --> 01:25:11.580]   They've got that costs four hundred fifty dollars, but can still run all the apps that need to be run
[01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:14.940]   How did they get the spectrum license before james bond did
[01:25:14.940 --> 01:25:19.740]   They were doing specter. They've been making specters forever. They're just doesn't have touch
[01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:25.580]   It's not a touch screen side firing speakers, which I like you know the stereo
[01:25:25.580 --> 01:25:29.900]   I like I like the specter twice. I've had a couple of them in for review and
[01:25:30.380 --> 01:25:34.380]   Uh, they were not enough to make me sway from apple from from
[01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:36.700]   For none, but nonetheless
[01:25:36.700 --> 01:25:42.620]   It's like if this is if I wanted to if I ever had to move to windows and I wanted the most macbook like experience
[01:25:42.620 --> 01:25:45.820]   This would be close to it. Although they
[01:25:45.820 --> 01:25:47.580]   Make some nice too
[01:25:47.580 --> 01:25:48.220]   There was it well
[01:25:48.220 --> 01:25:54.540]   They made a dumb mistake one of their earlier ones like a year or two ago where they had a was it a caps lock key or a power key or
[01:25:55.020 --> 01:26:00.860]   No, it was the light on the keyboard. I think for the backlighting that was like to show you that the backlighting is off
[01:26:00.860 --> 01:26:04.780]   But if you want the backlighting on here, it is but it was so piercingly bright
[01:26:04.780 --> 01:26:12.460]   That it would just that they actually had they actually had to release I think it was actually a firmware update to give people the ability to disable it
[01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:14.700]   Because it was like
[01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:20.060]   I think I still have del and Lenovo on timeout for their man in the middle attacks on their own users
[01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:22.060]   I think I agree safe one for me to buy
[01:26:22.300 --> 01:26:26.060]   You know HP is famous for junking them up, but I'll junk them up
[01:26:26.060 --> 01:26:31.020]   You just get your get your windows 10 disk and reinstall everything
[01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:35.980]   Or better yet, it's be a nice Linux machine. Hey, what?
[01:26:35.980 --> 01:26:40.460]   Gentoo, no go pat and freely. Oh, no, I have to say, you know, I um
[01:26:40.460 --> 01:26:47.820]   Romeo, I'm far. I'm actually nowadays there you know, we always make a joke about Linux on the desktop
[01:26:48.540 --> 01:26:53.820]   But you know, it's pretty good even though they're adding the bash shell to windows, which is bizarre
[01:26:53.820 --> 01:26:57.740]   Did we talk about the safari early access thing? They'll release last week. Well, you can get purple
[01:26:57.740 --> 01:27:02.220]   So you previously you could get the web kit nightly bills, but that was not you know for normal people
[01:27:02.220 --> 01:27:05.340]   That would you know, you had to really want those to go and install them and put up with bugs
[01:27:05.340 --> 01:27:09.420]   But now they have an early access program to use safari features and I forget the exact name
[01:27:09.420 --> 01:27:15.260]   But you basically get a purple safari icon on your dock and it gives you whatever they're working on for the next version of safari
[01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:20.380]   Is like the public beta program as you can get the latest greatest web. Can you have to be a developer?
[01:27:20.380 --> 01:27:24.540]   To do that. No, I believe it's totally open. I mean they they they made a very public page for it
[01:27:24.540 --> 01:27:30.620]   And it's I love when they do this because the web really is you know, the most communal of things and apple
[01:27:30.620 --> 01:27:34.780]   Hasn't always gotten things out as fast as some of the other people like the community would like yeah
[01:27:34.780 --> 01:27:36.940]   It's like samuel jacks and purpose
[01:27:36.940 --> 01:27:40.700]   Safari technology per preview. This is it. All right
[01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:45.340]   Um, and you just download it. Well, heck, you know, I don't mind being on the bleeding edge
[01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:48.940]   And you can update it through the app store, which makes it really easy for like normal people
[01:27:48.940 --> 01:27:52.060]   Yeah, I like that
[01:27:52.060 --> 01:27:56.620]   Yeah, I mean google's done this for ages. They actually google has three levels of chrome you have can get
[01:27:56.620 --> 01:27:58.620]   chrome
[01:27:58.620 --> 01:28:01.100]   Chrome chrome beta and then chrome what they call canary
[01:28:01.100 --> 01:28:03.980]   Which is like really early
[01:28:03.980 --> 01:28:06.700]   Release, I think that's you can still get web kit nightlies
[01:28:06.700 --> 01:28:11.260]   But if you want something a little bit friendly or you can get that how do you get web kit nightlies? Do you have to uh?
[01:28:11.260 --> 01:28:14.700]   Webkit org, okay, so you have to get those like from the website and
[01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:16.860]   Yeah
[01:28:16.860 --> 01:28:21.900]   Also, I also want to point out that like uh if you linux is an option but chromium is also a really good option
[01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:26.220]   the uh just like with android google releases binaries
[01:28:26.220 --> 01:28:32.380]   Excuse me source source files for the chromium operating system the stuff they run on chromebooks
[01:28:32.380 --> 01:28:35.580]   And why would you why would you want to turn like a $2,000
[01:28:35.580 --> 01:28:40.940]   MacBook into a chromebook, but if you have a macbook that's four or five years old
[01:28:41.820 --> 01:28:45.820]   It's not fast enough to run anything cool in the mac space right now
[01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:53.980]   But you can take it off the shelf and turn it to a chromium based machine and make it fast run all the different modern web apps
[01:28:53.980 --> 01:29:01.020]   All the different modern uh chromium apps and instead of this thing just collecting dust on a shelf or god forbid giving it away to a charity
[01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:06.700]   Your kid can actually have a working machine that you know that still has your your fingerprints and your arm hairs a lot
[01:29:06.700 --> 01:29:12.940]   Journey the keeper. No, in fact, I use that on well all my linux installs probably shouldn't but I do because it's got a you know
[01:29:12.940 --> 01:29:15.580]   I could slog in and it's got all my bookmarks and all my uh
[01:29:15.580 --> 01:29:21.500]   Extensions and it's at least as functional as chromo as right away and then I can you know install whatever else I need
[01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:24.460]   You do need by the way, should mention for safari purple
[01:29:24.460 --> 01:29:30.220]   You need which is I think my new name for it. You got to get 10 11 4
[01:29:30.220 --> 01:29:33.500]   What it this came out just a couple of days ago
[01:29:34.140 --> 01:29:40.700]   Yeah, along with 9.3.1. I think yeah, so 931 fixed that weird safari link bug in iOS
[01:29:40.700 --> 01:29:46.220]   Yeah, if you had bookings if you had the bookings app installed it would overflow. Oh, it's just that app because I haven't seen it
[01:29:46.220 --> 01:29:48.220]   So okay, that's why
[01:29:48.220 --> 01:29:51.900]   So I somebody called me up and said I can't you know, I do I need to install it
[01:29:51.900 --> 01:29:55.020]   I said no you don't need install it's just that one bug and it's even better than that
[01:29:55.020 --> 01:30:00.140]   You don't need to install it unless you have the bookings app installed. Yeah, I mean you might have I mean you might as well because you'll eventually
[01:30:00.140 --> 01:30:05.020]   Stuff anyway, but yeah, no totally and that's why it was so flummoxing because we could never reproduce and it turned out
[01:30:05.020 --> 01:30:11.740]   It was just none of us had bookings. It's so weird as for 10 11 4. This is a full upgrade, right?
[01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:14.060]   This is something everybody should do it's a point really
[01:30:14.060 --> 01:30:20.860]   Yeah, which always includes everything like from security fixes to bugs and you know, and it's almost a cliche now bug and performance and pretty improvements
[01:30:20.860 --> 01:30:26.780]   We had mentioned a few of these the ability to import ever note into notes. They're really beefing up notes
[01:30:26.860 --> 01:30:29.980]   They have now a passcode protected notes. Yeah
[01:30:29.980 --> 01:30:35.420]   You could share live photos between iOS and OS 10 via airdrop and messages
[01:30:35.420 --> 01:30:37.980]   I really wish some of this stuff would go system wide
[01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:42.140]   It's like you can use the touch ID or a password to protect individual notes
[01:30:42.140 --> 01:30:44.220]   Not the notes app itself but individual notes
[01:30:44.220 --> 01:30:50.860]   But it'd be super handy if you could require passcode or touch ID to launch the messages app the photo app the notes app
[01:30:50.860 --> 01:30:55.980]   Anyone that you choose just make it a setting in the app settings for each one toggle them on
[01:30:56.300 --> 01:30:57.580]   Yeah
[01:30:57.580 --> 01:31:03.660]   Um, so there's a bunch of fixes you can see and I presume some security fixes as well
[01:31:03.660 --> 01:31:06.380]   So uh download it
[01:31:06.380 --> 01:31:09.340]   You know what I I installed it on my other machines
[01:31:09.340 --> 01:31:12.300]   But they're not pinging you necessarily and
[01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:15.340]   Do they wait a few days before they say you should get it?
[01:31:15.340 --> 01:31:18.380]   It's if you haven't said automatic it'll do it automatically
[01:31:18.380 --> 01:31:22.780]   Otherwise, I think when you go to the Mac app store, you'll see it or you might get that little notification window that comes up
[01:31:22.780 --> 01:31:25.740]   That says you have updates to install. I forgot to do it on here
[01:31:25.740 --> 01:31:29.100]   I just you know, so where do I turn it on that it should do that
[01:31:29.100 --> 01:31:33.660]   In the system automatic or for automatic. I want to get them all automatically
[01:31:33.660 --> 01:31:38.860]   I believe that's in the settings for the Mac app. I'm just going to double check app store
[01:31:38.860 --> 01:31:47.020]   Yes, see look I have it and it still didn't do that automatically check for updates download in the background install install install
[01:31:47.020 --> 01:31:50.780]   It did it for me. I'm I told it to ask me and it keeps asking me every day
[01:31:50.780 --> 01:31:54.380]   Keep it keeps asking me while I'm doing a show like this like he's saying no later. Yeah
[01:31:54.380 --> 01:31:59.580]   That's probably a good reason not to do it automatically, but I have it turned on and I did not get pinged
[01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:04.540]   I'd forgotten that I had this machine. So anyway, I'm doing you leave any of your devices on automatic
[01:32:04.540 --> 01:32:07.180]   I mean, that's the one thing I everything don't do. Yeah, I
[01:32:07.180 --> 01:32:11.820]   I always wanted I always want to be able to what are you gonna do? Come on Alex? What are you gonna do?
[01:32:11.820 --> 01:32:13.820]   What are you gonna look at it and go hmm?
[01:32:13.820 --> 01:32:15.820]   It's mostly the time. I just don't want to do that
[01:32:15.820 --> 01:32:21.820]   It's it's mostly just that I just don't want to do it during a show or during an upload or you know
[01:32:22.220 --> 01:32:26.860]   I'm at an event it ever kind of does it automatically right? It'll it'll ask you before it does it right
[01:32:26.860 --> 01:32:33.660]   Uh, well, no, if you have automatic updates on your iPad, it's just gonna start it'll just just start just starts
[01:32:33.660 --> 01:32:40.460]   It'll do it at night. I think it prioritizes doing it at night when it thinks you're no longer using the device is night shift on okay? Let's update
[01:32:40.460 --> 01:32:45.900]   It was such a bruja-ha about people angry that night shift doesn't turn on when you're in low power mode
[01:32:45.900 --> 01:32:49.180]   But would like I don't know if night shift saves power
[01:32:50.060 --> 01:32:57.980]   It does him it's yellow power. Yeah, so it uses power for several reasons one of which I suspect is that it's not native and that it's actually rendering it
[01:32:57.980 --> 01:33:03.820]   Also, uh, some people pointed out that you have to actually boost the LCD because you're removing a bunch of blue light which is easiest
[01:33:03.820 --> 01:33:05.500]   One for the luminance with yeah
[01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:12.860]   Yeah, so it's boosting that as well and also because either it runs off location services to know when sunlight when sunset sunrise are going
[01:33:12.860 --> 01:33:15.100]   Or off a background process for the timer
[01:33:15.660 --> 01:33:19.580]   And all these things add up and one of them doesn't sound like a lot but when you have a bunch of these things going
[01:33:19.580 --> 01:33:23.180]   And the whole point of low power mode is to stop everything that's completely not necessary
[01:33:23.180 --> 01:33:26.460]   The only reason I've been using it is because it's the first time I could white balance
[01:33:26.460 --> 01:33:30.140]   My iPad for our over the headshot on my ones today
[01:33:30.140 --> 01:33:35.900]   And so our producers Anthony has said oh, that's good. It looks it looks white now. You still look blue
[01:33:35.900 --> 01:33:42.380]   So I so that I use it for white balance, but I actually hated it night. I don't want to look a yellow to out screen looks like parchment paper
[01:33:43.900 --> 01:33:46.300]   Like a pirate like a pirate. I'm looking at a map
[01:33:46.300 --> 01:33:48.540]   I'm not
[01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:52.620]   Just like the visual reminder that dude. It's 11 o'clock. Go to bed
[01:33:52.620 --> 01:33:59.180]   Are you really going to be reading your iPad for the next four hours? Yes. Yes. Do you mind someone is wrong on the internet? Andy
[01:33:59.180 --> 01:34:01.340]   Yeah
[01:34:01.340 --> 01:34:03.180]   They need you go get them
[01:34:03.180 --> 01:34:06.780]   Foxconn bought sharp
[01:34:06.780 --> 01:34:10.220]   Doesn't sharp make all of the panels for apple
[01:34:10.940 --> 01:34:17.100]   Displays the cinnamon displays one of them. They so they often apple often multi sources for displays now and you have yes
[01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:19.420]   I'm sung in sharp and I forget the third one. Oh, okay
[01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:20.380]   LG
[01:34:20.380 --> 01:34:27.020]   And it depends on any given product what that mix looks like. Okay, so that's not a big deal of I mean Foxconn's a good partner for apple
[01:34:27.020 --> 01:34:31.660]   Anyway, it is interesting though that this company which was really just a manufacturing company is now
[01:34:31.660 --> 01:34:36.220]   Turning into a super computer superpower. Well, it is making a little bit of money
[01:34:36.220 --> 01:34:40.620]   You know, they're doing okay
[01:34:41.020 --> 01:34:43.260]   Harry McCrack had wrote a great article
[01:34:43.260 --> 01:34:51.420]   In fast company in honor of apples 40th last friday with Regis McKenna's notebooks
[01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:54.780]   That was incredible handwritten notebooks. Yeah handwritten note
[01:34:54.780 --> 01:35:00.780]   So Regis is the PR guru that uh Steve Jobs went to in 1976 when he started apple computer
[01:35:00.780 --> 01:35:07.180]   And really had a great partnership with the apple for a long time helping position the company wasn't his i love this
[01:35:07.420 --> 01:35:10.860]   He's got a rubber stamp that says return to Regis McKenna himself
[01:35:10.860 --> 01:35:16.300]   And that but that was his actual title at the company on his business cards. It's a
[01:35:16.300 --> 01:35:21.580]   McKenna himself. Oh, that's hysterical because the company's need to Regis McKenna. So yeah, yeah, that's
[01:35:21.580 --> 01:35:26.140]   When a designer was just like dummying up some cards and chauffeurs proof. Oh, that's great. Let's you
[01:35:26.140 --> 01:35:29.980]   Like it's like galactica actual
[01:35:29.980 --> 01:35:33.980]   Yeah, this is so he had worked for intel helping intel
[01:35:34.620 --> 01:35:39.580]   Popularize the microcomputer. Here's a note from 1972. What is a microcomputer?
[01:35:39.580 --> 01:35:41.340]   How do you use it?
[01:35:41.340 --> 01:35:43.500]   Typical applications and from that of course
[01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:50.300]   One of his ads in 1973 showing all the typical applications or the ways you might use a microcomputer
[01:35:50.300 --> 01:35:55.980]   So he helped apple and they in this funny the notebook. He says, you know, just met with uh, it's Steve
[01:35:55.980 --> 01:35:59.420]   The steve jobs guy. This is actually uh
[01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:03.500]   An email i met with but this is not from regis. This is from somebody named uh
[01:36:03.660 --> 01:36:07.100]   I met with steve jobs at apple in his garage then steve visit our office
[01:36:07.100 --> 01:36:12.780]   He's 21 along with a 25 year old partner steve his design manufactured and is marketing a micro
[01:36:12.780 --> 01:36:15.260]   Processor system the apple one
[01:36:15.260 --> 01:36:19.740]   Computer his first ad is attached to appear in interface
[01:36:19.740 --> 01:36:24.060]   In july and then harry great good on you harry found the uh ad
[01:36:24.060 --> 01:36:27.660]   This is an apple one ad see that with the original ron wane
[01:36:27.660 --> 01:36:31.900]   logo of serizic newton and the apple falling on his head
[01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:36.860]   666 dollars and 66 cents and a typo in the first sentence
[01:36:36.860 --> 01:36:41.900]   No mr. Make sure the other side of the fence is painted just as well as the front side
[01:36:41.900 --> 01:36:48.460]   Yeah, maybe he learned that it says the apple one system if a fully assembled tested and burned in microprocessor board
[01:36:48.460 --> 01:36:50.540]   I think he meant is
[01:36:50.540 --> 01:36:52.540]   a typo
[01:36:52.540 --> 01:36:53.820]   Wow
[01:36:53.820 --> 01:36:59.740]   No, no red squiggly lines back then. Mm. Yeah, they probably had a I don't know set that in hot lead
[01:37:00.860 --> 01:37:03.260]   Sorry mr. Jobs. It'll cost you a buck 50. It fixed that
[01:37:03.260 --> 01:37:12.060]   Um, it took it wasn't easy for for jobs and was to get to meet with regis kind of himself
[01:37:12.060 --> 01:37:14.860]   uh, but
[01:37:14.860 --> 01:37:19.180]   once he did I think once they he kind of was inspired by what they were up to
[01:37:19.180 --> 01:37:21.580]   and uh
[01:37:21.580 --> 01:37:26.940]   He he looked at that notebook so fun. You can harry's may as you can blow it up. I I don't know where harry got him
[01:37:26.940 --> 01:37:28.940]   But he go to regis and say
[01:37:28.940 --> 01:37:30.940]   Give me your notebooks. I don't know
[01:37:30.940 --> 01:37:34.540]   Pretty cool
[01:37:34.540 --> 01:37:38.620]   Bit of history bit of apple uh history
[01:37:38.620 --> 01:37:44.700]   And there's regis himself with steve jobs in the eighties
[01:37:44.700 --> 01:37:49.100]   That was another thing bill act incident. He brought the famous picture
[01:37:49.100 --> 01:37:56.380]   Of bill this was shot uh two weeks before the apple mac and tush was released cross-legged holding a mac bill
[01:37:56.380 --> 01:37:57.980]   Of course got curly
[01:37:57.980 --> 01:38:00.380]   hippie hair and a big fluffy mustache and jobs
[01:38:00.380 --> 01:38:04.780]   Uh, he's sitting next to him both of them are shoeless. They're in their stocking feet
[01:38:04.780 --> 01:38:10.540]   Both cross-legged on the floor and bill actinson yesterday says look at steves look
[01:38:10.540 --> 01:38:15.660]   Because he's kind of looking at him like this. He's thinking he says steves thinking how can I use this there?
[01:38:15.660 --> 01:38:17.900]   It is how can I use this guy to my advantage?
[01:38:17.900 --> 01:38:21.340]   Even bill actinson said that which is great. Yeah
[01:38:21.340 --> 01:38:24.140]   he said for two years
[01:38:24.380 --> 01:38:29.900]   I had more dinners with steve than not it was like two years. We were joined at the hip
[01:38:29.900 --> 01:38:31.420]   We were close close friends
[01:38:31.420 --> 01:38:35.820]   And then jobs was fired famously started next
[01:38:35.820 --> 01:38:38.460]   asked actinson to come to next
[01:38:38.460 --> 01:38:44.780]   Bill said I was working on hypercard at apple and I didn't want to leave I wanted to finish hypercard so I said steve
[01:38:44.780 --> 01:38:50.700]   I want to finish i'm gonna stay because I want to finish hypercard job said if you were my friend you'd come with me
[01:38:50.700 --> 01:38:53.900]   Yeah, and bill said yesterday he said
[01:38:54.300 --> 01:38:55.660]   I wanted to say
[01:38:55.660 --> 01:39:01.820]   He said I think he did say it if you were my friend you'd want me to do what is making me happy and finish hypercard
[01:39:01.820 --> 01:39:04.460]   And they didn't talk again for seven years
[01:39:04.460 --> 01:39:07.340]   Wow
[01:39:07.340 --> 01:39:11.180]   But he you could tell he loved you steve he's teared up a little bit what he's was talking about
[01:39:11.180 --> 01:39:14.460]   And steve actually said well you can do hypercard at next
[01:39:14.460 --> 01:39:17.420]   Like and and he said back that well
[01:39:17.420 --> 01:39:23.500]   Max have how many million how many max out there versus how many next machines get although
[01:39:23.580 --> 01:39:25.580]   in in hindsight
[01:39:25.580 --> 01:39:29.900]   Maybe it would have done better because apple killed it when steve came back
[01:39:29.900 --> 01:39:34.780]   He killed hypercard because bill said it had the stink of scully all over it
[01:39:34.780 --> 01:39:37.580]   Well
[01:39:37.580 --> 01:39:44.540]   But he was also saying that while he that uh that uh, there's so apple did not have the ability to support as many projects as it was
[01:39:44.540 --> 01:39:46.220]   supporting
[01:39:46.220 --> 01:39:49.420]   And i think that was but that was us that was very short-sighted because hypercard
[01:39:50.060 --> 01:39:52.940]   Well and whether it's hypercard and on i think that one of the big things is missing
[01:39:52.940 --> 01:39:55.020]   I think apple is trying to make this all more accessible
[01:39:55.020 --> 01:39:57.660]   We've gone from objective c to to swift
[01:39:57.660 --> 01:40:02.940]   But I think what's really missing is some kind of the next generation of visual basic or whatever
[01:40:02.940 --> 01:40:09.340]   Which is that there is a you know, I have nodal connections that I can write my own program and I can compile it
[01:40:09.340 --> 01:40:14.940]   You know and and I think that um that would hypercard for me when I was much younger
[01:40:14.940 --> 01:40:17.980]   Was you know a way to just kind of hack out ideas?
[01:40:17.980 --> 01:40:21.500]   I didn't have to figure out all the syntax and everything else I could just I program
[01:40:21.500 --> 01:40:24.780]   We were talking about before the show I programed a whole radio station with it did all the
[01:40:24.780 --> 01:40:27.420]   rotations and all the ads and all the
[01:40:27.420 --> 01:40:33.580]   PSAs and like everything was all run through this thing and I would work on it every day after I got off the air
[01:40:33.580 --> 01:40:37.020]   I would just go out and like that and you know and I'd run a update every night
[01:40:37.020 --> 01:40:42.780]   You know and the and it was just very very easy to you know to throw ideas together and make them very visual
[01:40:42.780 --> 01:40:45.580]   And I think that it is a missing thing for apple now
[01:40:46.220 --> 01:40:52.940]   Um, you know to to have something like that. I think automated or goes some direction towards that which you know, um, but I think having a real like
[01:40:52.940 --> 01:40:59.740]   Programming interface that lets you do a lot of those things and then actually compile it would be would be really uh
[01:40:59.740 --> 01:41:03.740]   A useful direction. I didn't I didn't ask bill because you know
[01:41:03.740 --> 01:41:06.940]   I you don't want to put someone in the spot about something that they can't change
[01:41:06.940 --> 01:41:09.580]   But I thought maybe if he'd gone with next
[01:41:09.580 --> 01:41:11.820]   Stayed with steve
[01:41:11.820 --> 01:41:18.300]   Hypercard would have survived in some form or fashion. What about just spitballing here swift you have repel you have playground and
[01:41:18.300 --> 01:41:21.420]   Swift cards. Yeah apple. Yeah, still not
[01:41:21.420 --> 01:41:27.340]   As easy as hypercard, but they do like the whole interface for it and then maybe put it on iOS
[01:41:27.340 --> 01:41:31.020]   Just just wonder you know what Atkins had said and you would agree. I think with this
[01:41:31.020 --> 01:41:37.100]   Alex Lindsay he said the spiritual successor to hypercard is apples iBooks author
[01:41:38.780 --> 01:41:44.460]   It is I you know, I think that it's just not as programmable. I mean, I don't think you can do the kind of things that I did with hypercard
[01:41:44.460 --> 01:41:47.500]   With when I run a radio station and i book author
[01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:50.300]   Right. Well, I mean and again like and I had uh
[01:41:50.300 --> 01:41:56.860]   proposed to a software company in the early 90s because I was really into hypercard. I was I just did everything you know, I just
[01:41:56.860 --> 01:42:04.220]   Managed my life inside of hypercard and uh, and I uh, I said we should just write your next manual inside of hypercard
[01:42:04.220 --> 01:42:07.180]   You know, the whole manual should just be so and when iBooks came out
[01:42:07.180 --> 01:42:12.300]   I really saw it as that was something that I'm very excited. Yeah, yeah, and what is the status now?
[01:42:12.300 --> 01:42:16.460]   I mean it's still out there. It's free. Uh, you can create a book and publish it in iBooks
[01:42:16.460 --> 01:42:18.940]   Uh, but are people using it?
[01:42:18.940 --> 01:42:23.980]   Yeah, there are definitely people using it. Um, a lot of schools are using it. I think that what that what I don't think apple really
[01:42:23.980 --> 01:42:26.220]   uh has taken advantage of or
[01:42:26.220 --> 01:42:30.140]   Just didn't really understand I think about its own product
[01:42:30.140 --> 01:42:34.300]   I think a lot of companies will build something and they have a certain vision for it and then it gets used for something else
[01:42:34.380 --> 01:42:36.540]   And they just don't understand what to do with that. So
[01:42:36.540 --> 01:42:43.820]   It was not successful in getting the big publishers to move their content because they were kind of it was kind of you know
[01:42:43.820 --> 01:42:49.100]   New wine and old wineskins and it was just kind of this like they don't understand what to do with that and um,
[01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:53.900]   They you know, they did some stuff with apple pushing them to do it and it just
[01:42:53.900 --> 01:43:02.300]   Barely used what it could do what it really took off was it was this incredible tool for teachers to build their curriculum on my dad
[01:43:02.780 --> 01:43:05.500]   My dad used it. He's a professor of geology. He made an incredible
[01:43:05.500 --> 01:43:11.740]   Of course on Darwin and the beagle. Yeah, and and i'm a person i've known a long time
[01:43:11.740 --> 01:43:14.700]   There's been in the picks score tony farley, you know has is a you know teaches
[01:43:14.700 --> 01:43:22.140]   In san leandro and he's using iBook to build whole books and he's got all kinds of stuff and he's actually published some of them and and the thing is is that
[01:43:22.140 --> 01:43:25.180]   That's pretty cool. Yeah, because you can do your whole curriculum in there
[01:43:25.180 --> 01:43:28.700]   Yeah, and that has turned out to be a huge growth area
[01:43:28.780 --> 01:43:33.900]   I think that um, I do think that apple has not invested because it didn't do what they thought it should do
[01:43:33.900 --> 01:43:37.900]   I think that they haven't invested the kind of resources that that I really believe they should
[01:43:37.900 --> 01:43:42.300]   I think they should be double tripling tripling down instead of trying to figure out how to get
[01:43:42.300 --> 01:43:49.820]   Publishers, you know how to organize publishers so they can charge more for their, you know, regular old paper books that were scanned into
[01:43:49.820 --> 01:43:57.180]   Uh, whatever, you know, what we should really be thinking about is how do we just redefine how books are made and really spend a lot of energy and
[01:43:57.180 --> 01:44:03.260]   Resources and development funds in the way that, uh, you know companies are spending, you know, they'll spend money to say well
[01:44:03.260 --> 01:44:05.420]   We will fund, you know
[01:44:05.420 --> 01:44:11.020]   Uh, outrageous or really cool uses of our technology. There's a huge fund to build plugins for slack
[01:44:11.020 --> 01:44:14.460]   You know that slack pays you have to do that, you know and in the same way
[01:44:14.460 --> 01:44:18.540]   I think apple should be looking for people doing you know building inventive things and really
[01:44:18.540 --> 01:44:23.500]   Giving people the engineering resources to make that work because they could rather than trying to
[01:44:24.140 --> 01:44:29.100]   Compete with amazon just create a whole nother playing field that doesn't look like that at all because you know books
[01:44:29.100 --> 01:44:31.420]   We don't really want books to look like books in ten years
[01:44:31.420 --> 01:44:33.500]   The media like like we want them to be something, you know
[01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:37.580]   That's interactive and has video and 3d and that's all easy to develop and you know
[01:44:37.580 --> 01:44:40.300]   That's and I think that apple's really missing the boat in that area
[01:44:40.300 --> 01:44:44.380]   Um, and again, I think that there's also a huge programming opportunity, you know
[01:44:44.380 --> 01:44:49.180]   BiBooks could be that but I think that you really could build a visual programming interface that that
[01:44:50.860 --> 01:44:56.140]   Less people build take their ideas and visually build them without having to understand all the code
[01:44:56.140 --> 01:44:58.140]   And maybe they're guess to a point where they have to
[01:44:58.140 --> 01:45:01.180]   Understand the code, um, you know where they have to you know
[01:45:01.180 --> 01:45:05.340]   But but I think that um building some kind of programming interface that people could do more visually
[01:45:05.340 --> 01:45:12.140]   I think would create another explosion and people solving problem, you know problems, uh, you know for their own, you know for their own business
[01:45:12.140 --> 01:45:15.580]   Bill bill said something yesterday that I've always agreed with
[01:45:15.580 --> 01:45:20.220]   Um people oftentimes people even like an official capacity said why one
[01:45:20.380 --> 01:45:26.140]   We were considering like proposing our school board make programming courses mandatory and I always say the same thing that
[01:45:26.140 --> 01:45:28.140]   You're you got it
[01:45:28.140 --> 01:45:32.940]   But you got it the wrong way around that you should you should teach kids that here is a problem you want to solve
[01:45:32.940 --> 01:45:37.100]   Here is the box of tools available to you for solving it as opposed to today
[01:45:37.100 --> 01:45:40.140]   We're going to learn how to program in this language. Well, that's right
[01:45:40.140 --> 01:45:45.500]   Hypercard was so good because it really it basically is what problem do you want to solve?
[01:45:45.500 --> 01:45:51.500]   Here's a toolbox for doing it and you basically you learn how to script when you reach a point where I can't do this thing
[01:45:51.500 --> 01:45:53.500]   That I want to make this thing do right now
[01:45:53.500 --> 01:45:56.700]   Uh, and so that's why that's when you start to get into hyper talk
[01:45:56.700 --> 01:46:01.340]   But until then you can just add cards draw fields draw buttons link buttons to fields
[01:46:01.340 --> 01:46:07.020]   Uh, and that's that's why it was such a brilliant backdoor to teaching people out of program because it's never about even as a kid
[01:46:07.020 --> 01:46:10.300]   I was pro I was coding like hours and hours and hours every single day
[01:46:10.540 --> 01:46:14.060]   And it was never because I had an interest in 6502 assembler language
[01:46:14.060 --> 01:46:20.300]   It's because I wanted to make animation that worked better than I could get it to work on in apple thaw basic
[01:46:20.300 --> 01:46:26.380]   See that's funny because that's the difference maybe between you and me because I have only ever been interested in technology for its own sake
[01:46:26.380 --> 01:46:30.860]   Not as a tool at all. It's a toy. It's fun for me. It's interesting for me in the coding
[01:46:30.860 --> 01:46:38.460]   I have written code that it's used as a tool, but really the coding was the was the journey for me not the not the tool itself
[01:46:39.020 --> 01:46:45.260]   That's just that's kind of how I approached technology and uh, maybe I'd have been more creative and better had I not
[01:46:45.260 --> 01:46:49.340]   But it's always for me. It's always definitely whether it's it's a tool for you, right?
[01:46:49.340 --> 01:46:52.380]   It's all whether it's a bill, you know building something when I was you know
[01:46:52.380 --> 01:46:58.860]   My first programs were after I learned how to write basic my first programs were because I was a dungeon master for g&p
[01:46:58.860 --> 01:47:01.420]   And I was tired rolling all the place for non-player characters
[01:47:01.420 --> 01:47:05.340]   And so I was like you're gonna write a program that just generates non-player characters because they keep on dying so quickly
[01:47:05.420 --> 01:47:09.980]   It's a pain in the neck. It's always been a problem for me like learning new languages and learning code
[01:47:09.980 --> 01:47:12.060]   And I don't ever have anything I need to do with them
[01:47:12.060 --> 01:47:17.820]   So we need to get together because I like to write the code and I like to learn new languages
[01:47:17.820 --> 01:47:22.380]   I never have anything to do with it. I can I can fix that for you. Yeah, give me some things to do
[01:47:22.380 --> 01:47:25.180]   Some tasks. All right. That sounds good. Yeah
[01:47:25.180 --> 01:47:27.420]   um
[01:47:27.420 --> 01:47:32.700]   Taylor swift apple beats one will wrap it up with this and then we'll get to your picks of the week
[01:47:32.700 --> 01:47:34.860]   Uh, turn around
[01:47:34.860 --> 01:47:40.860]   Pardon me what a turn around what a turn around for Taylor and beats one here. She is an eddy an eddy q
[01:47:40.860 --> 01:47:44.140]   She's got her Jim
[01:47:44.140 --> 01:47:46.540]   All right, she's listening
[01:47:46.540 --> 01:47:49.820]   On the treadmill
[01:47:49.820 --> 01:47:55.100]   She's really she's really blossomed into a beautiful young woman. I have to say and so business Abby
[01:47:55.100 --> 01:47:57.660]   She's so savvy. That's what I was gonna say
[01:47:57.660 --> 01:48:03.740]   She seems to slow she's in complete control of her image
[01:48:04.460 --> 01:48:08.060]   her image her business her her content and
[01:48:08.060 --> 01:48:12.300]   also the her ability the amount of toys and
[01:48:12.300 --> 01:48:19.580]   Class that she's shown in the face of other self involved blow hearts right try to show her
[01:48:19.580 --> 01:48:25.980]   Taylor are you okay? I think she even does her own stunts
[01:48:25.980 --> 01:48:29.900]   She for those of you listening
[01:48:29.900 --> 01:48:33.020]   She does a face plan on the treadmill. I I
[01:48:34.220 --> 01:48:36.780]   I'm gonna have to look at this really closely to see if there's a
[01:48:36.780 --> 01:48:39.820]   Stunt double double. I just don't know I'm almost certain or
[01:48:39.820 --> 01:48:42.860]   I'm thinking they were making the commercial and it happened
[01:48:42.860 --> 01:48:45.180]   But that's pretty good
[01:48:45.180 --> 01:48:50.140]   So, yeah, that's a good classic kudos fall though. I mean that's a oh she knows what she knows how to fall maybe
[01:48:50.140 --> 01:48:54.060]   I don't know if she does, but I mean that's like she's like on the ground. Yeah. Oh, yeah
[01:48:54.060 --> 01:48:56.060]   The slap is the wrestler slap, right?
[01:48:56.060 --> 01:48:59.900]   cutting the frame with the the way it's framed cutting the frame with the uh
[01:48:59.900 --> 01:49:02.700]   Right there, you know, it's there's actually uh
[01:49:03.420 --> 01:49:11.180]   You don't see the what's down below her. Yeah, and but you do cut the frame with the treadmill and show you're just ruining all my dreams
[01:49:11.180 --> 01:49:12.940]   Alex lindsey
[01:49:12.940 --> 01:49:17.260]   Hate you. Maybe Taylor has mad skills. I just don't think that anyone would let Taylor do that
[01:49:17.260 --> 01:49:19.740]   Is that Taylor? Is that Taylor right now?
[01:49:19.740 --> 01:49:26.620]   Then this on this still I'm gonna guess that the bottom part is uh somebody else in the top part is her
[01:49:26.620 --> 01:49:29.820]   And they cut back to her belly
[01:49:30.300 --> 01:49:34.620]   But just just just keep if you keep going you'll right there. It's not Taylor. It doesn't look like Taylor
[01:49:34.620 --> 01:49:38.860]   Yeah, the hair's different. Yeah, so come on you guys are so so cynical
[01:49:38.860 --> 01:49:42.860]   Yeah, that's always the problem whenever they put a tailor does her own stunts
[01:49:42.860 --> 01:49:46.220]   And a horrible week verify that it was Taylor
[01:49:46.220 --> 01:49:51.500]   So you don't see her face here. Notice how when you come off this she's turned away. That's a classic now
[01:49:51.500 --> 01:49:58.140]   It's so you take where did you cut there? Okay, you can take the last frame of uh
[01:49:58.940 --> 01:50:03.820]   Sorry, you take the you take the last frame of the uh of where she landed
[01:50:03.820 --> 01:50:07.580]   Yeah, Taylor match that and then you have her match it, you know, and then it's her face
[01:50:07.580 --> 01:50:09.100]   And then she then she moves up
[01:50:09.100 --> 01:50:12.620]   But you because you don't see her face during the fall if she had turned her face towards you
[01:50:12.620 --> 01:50:15.100]   It wouldn't have been I wouldn't have said it was her but I always said a lot harder
[01:50:15.100 --> 01:50:19.900]   Right. Yeah, because that that's like a stunt double obvious when they're you don't see the saver
[01:50:19.900 --> 01:50:26.300]   They make absolutely sure that you don't see her face during the entire fall until she stopped where they can make the transition
[01:50:26.460 --> 01:50:32.460]   Oh, I'm choosing to believe it's Taylor. I think it happened in the in the shooting and they thought
[01:50:32.460 --> 01:50:37.580]   Of course if it had happened the shooting hundreds of assistants would have poured from the sides
[01:50:37.580 --> 01:50:41.180]   Say mr. The swift are you okay? You're our paycheck. Please. I hope you're okay
[01:50:41.180 --> 01:50:43.180]   I said imagine the treadmill is Kanye and hit it
[01:50:43.180 --> 01:50:49.180]   We have one trick with youtube is if you click on the timeline, can I uh, click on the timeline dot?
[01:50:49.180 --> 01:50:51.500]   Hold and pull up
[01:50:51.500 --> 01:50:55.100]   And then pull up. Yeah, it should give you it should give you the ability
[01:50:55.420 --> 01:50:58.380]   Maybe it's only chrome, but it gives you the ability to um
[01:50:58.380 --> 01:51:01.180]   to frame shutter
[01:51:01.180 --> 01:51:04.620]   I said I would like to quick time does did that used to do that, which was really handy
[01:51:04.620 --> 01:51:11.580]   Which was you if it's any constant any consolation? I think the high speed video of adam savage following on the treadmill while doing a drinking
[01:51:11.580 --> 01:51:20.140]   Myth bust that's real. I'm sure that's that's I did that stuff. That's but it's still apple went from her complaining very publicly about them to her starring
[01:51:20.140 --> 01:51:22.940]   Their commercial pretty quick like she's a friend of apple
[01:51:22.940 --> 01:51:28.540]   Some companies would have doubled down on the stupid there and just made it like a bad situation for a long period of time
[01:51:28.540 --> 01:51:30.620]   So this I think is good pr on their point
[01:51:30.620 --> 01:51:33.020]   And then in the commercial they punch her face to the ground
[01:51:33.020 --> 01:51:34.620]   So
[01:51:34.620 --> 01:51:37.180]   Maybe maybe there's a little vicarious joy
[01:51:37.180 --> 01:51:43.180]   Going on about the about the ending of the script. It's him coke said can you make her fall on her face at the end?
[01:51:43.180 --> 01:51:48.860]   All right, we're at a queue might have all right. We're gonna take a break come back with your picks of the week so i've ready get ready
[01:51:49.660 --> 01:51:52.540]   But first I gotta talk about my pick of the sleep
[01:51:52.540 --> 01:51:55.500]   Casper
[01:51:55.500 --> 01:51:57.500]   Man, I love my mattress
[01:51:57.500 --> 01:52:00.940]   I was lying on my Casper pillow last night with my Casper mattress
[01:52:00.940 --> 01:52:03.660]   Feeling good
[01:52:03.660 --> 01:52:07.420]   A great mattress. Oh, I just fell backwards and I just I left my feet on the floor
[01:52:07.420 --> 01:52:11.100]   I fell backwards and I just sank into it and if we just felt all the stress melt away
[01:52:11.100 --> 01:52:17.420]   It's nice because I it's hard to describe, but it's just it really feels great. It's uh, it's a cool mattress
[01:52:17.580 --> 01:52:20.940]   We got an 86 some say 90 degree day tomorrow
[01:52:20.940 --> 01:52:25.020]   But I don't I don't have to worry about that because my Casper mattress is
[01:52:25.020 --> 01:52:30.540]   Breathe feels cool. It's a great mattress obsessively engineered at a fair price
[01:52:30.540 --> 01:52:38.140]   And you can buy it online and the nice thing is you don't have to try before you buy because they give you a hundred days or maybe i should say a hundred nights
[01:52:38.140 --> 01:52:39.900]   free delivery
[01:52:39.900 --> 01:52:45.260]   And if at any time in the first hundred nights you decide I want to go back to my own mattress. They'll come they'll get it
[01:52:45.340 --> 01:52:47.340]   They'll take it away and return every penny
[01:52:47.340 --> 01:52:53.180]   So forget lying on a mattress in a showroom. That's no way to test a mattress get it in your home
[01:52:53.180 --> 01:52:55.980]   Really really get down on that mattress
[01:52:55.980 --> 01:53:02.060]   Made in the USA the pillows. Can I say are awesome? Their dual layer responsive pillow
[01:53:02.060 --> 01:53:06.380]   Is a perfect adjunct for your Casper? You can get them both

[01:53:45.180 --> 01:53:51.820]   Okay leo loport your pick of the week i'll stall for Andy
[01:53:51.820 --> 01:53:57.500]   Um, no, no, no, I'll finish. No, it's good. I I've installed what's app. I am still miffed a little bit
[01:53:57.500 --> 01:53:59.580]   They don't have an ipad app
[01:53:59.580 --> 01:54:03.660]   Got to work on that, but they do have a web app and that at least that's important for me
[01:54:03.660 --> 01:54:06.860]   Uh, it's web dot what's app dot com
[01:54:07.340 --> 01:54:13.980]   And I won't show the qr code right now because that would be giving away my uh, but what you do is you you you
[01:54:13.980 --> 01:54:19.340]   Take your what's app and you shine the qr code in from the computer in the what's app and then it says oh good
[01:54:19.340 --> 01:54:24.860]   I got your account on your phone in the computer and then you can stay signed in
[01:54:24.860 --> 01:54:27.740]   And use what's app on your desktop?
[01:54:27.740 --> 01:54:32.700]   Which is to me at least a big part of what I look for in a messaging app, although i'm still what in
[01:54:33.420 --> 01:54:38.540]   The ipad version and the next thing facebook already did this with facebook messenger on android
[01:54:38.540 --> 01:54:41.100]   They'll never do it on iphone for obvious reasons, but on android
[01:54:41.100 --> 01:54:45.820]   I can use facebook messenger as my msapp kind of like apple's messages
[01:54:45.820 --> 01:54:51.820]   I'd love to see that with what's app as well a couple people else noden and zadarski are pointing out that it doesn't it
[01:54:51.820 --> 01:54:56.540]   Doesn't protect who your texting so go to keep that in mind. Metadata is still there. Yeah
[01:54:56.540 --> 01:54:59.420]   Well, they probably can't protect that
[01:55:01.580 --> 01:55:05.180]   Uh actually they could there are apps that are completely anonymous
[01:55:05.180 --> 01:55:08.780]   You know kind of bitcoin like apps where you don't communicate with people with their real names
[01:55:08.780 --> 01:55:13.100]   If you the thing about what's app is it matt it matches you up with your phone number
[01:55:13.100 --> 01:55:19.100]   So you you're you're not anonymous in what's app and nor are the people you're talking to yes
[01:55:19.100 --> 01:55:21.100]   For users, that's a convenience
[01:55:21.100 --> 01:55:26.060]   Otherwise, I'd have to kind of say to you what's your secret number and we'd have to arrange that somehow
[01:55:26.060 --> 01:55:28.140]   um
[01:55:28.140 --> 01:55:34.620]   And then finally, uh, it's it's voting day in wisconsin and I don't know about you, but i'm ready for this app
[01:55:34.620 --> 01:55:38.940]   It's a chrome filter a chrome extension called trump filter
[01:55:38.940 --> 01:55:41.740]   That lets you just delete donald trump from the web
[01:55:41.740 --> 01:55:46.380]   You don't see it anymore or move to canada
[01:55:46.380 --> 01:55:52.860]   Giver room do you not have stories every day in your news feeds about donald trump even in canada
[01:55:52.860 --> 01:55:57.260]   No, we have people like drunkenly writing moose and dropping maple syrup on sidewalks
[01:55:57.260 --> 01:55:59.260]   We're really busy leo
[01:55:59.260 --> 01:56:05.900]   I and by the way, I didn't give you condolences about the late mayor of toronto rob fort who passed away to very young age
[01:56:05.900 --> 01:56:07.740]   yeah
[01:56:07.740 --> 01:56:09.180]   Shows that uh
[01:56:09.180 --> 01:56:11.180]   crack cocaine and politics
[01:56:11.180 --> 01:56:16.140]   Are not good for your health. No, but we did get transit directions at no no no relation
[01:56:16.140 --> 01:56:20.300]   We did get transit directions in montreal today on apple now. So we do have costs. That is nice. I like this
[01:56:20.300 --> 01:56:23.020]   Now i've stalled enough for you, andi
[01:56:24.300 --> 01:56:29.260]   Andi was you didn't see him, but he was like he is off somewhere getting the stuff. No, no, I was just taking my
[01:56:29.260 --> 01:56:35.820]   You know the clam shell on the on the ears and it gets my ears kind of sweaty. Oh, you're letting your ears air out? Okay, okay? I was just
[01:56:35.820 --> 01:56:38.460]   That's
[01:56:38.460 --> 01:56:42.620]   Really great really great pick this week. I've been looking forward to recommend it as for for quite a while
[01:56:42.620 --> 01:56:49.820]   Ulysses the really great word processor slash text editor that's multi platform works on max and ios
[01:56:50.220 --> 01:56:55.180]   A couple a lot of big announcements. They created a brand new version 2.5 for ios
[01:56:55.180 --> 01:57:03.580]   That is supports every cool thing ios 9 supports and every cool thing you want on an ipad pro whether the big one or the little one
[01:57:03.580 --> 01:57:08.700]   So it supports slide over supports multitasking split screen all that cool stuff
[01:57:08.700 --> 01:57:15.740]   The so it's it's a really great word processor to use alongside anything else you're using
[01:57:16.060 --> 01:57:23.740]   The strong thing that has always existed with ulysses has been it's in a category of word processor where it helps you to do things that
[01:57:23.740 --> 01:57:30.460]   Might be defined as projects where it's not one file that you're working on as powerful as microsoft where it is
[01:57:30.460 --> 01:57:37.420]   It's something where you're thinking more about i have folders of related documents that i'm working on whether it's a research project a novel
[01:57:37.420 --> 01:57:40.220]   a non-fiction book of a
[01:57:41.420 --> 01:57:49.500]   A thesis the sort of thing where you really really need to keep notes and different chapters and everything really nicely organized and together
[01:57:49.500 --> 01:57:54.380]   And it really makes it really really easy to organize stuff that's in progress or in process
[01:57:54.380 --> 01:58:02.940]   So this really is probably for now the only ios word processor where you really could write an entire novel on this and be very very comfortable
[01:58:02.940 --> 01:58:05.900]   In that space in addition to all this other cool
[01:58:06.780 --> 01:58:12.140]   Split screen sort of stuff for ios. It also supports has a new sharing sharing sheet
[01:58:12.140 --> 01:58:17.180]   So that if you're let's say you're doing research on a on a book and you're in a browser
[01:58:17.180 --> 01:58:23.020]   You can simply send a URL or send some text or send whatever out of that app and send it into ulysses
[01:58:23.020 --> 01:58:29.100]   And so it'll just be waiting for the you there in your inbox. Um, the only disadvantage of it is that it's uh
[01:58:29.100 --> 01:58:31.820]   Flat text only
[01:58:31.820 --> 01:58:36.620]   As is the way the way that you're editing so you don't get the sort of rich text experience that you would have
[01:58:37.100 --> 01:58:40.860]   On in microsoft word or in pages, but it does support markdown
[01:58:40.860 --> 01:58:46.060]   So you can do very sophisticated format formatting by using the right tokens and the right
[01:58:46.060 --> 01:58:48.940]   Uh, the the right margins and that sort of thing
[01:58:48.940 --> 01:58:55.180]   It also will support import import export of docx files so you can move files into and out of it from
[01:58:55.180 --> 01:58:57.020]   from
[01:58:57.020 --> 01:58:59.740]   Microsoft office it supports cloud services
[01:59:00.140 --> 01:59:05.340]   Sports cloud sync so it's easy to move files across them this new version also supports the iphone
[01:59:05.340 --> 01:59:09.260]   So you really can be a triple threat and use whatever device you have
[01:59:09.260 --> 01:59:12.140]   to manipulate all your data and
[01:59:12.140 --> 01:59:15.660]   Edit right update whatever the project's going to be
[01:59:15.660 --> 01:59:20.700]   And there there was another good piece of news on the complicated writing front
[01:59:20.700 --> 01:59:25.340]   That the literature and latte have been have been posting intermittent blog post
[01:59:25.340 --> 01:59:29.100]   Talking about how what progress they're making on scrivener
[01:59:29.660 --> 01:59:32.540]   For ios my favorite word processor by far
[01:59:32.540 --> 01:59:37.420]   This is it takes something like ulysses and takes it up and other seven levels in complex
[01:59:37.420 --> 01:59:41.340]   In the ability to manage major projects and sort of develop
[01:59:41.340 --> 01:59:44.460]   thoughts into actual printed text
[01:59:44.460 --> 01:59:46.220]   and
[01:59:46.220 --> 01:59:52.940]   The latest blog post says that okay. We all the people that we thought we had hired earlier on to work on this
[01:59:52.940 --> 01:59:59.180]   Punted and now we got we decided i decided i'm going to learn how to write an ios app myself
[01:59:59.340 --> 02:00:02.860]   And now finally there's we don't have a date or anything like that
[02:00:02.860 --> 02:00:05.260]   But we're really really close to announcing a beta
[02:00:05.260 --> 02:00:08.460]   And so hopefully we will see that by the end of the year
[02:00:08.460 --> 02:00:13.180]   Until even when that gets released ulysses will always have this unique spot
[02:00:13.180 --> 02:00:17.180]   It's it's a less heavy duty and therefore less intimidating version of scrivener
[02:00:17.180 --> 02:00:22.460]   But the ability to have this one app that can manage a complex project across three different platforms
[02:00:22.460 --> 02:00:25.820]   And make it really easy to get text in and out of it
[02:00:25.820 --> 02:00:27.420]   of
[02:00:27.420 --> 02:00:30.700]   When you need to put it someplace else uh really really big deal
[02:00:30.700 --> 02:00:34.940]   The uh ios app is 2499 for limited time. It's down to
[02:00:34.940 --> 02:00:36.620]   1999
[02:00:36.620 --> 02:00:41.980]   But it's a real for me. It's a real easy amount of money to spend it really has become my default
[02:00:41.980 --> 02:00:49.580]   Writing tool on on ios and it's absolutely perfectly integrated with the way that you want to work on an ipad pro
[02:00:49.580 --> 02:00:55.420]   I have to say with the new with integration into medium that makes it even more intriguing because yeah
[02:00:55.900 --> 02:00:58.860]   Medium has just added the ability. I mean they were really trying to get
[02:00:58.860 --> 02:01:06.700]   Publications to use it as their content management system. They've got they've got all sorts of new features and a number of the all just moved there a number of
[02:01:06.700 --> 02:01:11.180]   Web publications. Shawna. We guess says monday note is now on medium
[02:01:11.180 --> 02:01:17.500]   Uh, you can monetize and so you could write your medium articles on ulysses and then automatically uh post them up there
[02:01:17.500 --> 02:01:23.420]   So that's very interesting. Yeah, there's it. There's there's just a lot to a lot to love here. There is also a full
[02:01:23.420 --> 02:01:27.260]   Embracement of uh of uh keyboard navigation. You can change the layouts
[02:01:27.260 --> 02:01:32.060]   Uh, and there's there are a lot of people that have been really embracing ulysses to do a lot of different things
[02:01:32.060 --> 02:01:34.620]   Uh, so that there are a lot of people who have been trying to
[02:01:34.620 --> 02:01:41.260]   Export into into web format trying to export into other things you can't necessarily publish directly from it
[02:01:41.260 --> 02:01:47.820]   But it's starting to become like medium kind of a medium in and of itself enough people are using it as a platform that
[02:01:47.820 --> 02:01:50.140]   There are solutions to pretty much everything you want to get for
[02:01:52.220 --> 02:01:58.540]   Mm, Ulysses and it's a little weird finding it on the iPad best thing to do go to ulysses app on your browser and you get a link
[02:01:58.540 --> 02:02:01.180]   Uh, it's ulysses mobile from the soul man
[02:02:01.180 --> 02:02:06.460]   What do you want for nothing?
[02:02:06.460 --> 02:02:11.260]   Actually actually the update if you brought a previous version of less easily update is completely free
[02:02:11.260 --> 02:02:13.500]   So they didn't try to charge you brand new for it. Nice
[02:02:13.500 --> 02:02:18.540]   But definitely worth it definitely worth every penny that 25 bucks and you don't have to pay every penny of that just the first 19
[02:02:19.100 --> 02:02:23.820]   Actually, I think they went back to 25 bucks. I have bad news for you. I just paid 25 bucks
[02:02:23.820 --> 02:02:28.860]   That's all right. Oh well, totally worth it. They deserve the extra five bucks. Yeah, I have a lot of uh writing apps now
[02:02:28.860 --> 02:02:31.900]   Uh on my iPad. I'm not sure what i'm gonna end up using
[02:02:31.900 --> 02:02:36.140]   Full time. I've been playing with editorial, which I like a lot. Yeah
[02:02:36.140 --> 02:02:38.380]   Um, that's yeah
[02:02:38.380 --> 02:02:38.860]   I
[02:02:38.860 --> 02:02:40.860]   Apple sort of apple sort of forced
[02:02:40.860 --> 02:02:46.140]   The evolution of these really good simplified writing apps with fewer distractions minimal user interface
[02:02:46.460 --> 02:02:51.740]   Just by making it so damn difficult for any developer to create what is recognizably a
[02:02:51.740 --> 02:02:59.980]   Wizzy wig word processor because of Iowa so right. Yeah, maybe maybe that was their plan all along that was just brilliant strategy on their part
[02:02:59.980 --> 02:03:05.420]   Uh ladies and gentlemen, I give you rene ritchie and his pick as a week
[02:03:05.420 --> 02:03:12.860]   Uh, so I have two quick picks one is bit moji which I know megan is already with but I saw some avoiding this one
[02:03:13.660 --> 02:03:17.580]   Uh leo you gotta make a leo bit moji so I did actually I tweeted it
[02:03:17.580 --> 02:03:18.860]   I'm embarrassed to say
[02:03:18.860 --> 02:03:22.860]   George and I now have entire conversations that i'm gonna show you a big phone so you can see that are
[02:03:22.860 --> 02:03:27.660]   I just totally bit moji based and when I want to reply because it's a custom keyboard
[02:03:27.660 --> 02:03:33.020]   I just tap on it and it gives me so basically you download it and it's a keyboard you install on your iphone
[02:03:33.020 --> 02:03:39.740]   And then you design your bit moji and it takes what you design and applies that to its template of I don't know 50 or 100 different
[02:03:40.220 --> 02:03:44.780]   Generated cartoons and then you just use those because there's limitations in iOS
[02:03:44.780 --> 02:03:48.780]   You can't inject an image straight from a keyboard so you copy it paste it in
[02:03:48.780 --> 02:03:51.260]   And then you just send it like you would an image
[02:03:51.260 --> 02:03:54.860]   Uh, but it's it's one of those things where like a picture tells a thousand words
[02:03:54.860 --> 02:03:59.820]   But an emoji can sort of convey a thousand emotions and whether you're being sarcastic or sincere
[02:03:59.820 --> 02:04:03.740]   It's sort of liberating to be able to talk in in pictographs and pictures
[02:04:03.740 --> 02:04:07.100]   But it's super personal because it's made to mean and represent you
[02:04:07.660 --> 02:04:11.420]   And they're really timely like they had star wars ones for a while they had easter ones
[02:04:11.420 --> 02:04:18.540]   And they refresh all the different built-in ones, you know fairly frequently so there's always something new to to test out
[02:04:18.540 --> 02:04:21.340]   uh, and the new version it used to be um
[02:04:21.340 --> 02:04:25.900]   Bit strips which I never found attractive but emoji are super cute
[02:04:25.900 --> 02:04:29.820]   They've just been bought by snapchat so depends on how you feel about that
[02:04:29.820 --> 02:04:35.900]   But the app is still on the store and it's still working and if you want to sort of take your picture messaging game
[02:04:36.380 --> 02:04:39.900]   To the next level it's it's it's just a lot of fun and it's
[02:04:39.900 --> 02:04:43.660]   Uh, it takes a lot of the seriousness out of what can be really
[02:04:43.660 --> 02:04:48.060]   Drap text communications. So I've been I've been using a lot my mom
[02:04:48.060 --> 02:04:51.660]   They're not making one my sister and my boss made one a bunch of my friends made them
[02:04:51.660 --> 02:04:56.540]   They just throw them in every once in a while and it really it really breaks up the monotony of the text
[02:04:56.540 --> 02:05:03.020]   I'm a big sticker fan. So I guess I should probably start using it too. So the way you have to use this alternate keyboard though, right?
[02:05:03.660 --> 02:05:09.020]   Yeah, there's one for iOS. There's one for android so you can do cross cross platform bit moji to your heart's content
[02:05:09.020 --> 02:05:12.060]   Uh, and then you can also if you want to put them in like instagram
[02:05:12.060 --> 02:05:18.220]   You just save them out and you know upload them into instagram and then you can do like seriously or come on or
[02:05:18.220 --> 02:05:23.900]   Whatever or does this emoji make my butt look fat? I'm only have all sorts of really fun ones
[02:05:23.900 --> 02:05:27.420]   They have all sorts of really again topical ones too
[02:05:27.420 --> 02:05:31.580]   Like there's Batman and superman ones right now and there were x files ones and matrix ones and
[02:05:32.300 --> 02:05:34.300]   That's uh, it's super interesting
[02:05:34.300 --> 02:05:39.580]   Type the colon and an open print this season. That was good enough for us
[02:05:39.580 --> 02:05:43.580]   Askyard there's a vascular
[02:05:43.580 --> 02:05:46.940]   I ask you just good old fashioned
[02:05:46.940 --> 02:05:50.060]   Tansky for your ass. No, that's the wrong
[02:05:50.060 --> 02:05:54.460]   The other thing I wanted to mention quickly was text expander just came out with a full new software suite
[02:05:54.460 --> 02:05:57.420]   And it's been a little controversial because they're switching to a subscription model
[02:05:57.420 --> 02:05:58.860]   Yeah, that's weird
[02:05:58.860 --> 02:06:03.020]   And well, I mean we're we're in the day where software has no value and these companies want to keep making it
[02:06:03.020 --> 02:06:06.700]   And we have a choice of whether we like the old days software is super expensive
[02:06:06.700 --> 02:06:12.060]   So you couldn't buy many apps. I remember it was $40 to get a yellow sticky note app on my trio
[02:06:12.060 --> 02:06:14.060]   And I remember what mac apps used to cost
[02:06:14.060 --> 02:06:17.500]   So I just couldn't buy that many so I was forced to choose the ones it really mattered to me
[02:06:17.500 --> 02:06:20.140]   So for things like text expander, which I use every day
[02:06:20.140 --> 02:06:22.060]   Uh for me, it's it's not a big deal
[02:06:22.060 --> 02:06:23.900]   It's like I would love to pay for one password
[02:06:23.900 --> 02:06:26.780]   I won't I won't be able to afford every app but I'll have to make choices
[02:06:26.940 --> 02:06:29.180]   You know, I'm not owed any of these apps
[02:06:29.180 --> 02:06:32.140]   But an app that I want I want to be able to invest in so that they keep making it
[02:06:32.140 --> 02:06:34.380]   And I don't have to suddenly do without it
[02:06:34.380 --> 02:06:39.500]   So you can pay a monthly uh subscription fee or a yearly fee that's at a slightly reduced rate
[02:06:39.500 --> 02:06:43.260]   I think a lot of people found it surprising because they didn't as far as I know they didn't pre-announce it
[02:06:43.260 --> 02:06:45.260]   Which might have taken some of this sting out
[02:06:45.260 --> 02:06:47.340]   But you can still keep using the old version
[02:06:47.340 --> 02:06:51.260]   And there's new versions of the mac app and the ios app and they had I think a windows beta
[02:06:51.260 --> 02:06:52.940]   I don't think it's it's more along than a beta
[02:06:52.940 --> 02:06:54.940]   But a windows beta version of it
[02:06:54.940 --> 02:06:58.460]   And one of the big new features is because they're doing this new subscription for service
[02:06:58.460 --> 02:07:00.380]   Is they're no longer using Dropbox or iCloud
[02:07:00.380 --> 02:07:01.740]   They're doing all their own sync
[02:07:01.740 --> 02:07:03.260]   But that let them create a team system
[02:07:03.260 --> 02:07:06.220]   So if you had a like we have a mobile nations one if you had a twit one
[02:07:06.220 --> 02:07:09.180]   You could share snippets the way like one password teams work
[02:07:09.180 --> 02:07:10.620]   Where you can have your private collection
[02:07:10.620 --> 02:07:15.580]   But we can also have a bunch of snippets that just do mundane things that every one of us has to do every day
[02:07:15.580 --> 02:07:18.060]   And those always stay shared and always stayed synced
[02:07:18.060 --> 02:07:21.980]   In a little separate sort of above the fold uh part of text expander
[02:07:21.980 --> 02:07:24.300]   So it's still really great. I'm trying the subscription for a while
[02:07:24.300 --> 02:07:26.460]   I'm gonna see if I like it and see if I get value from it
[02:07:26.460 --> 02:07:28.460]   But I think I will and I think I'll continue using it
[02:07:28.460 --> 02:07:31.340]   And I'm happy that sort of developers instead of
[02:07:31.340 --> 02:07:34.460]   Everyone complains you can't make money on the app store and then we yell at people who try
[02:07:34.460 --> 02:07:36.380]   So I'm kind of stuck in the middle of this
[02:07:36.380 --> 02:07:40.620]   But I want to support the ones that really uh time is the only thing I have less less of than money
[02:07:40.620 --> 02:07:42.540]   If they can save me time it's invaluable to me
[02:07:42.540 --> 02:07:46.140]   I love text expander, but I you know I have to think twice with the monthly
[02:07:46.140 --> 02:07:46.540]   Sure
[02:07:46.540 --> 02:07:47.340]   Yeah
[02:07:47.340 --> 02:07:49.900]   Uh mr. Alex Lindsey
[02:07:50.700 --> 02:07:55.020]   Is actually has been using his pick of the week all through the show and it's been everything I could do not
[02:07:55.020 --> 02:07:56.860]   Not to say anything
[02:07:56.860 --> 02:08:00.220]   Yeah, so I have a I have both a tip and a tip and a pick
[02:08:00.220 --> 02:08:02.700]   Um, uh because my last tip went over so well
[02:08:02.700 --> 02:08:04.540]   I can't even what it was but I got all these clips
[02:08:04.540 --> 02:08:10.860]   Um, so uh one is that I didn't really realize as I set up an apple tv in our office that you could
[02:08:10.860 --> 02:08:13.100]   There's a there's now if you haven't seen it
[02:08:13.100 --> 02:08:16.860]   There is an app conference room display for your apple tv
[02:08:17.420 --> 02:08:21.980]   So it really is designed if you have if you've got the I we had a meeting with a client who had a mac
[02:08:21.980 --> 02:08:26.060]   And it was so easy all they had I mean they immediately saw it in their in their
[02:08:26.060 --> 02:08:28.380]   Um, airplane
[02:08:28.380 --> 02:08:33.260]   They just saw you know 200 conference room and they just boom and then their screen is right up on the on our
[02:08:33.260 --> 02:08:37.660]   You know, there's just no figuring out how to plug stuff in or what it's going to do or how to sync it
[02:08:37.660 --> 02:08:40.700]   Or as soon as they were on the wifi they were able to just plug into the screen
[02:08:40.700 --> 02:08:46.380]   And uh, so if you haven't done conference room display and set up set that up on your apple tv
[02:08:46.380 --> 02:08:50.540]   And you're using it in a business environment. It's uh, it's pretty awesome
[02:08:50.540 --> 02:08:53.340]   So uh, so anyway, it was just as seamless as you would
[02:08:53.340 --> 02:08:56.860]   Expect it to be and it never is it's always there's always some issue
[02:08:56.860 --> 02:09:01.100]   Um, and typically and it was not the case at least for me so far
[02:09:01.100 --> 02:09:07.100]   Um, my pick is that yes the thing i've been using all all which I think it's turned out pretty well. It sounds great. Yeah
[02:09:07.100 --> 02:09:11.660]   Yeah, this is the sure this is the mv51. So this is um
[02:09:11.660 --> 02:09:15.100]   It is it's got a couple different settings. Um, so I have
[02:09:15.740 --> 02:09:20.780]   You know, right now I have it set to vocal but I can change it to guitar and you know all kinds of other things
[02:09:20.780 --> 02:09:23.340]   It it it'll kind of um base itself on it now
[02:09:23.340 --> 02:09:27.580]   It's got a little kickstand on the back if you take off unscrew the back of it
[02:09:27.580 --> 02:09:30.060]   You actually get a mic stand
[02:09:30.060 --> 02:09:35.820]   Uh mount so that little that little rubber thing and the back you can unscrew that and it'll just mount right now
[02:09:35.820 --> 02:09:39.180]   I have it mounted onto a mic stand and it's just the same, you know
[02:09:39.180 --> 02:09:41.900]   So I just took that little piece off and I just screwed it right on
[02:09:41.900 --> 02:09:45.660]   Um, so you can do that if you want if you don't want to set if you want to get it a little closer to your mouth
[02:09:46.060 --> 02:09:49.020]   Um, I think it sounds great. Uh, I've been testing it for a couple weeks now
[02:09:49.020 --> 02:09:56.300]   I bought it. I bought that and their interface one of the things I got it for is the fact that it does use it
[02:09:56.300 --> 02:09:59.100]   That comes with a lightning
[02:09:59.100 --> 02:10:09.180]   A lightning to micro cable so that you can plug it right into your ipad or iphone and use it as a as an audio source
[02:10:09.180 --> 02:10:13.340]   So, um, it's a pretty uh, you know, I it's got you know
[02:10:13.340 --> 02:10:17.260]   Low latency if you need it on the back so that you can hear what you're doing there
[02:10:17.260 --> 02:10:20.780]   Um, and it's just uh, you know, it's a really well-built
[02:10:20.780 --> 02:10:24.780]   Um, little usb mic and it's a little bit smaller than some of the other ones that i've tested
[02:10:24.780 --> 02:10:28.700]   So it's something that I feel like I can, you know throw in my bag and and um
[02:10:28.700 --> 02:10:31.500]   And make it work. And so anyway, so I
[02:10:31.500 --> 02:10:35.420]   I'm very happy with it. I've tested a lot of these mics and I think this is probably
[02:10:35.420 --> 02:10:40.300]   Uh, the one that i'll be carrying around with my uh in my bag until I test, you know another four mics
[02:10:40.380 --> 02:10:44.540]   I mean, I think I own most of these mics at some point and a lot of them sound good
[02:10:44.540 --> 02:10:50.140]   But size and quality and all those things have to be mixed together and I think it's good Mike. Yeah, we um
[02:10:50.140 --> 02:10:55.740]   I I have that one and then uh, this is this is a whole line from shore. This is the
[02:10:55.740 --> 02:10:58.540]   Yeah, they've really gone up the road from the t-v line
[02:10:58.540 --> 02:11:02.460]   And this is the one I use for uh, and I showed this yesterday and I was today
[02:11:02.460 --> 02:11:07.340]   With Jason snout for like blogging on my ipad because this has a lightning connector
[02:11:07.820 --> 02:11:11.100]   Um yours does too. I mean these are this is like a family of these
[02:11:11.100 --> 02:11:14.060]   And I've I've been very happy with these mics
[02:11:14.060 --> 02:11:19.900]   But also with the software which allows you to change the mic pattern and add limiting and compression and all of that
[02:11:19.900 --> 02:11:22.940]   So I carry this in my in my backpack. I have this with me all the time
[02:11:22.940 --> 02:11:27.820]   And this one is the uh, the mvi which is uh, um, another
[02:11:27.820 --> 02:11:33.420]   Part of this family. So this one is um, you know, you can plug it into lightning
[02:11:33.980 --> 02:11:40.620]   Uh, that's nice. So you can use any mic with that. Yeah, so if you have another mic and you want to have it as an interface to your computer or to your
[02:11:40.620 --> 02:11:42.780]   To your iphone or ipad
[02:11:42.780 --> 02:11:47.340]   Um, you can use this as the interface. Uh, so that uses the high or whatever
[02:11:47.340 --> 02:11:52.460]   Exactly. So you already got a mic that you want, but you want to connect it to your, you know, I've you know, this is a
[02:11:52.460 --> 02:11:54.700]   You know, we've gone through lots of
[02:11:54.700 --> 02:11:55.900]   These
[02:11:55.900 --> 02:11:59.660]   You know, there's been you know for over the 10 years that there's been different versions a little heavy
[02:12:00.060 --> 02:12:05.260]   But the quality is is really nice and it's um, and again, it's really easy to set up. I actually, uh,
[02:12:05.260 --> 02:12:08.140]   um use this with
[02:12:08.140 --> 02:12:15.020]   Uh, I use it with our calm system. I actually have a clear calm system on my ipad and use this to get out to
[02:12:15.020 --> 02:12:18.380]   Speakers and headsets and stuff so it works really well
[02:12:18.380 --> 02:12:22.940]   A great recommendation from Alex lensy. I want to before we wrap thank um
[02:12:22.940 --> 02:12:27.100]   One of our viewers calvin t hues jr
[02:12:27.820 --> 02:12:34.620]   It as since we're doing a makintosh history week rapple history week on his 40th anniversary remember this the fairy first mac world
[02:12:34.620 --> 02:12:38.940]   This I think came in the box when you bought a makintosh. I know you got a subscription
[02:12:38.940 --> 02:12:43.260]   Um, but I think they might have also bundled the mac world number one
[02:12:43.260 --> 02:12:46.700]   And I couldn't pull it out and show Jason still I didn't want him to cry
[02:12:46.700 --> 02:12:52.140]   But uh, there's steve jobs in a tie actually not steve steven jobs
[02:12:52.140 --> 02:12:54.060]   in a tie
[02:12:54.060 --> 02:12:56.700]   And uh, there's inside here. There's a map of the apple
[02:12:57.420 --> 02:13:02.460]   This and all sorts of fun stuff. So, um, thank you calvin
