[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, Andy and Aco Renee Ritchie, Alex Lindsey.
[00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.360]   They're all here. We'll celebrate 10 years of Tim.
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.720]   It was 10 years ago today. Tim Cook became CEO of Apple.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.760]   We'll take a look back and a look forward to Tim's tenure.
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.280]   There's a new information anyway about the Pegasus zero-click iPhone attack
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.200]   that went around Apple's blast-door protections.
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.600]   How do they do that?
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.200]   And then we're going to talk about how T-Mobile
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.280]   is distracting us all by offering a free year of Apple TV Plus.
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.000]   It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.320]   With us, of course, the usual Mac Break Weekly Magnificent 3.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.360]   We wanted 7, but there weren't enough avatars to go over the table.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.840]   Just couldn't fit them. Alex Lindsay is here from office hours.global.
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.880]   Oh, nice. Hello. Hello.
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:15.760]   Come on, do the thing.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.800]   Do the thing. Okay. To the city. Here we go.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.440]   Oh my God. He disappeared.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.200]   I don't feel this is for the port.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.280]   So we're sitting here. We're talking everybody saying,
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.080]   well, we'll wait for Alex to show up and then he fades in slowly like Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.480]   It became what someone did.
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.880]   What happens now is because we're hanging out so much in office hours.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.840]   Someone did it and everyone was like, how did you do that?
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.760]   You know, like it was it was and then now, like I think by the end of this week,
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.560]   everyone will do it. It's not that hard, right? You just need a key and the.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.320]   Well, the ATEM, the Blackmagic, the ATEM, it has a it has a still store.
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.880]   So you can basically just hit record. So you just get out of frame.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.640]   You still start recording. Yeah.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.520]   And then you and then you auto and you do an auto from one of the other.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.880]   Dissolve from the other. I can do it too. I mean,
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:11.120]   maybe from now on, we will. I don't know. I should fade into the show.
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.920]   That sounds good. Yeah, exactly. It'd be perfect. Anyway.
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.320]   Andy and I go. The ATEM is really quite capable. It's kind of amazing.
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:25.680]   Yeah. Alex, I'm sorry. Andy and I was also here. WG B H in Boston and not go.com. Hello, Andrew.
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.280]   Hello, Leo. Well, now if you could fade the sideburns in and out, that would be or maybe like
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.880]   the Cheshire cat just disappear, except for the sideburns. That would be cool.
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.000]   Can we work on that? Alex, get still store that.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.600]   Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.600]   A little reconstruct. Now, let me let me let me give you the clean plate.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.800]   Background plate. Okay. Get the background plate. And now all you have to do, Andy is now leaving
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.800]   his seat. There's not a lot of room in there. It's hard to get that clean plate.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:02.720]   More side room. Yeah. It's a small. It's a small. It's a small room.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.800]   Thank you, Andy. And then Renee Richie, who has probably all the equipment to do that and more.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:18.000]   Hello, Renee from YouTube. All the equipment. No skill. What is it? What is steamer? That's
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.760]   what your t-shirt says. What is steamer? Oh, streamer. I think it's just streamer. Oh, okay.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.440]   I'm a steamer. You're a streamer. It goes. It's perfect. I love it. We're both punks. It's fine.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.640]   Speaking of punks, a subbility idol over the weekend. Wow, that was a trip back.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.240]   Great. You were way up front. You got some great shots. Was it with your phone over with your
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.480]   camera? So I'm kicking myself because we're in the front row. And then they say, because
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.680]   they're videotaping this, we're going to let you go right up to the rail because the camera
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.120]   operator is right in our way. And I said, okay. So I'm five feet away from Mr. Idol.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:01.760]   And then because they were filming it, he would come over. It turns out that the camera that we
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:07.760]   were next to, they said, Mr. Idol, you should go up to that camera and mug. So,
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:15.600]   so I got some good photos. Yeah, of Billy right up, right up, right up. What's the midnight hour?
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:21.360]   In the midnight hour. No, we left before that song, believe it or not. We wanted to get out of
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.800]   there before the crush. You're saying you didn't want more, more, more, less, less, less. You did
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.920]   your rebel yell, though, didn't you know, rebel yell. But it was fun. It was fun to see. But what
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:38.240]   was really fun was seeing the audience. Because of course, Mr. Idol was big in the early 80s
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:45.280]   with a launch of MTV. And the audience like myself have aged somewhat. So to see people walking
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.680]   around and studded leather with safety pins through their noses and stuff in their 50s and 60s is
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:55.760]   quite the site. I said, launch the TikTok. I need to get this. It's quite the site. Not a good site.
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:02.560]   What's the most fun site? Who I guess was a Billy Idol cosplayer, I guess? Who had the
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:09.360]   I guess had the spike hair. I mean, Mr. Idol himself is 65. He's no, he's no spring chicken. So,
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:16.080]   yeah, it was quite quite, quite fun. And yes, I was saying, I thought, I'll bring, I thought,
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.280]   should I bring a camera? Sometimes the concerts they will, you bring a camera with a detachable
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.160]   lenses that I thought, well, I could bring my Leica. But it's, it's 28 millimeters. It'll just be a
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.680]   big stage with a little teeny, meany idol. I had no ideas. Fortunately, I should show this because
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:35.680]   it really is an example of how good the iPhone is. Yeah, please do. Yeah, I can't, because I, for
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:41.040]   some reason, my Google photos, which is supposed to have everything I take on my iPhone, right?
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:48.880]   Has not yet sunk sunk up. It has not yet dained to sync your photos. Dained. Well, it is not my
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:55.280]   iPhone. It has them all. So what does that mean? It means that it needs to sync to the web. I could
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:00.800]   show you. You want to see on the web? I mean, yeah, yeah, it's better on the web, like an animal,
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:07.360]   like on a phone. So yeah, this is, so this is him mugging for the camera, which is right,
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:12.880]   which is right next to, oh my goodness. Video two. Yeah, that's, that's, that's like,
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.520]   that's like suspiciously good. Like you'd see that in an ad, like, okay, fine, they're hard
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:23.120]   Billy Idol. They built a set for him. So that the professional videographer with the phone could
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.360]   stand right there and they'll write in the light. I was very fortunate. Yeah. And he came, he came
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:34.240]   right up and he's he's shot. And I want to eat you scream. And yeah, it was, it was an
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:38.480]   adventure. It was an adventure. Contenting right there. But I have to say, you know, to make this
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:44.240]   Apple oriented, that was, I didn't need my special duper, duper, duper, canada. This is the, the
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:49.680]   telephoto 65 millimeter equivalent lens. And so I was able to get right in his face. It was good.
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:55.600]   Let's let us let us let us praise and say things of joy about that camera. That's not,
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.840]   that's not an easy shot. That was like intense blue stage lighting behind him. Oh, yeah.
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:04.960]   Spotlight of balance light in front of you'll see that the color balance was not thrown at all.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:09.760]   See the issue here is that some of it sometimes those lights you get all you get is a blue haze.
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:14.880]   They flare right in the back. So, but I was fortunate that I just kept shooting, right? That's the
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:19.200]   trick, isn't it? Yeah, it is a photo stacking. Just keep shooting. And yeah, that was the other
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:24.720]   thing I was pretty impressed with given the lighting that the camera could kind of handle it. I mean,
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:30.560]   yeah, that's impressive. You know, it's amazing. Now I admit I shot it vertical. Don't yell at me.
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:35.520]   That's what the kids do. Oh, no, they do diagonal now. The vertical is just our generation. We're
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:40.480]   finally getting there. Is it going diagonal? It's fine. Have we given up on the battle? That's vertical.
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:48.000]   That's how people are going to be watching these videos on their devices. So don't,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.320]   and also don't be one of those nudges who's like, I forbid you to enjoy your phone and enjoy your
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.560]   video the way that you choose to enjoy it. Like, for half an hour. Well, and I have to say,
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.480]   I was very conscious of people behind me and I, you know, I hate it when people are in the front row
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:06.320]   and they just hold their camera up there and shoot the concert like, oh, good. We'll go watch this
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:11.440]   over and over again. So I was very judicious. I would when he came over, I was able to snap real
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.800]   quickly. Here's, here's the shot on this. And you weren't wearing your Fez so that they could see
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:22.720]   but I did not wear my tall Fez. And I didn't use an iPad to do it. And I lowered it quickly.
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:26.480]   So I was cognizant. Oh, so is it galaxy fold? Consider taking a photo with your phone or with
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:31.200]   your tablet? Do they face the same? If you open it, are you scorned? Let me tell you my experience
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:35.120]   with the last fold. I'm not getting the new one because I just don't think that it's worth it.
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:39.680]   But to the last fold, it is a great experience shooting photos with it because you have a few
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:44.160]   fun. You're like your iPad. In fact, it's actually a little better. The iPad is so big. This is kind
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:49.040]   of nice. It's like seven inches. It's like an iPad mini. And it was just really a nice way to shoot.
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:52.960]   You really see what you're going to get. Did you get looks? Did people judge you for opening it?
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:57.680]   Take a shot. Did you get searched? I presume they were amazed that I had a folding phone.
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:02.960]   It folds. Actually, I'm not going to get the new fold too. But Friday, I will get
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:08.880]   the flip. I thought, well, I should try the flip this year. And I was able to trade in the fold
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:14.560]   and get some of that money back for the flip. You can borrow it for a month, right?
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.280]   Sounds like it has a borrowing approach. Pretty much. I think they're calling it. Yeah,
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:21.920]   like you get it for 30 days. No questions asked. They should because it really is challenging to
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:26.000]   know whether you're going to like this. And although I think even a month is not enough to know if
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.320]   the screen is going to last. But this is great even for Apple people because this is really the
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:37.440]   first generation of a foldable phone that is practical, affordable. It looks like it's going to
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.760]   be very, very popular because pre-orders are kind of through the roof on it. And so this is going to
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:46.720]   be the thing that Apple takes a look at to say that, okay, well, here is who's buying it. These
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:51.920]   are the sort of people that are also buying iPhones. Also, the technology seems to be mature enough
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:56.960]   that if we were to get into it, we could sort of buy it. Samsung can probably provide us with
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:02.400]   enough foldable screens that we can actually do this for real. So this is the first time, I think,
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:10.640]   that it's starting to leap from sort of a thing for early, early adopters, even, but early believers
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:16.400]   and into something where we can see a year or two from now where pretty much every major product line
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:20.960]   will have a foldable in it. So it's exciting news for everybody. Yeah, there were rumors. I think
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:26.160]   Gurman had them in others that Apple was trialing a folding phone. I mean, you can get those screens
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:31.200]   from Samsung. Oh, yeah. Since 2010, they've been trialing them. And I think continuously comes up
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:36.640]   with the answer, not yet, right? Right. Which I'm not sure I disagree with. There's a, you know,
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:40.880]   there's a, anyway, that's why I got the flip. I want to see. I think I think everyone who bought
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:46.880]   the first three generations of the Samsung foldables, like say, yeah, not yet. This is not yet. There's
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:52.000]   a reason why we don't even speak of like the Series zero. Same song full. Well, there's also,
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.400]   it's more than just hardware. Admittedly, I think these screens aren't really quite ready.
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:01.440]   This one is supposedly feels a little better. Last one felt like it had soft rubber on the, on
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:05.120]   which is not a good experience. But let's say they get the screens perfect and they're getting
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:08.800]   perfect. You still have to do the software. It's still a big software change. You have to kind of
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.560]   consider that. They're forcing Instagram. They have a mode you can turn on where it forces
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:16.880]   Instagram to act like a multi, like a multi windowing app, which to me is just peak Instagram.
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:22.560]   Wow. That's bizarre. Yeah. Well, I'll let you, I'm going to have it Friday. I'll have a
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:27.920]   hands-on technology review next Wednesday for you on the flip phone three and I got the gear
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:31.920]   watch for I'm going to say, really, that's a question of my mind. Can I replace an iPhone and
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:38.160]   an Apple watch with Samsung gear and be? I know it won't be as good, but hard. That's a real hard
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:43.440]   ask. It is. Isn't it? I mean, you put, especially when you put the Apple watch in, it's like,
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:48.320]   okay, you know what? We were, we were at least willing to play this game and be good losers,
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:52.080]   but we don't want the, we don't want to have to like end the game after the fifth inning because
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:57.920]   of the slaughter rule. There is once you're 18 runs ahead. There is sort of another rumor that
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:03.040]   Google may announce a Pixel six folding phone this year. Yeah, that's what I'm waiting for.
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:07.840]   Really? They said, so you'd rather get from Google than Samsung because it's cleaner.
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:13.360]   Yeah. Yeah. I like Samsung, but Google is just like last year I felt Google was lost. Like I just
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.400]   had no idea what they were doing anymore. And this year they got their crap together again.
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:20.560]   Some. And I generally prefer Google's implementation. Yes. I'm with you exactly.
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:26.880]   I think the Pixel six will be my Android phone. Andy, Andy, you use a Pixel, right? Not a Samsung.
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:32.480]   I have a, I have a four A that I bought last year. Oh, you do, you do, man. You do. Well, it's,
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:39.360]   it's the thing. Well, the thing is actually a pretty good phone. Google, Google has really,
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:47.440]   really shown their ability to make an exceptionally good $350 phone. And this is why I bought it kind
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:53.440]   of as a stopgap thinking that right my pixel one was now like officially no longer being supported
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:58.720]   with security updates. So it had to go. But I bought this as a stopgap thinking that if I don't
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:04.240]   see an iPhone that excites me in 2021 or if I don't see a pixel phone that excites me in 2021,
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:09.840]   I'll have absolutely no problem sitting with this for another year. But yeah, I mean, either,
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:16.480]   either way, I'm, I'm glad to see so much. I'm glad to see that I don't have to like be kind of
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:23.040]   resigned to okay, new phone announcement from Google. Like wonder, I wonder if they'll have a new
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:29.200]   color in the body, but still have a three year old camera sensor and basically just just basic
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:33.360]   improvements. It's interesting. Google has Apple and V because they're going to put their own
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:38.240]   supposedly their own system in a chip on a chip. Although I think we know now that Samsung's
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:44.480]   making it. So I don't know. It's an Exynos chip with a sense of Google, am I? Yeah.
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:50.800]   It's I'm really glad that they're doing they're doing affordable phone. And I'm really glad people
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:54.800]   are buying it. But I'm gonna wait and just watch it. Yeah, you should. I'm glad that getting through
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:58.640]   all those cycles. But I'm just amazed that people will pay to be really a beta test. Like,
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:04.640]   hey, this is like your pain in the above program. These are not cheap. But see, that's I have to do
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:08.320]   it because I should do it. So you don't have to, right? I'm that's right. I, you know,
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:12.160]   I'm really adopted to just love that stuff. Like they buy like edge case, everything. They
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:16.400]   just want the latest different like they're so bored with modern technology, they'll take
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.760]   anything that's different. They want to be part of the experimenting process. It's like an explorer.
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:23.520]   You want to leave more of that? Yeah. And Apple Meanwhile, it just tries all the stuff.
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:28.800]   Effect. The rumor is that the under, under screen camera on the Galaxy Fold, not rumor,
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:33.760]   reviews are it's terrible. What a surprise. Apple was looking at something like that.
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:38.400]   But I think the notch survives according to rumor in the iPhone. It's not ready. It's not ready
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:43.840]   for mass market. Apparently, Apple's also rejecting the under screen fingerprint reader for next year.
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:48.800]   At least that's, yeah, that's again, rumor. You know, I mean, you got you got to be really,
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:54.480]   really a finicky design person to decide that a simple hole punch in the screen is just so
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:16:00.240]   offensive to your sensibilities that it has to go. It doesn't matter if if you compromise the
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:06.800]   the front facing camera. It doesn't matter if it makes it completely hard completely hard to use
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:13.520]   and and compromises how easy it is to sign in on the device. I think I really think that's a way
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:18.960]   too hard line of stance to take. I don't even I don't even mind the notch on the on the iPhones.
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:23.600]   It's like it serves a purpose. It lets you gives you some extra screen screen real estate.
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:28.160]   Apple has done a great job of taking advantage of the two, like little kitty ears on the left
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:32.480]   and the right. So it's not as though it's it's completely wasted space. And when you're watching
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:37.600]   full screen video because of the way they've designed it into the frame, you don't even notice
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:42.080]   that that part of the screen is missing. So there there's some things I think that you really have
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:49.680]   to be a design walk to just be like goodness. I also think it's design. I don't think it's
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:54.000]   design. I think they have two tensions that they're always facing. One is the Asian market is such
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.200]   a wicked spec flex that they feel pressure from Huawei and and all those other pieces like they're
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:03.040]   doing it. We have to do we have to do it first. We have to do it bigger. But also they sell so much.
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:06.720]   I think half of every phone they make is like we can offer you these components. We're going to
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:10.080]   show you the components we offer. If you'd like some of them, please come buy them because that's
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:14.800]   what we make most of our money. And I think that there's an opportunity for Apple to have a pro
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:18.480]   pro phone like you know like a real pro phone with the hey, we're just going to take the same
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:24.080]   you know sensor and lens and everything else from the back of the phone and put it on the
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:28.320]   front of the phone and we're just going to make it longer put a bunch of an array of LiDAR and
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:31.600]   other things all down the side. And there's people like me that would buy that easily.
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.960]   Like we wouldn't wouldn't think anything of it. And I don't think I'm the only person that would
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:39.280]   buy it. I mean, we've talked a lot about it. I think that you know anybody doing you know again
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:45.600]   Instagram or creators but anybody who really wants to take those photos. You know you could charge a
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:51.360]   premium for that and have just great great sensors and photos on the front and not worry about it.
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:55.600]   Just make it black. You know and put a bunch of things down that side for us for those of us who
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:00.560]   want to play hard. I think that that's an opportunity that Apple really is one of the few companies that
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:09.440]   could take advantage of that. So let's I guess this little tour really take a break. I want to do
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:15.440]   a tribute to Tim Cook because this is the 10th anniversary of him becoming an Apple CEO and I
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:21.760]   want to take some time with that. So I guess it's not it's not too early to do. We'll do a quick break
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:29.200]   and then when we come back 10 years of Tim and we have some fun pictures to go with it. Our show
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:37.440]   today brought to you by AT&T active armor. This is a godsend. You know these days you use your
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:43.280]   phone all the time not just to listen to this show or watch it or stream from your favorite streaming
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:50.720]   service. Loki or Mandalorian or whatever. But catching up on family video calls we do that every
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:55.360]   week and our family. It's really fun to talk to everybody who's far flung. The last thing you want
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:59.920]   to do in the middle of any of that is get a fraudulent call saying your auto warranty is run out.
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:07.440]   Well thankfully AT&T makes customer security a priority helping block those pesky calls. It's

[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:33.840]   for details. Thank you AT&T for your support of Mac Break Weekly. Tim Cook 10 years ago I love
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:40.960]   this picture. I don't know what he's looking at. Something up there in the heavens. Maybe he's
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:46.880]   looking at Steve. I don't know. It was 10 years ago actually that Steve Jobs sent that famous letter
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:57.840]   naming Tim Cook as the new CEO of Apple. He said Apple is not going to change. But of course one
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:04.000]   of the pieces of advice Cook has later said that Steve Jobs gave him is not to ask what Steve would
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:10.480]   do but to ask what he would do. Great I think think piece and apple insider this week by William
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:16.240]   Gallagher speaking of pictures there's some great pictures of his Tim a little bit younger with Steve
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:21.200]   during this kind of transitional phase where Tim was being groomed he was this chief operating
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:26.800]   officer being groomed to take over as CEO but this is my favorite row of pictures. Tim Cook
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:35.120]   from 1978 which means he must have been in high school right 1982 that's probably at Auburn
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:40.400]   then as a young uh was where did he start his career wasn't it Apple wasn't
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:48.800]   compact before compact that's right yeah he really really was marked for greatness early on he
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:54.640]   if you look at the jobs that he took and how quickly he escalated from company to company
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:21:03.840]   he definitely had his it's almost as if he decided that my job in life is to run a big multi a big
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:10.960]   organization that can make change at a world level because he was there there are people who take a
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:15.360]   job and they want to do a great job at that one place they found their home and they want to stay
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:19.680]   there and there are other people who are like I've learned everything I can here where can I go
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:25.280]   next to learn more as a as a I think most from president as a high school senior which is this
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:31.600]   this left hand picture with the fro he went decided to go to Auburn where he did study in fact
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:37.680]   computer science coding and technology went from Auburn right out of school to IBM
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:45.760]   the PC had launched in 81 he he graduated in 82 so he joined the team at the research triangle in
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:51.200]   North Carolina working on the PC you've spent a dozen years working on the PC and then as you
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:22:00.400]   said he he went on to uh to compact one of the things that uh he uh kind of pioneered
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:06.880]   in those early years before he went to Apple was just in time manufacturer and that's the thing he
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:13.600]   brought to Apple was this idea of you make it when you need it not before you don't stockpile a lot of
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:19.440]   a lot of stuff in the warehouse and I think that that's what I mean there's a I think a saying that
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:24.320]   that from Omar Bradley that you know amateurs talk about strategy professionals talk about logistics
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:29.520]   right and what he really brought to Apple over time was logistics you know of really understanding
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:36.560]   how to you know get the most out of the the supply supply chain in a stable way you know and and a
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:41.920]   cost effective way as well yeah given what they were doing briefly in between um IBM and compact
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:48.720]   he worked at a company called intelligent electronics he was a chief operating officer there uh
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:56.800]   this is also from the great piece in Apple insider he had a serious illness or serious scare anyway
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:01.360]   they thought he might have multiple sclerosis which of course is a degenerative disease and would
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:06.080]   have changed the course of his life it turned out it was just exhaustion he had just worked himself
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:15.680]   into a state uh i.e. sold in 1997 a general electric cook left and join a compact but you have to
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:21.920]   think that this whole time uh cook is learning the logistics part but and I you know I think it's a
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:28.640]   good it's a it's a pithy quote Alex but you do have to make strategy at some point you can yeah you
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:33.360]   you got to do more than just build supply lines to your existing uh no it's just that it's just
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:38.240]   that that those logistics um you know the logistics support you to make the strategy you know like
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:44.400]   you can you can do it you have to have a good point but if you don't have you know you don't have a
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:50.000]   bigger plan of how to actually get it done it doesn't matter what you what you want to do he joined
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:57.680]   he joined apple march 11th 1998 he spoke about the decision in a commencement speech at mit he said
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:02.880]   i was never going to find my purpose working someplace without a clear sense of purpose of its own
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:09.200]   i was talking about compact here i tried meditation i saw guidance and religion i read great
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:14.320]   philosophers and authors in a moment of youthful and discretion i might even have experimented with
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:23.600]   the windows pc and obviously that didn't work he got an offer from apple uh march 1998 half
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:30.560]   million dollar signing bonus four hundred thousand dollars a year uh salary so it was a good move
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:40.640]   didro brian uh was currently head of apple retail was apple people uh says to this day i
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:45.840]   remember meeting tim and right off the bed it was very clear he was very focused he was incredibly
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:50.640]   excited about being at apple he had a big job to do you could tell he knew he had a mission he was
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:58.400]   looking for a mission and he found one uh at apple um by so a year six months after joining he got
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:06.160]   apple's inventory down from 30 days to six the following year he got it down to two this is that
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:13.520]   just in time manufacturing um so very yeah very interesting has here's the there's two questions
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:20.080]   though as we look back at ten years one uh has it been a good ten years from apple i think you'd
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:26.480]   have to say yes yeah uh not that he created i don't think he brought anything did he bring
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:32.720]   anything new to the table is there uh i mean the apple watch was already uh a product going to be
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:36.320]   a product he and he introduced it but it was already going to be a product certainly the
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:41.120]   iPad and the iPhone and the Mac were long standing products by the time he took over as CEO
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:48.320]   i think there's a lot of probably things coming and those are those are pretty good business models
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:53.280]   pretty good pretty good product line you know the the um it's hard to come up with something that
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:59.440]   is truly revolutionary every year um i think that even apple only did it a couple times um and the
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:07.680]   i think that i think he has fared better than steve would in some ways um in just being able to
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:13.200]   manage the very complex you know both global infrastructure as well as the politics you know
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:17.920]   steve didn't really have any time for that you know and so so i think that that he's been able to
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:22.800]   work through a lot of things that were that i don't think steve would have handled as well there's no
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:28.480]   question it was a perfect foil for steve he was the down-to-earth operations guy could manage the
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:35.040]   politics could manage the company but you but but for the first 10 you know 10 years of his more than
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:41.840]   that 12 years of his 10 year at apple he had steve jobs to kind of say charge and to point the
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:47.920]   company in the direction it was going to go uh if to some degree i think was always our concern
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:53.600]   back in 2011 that he would just continue to go in that direction but wouldn't forge new paths
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:59.280]   andy i don't know that yeah i think it's the the more interesting question for me is is apple in a
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:03.680]   better position today than it was 10 years ago and i think the question is the answer is definitely
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:09.120]   yes one of the biggest questions that analysts and even people who like apple were asked themselves
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:15.280]   is okay but look at how much of your revenue is coming from the iphone what happens when somebody
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:22.400]   blackberries apple if that's such if such thing as possible and suddenly it's no longer relevant or
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:27.280]   suddenly everybody can make a phone that says good and as attractive as an iphone only if they
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:33.040]   want a purple one they get one in purple uh and now every time that there's a new revenue chart
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:38.720]   that that there's still making the lion's share of money off of the iphone but services accessories
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:43.360]   those are just gaining gaining gaining knowing that this is not a one trick pony that they
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:50.000]   i used to think that they were a a hardware design company and they're they're design company that
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.600]   likes to express its art through the creation of technology designs now i really do think that
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:28:00.880]   they have an an aesthetic that they can apply to pretty much any product that they want to put out
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:06.480]   there even if it's just pushing electrons through wire so i i mean i i'm not going to guess whether
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:12.080]   apple would be and as good a position under steve or not i can't predict that sort of thing but i
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:18.480]   think very very clearly that uh there's no there's if people had any question as to whether apple
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:23.840]   could survive without steve jobs at the helm now it's almost impossible to imagine a world without
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:30.240]   apple as a dominant player as an influential and independent player on the world stage you know and
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:35.120]   we were talking before the show about how i don't think the financial markets are germane to whether
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:39.440]   a company is good or not it's just right you know the financial bet on whether the company is going
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:44.480]   to make money in the future but i should point out that the apple stock price did go up one thousand
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:51.120]   twenty two percent under under cooks leadership which is well insignificant they become a nearly
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:57.840]   two trillion dollar company under him and and i and i think that um you know the revenue has gone up
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:02.560]   a little bit too in addition to the and into the stock price it's not just that the stock price
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:08.080]   has gone up it is that that apple just continues to perform better than you know each quarter almost
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:15.280]   almost in straight lines um you know every quarter from the year before so that's it's quite a thing
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:19.200]   you know to be able to do at that at that at that size you know and the thing that right now
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:25.600]   is kind of you know scared what's scaring people about apple right now is that in many ways it's
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:30.480]   still moving like a startup and and it's this massive company you know so when you start doing
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:34.960]   things like oh you know when we talk about you know as apple doing something revolutionary the
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:39.920]   system on a chip is is going to be a big deal you know like this is not this is going to change a
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:44.000]   lot of things as it keeps on growing you know because now they have a unified architecture and
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.560]   that is going to be very very hard to compete and very very hard to replicate i mean other people
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:52.720]   are talking about it but saying they're going to do it and doing it are two very very different
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:58.560]   things yeah that's a really good example of taking a a precept of steve job which is uh you've got
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:04.880]   to make the whole stack and using your operational ability to actually make it happen i mean and
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:09.760]   and when you look at the scale of that i mean you have to be at apple scale to be able to do that
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:12.880]   you have to have those products to be able to do that and when they start talking about in the
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:17.840]   quarterly legacy components it means that they're not done yet you know like they're they're going
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:23.280]   to get rid of all of it you know until they own the whole the whole stack you know and and at that point
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:28.160]   their ability to innovate very quickly and very quietly you know where and and because they have
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:34.800]   xcode because they have the you know this is a very very vertical integration that becomes very
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:40.240]   very difficult to compete with because it is so efficient you know and and so that's going to be
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:44.880]   something and i think that that's that's something that is very much what tim what is what steve
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:49.760]   dreamt about doing and i think tim is executing it apple was worth three hundred forty nine billion
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:53.920]   dollars kind of sorry to believe three hundred forty nine billion dollars when cook took over
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:31:01.760]   it's now more than two point four five trillion dollars he added two trillion dollars to apple's
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:08.240]   market value that's that's pretty good i mean that's a success i mean certainly that is the number
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:17.040]   one job of a ceo the i guess is his report card's gonna depend a little bit on what apple does next
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:24.320]   yes whether ar or the car or whatever else they've got going i think i think apple silicon is a is a
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:32.480]   a plus but then what's next right how do you product the most i think the most important
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:38.640]   thing for any company particularly at that scale is to earn the ability to call their own destiny
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:43.440]   and apple certainly has that it's it's a problem when you find yourself in a position where oh my
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:50.560]   god we haven't we haven't had a market beating product uh uh since we released the air pods so we
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:53.840]   have to actually we have to come up with something that gets people's attention and really really
[00:31:53.840 --> 00:32:00.000]   sells in the quadrillions of units like well no apple just simply has to keep doing what it keep
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.840]   it just they just have to keep their game plan they don't have to be dictated to uh by the marketplace
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:11.840]   right now they can continue to drive their company in a place that they think make sense for
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:17.440]   their business strategy their product lines their goals their aesthetic and all that other sort of
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:23.200]   stuff whether they get there strictly by services where they get get there by creating a product that
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:30.960]   does take people's imagination like god for god if only god can imagine a pair of like sunglasses
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:36.400]   that are so stylish that just like the apple watch just like the air pods that people will want to
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:41.680]   be seen wearing them whether they need glasses or not and yet packs actual practical functionality
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:46.400]   of them again that would be revolutionary that's when you that's something that Tim is excited about
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:51.760]   it's one of the few things that is an unannounced apple product that Tim will talk about during
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:55.600]   calls and during interviews so you know that that's something that is going to happen to come hell
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:33:00.080]   or high water but that's really not about the next breakthrough product that's a that's something
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:05.840]   that a smaller company really really has to keep focusing on and one of the things that we can't
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:12.800]   ignore is that it's apple against pretty much everybody else in that space one of the reasons why
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:18.880]   apple is able to make the whole widget as we say and create that whole chip create
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:22.880]   now work on their own modem chips doing whatever they want is because they are the only company
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:29.360]   that makes phones that run ios whereas if they did have to compete with an entire world market
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:36.000]   of that has to create an indian localized phone not just for local laws and production
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.560]   production requirements but also because of this market is different from any other world market
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:46.000]   if they had to compete state by state by state worldwide that would be something they're really
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.280]   not capable of doing and they would be in big big trouble the fact that they have managed to
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:56.320]   define a phone market that is all theirs that again they can control and they don't have to respond
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:34:00.800]   they don't have to create a blister pack fifty dollar phone that has smart features and can run
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:04.320]   facebook messenger they don't have to do that if they don't want to and clearly they have taste
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:09.680]   and they don't want to Renee is it augmented reality you think that's going to be the next big thing
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:16.960]   they don't have to but i feel like they ought they need to they want to right and services as
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:22.240]   much as they've propelled apple forward aren't going to be the next big thing i don't think for apple
[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:27.920]   is it augmented reality because i think my audio has been off for a while oh my god i'm so sorry
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:31.360]   i'm here you know what happened to you we're like what happened to you i just thought he was being
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:36.480]   polite letting you know i just letting us win bags take over but it didn't seem to work oh now we
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:41.680]   hear you go ahead okay okay good um yeah so i can best answer this for like this little anecdote
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:47.440]   which i thought was delightful and it's from a couple years ago when i flew into um san francisco
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:52.000]   airport and i was on my way to an apple event and the uber driver said that she used or the lift
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.520]   driver said that she used to work for tim cook and you always hear these kind of stories so i very
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:35:00.880]   casually and quickly just linked in search for the name on the on the lifting and lo and behold she
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:06.320]   was head of apple of mac logistics for a long time under tim cook and she retired when a lot of it
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:10.320]   moved to china because she didn't want to travel but she said he was he was amazing she would come
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:14.560]   in every week and she would give him her report he'd remember what was in the exact spread she'd
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:19.360]   shell from cell from like three or four weeks ago a month ago he had an incredible memory for that
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:23.360]   stuff but one day he didn't feel like he didn't sound like himself and she asked him what was going
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:28.640]   on he said steves making me go work in marketing for a while oh wow what do you mean he's like he
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:32.400]   says i have to know how to run the whole company and i'm really i'm really good at my job but i've
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:38.320]   never done marketing and i don't really understand all these things and i think that steves point um
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:42.080]   and so he put him in charge of a product the way that they've put like jeff williams in charge of
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:48.560]   apple watch and every executive has to run at least one one product these days um and he was just
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:51.920]   like he knew it was an important step in becoming apple but it was just a complete
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:56.960]   fish out of water situation for him and then a while later she came back and he could describe
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:01.600]   all the materials in the staircases and apple retail stores and how they were putting together
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:06.880]   the user experience for a particular product and it it sounded like it was an incredible shift in
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:14.240]   focus for him and because his perspective is so logistical based like he was codifying what apple
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:19.360]   was like steve was just very top of my head and almost like a pixar like sense before disney
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:24.160]   bought them you had profound genius but also a few complete flubs and an apple you had
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:29.760]   profound steve jobs genius but also a few like really bad takes that it would be like normalized
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:35.840]   but codified in like apple university but also in the in the tim cook doctrine which is apple only
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:40.000]   invests in technologies where they think they can make a substantive difference in the experience
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.920]   that they provide to users like they can have an impact and i think that's why he's willing to
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:50.640]   talk about ar and ai um these types of products because to him they're like screen technology
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:55.200]   everything has a display so talking about displays isn't a big deal and in the future of apple
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:37:00.720]   everything will have some component of automation artificial intelligence silicon and augmented
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:05.760]   reality and that's really where he sees the vision and he'll say like health care is the most
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:10.160]   important thing apple ever worked on but getting to theirs probably gonna involve a whole bunch
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:15.440]   of robots a whole bunch of machine learning and a whole bunch of silicon to power it all
[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:20.400]   and i think that's sort of what tim brings to the apple table it's his ability to do all of that
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:26.240]   stuff with really good logistics to that famous saying only only steve jobs could imagine an ipad
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:31.680]   but only tim cook and produce it for 500 bucks it's really a credit to steve jobs and maybe to
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:38.240]   serendipity or good luck that they found a guy that was such a perfect replacement and obviously
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:43.440]   you know i remember that as steve was getting sicker and sicker uh a lot of the conversation
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:49.440]   was is is he doing anything to prepare for succession because there was it as usual with apple there
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:55.200]   was no announcement there was no obvious movement going on but clearly he was when he's telling
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:38:01.680]   tim some like tim cook okay now you gotta spend time in marketing that's that's very clear so
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:07.600]   seve jobs picked somebody picked exactly right guy and then made sure he was equipped to take over
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:12.080]   at exactly the right time so a lot of credit to seve jobs for that as well and and accredited
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:18.160]   tim cookin in in the he's the type of person that was willing to stay in the back in the you know
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:22.400]   behind steve until it was time for him to step forward so that's another reason why he was the
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:27.200]   perfect apple man right that's what you want right but that's that's that's hard to find you
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:32.640]   working a lot of companies and executives get you know they they get uh inpatient oh yeah you know
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:36.400]   and they and they want to you know they want to move forward they want to push things you know
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:41.760]   onward and that becomes um you know problematic there's a long trail of people who've left
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:46.240]   Microsoft because they realize they were never going to get to be ceo right and they're and
[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:52.160]   the Microsoft's a perfect and antithesis to the synthesis of my thing signed on in the newspaper
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:57.200]   because yeah yeah uh where it's just really it's it's kind of competitive it's kind of
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:04.880]   survivor uh to get to be ceo but but apple this is where apple really is a remarkable company they
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:10.000]   they're very cohesive they've you know everybody's kind of pulling the oars in the same direction
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:17.040]   yeah i think part part of the key is that they're legendary for not making each of their like top
[00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:23.040]   tier uh vice presidents division heads feel as though like they're jockeying for resources they're
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:28.800]   jockeying for attention they're jockeying for the company's focus it's you can get so much out of
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:33.680]   people that you're working with if you make sure that you that they are genuinely part of the big
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:39.200]   picture and genuinely part of the project progress but process i think it's amazing that apple if
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:45.520]   you once you get into the the vp suites at apple once you're one of let's say the the those six
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:51.360]   people that tend to appear uh on stage who are not engineers during keynotes and stuff these people
[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:55.680]   have they don't just they don't just stick around until they get a good offer to be a ceo someplace
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:40:00.160]   else they're lifer that's really true that's not that's not because it's not because of the money
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:06.640]   i'm sure because after after three or four years in that job you have no need of any money whatsoever
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:11.200]   they you that that is the residue of people who are feeling fulfilled and satisfied and once again
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:16.240]   once you're at that level you're you start to think about how am i making the best use of my time on
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:21.760]   this planet am i creating am i using my point of view to make positive change for the world and
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:25.520]   sometimes it really is a commercial thing not necessarily feeding the they're feeding the hungry
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:30.160]   really it's just about creating a good service or good product and these people are filling
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:35.440]   fill filled fulfilled apparently company like uh microsoft i think has the point of view that it
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:41.920]   it needs to be Darwinian there's whoever can whoever can survive the competition is the guy who should
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:47.360]   get to uh do the job and there's a constant turnover there apple has this you know it must go back to
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:52.560]   steve and it must go back to the new the second coming of steve and the kinder gentler steve
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:56.640]   the functional organization too it's like everyone those organizations is basically run like a company
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:41:00.960]   like the the senior vice-president are basically presidents of their own company like eddy q has
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:05.200]   his own events team his own marketing team his own software development team and that's just for the
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:09.200]   saw that's like not craig's team that's eddy's software development team for like i work and all
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:14.000]   the other stuff and craig has a child like they all have these incredibly functional organizations
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.240]   and it'd be hard never mind be the CEO of apple it would be hard to have a position as influential
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:22.960]   as being the senior vice president of software at apple or services at apple or read like
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:28.400]   angel angela left berberry CEO berberry to be senior vice president of retail at apple she did not stick
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:33.280]   around though which is interesting she was she was the counter example because of of all the uh
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:39.200]   lives executives she was gonna do yeah yeah but then there's people like kevin lynch
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:46.080]   who just got moved over to cars it's like uh clearly these people are team players and just like a
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:50.560]   good football team when they're told okay you're playing a new position tomorrow they go okay
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:54.880]   put me in coach well he's designing experiences like his genius was being able to make an
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:58.240]   experience that would last two seconds on an apple watch and now they need an experience that
[00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:02.640]   will last at a glance on a car dashboard yeah and so like they all have very specific like
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:07.920]   alex they have very particular skills and they're being deployed to exercise let me this is very
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:15.360]   touching i remember this it was in the evening uh august 24th 2011 after the markets had closed
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:20.080]   uh apple released this to the apple board of directors in the apple community i've always
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:25.120]   said steve jobs writing if there ever came a day when i could no longer meet my duties and
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:30.640]   expectations as apples ceo i'll be the first to let you know unfortunately that day has come
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:36.800]   he was very sick by this time i hereby resign as ceo of apple i would like to serve if the board
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:42.800]   sees fit is chairman of the board director and apple employee as far as my successor goes i
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:49.040]   strongly recommend that we execute our succession plan and name tim cook is ceo of apple i believe
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:53.520]   apples brightest and most innovative days are ahead of it and i look forward to watching and
[00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:57.680]   contributing to its success in a new role i've made some of the best friends of my life at apple
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:02.320]   and i thank you all for the many years of being able to work alongside you very poignant because
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:07.680]   of course it was only about four months after that that he passed away and the reverence that
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:11.920]   tim always has for steve like you hear it in his like in his talks and in his quotes or he would say
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:17.360]   sorry my boss is calling or i've got to go see the boss now it's just yeah it never changed and i
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:24.080]   i wonder at this point if some of that is part of keeping the uh you if to keep everybody
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:29.840]   wrong in the same direction you have to have a kind of a fundamental belief and founding concept
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:35.440]   that everybody buys into them almost a mythos that everybody buys into and says yeah we're
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:41.680]   going to do that and steve is a big part of that right and i think tim would be it's i think it's
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:47.040]   wise of tim to continue to revere steve while saying we're going to forge our own way forward
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:51.040]   we're going to do what's right for the katirby's apology but you have to have that mythos don't you
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:58.080]   we definitely have a culture i mean i think that the culture is you know the um there's uh
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:03.840]   there's often there's a story uh that bounces around about you know an engineer walked in on a
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:09.520]   monday and asked steve how the how the his weekend was he just just innocuous thing and steve didn't
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:13.120]   even look at him and just said how about we bring up the the intelligence of the conversation
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:19.200]   you know that's for steve jobs but but that was also the that was the first generation steve
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:27.120]   jobs right there no no that was that was deep to no okay so but but but the the the thing about
[00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:32.480]   about apple uh is that you know it's in a lot of those meetings i mean what you hear a lot is
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:36.000]   is that those meetings are pretty focused there's not a lot of like you know there's a there's a
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.520]   reason that there's a meeting here and we're gonna meet until we're with for that reason and
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:43.040]   there's not a lot of kicking other things around during that meeting and you can do that at lunch
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:45.840]   you can do it and you know more but if you have a meeting about something you're gonna have a
[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:48.640]   meeting about that thing you know and you're not going to talk about a lot of other things
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:55.120]   other than that thing you know and and it's a very very focused culture um you know and
[00:44:55.120 --> 00:45:00.160]   compared to a lot of the other companies that we're are in the same space right so uh i said
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:05.280]   there were two questions the next one is who's next uh tim's 60 he's probably going to be there
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:12.880]   five more years but i imagine just as steve had a succession plan tim must be thinking along those
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:18.640]   lines yes or no he is said he's not leaving right now it's jennifer leams it's it's Williams
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:23.360]   yeah it was the same thing with jeff williams he's put him in charge of things he's like
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:28.400]   yeah yeah so he he was basically working for him in logistics and then he became chief operating
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:34.800]   officer when uh tim cook became ceo shortly thereafter and then because he was getting more and more
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:38.880]   expansive duties the same way tim may sorry steve made tim do more and more things jeff was put
[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:42.640]   in charge of the watch put in charge of health put in charge of not only one problem with that
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:47.120]   and design he's only two years younger than tim but he's so tall leo
[00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:55.760]   i mean don't you want somebody who's in his 40s to or 50s maybe uh well you want the if you get hit
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:59.440]   by a bus person and then you probably want the next 50 years person and they're not always the
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:05.760]   same person right luka mace tree eddie q
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:13.440]   kevin lynch sexy sexy craig federiggy craig oh let's not forget the hair i mean i think you i think
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:18.800]   you go by how many buttons they leave open i mean i i i think you i think you you have to look at uh
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:23.840]   any of the senior vice-presidents i mean those are all of them are in the running in the play yeah
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:29.280]   yeah jaws is a genius let's not forget jaws yeah i always think a jaws is a more of a
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:35.360]   technical guy than a uh yes but i i've always i mean he's probably the senior executive i've
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:41.200]   spent them i've i spent the most time with one-on-one and he's always really he always really impressed
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:48.000]   me as someone who is a very very fluid flexible and lateral thinker you know where he seems to have
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.160]   a mindset that he can apply to a whole bunch of different topics and a whole bunch of different
[00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:56.960]   problems as opposed to this is what he was trained to do he does that really well and he will hire
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:03.040]   some people to help him out with the other stuff uh and he also has the ability to really get people
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:07.840]   i i feel as though he has the ability to get people pushing all pushing and pulling in the same
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:14.720]   directions uh ideally only one at this at the at the at a technical time uh at the way that a
[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:21.440]   really good ceo should so i mean i i i've no idea about inside baseball about things like that but
[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:26.000]   yeah i mean that's the that's the name that i would be thinking about if that that would get me really
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.560]   interested you definitely you're definitely not gonna get somebody who wasn't a real lifer because
[00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:36.080]   that really is an absolute culture you need you need to groom so you need to groom a man or a woman
[00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:42.800]   to be an apple type ceo almost almost maybe that's one of the reasons why you don't see them jumping
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:47.600]   ship because after 10 years at apple they're really not housebroken for other companies anymore i
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:52.560]   know if they're not and they're they're used to wait a minute but but the senior vice president
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:57.200]   on the ceo said that this is a priority for the company why are you not doing this well because
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:03.040]   uh i got this offer i got this offer from waymo like well screw waymo you're gonna apple now uh
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:08.480]   so i have to say though the one of the benefits of tim cook was that he had had a career at i b m
[00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:13.760]   and compact uh he had some outside experience he was at apple 13 years before he became ceo
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:19.440]   so maybe that's the best of both worlds because it's nice to get some other genetics into the dna
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:26.560]   yeah isn't it or maybe not well at that at the senior vice president level they're they really
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:31.520]   all seem like they were they're they're they're not brothers and sisters but they're at the minimum
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:36.720]   cousins you can see you can see the shared dna of the thinking of all of them so you don't you don't
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:43.600]   really have that one maverick who is just who's turns up on cnn saying something that disagrees with
[00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:48.960]   like you know what i i really think we did screw up this idea about about uh about screening people's
[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:53.680]   photos on device i mean i i was against it but you know we always talk about you you don't feel people
[00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:59.120]   you don't have people flying off the coupe like that yeah um i mean eddie q's been there since
[00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:09.680]   89 jaws since 86 craig federigi has actually been at apple twice he he was at next to yeah uh john
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:15.440]   john andrea is probably the most recent uh guy on the on the team he came from google many years at
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:23.360]   google um i don't know it's an interesting so it's in this group of uh 12 anyway um but you're you're
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:27.200]   right no sir number one amazing it'd be like silicone is unforgivable wouldn't that be interesting
[00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:34.080]   see seruji meeting yeah he's only been there since 2008 so he was in tell i'd be in before that what
[00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:38.800]   i didn't you are right the all these all of these faces have a bunch of things in common not only
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:42.960]   that they're all that they i think they're all white not only that there's only i think one senior
[00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:48.960]   vice president who's a woman but also because i think almost all of these people were have been
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:54.640]   with apple long enough to have had steve jobs as a boss or as at the top of the tree i think it's
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:59.520]   gonna be most interesting when most the senior vice presidents for them steve jobs was a what is
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:03.120]   as a legend isn't that interesting yeah that floats around the front of the place there's two
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:08.640]   women is katherine adams is the general councilor along with doo-duro brine um yeah it's interesting
[00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:12.240]   and then you have this kind of the second tier of people like lisa jackson
[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:18.080]   uh fill shiller i guess fills kind of fill fills not around really anymore is he uh
[00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:23.360]   yeah he reminds the events in the app store stittle yeah oh okay i thought he was mostly out
[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:24.480]   he's an apple fella
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:29.600]   i mean the app store just might not have been as big a deal as he thought it would
[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:36.000]   be this year yeah well no they gave me tough assignment actually it's it hey congratulations
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:40.800]   you're running app store look at it they an apple fella you're gonna get app store and events oh by
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:43.840]   the way there's a pandemic we're gonna change the entire way we do events oh by the way we're
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:47.120]   being sued by everybody yeah you're gonna have to do a lot of stuff with the app store this year
[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:53.040]   yeah he's like ah can i give those to can i give those to jaws too nope so there's there's it's uh
[00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:58.800]   anyway uh it's a good time for a victory lap for tim cook ten years in as ceo no question he's made
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:05.040]   this company hugely successful and its shareholders very wealthy uh but he's also uh i think been a
[00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:10.400]   good steward of of the steve jobs legacy um but that there is always that nagging question what
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:15.200]   it what are you gonna do what's gonna be your what are you gonna put your mark tim what will people
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:22.080]   look back and say oh that was the tim cook thing well i think i i actually see that as a i actually
[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:27.840]   see that as a positive thing that his his priority is keeping apple successful keeping apple productive
[00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:35.920]   and influential uh and making sure the character of apples remains relevant for 2021 i i would be
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:40.560]   i would be very very concerned about like a john lee gasey who was like i need i need to i need to
[00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:45.280]   have a steve jobs type product newton message pad right get get that off the get that off the the
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:50.880]   whiteboard start making it i want to i want a keynote about this in about a year so this is it's
[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:55.200]   not a bad thing and i think that there's been an incredible amount of patience on apple apple is
[00:51:55.200 --> 00:52:01.120]   like they're spooling up a lot you can just see you can see this fooling you know when you look
[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:05.040]   at the ar prop thing that they're they're solving so many problems google just popped out and said
[00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:10.160]   okay we're gonna do ar five years ago yeah and and and there was no there was no uh groundwork there
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:15.200]   was no foundation there was no process you know apple is slowly giving us all these tools that we
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:20.960]   need to create all that to take full advantage of it and that's that takes so much to to to stay
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:28.080]   to be willing and be able to work on products for a decade and be able to you know slowly year by
[00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:33.040]   year by year roll out the pieces that you need and letting people assimilate those pieces before
[00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:37.520]   you roll out something that's going to be bigger and more interesting i think that apple you know
[00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:43.280]   last the last decade was better than this last decade uh was better than the decade before it
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:47.920]   which was better than definitely better than the decade before that and i think the next decade
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:51.840]   is going to be better than this one i mean you know it's it is uh you know i think they have a lot
[00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:55.760]   in front of them there's a lot of places they could go i think that i think of anything apple
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:53:00.400]   limits itself by its focus i think that it i think i make sense that it's focused but there are so
[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:06.640]   many verticals of people doing making bad bad products right there's so many places for them to
[00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:11.520]   go you know like cars cars and possibly ar those are those are good ones to go but i look at everything
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:15.520]   in my kitchen just go there's almost no product that i think apple couldn't do much better than what i
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:20.800]   have now there's a lot of discipline and that's that's what Steve Jobs brought back and Steve
[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:27.600]   2.0 and and Tim is is very disciplined i think that's exactly right i think ar if anything in five
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:33.120]   years if we're talking about Tim Cook's plans to retire if anything you're going to say apple silicon
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:40.400]   and you're going to say uh i would bet ar because if if the problem with ar is unknown uh there's
[00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:44.720]   technical difficulties that are diff are challenging and it's unknown if those will be solved like
[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:50.160]   battery life and things but if they can solve those there's no question ar could succeed the
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:56.000]   iPhone as as the product it's heat with a dancing tesla robot i mean that's what the party is
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:02.800]   not making a dancing robot let's make that very clear let's see this let's let's let's also take a
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:08.560]   look at the at elan musk as like the ghost of christmas kriyfta come like hope this is this is
[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:12.960]   the future that can only might be it's not the one that could be could we have like a bonehead
[00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:18.640]   ceo who keeps making asinine promises that absolutely they the engineers are like oh holy crap we're
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:24.960]   doing a dancing robot now uh but i i'm i'm not quite as bullish on ar i think that i mean if there is
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:30.640]   one thing that apple is definitely working on that could be the newton message pad it is augmented
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:37.680]   reality because if they get this wrong they could have an amazingly cool piece of technology that people
[00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:44.320]   look at and say but this doesn't help me in anything that i do in my daily life and or this is not a
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:48.320]   this is not something you've you've just like the one the problems of the message pad was
[00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:52.560]   it was something you're supposed to carry with you everywhere that does not fit in a jacket pocket
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:58.400]   and perhaps if i like ar sounds great sounds wonderful but i'm not keeping these things on my face
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:04.400]   like more than 20 minutes at a time so that it is a gamble well that's they could solve all
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:09.840]   those problems maybe but that is not a definite that is not a given but not a given although if you
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:14.640]   could make it happen uh i think it would be hugely successful but it has to be done right
[00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:19.920]   right um does apple this actually begs the question does apple does tim cook have to come up with
[00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:25.280]   the next big thing or can they just continue as they are i mean it's kind of accepted canon that you
[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:30.000]   can that you should i think you can make a metaverse now leo if you have to make a metaverse now yeah
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:36.800]   like you just have to well jesus ar is the metaverse if it's done right well i i i think the fact
[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:41.600]   that it works on ipads and and iPhones now i mean that you don't have to put glasses on they just
[00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:46.000]   make them better you know like you know it and so there's there's so many things we were talking i
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:50.960]   mean we were brainstorming the other day about wouldn't it be great like weird little things
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:54.960]   but you know all these restaurants you walk up and you and you go up into a QR code now and your
[00:55:54.960 --> 00:56:00.960]   menu comes down and i was like what i really want is to be able to um big basically find something in
[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:05.280]   the menu click on it and then look at it in front of me like this is how big it is because i thought
[00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:11.600]   about it because like i ordered some noodles at a at a at a tie shop and i i got three times more
[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:15.840]   than i expected and i was like and i was like i was like really good if i knew how big this was gonna
[00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:19.600]   be and exactly what it would look like you know kind of like the the japanese uh you know when you
[00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:24.160]   walk into a japanese restaurant and all the things are plastic on the front i just went that but in 3d
[00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:30.240]   and and um and the thing is is that is that what apple's building is that's going to be very very
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:35.680]   possible very very like it's it's almost possible now you know and and so the thing is is that we're
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:39.200]   gonna get now now for the glasses you know it depends on the battery life and everything else but
[00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:44.720]   with my phone i i could do it um and and it is going to change you know the thing is is that there'll be
[00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:50.560]   places that use it um you know when you look at at at tourism you know being able to add things to
[00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:54.880]   what you're what you're walking through and then education you know when it becomes something like
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:57:00.720]   even now if i text you a usdz and you tap on it you can immediately see it to scale in front of you
[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:04.800]   and we're using that already now you know in some of our productions where we just were sending
[00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:09.360]   back and forth like this is what i wanted to look like and you know that that you know we we see
[00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:13.360]   it right now and the big thing is is that you have all these phones that are already capable of doing
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:18.320]   it so it's not like you have to persuade everybody to get glasses to to get it to to launch so that's
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:24.080]   a nice feature that's not a world-changing product yeah i think it's something that's that that is a
[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:29.440]   good example that i could see people enjoying that kind of thing at a restaurant but realize that
[00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:34.240]   we're it's not a given that if i go to a restaurant's website they will list like what hours they're
[00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:39.200]   open what their address is in a place that's that's obvious most the time when i go to a restaurant
[00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:43.520]   it's a big deal if they have a qr code and really pretty much the only thing reason why they're
[00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:47.360]   doing that is because they need to make things contactless now so they don't they're not as big
[00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:52.320]   a fans of having as spreading around actual physical menus but when physical menus were around
[00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:56.880]   it was something that was just spooled off of a laser printer or photocopied so i'm so what i'm
[00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:59.760]   getting at is that's not the way you really think we're going to do this not it's not as though
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:04.240]   yeah i think we're going back it's totally think we're going back again qr code is not as
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:08.640]   good experiences are as a menu i think i think that most people when they go to a restaurant at
[00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:13.040]   least the current generation the current reality they want to open a menu and pictures are great but
[00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:17.600]   they want to read what's going on they don't want to say okay well first of all high-end restaurant
[00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:23.920]   hey pick up your phone that's damn your camera app at this time it's more price is
[00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:27.600]   well maybe not yeah that's that's the thing i'm talking about i mean it doesn't again it'll be
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:34.000]   VR glasses are the the science fiction ideal and there are ways to do AR without it but we still
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:39.040]   have to think it's not just a demo it's not quick time had to be explained as something other than
[00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:43.680]   hey now you can paste a video inside a word document which is how apple originally
[00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:48.320]   rolled it out just like the you can't just say here's the new message pad now you can
[00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:53.440]   make an appointment by writing writing with a pen on a glass screen and not in the world in the
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:58.000]   mid 90s where people were still using file effects is because the damn things worked they were
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:03.680]   they are easy to duplicate they're easy to integrate i think we can safely say that sort of thing
[00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:11.280]   the paper planners on its way out handy no no i'm saying i'm saying in 1996 yeah in 1996 i'm not
[00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:16.000]   sure the paper menu that was one that was another reason why yeah see honestly that's what i'm
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:19.840]   getting at there there are a lot of there are a lot of great use cases for AR not the sort of
[00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:24.640]   use cases that say here's here is a here is a wearable device you're going to wear on your wrist
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:28.720]   they'll do all kinds of things for you that was a kind of a no-brainer because if you wear watches
[00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:32.320]   it will still tell you the time and it doesn't cost that much more than i'd watch i was skeptical
[00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:36.480]   though and i think people had stopped wearing watches and i was very skeptical of the watch
[00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:41.200]   would be a hell of a product it took a few years before it really became all because yes because
[00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:46.160]   yeah because apple didn't have any idea what it was for the first year was no killer app at first
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:52.080]   yeah yeah and the the the iphone was a huge hit because it turns out that when you delete the it
[00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:58.320]   was not necessarily because it was a multi-touch device but because it was the first one where
[00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:02.160]   wifi was not just something you turn on and on and was kind of a nice thing to have
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:06.960]   a data connection over mobile broadband was not simply a nice thing to have
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:11.440]   so you can get your text messages and get your get your emails it was integral to the experience
[01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:14.880]   of the device that's what made it relevant to absolutely everybody so that's what we're waiting
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:20.880]   for with AR something that is fundamental something that is about the the amount of nitrogen you have
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:27.120]   in the atmosphere that allows mammals like us to evolve thrive and thrive and survive that's the
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:32.640]   for some extra nitrogen for augmented reality to some extent the phone created its own need
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:38.720]   uh i don't think before the phone people said oh i gotta have some way to get my notifications
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:43.600]   i think it created the need for it and i think it's possible i i think it's probably our will
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:49.280]   create a need for it i do disagree with you Alex so that it's that menus are on their way out i know
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:54.240]   you i know i know you know i know people like qr codes but i'm not i'm not i'm not saying the
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:57.680]   menus are on their way out i'm just saying that there are a lot of restaurants where you know
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:01.920]   that being able to add it would change what you bought you know because i know that that half the
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:05.680]   time i go to restaurants i'm like i don't know what that is you know like i don't know what it's
[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:10.000]   gonna be when it comes out i guess until i've been there a couple times and and so the the
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.320]   anyway i i don't think that it's it's an either none of these things are either last restaurant i was
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:18.720]   at no menu no qr code they just brought you what they brought you and you better eat it
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:24.960]   well i'm a customer also known as kitchen it was a very it was a three star Michelin restaurant so
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:28.640]   it isn't that what you're talking about with the iphone is that it was a conflict like coming
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:32.720]   together of several different technologies it was like mobile internet was finally ready and we
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:36.880]   had the ability to make miniaturized device like apple all their training under the ipod
[01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:42.240]   ready them and the advent of safari blackberry was betting so heavily that we would need physical
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:46.080]   keyboards and proxy internet and the data savings was the most important thing and it was like
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:49.600]   apple said no they're getting rid of the keyboard and we're gonna love everyone have full broadband
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:53.440]   and it was just completely inverse thinking of the time what's what's the case the real
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:58.480]   cases it's easy in hindsight to say oh yeah that was a good move oh yeah that was brilliant
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:03.600]   um it's a lot harder to say ahead of time how to invent the factory thing inventing the
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:07.920]   first thing that's not easy it's not it's if anybody can do it it's going to be apple absolutely
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:13.920]   and and i think that the that the what apple hopefully learned from the i-book fiasco
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:19.120]   which is that they have to see the market better you know and one of the ways to not see the market
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:24.240]   is going to um people who are already leaders in that market the i mean what the disaster that
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:29.600]   was i-book was going to to Pearson and right people who make textbooks and asking them to do examples
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:34.400]   wouldn't you like it would you like to type your profit margins but home app was the same thing
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:38.880]   right like they didn't make a home app they let everybody else make a home app and it was terrible
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:42.880]   until they actually made their own o-map do you think apple kind of do you think apple is very
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:47.200]   good at learning its lesson do you think that's a good strength that theirs are not
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:53.200]   it can be i mean i think that i i think that they're going to probably invest pretty heavily in in
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:57.840]   uh pushing ar if it if they decide to really roll it out of it when it stops becoming a hobby i think
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:03.600]   there's going to be a lot of seating of the market to make sure that it works there have been lessons
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:08.560]   uh the trash can back was a big lesson i hope they learned that lesson uh that i think great
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:13.920]   abilities we got we got only one yeah that was a big plan for the future uh i think i think i think
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:20.160]   and i i think it may be heresy to say this but the home pods were kind of a lesson you know you
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:25.200]   could build 93 anechoic chambers they didn't learn it they didn't learn it they did the ipon high five
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:30.880]   lesson same lesson this time they said we're going to build so many anechoic chambers that we have this
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:36.400]   has to sound the best thing ever and nobody cared because it was 500 bucks right the one thing that
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:39.840]   i think that you know to alex's point the one thing that i think is really crucial for apple to do is
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:43.680]   like they're about to come out with 120 hertz display it's not going to be the first one nokia had
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:48.400]   120 hertz display in 1812 all our commenters are going to tell us you know very very soon
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:52.800]   but when they ship it it's going to be on a hundred million devices not on you know three million
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:57.040]   devices and developers are going to know that if they update their games to 120 hertz it'll be on
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:02.160]   the app store for all those customers day one to download and buy and it's going to so really like
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:06.000]   the same thing with hdr it's going to watch that market forward let's watch what happens with spatial
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:13.840]   audio because i'm i like spatial audio and uh and everybody's very bullish on it i'm i think it
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:20.640]   actually is starting to look like it may not be the next big thing in music apple can put a lot of
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:24.800]   energy and a lot of arrows a lot of them wooden those arrows it doesn't make the world change
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:29.360]   necessarily well i think universal and one or think it that's going to be the next big thing but
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:34.160]   they thought they thought maybe movies were the next big thing yeah yeah it's Netflix the problem is
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:38.240]   is that is that right now we're still we're still in the baby steps where people are still learning
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:44.240]   how to do it the hardest part is is that the the music folks doing music at most just don't i feel
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:48.800]   like don't mix it very well the people who come out of film understand center channel and so and so
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:52.560]   forth and that's something that is a lot more pleasing to listen to so i think that there's we're
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:56.720]   kind of in that um that area where photoshop came out and suddenly there was all this crazy
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:01.680]   you know um you know crazy designs and everything else but but i will say i mean as someone who
[01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:07.200]   you know spends a lot of time listening to spatial um you look at stare i look i still look at stereo
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:11.120]   and mono is pretty much the same now like it's just like you know that's like this tiny little format
[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:16.960]   and and you get so used to you get so used to it but i'm just saying that it as you listen to it more
[01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:22.160]   and more and remember that that most of our most of the pop library will all be spatial within the
[01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:26.000]   next six months you know like so everything being released is going to be really spatial because of
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:31.120]   apple you know they're not gonna absolutely agree and so and so and what happens is when you start
[01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:35.840]   listening to spatial your brain doesn't actually absorb it very well and it just kind of sounds
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:40.560]   like stereo plus and then after you get used to it you're like you'll listen to stereo and you'll go
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:45.120]   what is this mud like like you know this is like mud and i can't figure out and you can't figure out
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:48.800]   what it is and you're like oh it's stereo you know like it's not that's interesting i have not got
[01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:53.680]   that does it it takes it took it took me six months yeah in six months before my brain started like
[01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:59.200]   looking at stereo like a muddy little money little thing yeah you go back and suddenly your old phone
[01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:02.800]   like a screen door yeah or when you start looking at hd bar you go back and everything went back
[01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:08.480]   the jury's still out let's let's see let's talk in a year we should have a long bet i mean a big
[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:16.320]   yeah i'm a big thing is is that is that logic uh as promised if it if it releases a much easier to
[01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:22.640]   use um solution for for atmos um it's going to make a big difference that's part of the problem right
[01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:28.400]   now is there's some expertise required it's easy to do a bad spatial mix developers are more
[01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:33.040]   motivated than than studios Leo like it's getting a whole bunch of studios to rerecord music is is
[01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:37.760]   is like hurting cats getting developers who want to be featured day one on the app store yeah remix it
[01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:41.040]   but like getting a bunch of developers they want to be featured on the app store day one we've seen
[01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:45.280]   that work over and over and over again uh maybe not so much with the apple watch because it wasn't a
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:48.720]   great platform for apps but if they start getting the first generation of AR apps they're all going
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:52.560]   to want to be like James Thompson is going to have that ready three days before it launches yeah he
[01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:59.840]   was pissed off i saw because he said he he had a day one uh feature release for a share what does
[01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:05.200]   it share play the yeah sure of course he did yeah he said and there goes another day one release at
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:10.400]   the window but he got the Ted lasso domain so i can't feel i can't feel oh did it was a short
[01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:14.560]   red dot well he noticed that there was no he noticed that there was a domain that they kept
[01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:19.760]   advertising on the side of the bleachers and it didn't go anywhere so he very quickly redirected it to
[01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:26.160]   the uh yeah to Jason Snell's um podcast on Ted lasso free advertising oh did he that was nice of him
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:31.600]   he could have redirected to p-calc but instead he sent it to Jason that's nice well he's against
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:36.240]   on it but it's still nice you know the and you know the other thing is is that we we shouldn't ignore
[01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:41.120]   is that the hundred twenty twenty hundred twenty hertz is in every tv that we buy today right um so
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:46.480]   it's been it's been in there for a long time and you don't have to just make games i can i can see
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:51.680]   people getting you know yeah just because i tell you what i was watching an old movie and hd those
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:55.600]   starting to look bad so i could totally see people getting used to high-firm rate but 120
[01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:59.040]   Hertz has been a problem because like there's not a lot of games that's uh android has had 120
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:02.240]   Hertz for years and a lot of the developers just haven't bothered to do it because they haven't
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:06.320]   had sufficient well they don't sell as many units like that sounds like i think makes like 10
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:11.120]   million of their premium phones apple makes 75 million the first quarter station five can either
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:18.240]   do 4k or high frame rate not both so yeah so can i sound so usually you can do both i mean it
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:22.000]   just a matter of knowing what you what you know how much bandwidth you have i mean you can definitely
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:27.520]   do a 120 frame per second 4k on a PlayStation 5 oh no no PlayStation 5 that's what i'm saying tv
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:31.360]   yeah on an apple tv you might be able to yeah but the thing is is that what this provides is i mean
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:34.320]   we talk about like what's the difference between being able to do free red when you're in real time
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:39.520]   rendering right but the the but the main thing here is that is that apple can start like we'll
[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:44.480]   see what happens i mean no one knows but apple can start playing a game that no one else can play
[01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:50.160]   when you have the apple tv the phones the ipads the the laptops everything running at 120
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:55.200]   and then you start pushing content out through apple tv plus and through games and so on so forth
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:09:00.560]   when you start to increase all of those things it's very it nobody else has the pipeline to do
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:04.880]   that and that's something that is you know and regardless of whether everyone does it or not
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:09.360]   everyone's going to be seen as smaller than you know like it's it's the big it'll be the big show i
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:20.080]   agree apple has 75 million distributed devices but building 90s 93 individuals studios so that you
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:26.160]   can tune you know apple can do it i'm hurting cats yeah you can build it but that doesn't mean they
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:30.960]   will come so look apple's in a great position i mean no that's all you can ever ask for as a
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:35.760]   company's to create a work case that's why i'm hoping that's for a few years and if you want to
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:39.840]   look at like you look at like a like a you know black magic just dropped the price of their their
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:44.560]   12k camera at six thousand dollars last week or a couple days ago yeah and so you have a six
[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:51.200]   thousand dollar camera that can capture 120 you know 8k 120 you know so so it is it's not hard to
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:55.760]   make the content anymore and apple doesn't have to do it with everything they shouldn't do it with
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:10:00.720]   narrative in my opinion but the three places that we see it you know um you know documentary
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:04.800]   experiential yeah i'm sorry about this last week yeah yeah you know are the ones that
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:10.000]   poor i'm still out on the jury's still out on that one i'm gonna tell you i'm gonna tell you i've
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:15.040]   seen example of it it's scary scary it's i won't watch it like i won't watch a horror film and
[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:19.120]   steve makes alex fade out that's why that's why he disappears from the back i was like you know i was
[01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:23.600]   like i was like i spoke two-year point i guess too much for me two-year point alex uh today apple got
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:32.000]   83 patents from the us patent and trademark office today 83 patents on things like scanning 3d models
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:37.280]   virtual parallax and apple maps look around a bit much uh 83
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:43.840]   uh laptop with with two screens including a simulated keyboard again yeah how many patents
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:48.640]   so the how many speedboats can they waters key behind multi modal three-dimensional object
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:54.720]   detection virtual parallax uh graphical interfaces for system-wide behavior for 3d models manipulation
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:59.440]   of virtual objects using a tracked physical object yeah sounds like it just a hobby to me
[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:04.480]   look at this i don't think they think it's going to go anywhere one day i'll test the water Alex
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:11.360]   Lindsey one day they're cranking it out yep let's take a little break we are uh we're talking
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:15.680]   high tech we're talking the latest and greatest we're talking we talk about the letter after leo
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:21.600]   after the break which letter the letter from ryan reynolds and yes short red recipes on their way
[01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:27.120]   to all uh yes we could talk about that in the hall there's actually a lot in fact we haven't even
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:32.800]   gotten to the rumors about the mac mini yet we'll get to that in a second uh to me it all comes down

[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:40.400]   ceos from these companies sitting around a table coming up with new strategies they do nothing but
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:45.520]   agreement that's going to stop just ask them to stop please ask them to stop with the
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:51.280]   i guess it's yeah i mean i you know it's uh it's a photo op they'll uh they'll also be
[01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:56.880]   ibm is sending uh uh ceo southern company jp morgan and chase and company of course the
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:15:03.360]   thing that's terrifying people these days is ransomware um and i think they're gonna ask jp
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:07.920]   morgan and chase why they killed only fans you think that'll come out
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:12.400]   i love that only fans only fans
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:18.960]   sir sir you're on camera sir oh there was a great uh oh i wish i could remember
[01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:25.040]   oh uh there was a great tweet about only fans um but i can't i'll come up with it i'll find it
[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:28.960]   then i'll read it to their ceo just dunked on jp morgan and chase as frick killing his business
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:33.920]   yeah i mean basically it's clear that it's the credit card companies who don't want the liability
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:38.160]   and they're changing their policies and uh it means no more porn on only fans
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:46.080]   which you know they're they're they're still still nudity still videos still they're they're
[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:53.600]   drawing a line at a certain without judging anybody what most what many people would consider
[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:58.480]   the extreme level of porn that would find the good people at visa and mastercard and
[01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:03.040]   the diners club taking offense and saying no we're not going to process payments for that god no
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:10.320]   yeah um i went my advice to tim is that don't say hey wow you know they they move that potted
[01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:16.160]   plants for when all my meetings with trump are you think biden will call him tim apple i would
[01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:24.720]   like that i think i just preserve that um let's see what else uh why does it get sorry that i'm not
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:31.440]   off oh there are some issues i'm sure that tim would like to bring up with biden uh one is of
[01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:37.680]   course congresses move to uh break the monopoly on the app store apparently uh there's a some real
[01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:44.880]   fear this is going to happen first in south korea yeah like this week like any minute now uh
[01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:49.840]   south korea course the home of sam san uh south korean but they're calling it an anti google law
[01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:54.560]   which is the funniest thing like it's it's like google can't catch a break i know they're like
[01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:58.800]   the most open but they're the most targeted at the same time south korean legislation to be the first
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:04.400]   law in the world to require companies that operate app stores to let users pay for in-app purchases
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:10.960]   using a variety of payment systems it would also prohibit something that apple does do
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:15.120]   which is blocking developers from listing their products on other app stores apple has all sorts
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:22.320]   of rules about developers uh in fact the other day i saw an app that said um and i wonder how long
[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:28.880]   they're going to get away with this it's a it's a new to-do app called tweak tweak.so and when you go
[01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:33.520]   to the i'm sure this is against the rules for apple when you go to the premium thing it says
[01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:40.080]   go to our website it says please use the browser version to find out about tweak premium
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:45.520]   they don't want you to buy it through the app and give apple to 30 percent i think apple prohibits
[01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:49.840]   that don't they this is pushing but it was this i saw this interesting report like i don't think
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:54.240]   it's been made public yet but that even when you overcharge like when you when you add apples cut
[01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:59.120]   to your in-app purchase price people will still do it because a they trust apple is convenient
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:02.400]   for them because the credit goes already on file and it's it's easy they'll have to do is hold the
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:06.880]   button down so people still convert massively even if there's a search charge to use the apple version
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:11.280]   which blows my mind so in that case it's not a detriment to the companies detriment to users
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:16.000]   who are paying 30 percent but i'm sure Alex will say this we're paying 30 percent for the
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:29.200]   convenience it's a convenience fee like ticker master everyone loves ticker i won't i won't
[01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:32.480]   buy anything on the on those things anymore i mean there's a handful of them that i bought
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:38.000]   in the past but at this point a third party story i mean yeah i mean i like the thing is is that i
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:42.960]   i will like i have netflix and a couple other ones but now if i hit something in it on my on my
[01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:47.920]   apple tv or my phone and it says you now need to to sign up on the web just won't do it just won't do
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:51.200]   it like i'm just you know and because the problem is is that for subscriptions i can't manage
[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:55.840]   some pain in the butt so yeah it's a pain i don't want to you know i either care you know i you know
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:19:00.640]   and and so i think that uh i think people are going to be more like that i mean i don't i think that
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:05.040]   the more i think about it the more the less i think this is going to be really
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:11.520]   impactful because i think that users are going to get as soon as companies do what they're going to do
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:16.240]   if this if this happens people will turn against it really quickly you know like a large number of
[01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:20.800]   people will take a pretty ardent you know like i don't want to play that anymore because it's
[01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:24.720]   going to be chaos you know it's going to be chaos for the user because it's already you can already
[01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:29.840]   see it like with these these apps that you have to put your your email in and you have to now put a
[01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:34.000]   thing in they're going to send you a code and all that stuff is a pain you know and so the thing is
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:39.440]   is that um you know people are not going to they're not going to enjoy it when it happens all the time
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:42.480]   that they're put up with it when it's here and there but when it happens all the time they're
[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:47.440]   gonna be mad i would submit you are not sensitive perhaps to the difference of the fun and nor am i
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:51.360]   to the difference of 30 but there are plenty of people who say you know what that's that 30 percent
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:56.000]   is not in a insignificant amount of money and i would prefer to save the 30 percent and deal with
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:02.400]   the inconvenience you know you and i are saying well it's a couple of bucks who cares not everybody
[01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:07.120]   says that i know not everybody says that it's just that the question is is there enough of them to be
[01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:11.200]   angry yeah you know like you know and the thing is is that you can focus i keep getting my cards
[01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:15.200]   stolen yeah and no and now as you raise raise a great point the subscription management is so
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:19.280]   much easier on apple when you're when you don't want something anymore you just cancel the subscription
[01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:24.160]   right uh i have to say that that's a very good that's an i can't remember which ones i'm subscribed
[01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:28.720]   to and which are not and everything else is on all has that list yeah right it's the same reason i
[01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:33.440]   prefer to to download apps on the mac from the app store because it keeps them up to date i know
[01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:38.000]   what i got it's easier it has to be really good at this point if it's under a hundred dollars
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.960]   if it's over a hundred dollars i go oh you know there's some app that i might want
[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:45.200]   but under a hundred dollars it has to be amazing for me to get out of the to go outside of the
[01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:50.160]   app store because the problem is like when i get a new computer that this is what really hits it
[01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:56.640]   for me is when i get a new computer i immediately up so easy you know i update everything and everything's
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:21:02.320]   on it and i don't have to think about it and and that is that easy but is that good for america
[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:07.840]   it's good for allerica but is it good for america
[01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:12.000]   oh i think it's more than good for apple users i don't know if the apple users have to think
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:17.200]   about america but i mean are the users well that's the problem apple users aren't thinking about america
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:23.280]   yeah yeah no it's i i do think it's something that apple is just going to have to figure out how
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:27.760]   to assimilate into their into how they run the app store how they run their business
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:35.760]   the the momentum behind this is so huge at this point that uh it's hard to it's hard to imagine apple
[01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:40.720]   arguing their way out of this now the the only thing they could do i think at this point is negotiate
[01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:47.840]   their way or influence their way into a version of allowing other apps to exist on their device
[01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:53.920]   in a way that they at least find palatable if not ideal um it's i mean i i agree with everything
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:22:00.400]   that that you've said i think the having a curated app store as the as the exclusive location of apps
[01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:06.880]   source of apps for for these devices is the the best case for almost every user out there i'm not
[01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:12.960]   sure that it means that uh it should be the one way of doing it to the exclusion of all others for
[01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:20.080]   every user but the thing is there's there's way too bad of a paper trail left behind it the again
[01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:27.120]   epic there there it was a bad lawsuit it was a bad gamble they were destined to lose but oh my god
[01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:32.720]   the the amount of documents shaken lose from apple and google saying that we are absolutely
[01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:37.840]   hosed if we allow any third party to install apps we've we've done our own finance we've done
[01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:42.800]   our own calculations saying that this could cost us as much as six billion dollars a year it is it
[01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:48.720]   is absolute in google in google's case particularly it's it's essential that we cut deals with Samsung
[01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:53.040]   and sony and everybody else to make sure that they don't allow this on their devices it's like
[01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:58.800]   all they got to do is wave this piece of paper in front of this the mat and he sort of a senate
[01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:04.080]   uh senate tribunal and they're like uh actually we do have some movement on this we're willing
[01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:09.840]   to negotiate where it's it's hard for them to make the case that it's hard for them to be in public
[01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:16.240]   and saying we feel as though to protect our users and the internet as a whole we have to hold firm
[01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:21.360]   on this meanwhile in their own memoirs they're saying oh my god we will only be able to have like
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:26.880]   uh a spaceship campus the the shape of a letter c not a letter o because we won't have enough
[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:32.880]   money to close the gap if we allow third party apps we have to fight this so they're fighting it in
[01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:36.560]   Korea and actually there's an interesting question posed by the New York Times
[01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:40.560]   we'll the US government we'll the Biden administration
[01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:47.040]   defend apple against the south korean government because that's good for america
[01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:51.840]   at the same time as the US congress is attempting the same thing in the US well they let the
[01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:58.080]   Samsung store win it hasn't it hasn't passed yet um number one well it's very close to not in the
[01:23:58.080 --> 01:24:02.400]   United States it's very close to passing in korea apparently yeah yeah but they'll do things it's
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:07.040]   defend apple in korea but fight them in us well that's the question yes technically it's technically
[01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:12.000]   their job to do that right to defend american country american companies so if they don't defend it
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:16.160]   they're actually not doing their job you know because that's you know that's it's a it's a act
[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:22.000]   that's targeting american kind you know companies so so it's you know so so it would be there if it
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:26.480]   would be them not fulfilling their duties if they don't defend apple in that in that area
[01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:30.720]   New York Times says how the white house responds to this proposal poses an early test for the
[01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:35.760]   Biden administration will it defend tech companies facing antitrust scrutiny abroad
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:41.520]   well it both applies that same scrutiny to the companies at home yep yes the answer is yes yeah
[01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:47.440]   it will well we hope so we know we'd hope that they would find um some if somebody's going to
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:51.840]   regulate us it's going to be uh it might be jerks but there are jerks leo that's how that whole
[01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:55.680]   thing works like you can fight in the family but you don't find out the family right
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:58.720]   but that also that also illustrates the problem that they're going to be facing
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:02.640]   internationally because think about point of view from the point of view of south korea
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:09.040]   they're saying well how what it's not it's not in our countries and our our industries best interest
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:15.120]   that citizens of south korea operate a phone that they purchased in south korea that was largely
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:20.720]   manufactured in south korea they buy an app from developers who might be based in south korea
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:25.840]   the money goes to california and some of the money comes back to the developer in south korea
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:29.840]   why do we not have a situation where at least if there's a if there are
[01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:34.320]   company if there are developers who are located here we can create an alternative app store so that
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:38.960]   all of the money stays in this country instead of having to shovel it into and help out the
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:43.120]   united states economy that's where they're going to be fighting a very very long and hard time again
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:46.480]   the new york times american officials have echoed some of the industry's complaints about the
[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:50.960]   proposal saying in a march report it appeared to target american companies but
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:57.040]   u_s_ trade officials have yet to take a formal position on it said adam hodge a spokesperson
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:26:02.000]   for the united states trade representative he said officials are still considering how to
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:06.560]   balance the claim that the legislation discriminates against american companies
[01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:11.760]   with the belief among tech critics in south korea and america that the legislation would
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:19.200]   level the playing field oh boy uh... we are engaging a range of stakeholders to gather facts
[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:21.040]   said mr hodge
[01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:25.520]   it's interesting because panda devens had a really good article about this uh i don't know if it was
[01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:29.600]   this week or last week but i just saw ben beher all the bends it are really good analysts the
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:34.000]   analysis name is ben they're just really good uh about like we're arguing we're spending an enormous
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:37.840]   amount of time arguing about this where all evidence shows that it will almost never be a mainstream
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:42.000]   feature like it could be enabled and a very very small amount of people will use it and that doesn't
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:46.400]   mean it's not worth fighting for but it is worth contextualizing in whether you do the math and
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:51.840]   how much it will cost apple or how much it'll help users it is a very nerdy nerdy feature yeah i
[01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:56.480]   mean app for google for a long time has had this you know in the settings you have to do this
[01:26:56.480 --> 01:27:01.120]   and i think most people don't because it's just the same reason they don't have apple or they're
[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:05.680]   wouldn't have a lot i think you're right i think the vast majority it's the tyranny of the default
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:10.160]   or always gonna do what they're doing now yeah i don't think it's an either or proposition i think
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:16.080]   it's i i think you know that my position on a lot of things is that if you have the opportunity to
[01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:20.160]   have an imperfect system that gives people choice or an imperfect system that doesn't give people's
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:25.760]   people choice allow the imperfect imperfect system that gives people choice i don't think it'll be
[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:32.160]   the downfall of security on of the internet or on all iPhones i don't think it'll be the the
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:37.360]   downfall of the simplicity of installing apps on the iphone or any other device i think that it will be
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:42.400]   something that is very very easily accommodated and just like just like it was possible to jail
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:47.840]   break phones easily for a long time and people didn't jail break phones because really it was
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:52.640]   very quickly there was no reason to do so it was it was something to show off at a party and say
[01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:58.000]   hey look i've got see see how i've got a boot screen that's different from the apple logo well it took
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:03.040]   me three days and two brick devices to get that but i've got it now because i've got an unlocked device
[01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:09.760]   yeah like okay i think that i think that the first large company that tries to force everybody to
[01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:13.840]   to go outside of this i mean epic might get away with it but because they've got a bunch of game
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:18.240]   players that want to play it or whatever but but i think if it starts to become more than a couple
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:23.680]   uh big companies that do it i think that the the backlash from the users will be much more intense
[01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:28.880]   to the point where they're trying right what about amazon because i think uh you know apple must have
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:34.320]   seen amazon as a threat because they've made a side deal with amazon apparently because you can now
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:38.960]   buy stuff you know they're getting the deal i think through apple it's unclear but it looks like
[01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:41.840]   they're getting the deal that's business though i mean like the bigger your supply like walmart does
[01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:45.680]   that for big suppliers too that's just like complete natural course of it but that's the point is that
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:52.720]   amazon was so big that if amazon decided to bypass uh and we have problematic yeah but maybe
[01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:58.320]   maybe but i didn't buy it you know i hate my amazon's on the web and then so i can read him in my
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:02.480]   kennel reader on the same ipad that's annoying yeah the promise like Andy said the users get
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:06.000]   like the the users don't get prioritized is whether it's good for apple or good for amazon but i
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:10.640]   want what's good for me right it's but i want right it's it's it's it's a it's a tough thing to say
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:15.440]   that apple will treat you more fairly if you are in a position to hurt them if you have no power
[01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:19.920]   over them then you just simply have to take terms that apple dictates welcome welcome to real life
[01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:24.960]   though but we're but we're talking about for for probably 90 percent of the developers even the
[01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:28.160]   ones that are a little upset about this whole thing they're not going to do anything they're not
[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:32.400]   going to they're just going to keep pushing things into the app store because for 98 percent of them
[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:36.000]   they make less than a million so they're only giving up 15 percent you know it's the 30 percent
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:42.000]   is the risk man's got move on apple's part is they give rich me very little money and appeal to 95
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:46.320]   percent of developers who are under a million dollars while almost all the money they make
[01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:50.640]   comes from the whales that are more than a million dollars and and again they made that they made
[01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:55.520]   that change only when they started feeling pressured once once they had once in their position where
[01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:59.920]   they could get hurt by not making a change they made a change they didn't decide that hey wait a
[01:29:59.920 --> 01:30:05.200]   minute we just did we just were did a quick quick quick spreadsheet and realized that we can actually
[01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:09.360]   let the small developers have more money without it really affecting our bottom line no they had
[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:14.720]   to be really forced against the wall and see the approaching dawn in the hoofbeats of the of the
[01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:20.000]   writers of death approaching saying that oh you know what i'll tell you what hey we were going to do
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:24.960]   this anyway we swear the fact that this is all all the emails about this are dated no earlier than
[01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:30.240]   18 hours ago but hey we just made a change to our model we're gonna make some more concessions you
[01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:34.800]   think yeah definitely they're gonna have they're they're only in position now where they get every
[01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:39.120]   big whether it's google whether it's apple where whoever they're only in position now where they can
[01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:44.800]   negotiate the best life that life for themselves inside this new reality i don't think they can
[01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:52.240]   change what's coming there's my problem with the other time on tim cook's desk of like step one step
[01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:58.320]   two step three step four step five the the concessions that they're willing to make go ahead i'm sorry
[01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:03.440]   Alex you know in the in the united states you know we still have a court so so so there's there's a
[01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:07.600]   long there's a long you know i i don't think this is going to get passed and then just go okay we're
[01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:10.400]   it's going to go into into i think though there'll be probably spend a little time
[01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:18.480]   in the court system which currently is not favoring uh probably won't favor this type of law so so
[01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:23.200]   i think that it would you know at the top at least so i think that it would be it's probably not now
[01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:26.880]   in europe and obviously in south korea that's a whole nother thing because you know they have
[01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:31.680]   different set of rules well but remember that the ftc has asserted that it has a lot of power
[01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:36.880]   using its existing laws and existing mandate that doesn't necessarily need it's asserted it but
[01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:43.840]   it hasn't been tested so so the thing is still appeal at court yeah but so that that doesn't mean
[01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:47.600]   that things with things are gonna get tied i'm saying it's not as simple as oh well that just
[01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:51.920]   appeal it and we'll hope that we'll take our risk on the court there is there is a temperature
[01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:58.400]   change happening this isn't just one buckaroo who's got a bug up their butt for for antitrust for for
[01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:03.920]   the app store this the fact that this is happening everywhere all at once means that i think it's
[01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:07.360]   unclear what that waiting for apple to think that they can fight all this i think it's also
[01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:11.760]   how clear what courts are gonna do i have to say though the ftc has to do a better job than they
[01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:17.520]   have in the uh yes against the facebook because yeah that was nope that would they've done they've
[01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:22.320]   done a bad job and they've come back with it even worse uh can i also be like a little bit
[01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:25.440]   disappointed with the companies themselves because again like i don't care about apple or
[01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:29.680]   amazon or facebook or the government i care about me and i feel like a lot of these companies if
[01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:34.240]   they weren't just quite so arrogant about their play yes you were hugely successful but you didn't
[01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:38.320]   have to strut you didn't have to make yourself such a big target you could have quietly done a
[01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:43.600]   few concessions more concessions over the years when it wasn't quite so fraught or fought and
[01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:48.480]   just cut a lot of this like removed the high ground from a lot of these arguments i think your point
[01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:54.160]   is the best point of all what about us what's right what's the best for the end user not what's best
[01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:59.280]   for amazon epic google or apple but it's really the twitter user but like the actual main real users
[01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:06.160]   what's best for real users for 99 for 99 percent of the of the users a closed system is better
[01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:11.840]   99 for 1 percent it's not they want something else for 99 percent a closed system that just works
[01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:17.520]   that's safe that's easy to order easy to run short term i agree i think long term that's hard to use
[01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:23.200]   i know it's hard to see long term but i think short term a mono culture closed system is not
[01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:27.680]   in everybody's x-box and it's also hard to see you don't have to make everything like you don't have to
[01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:32.160]   make everything in x-box and everything a pc like we can have both right i might might also point
[01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:36.800]   out that there are tens of millions or if not hundreds of millions of iphone users out there
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:41.600]   1 percent of 100 million is a lot of people who are trying to do the thing they want to do right
[01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:45.120]   so i'm not i'm not flat out disagreeing with you i'm saying that there's
[01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:52.720]   as i said this is this is why i tend to i tend to err on the side of more power as opposed to just
[01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:59.680]   lock it down for reasons that they can't really defend it if they if they've been naughty according
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:03.680]   to their own internal discussions on the matter that is all the more reason to say you know what
[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:08.880]   we're going to try it this other way and we're just we're just weighing we're weighing a handful of rich
[01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:12.480]   companies against 99 percent of the users i mean that's what we're talking about right now is a
[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:17.920]   handful of rich companies billionaires mostly and you know against everybody well there's a
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:23.120]   say 99 i'm very super conservative because it's probably 99.99 999 there is a legitimate third
[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:31.440]   position which is that things should be more open and i agree that i just want to have a closed
[01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:35.760]   platform for people like you Alex i don't i just want it to work i don't i don't want to be i don't
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:40.080]   want to be complicated i know i know i don't think i don't think i don't think it will be complicated i
[01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:44.480]   think that we can have i think we can have both i think we're going to have this really cheeky
[01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:49.360]   suggestion from one of his readers today which was let apple make a vanilla android that if you
[01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:53.600]   want to sideload you just replace ios with vanilla android on your phone and you can then you can
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:59.440]   run android apps instead oh they could do that i call it like ios blue or something and uh so
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:06.240]   well if you really want to we have this very insecure poor privacy variant uh you could use it we
[01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:11.200]   store your credit card in plain text but you could use it that's an interesting point of view we're
[01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:17.520]   using the open source version of android 2.7 enjoy enjoy coming in without google maps without
[01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:21.520]   the play store without it yeah it was another good point rene which was there's there's room for
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:26.080]   both there's room for a playstation and there's and there's room for pc but then but we have that we
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:31.120]   have that we have apple and android right like we we people the and apple's not still not a
[01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:36.960]   majority holder stakeholder in the world market and just barely i wish we had more than just apple
[01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:41.520]   and android i mean there are certain third parts it's hard to do yeah there aren't really many
[01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:44.560]   just give me a little less back i'll be happy but that but that's i think why google's getting in
[01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:48.240]   more trouble with these stuff and it's counterintuitive because you think they're more open so why are
[01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:51.360]   they getting in more trouble and a lot of the arguments being made against google is they're the
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:55.200]   alternative they're more open they're more egregious yeah when you are controlling yeah they're the
[01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:59.120]   anti apple so you should at least because they're with games they're very different like they're
[01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:02.640]   they're very similar to apple when it comes to games because games make so much money and money is
[01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:07.360]   just so corrosive yeah yeah it is it is for pretty big slap in the face when they're saying no no
[01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:13.360]   we actually have this feature built baked right in we're just going to pay off phone manufacturers
[01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:18.480]   and uh in app manufacturers not to take advantage of this feature that is supposed to be a hallmark
[01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:24.640]   feature of a vandroid openness yeah yeah okay you're you know what you're you're sitting the corner
[01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:29.920]   think about what you did think about what you're gonna be able to get nice men and women yeah i
[01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:34.880]   bought a i bought one of those pine phones hoping that uh there be a decent linux
[01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:38.880]   alternative it's not there yet but that you know there's a year of handtop Linux
[01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:44.880]   well in a way that's what android is but i think i would love to see an open source of phone and
[01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:49.360]   see what what they could do i mean i know what they could do so far let's get it let's get it better
[01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:54.240]   and maybe there would be a third open choice that would be kind of interesting
[01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:59.600]   unfortunately all the all the bugs of all the things that people can
[01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:05.280]   all the things that we're complaining about about ios and android are actual features
[01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:09.360]   for all the companies that make money off of apps whether they're free apps like facebook
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:14.080]   or whether they're paid apps and none of those things work again i have i have a couple of open
[01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:19.040]   source operating systems on a couple of older phones and they're great so long as you don't ever
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:23.760]   need to like halo ride right so long as you don't ever need to order food or you or stuff
[01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:29.440]   that makes this thing really yeah exactly yeah so uh bad news well maybe not bad news but at least
[01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:35.600]   details of this uh Pegasus issue more information coming from the university toronto's monk school
[01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:44.160]   about how Pegasus works and in fact a specific example of how this spyware technology from the
[01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:52.800]   nso group was used against uh opponents of the regime in barrein they found nine bahrani activists
[01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:59.840]   whose phones were hacked with Pegasus between june 2020 and february of this year uh some of them
[01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:07.840]   were hacked with a uh zero click attack that bypassed the blast door that apple was using to
[01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:14.800]   to protect and that's of course a real cause for concern um the the other cause for concern is you
[01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:19.840]   can make it a pretty strong case that the nso group says well we only sell us to responsible
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:24.880]   governments now maybe this is an ignore not the top of the list not the top of the list uh and
[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:30.400]   the people they're using to attack with this journalists and activists um probably deserve a
[01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:35.120]   little bit more understanding is that this was stuff that was not yet inside like it does go
[01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:39.680]   through blast door because the stuff that it's attacking is not completely secured by blast
[01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:44.160]   door but that's part of the ongoing process of blast horrifying more and more content types and
[01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:50.000]   it's i mean all of these attacks are multi-layered uh you get in one part in another part but they
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:55.680]   call it forced entry um and it's actually it's a great this is a great piece because they have
[01:38:55.680 --> 01:39:01.040]   logs the crash logs and so forth these activists were able to get their phones to the monk school
[01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:06.960]   and they were able to really analyze the logs um google deletes the logs so we don't know exactly
[01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:10.400]   what's happening on android devices but we have a much better idea of what's going on
[01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:16.880]   yeah uh or the saving grace at this point is just that these these kind of zero days on the iPhone
[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:22.160]   are so valuable that the only people who can afford them are state governments uh and when it
[01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:27.680]   when it comes when it comes to the point where anybody with five hundred dollars and who can
[01:39:27.680 --> 01:39:32.000]   do a bitcoin transaction and knows how to find things in the dark web can get a trace on any
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:37.040]   phone that they have a phone number for that's when things go straight to hell yeah they uh even
[01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:41.280]   have samples of errors that it's go ahead i was going to say they don't want to burn those
[01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:45.840]   exploits that's why they're so valuable because if they if they get why then people fix them and
[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:50.000]   they don't want them to be fixed so they're incredibly strategic in how they apply them right yeah
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:56.720]   there's some uh really good examples in the uh in the piece from citizen lab.ca uh showing the texts
[01:39:56.720 --> 01:40:02.880]   describing how it happened who was attacked i think it's really uh a fascinating read it's
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:10.240]   just recommended and uh yeah yeah we're not you know unless you're a um political uh dissident
[01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:16.160]   or a journalist you're probably okay every reason i believe nsa and like the five what is
[01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:20.000]   five i six i i forgot how many eyes we have now but they they all have they don't need pegasus
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:24.480]   because they have their own capabilities in this area yeah yeah yeah not that they don't you know
[01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:27.840]   they won't sell it to them it's just they need it if anything the bottom line is don't assume
[01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:33.920]   that any device you carry is 100% secure it's not if you're not a huge target either don't stress
[01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:37.520]   over like it's no don't stress over it some people read this and they become incredibly anxious
[01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:41.120]   about this and if you're not if you're not someone that a government's willing to burn a lot of money
[01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:45.600]   and exploits on then you're you don't have to say up at night i you know and one good thing that's
[01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:52.000]   coming out of all this i'm glad that uh apples communication relationship with its users is not
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:57.200]   treating them like infants like they used to where they they're no longer they're no longer putting
[01:40:57.200 --> 01:41:02.240]   oh well we this is the one platform that's safe and secure and can't be you know though there are
[01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:07.120]   kinds of viruses and malware and all kinds of exploits on all other devices but not on iphone
[01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:12.560]   you're safe with us even though that was really never the case and it was an it was a hard thing to
[01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:18.080]   to to defend you you have to be honest and open with your users about exactly what the
[01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:23.200]   vulnerabilities of their device are don't scare them but always make sure that they know the status
[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:29.840]   of the vehicle that they're that they're operating apple says actually it's an ableist we move on
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:34.080]   there was another there was another report um people have to be careful about this there was a
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:39.600]   the los angeles times is reporting that a man in los angeles managed to forget the number now he
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:44.960]   hacked his way into thousands of iCloud accounts to try to steal nude images of people and he did
[01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:50.000]   it by posing as an apple support person and this is happening on youtube accounts as well like
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:54.400]   people are posing as customer support chatting asking people for their passwords and just a
[01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:58.880]   a reminder no no real company is ever going to contact you and ask you for this information
[01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:01.840]   they're never going to try to get into your account never going to ask for access to your
[01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:06.800]   account never give anyone information on your account because it's never it's never for legitimate
[01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:12.320]   purposes yeah also if you're listening to this podcast you're probably pretty savvy as it is
[01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:17.360]   so take it take advantage of your savviness and the fact that people who are not quite as clued in
[01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:21.840]   as you trust you and when you visit when you visit your friends and family who
[01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:26.880]   just trust things to work and have lots of faith in people that haven't been burned off
[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:31.520]   by cynicism and mistrust like we have uh tell them about this sort of stuff that there's
[01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:35.680]   there are ways that if you think that if apple if you think that apple is telling you that they've
[01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:39.920]   compromised your account there are ways to contact apple directly uh and make sure that hasn't
[01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:44.400]   happened even though there's no almost no chance that will ever have happened there they're super
[01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:48.800]   smart like a bunch of really high profile youtube accounts got hacked because someone went to google
[01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:54.720]   chat sent a link from google chat which therefore gets sent through a google relay so it shows up as
[01:42:54.720 --> 01:42:59.200]   a google email with a google link and when you click on it the chat person says hi i'm youtube
[01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:03.280]   support you've got double ad sense accounts we're going to shut you down unless you resolve this
[01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:07.600]   immediately and you start to panic and then they could trick you into deleting your account so like
[01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:14.960]   you you just you cannot be careful enough with this stuff analyst says you don't have to worry
[01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:22.960]   about the chip set shortage apple the chip ship chip set shortage now affects everybody but apple
[01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:30.640]   there are plenty of iPhones to go around this comes from wave seven research uh sources have
[01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:35.280]   told wait seven research apple was able to lock down chip we've known this for a while but this
[01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:42.320]   confirms it locked down chip set supply say that five times fast chip set supply well ahead of time
[01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:51.280]   unlike other oem's sam sung and one plus are particularly hard hit the shortage is uneven by
[01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:57.840]   carrier channel even by store atent he least affected but only because atent has the most
[01:43:57.840 --> 01:44:05.360]   iPhone heavy customer base yeah it's i mean uh it seems to be getting worse and worse i mean
[01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:09.440]   everything that we've talked to almost everyone except for apple is going to have increasing
[01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:18.640]   trouble through why why why worse what's going on it there's a huge backup in just the availability
[01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:24.560]   of even storage containers as well as just a perfect storm so there are uh there there's the
[01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:28.640]   AKM fire which caused a bunch of other problems there's been a couple other fires that that have
[01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:34.240]   put a pinch on a bunch of chip sets um there then there is uh you know shipping backups then
[01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:40.080]   there's covid and covid keeps on going up and down um and and and so it's not any one thing
[01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:45.680]   it's just keep but it's it's something that everyone that i'm talking to that are in that chain and
[01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:50.560]   i'm talking a couple folks that are impacted pretty heavily are literally not releasing products or
[01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:54.960]   adjusting their products that they that they do release to go around the chips that they don't
[01:44:54.960 --> 01:45:00.880]   have um because it's just it is it's the worst that anybody has anybody that i've talked to has ever
[01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:05.200]   seen you know as far as the shortage goes and it's they don't expect it to get better until
[01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:16.320]   second half of 2022 wow wow uh all right let's talk about a few new things happy things positive
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:27.600]   things rumor central mark german says there will be a high-end m1x mac mini new designs and
[01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:34.720]   they knew it additional points you're going to damn it damn it and in but oh but all he says in
[01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:39.760]   the next several months i don't know how soon that is probably here's the best the best thing
[01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:44.560]   about mac minis is they never go you never stopped using them i have a mac mini over here that the
[01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:48.160]   one that's sitting under the brand new 16 gig one that i got after and each show the thing about
[01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:55.520]   the photogrammetry um not that i'm bitter uh anyway the um the one sitting underneath it is from 2012
[01:45:55.520 --> 01:46:00.800]   and it's you know it's running some uh controller software for me right now and they just never go
[01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:04.960]   away and they have a bunch of IO in the back they're easy to the rack mount they're easy you know
[01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:08.240]   i don't feel bad about buying them because i'm like i know i'll use them for the next decade you
[01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:12.400]   know like it's you know it's not a it's a really odd thing although that was the one thing wrong with
[01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:18.640]   the emo and mac minis was the lack of ports yeah yeah i got a lot of ports they got enough ports
[01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:23.120]   he's always you haven't got one more than my i'm act yeah yeah no i'm i'm totally i'm totally with
[01:46:23.120 --> 01:46:28.560]   you i mean yeah i'm i'm probably the biggest cheap skated on this panel but if there is a really good
[01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:34.080]   emo and x uh mac mini coming out in the next few months i will almost certainly buy it even though
[01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:40.000]   on my long-range game plan has always been i'm waiting for a super powerful uh like mini mac pro
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:44.480]   something that is like really really high-end powerful for a lot of stuff i want to do but just
[01:46:44.480 --> 01:46:50.160]   just as you say it's like there will always be a place it's it's it's it's it's like it's like
[01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:54.560]   it's like occasional situational lighting it's like this desk lamp when i'm done with it i will
[01:46:54.560 --> 01:47:00.000]   find another place for it i can always use lighting elsewhere in the house so just i will i will buy
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:06.000]   the m1x the m1x will become like my podcasting streaming computer when i get the mac uh when i get
[01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:13.040]   the hopefully the mini mac pro like in 2022 2023 that will become like the m1x will probably become
[01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:18.960]   like my my plex server my media server or it'll just become something that that lives underneath
[01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:24.960]   the spare machine it is the it is the sleeper mac of the entire lineup it's the one thing that
[01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:30.800]   it will never date never really date it will never become useless it will never be moldering on the
[01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:36.880]   tree it will never become it will never be repurposed as a as a as a hot plate or as a knickknack for
[01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:41.520]   the shelf because you can always be something with it i think a lot of us were very uh worried
[01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:45.600]   that they weren't gonna update it it wasn't gonna get any better like it it sat there for a long
[01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:52.400]   time and now you know it's it's really become an exciting product again yeah i loved a couple of
[01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:57.760]   years was a three years ago at the Brooklyn Opera House where this was they didn't have they still
[01:47:57.760 --> 01:48:02.160]   didn't have like a new mac pro to show off so they really just rolled out here is your pro
[01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:09.040]   workstation a stack of a stack of mac minis that are maxed out that are but but but but but they
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:13.840]   made such a compelling argument that it's it's a it's very very tidy it's something that you can
[01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:20.240]   redeploy again like view by 10 for your computer excuse me 10 for your uh for your office you can
[01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:24.320]   just deploy them where they need to go without having to think about whether or not does this
[01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:31.920]   person need a a 24 inch screen does this person need 80 cores in a tower anyway i it is my favorite
[01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:36.080]   like mac and of the entire lineup and it's the one that i would love to put more money into
[01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:40.160]   and literally i'm about to get i have an i-mac right now in front of me that's my older i-mac
[01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:45.840]   and i'm replacing it with the 16 gig uh and one that Andy got me to buy anyway and and um you know
[01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:50.320]   hold anyway but i'm gonna put it i'm gonna have two screens that i'm gonna have on on either side
[01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:54.640]   here and what's great about it is i've got i'll have those screens and and now i can kind of
[01:48:54.640 --> 01:48:59.360]   route whatever i want the i-mac will still be available but it's not but but it you know i'm
[01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:03.200]   able to replace it and i have just so much more flexibility i mean i as someone was asking me
[01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:06.720]   whether i was gonna get the i-mac or the mac mini and at this point i'm just getting mac minis
[01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:11.760]   because i you know the i-mac is cool but i'd rather have all the flexibility and more i-o and
[01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:15.440]   more compatibility and being able to rack them and everything else it's just an amazing little
[01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:20.960]   product is there's uh the m1 has a little bit of an issue with multiple monitors like the you have
[01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:26.960]   to kind of play some games to get two monitors is that right i i-not two i think it's it's uh i- i
[01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:31.840]   can't remember whether it's three three or more but it's it's two or two is fine the the m1 the m1
[01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:36.400]   supports two displays if you've got like a macbook pro one of them is one of them is the internal
[01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:40.640]   display the second one is the external display uh it's for the laptop so that's an issue us right
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:45.440]   okay so it's the point of putting a third one right so so putting any four of the third display
[01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:50.560]   but presumably an m1x would solve that i would there's i would hope yeah and there's some breakouts
[01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:55.280]   they can you get you up to six okay it's from the mag mini yeah like a little hardware little
[01:49:55.280 --> 01:50:02.080]   ht my breakouts they can oh okay okay but i i'm suddenly i'm suddenly trying to remember if uh the
[01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:06.960]   here's how bad my memory is today i came around what's the name of that really great feature they
[01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:12.400]   demoed for the next version of of macOS that lets you just simply put a put an ipad screen next to
[01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:17.040]   the your mac your i-mac screen and your your boss partner simply moves from one display to the other
[01:50:17.040 --> 01:50:19.920]   and turns into a different controller um i don't know what the name of the
[01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:27.200]   uh name or the name of that rene what is the name of that technology it's universal control and the
[01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:33.280]   way it's currently implemented is you can have a mac control up to two other ipads or mac so and
[01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:39.360]   you could have is one mac and then two other macs one mac and an ipad and a mac one mac and two
[01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:43.840]   ipads and then you just control them all with that mac's and you can drag and you drag around
[01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:48.000]   files i love that i can't wait i just that's gonna be you can even make permanent setup so like if
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:51.920]   that's all you want to do and you can have that setup in settings you don't have to do that little
[01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:56.880]   i'm dragging the cursor along wait for a second for it to you know break the membrane and go in
[01:50:56.880 --> 01:51:00.880]   you can just say remember this layout and switch to it when i want it to yeah that's really nice
[01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:05.280]   you know it'd be that that's such an ideal situation for a lot of like what i do
[01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:09.920]   like oftentimes i'm doing like a really big like video transcode and would be great if i have like
[01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:16.000]   my video transcoding tools just in a window that's in my setup i have no idea of a more particular
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:21.120]   awareness that this app happens to be running on its own dedicated machine uh i just by virtue
[01:51:21.120 --> 01:51:25.520]   of the fact that i moved the mouse pointer into there and press this go button uh it all worked
[01:51:25.520 --> 01:51:31.120]   but i can i i want i want to be able to put a raw potato on the middle of my desk and it just like
[01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:37.040]   slowly cooks because of all the screens i thought like pivoted that's what i want that's the dream
[01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:40.960]   that's the aspiration all right there was no news this week so we that's my problem today
[01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:46.000]   you have a raw potato degrees you're broadcasting from ropatera oh i'm 33 degrees and i turned the
[01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:50.480]   air conditioning out for the show and i wonder if my tech is everything's over he's only cooking on the
[01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:56.800]   oh my god turn the ac on it's okay with me we're gonna run through the uh apple tv news there's
[01:51:56.800 --> 01:52:01.920]   a bunch of it quickly tell you that it got so hot that i went into like my living room and got the
[01:52:01.920 --> 01:52:08.560]   the unboxed like fan that i bought a day to go to to put our need the desk i was like no i i
[01:52:08.560 --> 01:52:13.520]   bet during the cast barrette i can get those unboxed that plug it in and get some relief so you survived
[01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:19.280]   all re my mom did too no power outage for her did you have a power outage no as a matter of fact i
[01:52:19.280 --> 01:52:24.480]   missed it i missed a power outage by like half a block yeah because and and the thing is wow like
[01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:29.840]   i do live i do like i do live right in the middle of a downtown and on my building no joke there was
[01:52:29.840 --> 01:52:35.840]   in 1930 there was a huge hurricane in rod island that was like the legendary one that cost a lot
[01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:41.280]   of lives i remember i was a kid in my time yeah my and my well no not not this one i think no i'm
[01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:46.080]   kidding i'm joking sorry because i'm about to say that on my building there was actually like i
[01:52:46.080 --> 01:52:50.240]   bronze plaque with a line that comes up the one way got this here's where the high water line
[01:52:50.240 --> 01:52:54.640]   yeah so as a result like i've told you that i live in like what is the downtown area of a touristy
[01:52:54.640 --> 01:52:58.800]   village because i know like most of the business owners and most of them live like a 10 or 20
[01:52:58.800 --> 01:53:04.800]   minute drive away i kept getting dms all day saying is my is my business flooded out is it and i said
[01:53:04.800 --> 01:53:08.720]   dude i'm looking i'm looking at your business right out right now there's someone walking a
[01:53:08.720 --> 01:53:13.600]   Yorkshire derrick terrier and he's pissing on your he's piddling on your on your front steps
[01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:18.720]   that's the only damage that you're throwing us up in right now it was a category five hurricane in
[01:53:18.720 --> 01:53:24.480]   1938 referred to as the great new england hurricane they didn't have ladies names at the time
[01:53:24.480 --> 01:53:31.600]   the great colonial hurricane and all of new england just like i'm sure in all the parts of the country
[01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:36.960]   there is always that one storm that a certain region is known as oh that oh the the big hurry the
[01:53:36.960 --> 01:53:43.600]   the way you're dying the big one when we were uh we're still having trouble with rene he's frozen
[01:53:43.600 --> 01:53:48.960]   again when we were sailing down the uh ryan almost every town in the ryan has those marks on the
[01:53:48.960 --> 01:53:58.080]   building the river got this high in 16 but uses like 1638 the water got up to here yeah it's kind
[01:53:58.080 --> 01:54:04.080]   of amazing i was going up it was it was it got the winds got pretty high the rain got pretty bad but
[01:54:04.080 --> 01:54:07.920]   wasn't so bad that couldn't like take a look see out like once an hour or so so i was going out
[01:54:07.920 --> 01:54:12.960]   taking a picture of like the water level in the canal to keep people so people can not exactly
[01:54:12.960 --> 01:54:17.840]   where the water was going and it was like i'm i'm sure that like i haven't been out like getting
[01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:21.600]   like my usual takeout orders but i'm sure i'm gonna get a like a free sub from this one place
[01:54:21.600 --> 01:54:24.640]   free breakfast sandwich from this other place oh thank you so much we're so worried we're so
[01:54:24.640 --> 01:54:30.400]   worried gosh this i i i i never heard of this 1938 hurricane i must have when i was a kid it was
[01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:37.520]   it was 160 mile an hour winds that that's peak yeah and and we were worried because we were like
[01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:43.840]   right in the in one of the storm tracks like only a day before it made landfall we were like
[01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:49.040]   right in the smoke yeah yeah of landfills if it had become if it become a hurricane it would have been
[01:54:49.040 --> 01:54:53.280]   yeah yeah but fortunately there was one down in my neighborhood there was one down power line that
[01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:57.120]   blocked out not my half of the neighborhood fortunately but the other half of the neighborhood
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:03.520]   it was it was the it was the only disadvantage of having a UPS is that you know exactly like
[01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:07.840]   when things are getting a little bit shaky because i was streaming i was watching tv
[01:55:07.840 --> 01:55:12.960]   like that the stream was fine the tv was fine the audio was fine but in the office on the other side
[01:55:12.960 --> 01:55:17.040]   of the door i could hear click click click click click click click click of the UPS deciding whether
[01:55:17.040 --> 01:55:23.200]   it's time to switch over or not wow so but wow yeah but it was fine we are uh internet went out
[01:55:23.920 --> 01:55:29.920]   last night and i really depended on the internet i did not i just sat in the couch staring into
[01:55:29.920 --> 01:55:36.240]   space yeah i was like i don't know what to do uh what should i do was lisa like we don't look
[01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:42.640]   lisa laughed yeah after after uh we lost we lost power for the starbucks twice
[01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:49.840]   we lost power twice in a in a week and i i put a big UPS on my oh it's terror i was like enough
[01:55:49.840 --> 01:55:54.320]   of this enough of this i i can now last six hours without power you know and and i'm getting
[01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:59.280]   generators to make sure that that never we have two two Tesla batteries i'm gonna get a third
[01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:04.800]   we can go all day and then the sun charges them back up so the in theory yeah but the but when
[01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:10.160]   the internet goes out a no battery for that no it's like being in solitary confinement for the
[01:56:10.160 --> 01:56:15.360]   my god for the modern era oh my god you're really actually just gone buying one of those big like
[01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:21.680]   jackere like with the battery battery boosters the size of like of a of a of a Coleman cooler yeah
[01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:25.680]   because i'm like it would be nice to have six hours of power that i can actually use Tesla power
[01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:30.720]   walls they're amazing they're basically a Tesla the battery pack from a Tesla you know yeah but
[01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:35.600]   but to your point it was it was i did have this weird very weird moment like as i was doing storm
[01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:39.840]   prep thinking that like i'm young enough to remember okay so like with with my dad okay so we're
[01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:44.240]   gonna make sure that we we cut off the we we we tough cut off the pilot like to this so it doesn't
[01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:49.040]   that we're gonna make sure we get in bagged guys together and i was thinking that okay um it's the
[01:56:49.040 --> 01:56:53.680]   it's the morning before it's gonna hit i gotta make sure that i'm i get out get out my ipad pro
[01:56:53.680 --> 01:56:59.280]   download every episode of Ted lasso i haven't seen so that if i lose power i can still binge watch
[01:56:59.280 --> 01:57:03.600]   something that's the problem the internet you get no warning the internet goes out and you didn't
[01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:09.680]   download the episodes and now you just stir into space for three i'm not sure them i'm not sure
[01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:14.080]   them immigrant grandparents would understand exactly what what i define as suffering during
[01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:17.120]   a during a big break oh built some furniture what are you doing you're sitting there
[01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:22.960]   anyway let's continue on i think we got rene i think i think while we still have rene well we still
[01:57:22.960 --> 01:57:29.440]   have rene apple tv stories bunch of them bunch of them t-mobile is offering just in the nick of time
[01:57:29.440 --> 01:57:33.600]   now that i've got the message of t-mobile saying yeah we all your information is compromised
[01:57:33.600 --> 01:57:38.080]   there but on the bright side you're getting a free year of apple tv plus starting wednesday
[01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:44.480]   morning show in c season two season two trailer is out for the morning show i haven't seen it yet
[01:57:44.480 --> 01:57:50.480]   does it look good yeah it looks very morning showy um in the morning show to me the last few
[01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:53.520]   episodes of that were terrific so i'm looking forward to it i don't know if they can recapture
[01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:57.200]   the magic some people are complaining about Ted lasso season two magic so you never know
[01:57:57.200 --> 01:58:02.960]   but i'm hopeful i haven't watched any of that yet looking forward to it uh if you wanted something
[01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:10.800]   a little different the tragedy of mckbeth is coming to apple tv october 17th the cohen brothers have
[01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:18.320]   written it not it's shakespeare's mckbeth as as seen by the cohen brothers starring denzel washington
[01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:23.360]   and frances mckdormand is lady mckbeth that's going to be interesting oh yeah that should be
[01:58:23.360 --> 01:58:30.400]   interesting yeah that's coming uh of course we all saw the foundation uh trailer yes the long trailer
[01:58:30.400 --> 01:58:35.840]   now that that's gonna be that is gonna be so great or epic fail i just so great are so bad we don't
[01:58:35.840 --> 01:58:40.480]   know i just don't know i just don't know but i'm like oh it looks so interesting yeah it looks so
[01:58:40.480 --> 01:58:46.000]   dramatic yeah but you love the big you love the big swing and you're glad that that's what that's
[01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:50.320]   streaming media can do that it doesn't we're not we're not putting all of our hopes on a hundred
[01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:55.920]   million dollar opening weekend it's okay to take some risks it's okay to go for a smaller audience
[01:58:55.920 --> 01:58:59.040]   that will absolutely love the hell out of this as opposed to getting everybody in the theater at
[01:58:59.040 --> 01:59:05.280]   the same time yeah yeah big swing uh amex yeah it's definitely the way to make it i think dune is
[01:59:05.280 --> 01:59:09.920]   it's gonna have a trouble with it only two movies to do that whole novel it makes it a lot more
[01:59:09.920 --> 01:59:14.240]   sense to take something and spread it out over multi many hours i how many hours is going to be
[01:59:14.240 --> 01:59:21.920]   do we know is it ten hours eight hours how many episodes yeah but i think the turn the trend is
[01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:27.040]   series there's no reason for a subscription model to make movies right i mean that's the one like
[01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:31.360]   you now when i see movies i'm like oh did they really did that like like why did they only had an
[01:59:31.360 --> 01:59:35.120]   hour and a half for that like they were two hours tell a story i mean you know we could have done
[01:59:35.120 --> 01:59:39.920]   we could have done the hobbit and lord of the rings for like five years like every week you know
[01:59:39.920 --> 01:59:44.880]   well good news uh amazon is remaking lord of the rings and i don't i don't get remaking it they're
[01:59:44.880 --> 01:59:50.160]   making it's it's not part of the the same it's not allowed to touch the lord of the ring so it's at
[01:59:50.160 --> 01:59:59.040]   a different time oh yeah uh so i don't know if i like that uh let's see there's still a little bit of
[01:59:59.040 --> 02:00:07.120]   apple tv left something to do with ryan Reynolds and ron mackellaney demanding shortbread biscuits
[02:00:07.120 --> 02:00:13.680]   so i think that there was a passing comment in the in the recent ted lasso uh that was um maybe
[02:00:13.680 --> 02:00:19.920]   giving a i haven't seen it but i but but it evidently gave kind of a side comment about their purchase
[02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:26.000]   of the football team and they they sent a ceasin desists you know a letter so so actually they have a
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:32.320]   Welsh football team rexam afc they actually did buy that i think they did yeah they're referred to
[02:00:32.320 --> 02:00:37.600]   in ted lasso as having as owning it yeah and i think that they and then they demanded they sent
[02:00:37.600 --> 02:00:43.600]   out a ceasin desist this letter and demanded cookies yeah while we while we hold the
[02:00:43.600 --> 02:00:47.840]   incomparable jerry mace smith with no ill regarding our honor to be mentioned on the platform that's
[02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:53.920]   brought us high quality programming ranging from mythic quest season one to mythic quest season two
[02:00:53.920 --> 02:00:58.960]   of course robs is star of that show creator we must insist that you ceasin desists from the casting of
[02:00:58.960 --> 02:01:06.080]   any doubt regarding our commitment to the club the fans and the entire rexam community we want two
[02:01:06.080 --> 02:01:11.680]   large boxes of ted lasso's biscuits to be sent to the club ahead of the ceasin kickoff this weekend
[02:01:11.680 --> 02:01:18.160]   to avoid legal action and once again ryan renolds wins the internet yeah you know like he's good

[02:01:51.360 --> 02:01:57.520]   ryanne let's uh... before we lose you again let's kick off with your pick of the week this week
[02:01:59.200 --> 02:02:02.640]   all right so my pick of the week is just a really quick one is something i really like it's no
[02:02:02.640 --> 02:02:07.040]   mad goods which makes some of my favorite leather products for my favorite apple products and they
[02:02:07.040 --> 02:02:11.600]   just showed off today a i don't know how to describe it's like a leather sticker it's like one of
[02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:16.080]   those vinyl not not vinyl but one of the stickers you put on the back of an iphone that's really
[02:02:16.080 --> 02:02:20.080]   minimalist but this is made out of their famous leather they do really really really
[02:02:20.080 --> 02:02:26.480]   leather yeah the chicago leather guys and it works with the mixtape oh that's nice yeah
[02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:31.040]   but it isn't a good imagine that it's just it's just the back
[02:02:31.040 --> 02:02:36.480]   and i don't want to case but i i am i am just i don't want to use a bad word on this show but i
[02:02:36.480 --> 02:02:41.040]   am just that kind of jerk that would love to pose with a finely leather backed iphone you know put
[02:02:41.040 --> 02:02:47.680]   it artistily on the side of my coffee cup shot on instagram i am i am that worst terrible person
[02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:51.600]   and this is just perfect because i don't want anything big i don't want to be bulky but also one
[02:02:51.600 --> 02:02:57.200]   of the worst aspects of modern iphones it's like like anything that has uh inductive charging
[02:02:57.200 --> 02:03:02.080]   also seems by law to require the slippery is back imaginable and i'm going back to like palm
[02:03:02.080 --> 02:03:08.320]   preys nexus fors all the the current uh flip galaxy flips they race to the edge of a perfectly
[02:03:08.320 --> 02:03:14.080]   flat table in no time at all and then all you find out is boom on the floor so i put these i put my
[02:03:14.080 --> 02:03:19.920]   iphone 12 down and it inevitably falls off and leather has friction and it's it's not bulky it's
[02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:23.680]   not gonna weigh me down it's not gonna feel big in my pocket it's not gonna do anything but stop my
[02:03:23.680 --> 02:03:28.480]   phone from falling and that's the kind of prevent preventative protection i really want if it's
[02:03:28.480 --> 02:03:32.720]   already falling i don't need this ramix yield it's too late stop it from falling to begin with
[02:03:32.720 --> 02:03:37.760]   and it's my hope that i can do that and look good like look indiana jones good well doing you too
[02:03:37.760 --> 02:03:44.400]   looks nice it's uh nice and thin yeah it's just a little a skin for the back but no
[02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:48.400]   mad just minimalist i have a lot of no mad stuff they do really nice leather that's the
[02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:53.600]   flex on your flat laleo yeah that's the lovely thing about those those camera bumps it makes it
[02:03:53.600 --> 02:03:58.480]   really easy to locate an accessory like that that's a good point it just simply snips around it it
[02:03:58.480 --> 02:04:03.040]   looks like it now now the camera bump is flushed with that leather back it looks like it was built
[02:04:03.040 --> 02:04:07.920]   in so don't complain about bumps there they have they're they have their uses i might get this actually
[02:04:07.920 --> 02:04:15.040]   that's a good point yeah yeah ordered immediately yeah andy naco pick of the week uh mine is a really
[02:04:15.040 --> 02:04:19.920]   cool app for to help you take your pills your medications there's an app called hello meds
[02:04:19.920 --> 02:04:25.680]   that just came across last week it's uh it's iphone only uh and what i like about it is that
[02:04:25.680 --> 02:04:30.080]   there are all kinds of different apps for you know making sure that you take your medication on time
[02:04:30.080 --> 02:04:34.640]   but they're very linear they're very literal and how they work it's like okay you uh on this page
[02:04:34.640 --> 02:04:40.000]   you you take it you list what your pill is how many you need to take and what time you're supposed
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:44.560]   and it will give you a reminder that you have taken you need to take the thing this is more like
[02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:50.080]   this is more flexible so it can do stuff like that but it's also for like uh i take a i take a
[02:04:50.080 --> 02:04:55.840]   brain pill that it's not necessarily the same time every day it's like if i feel as though i'm going to
[02:04:55.840 --> 02:05:01.520]   if i'm going to be talking extemporaneously on mac break for a couple hours it helps if i take
[02:05:01.520 --> 02:05:06.720]   this pill like an hour beforehand so that the the the dents and the scratches in my brain get
[02:05:06.720 --> 02:05:11.760]   buffed over well enough that i can have uh my my best chance at a really good conversation so it's
[02:05:11.760 --> 02:05:16.960]   not necessarily the right to a certain time of every day it's just as needed per use and this is
[02:05:16.960 --> 02:05:21.760]   very good for tracking yes i did use that today so that means that i can't take another one for another
[02:05:21.760 --> 02:05:29.200]   x hours or uh or even if it is a case of uh a pill that you take every morning when you wake up
[02:05:29.200 --> 02:05:34.080]   maybe you are so foggy you know because you've just woken up you don't know whether you just sort of
[02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:39.680]   automatically took your pill or whether you decided to like go and wash your face and you don't by the
[02:05:39.680 --> 02:05:44.080]   time you get back you don't know if you've taken or not to log exactly when you've taken the sort of
[02:05:44.080 --> 02:05:49.920]   stuff i like the way that it works it look it it you can tell from the block it says in the blog post
[02:05:49.920 --> 02:05:54.560]   it was written by somebody who needed to track their own meds as opposed to someone who did a
[02:05:54.560 --> 02:05:58.640]   focus group and it definitely has that uh you definitely you can definitely can tell by the way
[02:05:58.640 --> 02:06:04.320]   that this thing works now i did read the the privacy statement my understanding from the privacy
[02:06:04.320 --> 02:06:10.080]   statement is that all of the personal data in terms of the medication you use and what times
[02:06:10.080 --> 02:06:15.120]   you're taking them stays on the device it doesn't get synced up to anywhere else uh that uh the the
[02:06:15.120 --> 02:06:20.000]   usual stuff that's in the privacy uh privacy statement has to do with like if you are a user of this
[02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:24.640]   app obviously it knows that you're using this app if the company is bought or the app is bought by
[02:06:24.640 --> 02:06:29.120]   another company then that other company will know that you that you own this app and you have been
[02:06:29.120 --> 02:06:33.760]   using it but it won't have access to the data you've been entering so that's probably the one question
[02:06:33.760 --> 02:06:38.400]   that you want to have answered before you start using an app like this um i this is the sort of
[02:06:38.400 --> 02:06:43.120]   stuff that i really wish i could it's it's it's the oh the other thing that i want to make sure i
[02:06:43.120 --> 02:06:49.120]   point it out it is also uh completely wired into shortcuts so if you want to just put a big big
[02:06:49.120 --> 02:06:53.840]   button on your home screen that says yes i yes i took the orange and purple pill whatever that is
[02:06:53.840 --> 02:06:58.640]   and it will create the log or if you want to have a create a widget that just simply shows you an
[02:06:58.640 --> 02:07:02.880]   update of what you have taken today when you took it when uh what you need to still take
[02:07:02.880 --> 02:07:06.800]   it can handle all that too generating reports if you want to do that through shortcuts i mean
[02:07:06.800 --> 02:07:13.040]   it's it is the sort of app that makes me want to switch back to iphone as my regular as my regular
[02:07:13.040 --> 02:07:17.600]   phone android apps are great and they're they're beautiful i love a lot of the stuff that i use
[02:07:17.600 --> 02:07:24.080]   but it seems like the stuff that is just perfect solution to a problem like this and supports
[02:07:24.080 --> 02:07:28.400]   additional technologies like shortcuts they're far and few between on android this is one of the
[02:07:28.400 --> 02:07:33.680]   big advantages you get by using the iphone so big so big ups for this i think i think it's very
[02:07:33.680 --> 02:07:37.360]   well focused for the way that people take a bunch of medications over the course of a day
[02:07:37.360 --> 02:07:47.680]   hello meds from hello code dot co and uh it's free right looks like it's free um it is it is free i
[02:07:47.680 --> 02:07:52.080]   didn't see i didn't see an in-app purchase thing i i'd rather did not i've only only been using it
[02:07:52.080 --> 02:07:57.680]   like on my iPad for the past week to see to see how well it works looks cool yeah from
[02:07:57.680 --> 02:08:03.040]   there are australian so i'm sure they're nice there you go well again they they they they have to
[02:08:03.040 --> 02:08:08.320]   take anti-venom pills they have to take various antidotes she have to get very shots you never know
[02:08:08.320 --> 02:08:12.720]   it's a life or death thing over there so trust in australian about trust in meds and it is written
[02:08:12.720 --> 02:08:18.480]   in swift so uh it's absolutely native yeah i was checking that beautiful looking at uh all right
[02:08:18.480 --> 02:08:25.520]   we have saved the most expensive for last not the thon this time not this time yeah the um uh
[02:08:25.520 --> 02:08:32.240]   quick kind of small one uh i for apple tv just as an aside watch the sound with mark ronson is
[02:08:32.240 --> 02:08:37.760]   pretty slick uh it's really getting behind them behind of how music i was just watching a synth
[02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:43.200]   one but he's got lots of other ones that are in there in on the in apple tv plus and uh so if
[02:08:43.200 --> 02:08:46.960]   you're just looking for something that's a little bit more documentary around music um it's worth
[02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:51.600]   checking out it's a little over produced here and there but a lot of the content's really good
[02:08:51.600 --> 02:08:56.800]   watch this looks like it has and his favorite dave grohl is there so it looks good it's gonna
[02:08:56.800 --> 02:09:02.240]   be good if it's dave grohl's there all right yep the my pick for the week though is it's from um
[02:09:02.240 --> 02:09:08.560]   don kamarachka and it's called macro photography and don't don is amazing we've had him on it
[02:09:08.560 --> 02:09:13.840]   yeah he had and sat him on hands up it's on this book it is a coffee that's coffee table book like
[02:09:13.840 --> 02:09:21.440]   it is so nice there's no flake guy he was and that what he is but he really took it to another level
[02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:25.920]   with the macro photography and it's just a book that you just want to just look at the pretty
[02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:31.600]   pictures but it also breaks down how to actually do it like you know this is the way that you put
[02:09:31.600 --> 02:09:38.480]   these together and he's and he has really taken this to a whole different level um you know of really
[02:09:38.480 --> 02:09:43.520]   talking about how to do it how to process it the kind of tools that you need and he's been on
[02:09:43.520 --> 02:09:48.480]   office hours and and walked us through a lot of this stuff and i've you know he's i don't know if
[02:09:48.480 --> 02:09:54.560]   there's anybody that's thinking as hard about this as he is um right now in the world and it's just
[02:09:54.560 --> 02:09:59.360]   you know the workflows that are in here so it's not just it is it here's the best part about this
[02:09:59.360 --> 02:10:07.200]   it's a pretty book with pretty pictures that you can just enjoy and then it comes with a bunch of
[02:10:07.200 --> 02:10:12.560]   great information that you can actually use to do it yourself it's just a it's a really really
[02:10:12.560 --> 02:10:18.720]   amazing um piece of work that i know he's worked really hard on and um anyway so i i just think that
[02:10:18.720 --> 02:10:23.280]   it's it's a magnificent book and it's the kind of book that you want to buy to make sure that he
[02:10:23.280 --> 02:10:28.720]   keeps doing this you know whatever he wants to do next yeah um because it's it's so well written and
[02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:36.160]   and well laid out and beautiful to look at and and again it has great you know real life it's not a
[02:10:36.160 --> 02:10:39.520]   author trying to figure out how to do macro bio it's someone who's really passionate about macro
[02:10:39.520 --> 02:10:46.640]   photography really giving you everything you need to know to actually do it um and and then and then
[02:10:46.640 --> 02:10:50.560]   made it pretty usually get one or the other you don't get both at the same time and this book is
[02:10:50.560 --> 02:10:56.240]   both and it's just i would run not walk to go to go get it if you're interested that all photography
[02:10:56.240 --> 02:11:01.920]   the universe at our feet there's an e-book edition i bet you want the seventy five dollar coffee table

[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:13.680]   made beautifully bound beautifully printed book it's not it's not a twenty one dollar dummies guy
[02:11:13.680 --> 02:11:18.080]   it really is something it is a how-to book you would keep again like like gala said on the coffee
[02:11:18.080 --> 02:11:21.280]   table because you will be flipping through it and enjoying the experience of looking at these
[02:11:21.280 --> 02:11:27.040]   pictures and with the extra secret sauce that oh gee if when you're many many books of these kinds
[02:11:27.040 --> 02:11:32.560]   you will you become inspired to take take photographs like this and this book will tell you and help
[02:11:32.560 --> 02:11:37.040]   you and how to actually do that whether you have really expensive equipment or you don't have really
[02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:43.040]   expensive equipment it's a very very well done book wow really neat uh he's done a number of
[02:11:43.040 --> 02:11:48.640]   other books but this is this is his newest uh it's in pre-release actually all pre-orders have
[02:11:48.640 --> 02:11:53.840]   shipped new orders ship immediately macro photography the universe at our feet i guess it's officially
[02:11:53.840 --> 02:11:59.200]   out now and the best way to get it is from his website and go to skycrystals.ca
[02:11:59.200 --> 02:12:05.120]   if you want to get it get it from him directly good recommendation i'm gonna buy that right now
[02:12:05.120 --> 02:12:12.240]   i already bought the nomad case so uh and i downloaded hello meds so i guess it's uh we have a hat trick
[02:12:12.240 --> 02:12:21.200]   it's been a while since we've had a hat trick thank you Alex Lindsey office hours dot global
[02:12:21.200 --> 02:12:26.400]   what's the latest over at office hours uh you know the the interesting thing is the second
[02:12:26.400 --> 02:12:29.680]   the second hours have just gotten really good like i've gotten to the point i don't know if i
[02:12:29.680 --> 02:12:33.360]   told this before last week but you know we just i don't want to meet with any software companies
[02:12:33.360 --> 02:12:38.560]   or hardware companies without without my my posse because they they think about all the questions i
[02:12:38.560 --> 02:12:44.080]   wouldn't thought wouldn't have thought of we had um uh some guys on talking about remote music uh today
[02:12:45.200 --> 02:12:51.840]   and and it was what was interesting about it was is that we probably asked them 5060 questions in
[02:12:51.840 --> 02:12:57.600]   an hour like it was just the peppering of stuff and i learned so much um and uh so it was just a
[02:12:57.600 --> 02:13:03.200]   really interesting thing we're our our Saturdays are back the long days so we have education then
[02:13:03.200 --> 02:13:09.760]   we switch to unreal engine then we switch to uh we're mixing we're literally cutting a show in bell
[02:13:09.760 --> 02:13:17.120]   fast from all over the world so last week we had a the the person editing the show was in um
[02:13:17.120 --> 02:13:21.680]   Germany the person we had different people calling the show some were in boston and some were in
[02:13:21.680 --> 02:13:28.000]   maryland and some were at other places and then but the the bar we had a band that came in just for
[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:32.960]   us uh and and uh and so we were because we were trying to figure it out like how do we cut the show
[02:13:32.960 --> 02:13:37.200]   in bellfast from all over the world and we said someone from the west indies was doing part of
[02:13:37.200 --> 02:13:42.000]   it as well and you know so there's all this this interaction we're we're now getting to a point
[02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:46.240]   where we're not just talking there's a lot of people hanging out and doing things together
[02:13:46.240 --> 02:13:50.800]   and then and then after that after we finished that we started cooking i made some incredible
[02:13:50.800 --> 02:13:56.720]   chutney um so it's like the best chutney ever and and and so um we did it together you know because
[02:13:56.720 --> 02:14:02.240]   we're figuring out how to learn something together physically and as well as making good food so um
[02:14:02.240 --> 02:14:07.200]   watching you read a cookbook making chutney there's it's a it's a confort we had a fab
[02:14:07.200 --> 02:14:14.160]   domyanti gajar who is who is uh in south africa indian in south africa teaching us how to do it
[02:14:14.160 --> 02:14:19.680]   oh live and so we're and so she's answering all the questions and this is what you want and this is
[02:14:19.680 --> 02:14:24.000]   how you do it and i think the video is up there and and and and so it's so we're you know it's
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:29.280]   and it's breaking new ground in the idea of of what it is to you know to learn how to do that so um
[02:14:29.840 --> 02:14:35.680]   so there you so domyanti and it's you know of course it's us so it's it's these are she's got uh uh
[02:14:35.680 --> 02:14:42.080]   hosmok has her her husband has you know two black magic six kays you know and a switcher and uh
[02:14:42.080 --> 02:14:47.520]   you know like they're like you know this isn't oh my god this isn't like your webcam you know you know
[02:14:47.520 --> 02:14:53.040]   and so so um so we're kind of taking it to an entirely you know i think you live it actually
[02:14:53.040 --> 02:15:01.120]   your break this is a breakthrough in uh uh media frankly because the idea of having uh
[02:15:01.120 --> 02:15:07.360]   60 people asking questions at once it really is 10 times better and then the idea of of doing
[02:15:07.360 --> 02:15:12.480]   these kind of remote cooking things you're you're reinventing you're inventing a new kind of media
[02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:17.680]   that i think is very successful very interesting really works it's interesting it's it's it's
[02:15:17.680 --> 02:15:21.520]   getting interesting and it gets more interesting every week and and you know now there's an after
[02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:26.080]   hours which i'll jump into after we have this show and there's just and we'll just be all hanging
[02:15:26.080 --> 02:15:30.160]   but everyone's hanging out 24/7 so there's 50/60 people there and and what happens is you just
[02:15:30.160 --> 02:15:34.080]   ask you have a question oh i don't understand this and someone is there to show you you know how to
[02:15:34.080 --> 02:15:39.520]   you know how to do that and it's it's there you can see me in my kitchen working away they told
[02:15:39.520 --> 02:15:44.480]   us at tech tv oh we can't have a mirror in the ceiling for a top down that's those shake it's
[02:15:44.480 --> 02:15:49.040]   too hard to do that my god well that's not a mirror that's just the camera up there you know
[02:15:49.040 --> 02:15:53.200]   pointed yeah yeah but it's but but but here's here's a here's a crazy thing is
[02:15:53.200 --> 02:15:58.640]   oh i want some yeah and the cameras though before the show were were shaded from new york who's doing
[02:15:58.640 --> 02:16:03.520]   the switching hosmok her husband he's he's not just her switching who's switching to the other people
[02:16:03.520 --> 02:16:10.640]   on the zoom call oh we had um i'm not sure i i i feel bad now it's a camera so somebody's in zoom
[02:16:10.640 --> 02:16:15.600]   there's some director that's doing some cutting right so so what happens is is that they're they're
[02:16:15.600 --> 02:16:20.320]   in zoom um whoever's running the conference i guess is doing there they're basically what their
[02:16:20.320 --> 02:16:26.000]   view is so they're able to cut it in zoom and what goes out to youtube is what's being cut and um
[02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:32.320]   i i i because this is like you this is like a this is like we are the world you've got
[02:16:32.320 --> 02:16:37.280]   people all over the world with their cameras yep doing something and somebody's cutting it
[02:16:37.280 --> 02:16:43.840]   probably in another country yeah yeah oh my god in real time yeah look how good this looks
[02:16:44.320 --> 02:16:50.480]   yeah it's that's like can you get the zoom logo out of there is your way to do that
[02:16:50.480 --> 02:16:56.080]   yeah yeah we're that's next it's not it we're the new system is i mean i'm like giving a plug
[02:16:56.080 --> 02:17:00.320]   because it's pretty amazing that there's no it's that you could do this what's what's nice about
[02:17:00.320 --> 02:17:05.840]   this is that it's really easy you know the zoom logo comes with wow i just hit go and it goes right
[02:17:05.840 --> 02:17:10.560]   the new system that we're building for the fall actually takes all of the all the feeds out
[02:17:10.560 --> 02:17:14.240]   kind of like what you're doing what you're doing for this show it takes them all out and puts them
[02:17:14.240 --> 02:17:19.520]   into into graphics and right right um so it's and then we're taking the problem we have is that
[02:17:19.520 --> 02:17:25.600]   instead of having four people we have 20 right so so we have to build an entirely new um the new
[02:17:25.600 --> 02:17:31.280]   logic system to be able to cut randomly between 20 people is what's this what's this thing in the
[02:17:31.280 --> 02:17:36.160]   upper left hand corner this oh that's our that's our meters make sure your audio meters are right
[02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:41.760]   we're gonna scope one next to it or scopes oh that's a scope and meters yeah and shame and it was
[02:17:41.760 --> 02:17:48.480]   mastering shame-based engineering yeah yeah and uh oh tony's flaring on his forehead looks like
[02:17:48.480 --> 02:17:53.920]   someone doesn't understand how to do how to do auto white leveling yeah jj jj's who's cutting so
[02:17:53.920 --> 02:17:58.000]   jj who's the black screen down there jj is cutting the show like he's sitting there in there oh and
[02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:02.320]   that's why he's got a black screen and bobby who's bobby because she looks like she knows what she's
[02:18:02.320 --> 02:18:09.440]   doing in there this is good yeah bobby is in monoray and bad in the kitchen live she's even
[02:18:09.440 --> 02:18:13.440]   got an apron yeah well that was because we did we didn't you know a bunch of shows mad in the
[02:18:13.440 --> 02:18:17.280]   kitchen which was even a bigger thing because we were bringing we were really bringing all those in
[02:18:17.280 --> 02:18:20.960]   and cutting them closer to twit that was an experiment you know over a couple weekends and so
[02:18:20.960 --> 02:18:27.200]   so the um so so that yeah we're there's something about just cooking with shannon's husband doing
[02:18:27.200 --> 02:18:31.840]   back there what's he up to he's making he's oh no that's
[02:18:31.840 --> 02:18:40.480]   yeah that's her mom oh yeah yeah of course yeah people pull it so but but the um uh
[02:18:40.480 --> 02:18:48.960]   sneak it into chops and garlic yeah the um uh i gotta tell you though this is the way to learn
[02:18:48.960 --> 02:18:54.480]   how to cook because you have incredible the person who wrote the book so uh demiante wrote a book on
[02:18:54.480 --> 02:18:58.480]   on um arabatic cooking you know so it's so vegetarian it's really healthy
[02:18:58.480 --> 02:19:03.200]   and so she wrote this book and um she's going through these different recipes that are in the
[02:19:03.200 --> 02:19:09.440]   book and we're all learning and able to ask questions from the author from the person who wrote it
[02:19:09.440 --> 02:19:14.160]   you know while we're working and folks this is literally a covex of the future i mean this is
[02:19:14.160 --> 02:19:18.880]   this is reinventing the medium that's a very interesting story this is this is a you've created
[02:19:18.880 --> 02:19:23.760]   a skunk works for video yeah it's like you'll just figure it out you're on your own amazing well
[02:19:24.240 --> 02:19:30.080]   it that we we have a um you know we have people now starting shows and then a whole bunch of people
[02:19:30.080 --> 02:19:35.120]   just group in and build the show like we built um tony mobley has one that is uh it's it's an
[02:19:35.120 --> 02:19:38.800]   interviews show kind of like that but he was doing it through zoom and everyone said you know i
[02:19:38.800 --> 02:19:43.440]   think we can do this in aws and next thing you know it's got graphics and super sources and
[02:19:43.440 --> 02:19:47.520]   everything else all being done in the cloud and it was figured out in like a couple days by by
[02:19:47.520 --> 02:19:52.800]   people who are working together and that's on wednesday nights and so so the um it's love this i love
[02:19:52.800 --> 02:19:58.800]   this scope goes it's a part of this part of this obsession oh yeah yeah we don't mess around oh my
[02:19:58.800 --> 02:20:05.360]   god this is awesome we don't this is mind-flowing it's it's it's it's a very it's it's it's just one
[02:20:05.360 --> 02:20:11.600]   of the many things going on yes and uh it's it's a really um and it's an incredible community i mean
[02:20:11.600 --> 02:20:15.680]   the the thing is is that it's a really supportive community probably i i don't i've never seen one
[02:20:15.680 --> 02:20:20.080]   like it online and and that's just because of the the type people who showed up and you can see that
[02:20:20.080 --> 02:20:26.240]   there's a lot of recently good cameras yeah it looks good yeah yeah everyone looks good and there's
[02:20:26.240 --> 02:20:30.080]   almost like a quite half of us what do you call it shame-based engineering is that what you call it
[02:20:30.080 --> 02:20:41.840]   so gotta look good gotta look good yeah it's amazing it's it's a really good conversation i am i am uh i
[02:20:41.840 --> 02:20:47.040]   didn't i didn't get it at first i just thought you were being a masochist but uh but i see now
[02:20:47.040 --> 02:20:52.880]   there's there was some method in your masochism so it's it's taking a long time but it's it's again
[02:20:52.880 --> 02:20:57.360]   it's it's really more about the community is taken take it is slowly taking always the best way to
[02:20:57.360 --> 02:21:02.560]   do it always the best way let the community run it uh office hours dot global if you want to join

[02:25:43.920 --> 02:25:48.240]   Alex started this whole thing i think that it was do we did we mention by the way i don't know
[02:25:48.240 --> 02:25:56.960]   whether it happened before or after the last one that emry sold frame i owe he did yes 1.275 billion
[02:25:56.960 --> 02:26:04.480]   what adobe right okay so you're gonna take us on his yacht i i don't know i don't know it in cash
[02:26:04.480 --> 02:26:11.920]   not stock cash 1.7 1.2 75 billion did he have a fairly large stake in the thing i think he did
[02:26:11.920 --> 02:26:16.640]   he founded it like you know like i think he probably made more than ten dollars i don't think you know
[02:26:16.640 --> 02:26:22.880]   like it was him when he was just a normal person now he's a trace commas for those who were watching
[02:26:22.880 --> 02:26:28.960]   uh emry was in episode one of mac break video so the the very first one it was Leo and i and
[02:26:28.960 --> 02:26:36.320]   amber macarthur and and emry and he was on this week in media and um yeah so oh my god
[02:26:36.320 --> 02:26:41.280]   yeah just did that last week mac break weekly was we actually just celebrated our 15th anniversary
[02:26:41.280 --> 02:26:48.000]   was august 12th 2006 but mac break itself is older than that uh well and and also mac break weekly
[02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:53.200]   that's the first twit one right because i think that we were doing mac break weekly i think in the
[02:26:53.200 --> 02:26:57.200]   spring you were doing oh i thought you were just doing mac break you were also doing mac break weekly
[02:26:57.200 --> 02:27:03.280]   yeah so we had played with it and then then you took it over did i steal it from you no you did not
[02:27:03.280 --> 02:27:08.560]   no no we we talked about it i knew it would do better under you than me so i hope i didn't steal
[02:27:08.560 --> 02:27:12.560]   it from you i would do not steal it from you know no no you you asked you asked if i wanted to put
[02:27:12.560 --> 02:27:16.080]   it in there and i was like absolutely and you know i because i knew that it would be it would be
[02:27:16.080 --> 02:27:23.440]   better in your uh in your um box than my box so um you see all the other podcasts that i do how
[02:27:23.440 --> 02:27:29.360]   well they're doing you did the first mac break tv shows in 2006 also it looks like yeah i think that
[02:27:29.360 --> 02:27:34.880]   was that was number one that was the first mac break so the ten nd p episodes the infamous ten
[02:27:34.880 --> 02:27:40.320]   nd p episodes yeah still the most viewed one was the road to tenety-three the road how we got to this
[02:27:40.320 --> 02:27:47.200]   crazy thing now is that was an episode now ten eight piece nothing yeah but it was a thing back i mean
[02:27:47.200 --> 02:27:52.960]   it was there was a lot of what have i done uh moment uh because we shot we shot like i think we shot
[02:27:52.960 --> 02:27:58.160]   fifteen or sixteen episodes in green screen tenety-p and i did i did stupid things like i made the
[02:27:58.160 --> 02:28:03.520]   table green uh in the very first one as we had all these contact shadows and everything else so
[02:28:03.520 --> 02:28:08.560]   computers that could barely do it and i was just like oh this was a horrible idea and and leo is
[02:28:08.560 --> 02:28:14.000]   sending me emails about uh every day going hey when are we doing this i already talked about it and
[02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:17.520]   when are we gonna release these and i'm like so the road to tenety-p was like i just got to put
[02:28:17.520 --> 02:28:21.760]   something up and then uh we got them all out but it was um and then and then within the next shoot or
[02:28:21.760 --> 02:28:27.120]   two we were doing twenty-five a day twenty-five in a given day yeah so it wasn't it's you know there's
[02:28:27.120 --> 02:28:33.760]   a wikipedia article about all of this where i'm learning things that i never knew i didn't even
[02:28:33.760 --> 02:28:39.040]   know there was a a mac break minutes featuring merling man merlin man and kenji kato and that
[02:28:39.040 --> 02:28:44.400]   happened that happened in 2005 that was in the fall before this wow never even knew about that yeah
[02:28:44.400 --> 02:28:51.520]   uh wow uh fascinating you know i i i thought it at first but i think moving away from flash video
[02:28:51.520 --> 02:28:58.320]   was ultimately the right idea to feature the show i admitted i was i was short-sighted so thank you
