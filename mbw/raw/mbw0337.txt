[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.480]   and so forth.
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:16.320]   We've got a great team to do it, visiting us from Liverpool, Mr. Don McAllister of Screencast
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.320]   Online.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.320]   Hi, Don.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.320]   Hello, Leo.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.320]   Hi.
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.320]   Good to see you.
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.320]   Pretty, I'm only virtually visiting you this time.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.600]   Was there two weeks ago for Mac World, but I didn't make it in time for the show.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.400]   I am sorry, but that's okay.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.320]   So I was wondering, you did go to Mac World.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.320]   I will.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.320]   Yeah.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.320]   Yeah.
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.320]   All right.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.320]   Certainly did.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.320]   As you came over on the, I actually traveled on the Tuesday.
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.320]   That's why I couldn't make it onto the show.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.320]   And then I came back on the Sunday.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.240]   So I was there for the full three days.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.240]   Awesome.
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.240]   And worth it?
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.240]   Of course.
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.240]   Yeah.
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.240]   Yeah.
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.240]   It's still a good show.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.240]   I know it has changed significantly since Apple left, but it's still a great event.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.240]   And you know, the people, they're fantastic.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.560]   It's always good to meet up with old buddies and make new ones.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.960]   Everybody says it's the people now.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.960]   It's about the people.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.560]   Some good kit there as well.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.120]   I mean, the show floor was very busy.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.360]   Obviously, no great big announcements or anything, but you know, it's always interesting
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.360]   to see what's going on.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.960]   And the tech talks were very successful this year as well.
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.200]   I actually gave one this year, but I know that most of the sessions that I visited tended
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.520]   to be a little bit more than last year, actually.
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.960]   And then the 10-plus sessions.
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.240]   I think Renee, you agree that was Renee Richie is also here from iMore.com.
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.560]   And he came down from Montreal for Macworld, iWorld.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.560]   Absolutely.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.560]   And I got to meet Don.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.040]   And I got to meet a lot of other people that I have only met virtually or as talking heads
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.040]   on the Twit Network.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.960]   And I got to put actual bodies on them.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.960]   And that was fantastic.
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:30.960]   It's true.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.160]   We're just floating heads here, aren't we?
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.320]   Well, Andy and I and Don are.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.320]   Yeah.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.880]   Andy and Ico is here from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.280]   And this beautiful snowbound Boston area.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.280]   Hello, Andy.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.120]   A little less snow than on Saturday.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.800]   But again, we're made of party pioneer starter.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.640]   Did you lose power or utilities this time?
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.960]   Yeah, last Friday night, which was a bigger problem because the house is electrically
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:58.960]   heated.
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.880]   Fortunately, we have a wood burning stove.
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.160]   I put a knife I brought in a firewood to last me through the night.
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.280]   It was like eight degrees outside.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.200]   The interesting part of that was the time when I'm just sitting around the Starken house
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.200]   and thinking, oh, yeah, it's going to be eight degrees tonight.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.760]   I should take my soda out of the pantry in the kitchen and move it into the fridge.
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.640]   So it'll be insulated against the cold.
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.760]   So it was also good.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.920]   It was also good opportunity to go through my bookcases.
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.560]   If in the past five years you've set me a training book on a piece of software that
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.440]   hasn't been made for at least two years, I'm sorry I burned it.
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.120]   Did you read my doughy Photoshop four book?
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.920]   Well, I had firewood, but you know, you have this.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.280]   I'm sure you guys have this problem too, where you have books that you just keep for no
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.280]   part apparently.
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.880]   And I'm not talking about like new valuable books.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.440]   I'm talking about like Claris works, you know, stuff like that.
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.160]   Yeah, the Delphi three super Bible.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.640]   I'm not going to be doing it.
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.000]   Yeah, and you never get around to it and say, well, I wonder how well that will burn.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Well, what do you know?
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   It will burn very nicely.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.120]   Although I did, I did and the other fun was that every time I only burn like maybe five
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.760]   or six books and again, not because I was burning them for heat, but because okay, they'll
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.880]   stretch out my firewood a little bit more and also it'll like revive the fire.
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.080]   I need it added, but every time every time the other wind was every time I put another
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.120]   book on the fire, I had to do my, you know, Dr. Henry Jones at mange that goose stepping
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.200]   morons like you should try reading books instead of burning them.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.080]   And I had a good laugh and I was still cold, but I had a good laugh.
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.280]   It's like Fahrenheit 451 in there.
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.400]   I'm just happy enough to eat the squirrel.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:44.760]   I have to pity whoever's job it was like at the end of that book to have to memorize,
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:52.320]   you know, iOS 5.1 for the expert Bible for all 800 pages.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.240]   There are some books you really don't need to preserve, I think is the point.
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.240]   Yeah.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.960]   That's the title of the show, by the way.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.800]   I've already decided put another book on the fire.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.560]   I think it's perfect, perfect.
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.840]   All right, we could do, let's see, we could do rumors.
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.200]   We certainly got the rumor expert.
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.480]   We could do jail breaking.
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.520]   We could do news from Apple.
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.240]   We could do the big lawsuit, which Tim Cook calls a silly side show.
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.640]   We could talk about the watchroom.
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.000]   Let's start with a watch rumor.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.640]   I think that's a, that's a juicy one to start.
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.840]   Yeah, rumors for 400.
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:30.120]   This comes from, it started with Nick built in the New York Times quoting, it sounds like
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:37.080]   quoting Hanhai Foxconn, saying that Apple was making a curved glass smart watch.
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.040]   Wall Street Journal said, yeah, we know that.
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.640]   Yeah, yeah, we read that.
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.600]   I mean, we got, yeah, we have the story.
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.560]   And of course, once the times in journal say it's got to be true, but I'm more interested
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.960]   in what Renee Richie has to say.
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:53.960]   What do you think?
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:54.960]   Yeah.
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.240]   Well, my standard answer is that Apple is a really, really smart company and they're
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.880]   always working two to five years in the future.
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.240]   And if there is any product category that you can think of that they may want to one
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.760]   day be in, they've probably got the 10 designs and working on the three prototypes and they're
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:12.440]   locked in the lab next to the television sets and the IS, espresso makers and everything
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.880]   else that they're toying with.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:19.040]   But the timing I think is interesting because the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.160]   are usually organizations that, you know, they softly, not softly, but they get, they
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.640]   get told certain things at certain times.
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:30.360]   And whether it's to mitigate against what a competitor is doing or to, you know, a swage
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.880]   Wall Street fear is that the great era of Apple innovation is over, I think it is telling
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.680]   that both those papers do have rumors at the same time.
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:45.440]   You're saying these rumors come from Apple PR as a form of manipulation.
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:49.080]   I think sometimes, I mean, it's hard to say that exactly, but we all remember when the
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:53.000]   iPad was rumored, you know, before the iPhone, the iPhone was rumored, then the iPad was
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.840]   rumored and it was rumored at $1,000.
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:55.840]   And it came out at $500.
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.160]   And oh my goodness, how cheap is that?
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:02.360]   Boy, that does seem cheap when we compare it to the thousand we thought it would be.
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.360]   Right.
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.360]   So there's, yeah, I think it's a little...
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.360]   It's a limitation setting.
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.360]   Yeah.
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.360]   Yeah.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.360]   Expectation setting.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.360]   That's a nice way to put it.
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.360]   Yeah.
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.360]   Do you think...
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.360]   So it's the new Apple TV though, isn't it?
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.360]   That's the thing that's annoying me.
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.160]   Now everyone's jumping on the, the iWatch bandwagon and it's exactly the same as, you know, when
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.880]   the Apple TV rumors came out, you know, the big screen Apple TV, everybody now has to
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.000]   have their iWatch story.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.160]   And I think the catalyst to this is this little beauty because I actually got mine a couple
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.160]   of days ago.
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.160]   So you got the Pebble.
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.160]   Yeah.
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.160]   And he's got his...
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.160]   Claire's watch.
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.160]   The dog gal watch.
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:38.520]   But it is an actual like licensed Apple watch has got the Apple logo on it.
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:42.880]   That was like one of the last things that when Steve Jobs came back, when the first thing
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.720]   that was killed, like all the license thing.
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.720]   Yeah.
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:46.720]   And so you can...
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.720]   Did you blow an embargo on that, Anako?
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.520]   Design in Cupertino, Made in Switzerland.
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.520]   Yes.
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.520]   Yes.
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:52.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:53.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.000]   And the always up stages is, doesn't he always has the gear and have...
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   It's great.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   He's actually got an Apple watch and there is death.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   Got the Apple watch.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   You always...
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   Maybe something like this.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   If it looks like that, I don't want...
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.080]   See, this is, I think this is what we're expecting like from Apple.
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.360]   It's about just for people listening at home.
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.840]   It's the size of a small television.
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:18.320]   It's got, it's about as thick like a fun sized Snickers bar.
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.480]   It's like with on hand wrist PC.
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.480]   Is that a spot?
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.480]   Watch, what is that?
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.480]   No, no, no.
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.760]   It's the on hand wrist PC.
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:26.760]   It was very...
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.120]   I don't know if it ran Palm, but it ran something very similar to Palm.
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.760]   It has a stylist, doesn't it?
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:38.280]   No, it has like a little five, like little joystick here, like a five button joystick
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.280]   here.
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:40.280]   Wow.
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:45.600]   And runs on a stack of like CR 20 35 cells, like three of them inside there that would
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.920]   run for practically nothing.
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:52.440]   And even though it's just like an LCD screen, it doesn't tell you the time until you sort
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:56.000]   of like nudge this button to like get it to wake up.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   And so...
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.600]   But imagine like going through an airport with like, I've got like my rolling my luggage
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.720]   in my and one hand with this, I have to sort of like lift up my wrist and sort of bang
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.360]   it against my chin just to find out if I'm going to make my flighter.
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:10.360]   But let's face it, it is a chick magnet, isn't it?
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.360]   Well, I took this.
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.360]   Clearly.
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.360]   Has a magnet in you.
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.880]   You come to me, chick.
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.600]   Yeah, it's sexy.
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.200]   I think Don is right that we are in a...
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.200]   Go ahead, right.
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.520]   We're in a hit driven business for Apple.
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.360]   I mean, it's always what have you done for me lately.
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.440]   They're going to make the phone, they made the phone, where's the tablet?
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.240]   Okay, here's a tablet, where's the TV, where's the watch?
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:37.400]   And it's some combination of them having done a lot of high profile products, but also
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.680]   this really strange expectation from customers in Wall Street.
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:45.560]   If you look at Amazon and their price to earnings ratio, and they've never been profitable
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:50.400]   compared to Apple, who makes heaps and tons of money, but the expectation is always what
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.400]   is next from Apple.
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:55.480]   So I think there is some pressure to, even if there's not something coming next to have
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.520]   the appearance of things that are always in the pipeline.
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:00.400]   Do you think it's significant, I guess you do, that the Wall Street Journal and the New
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:04.160]   York Times floated this rumor, which would otherwise be pretty much...
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.760]   I mean, look, everybody would publish it and we might even talk about it, but everybody
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:11.920]   would point out, as you did, Apple makes a lot of prototypes, doesn't mean they're going
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.880]   to market with it.
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:18.680]   It is a fairly advanced step to take it to Han Hai and say, "Let's make this," because
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.840]   that means, "Well, we're thinking enough about it that we want to see if we can produce
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:23.840]   it."
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:24.840]   Right.
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.240]   I believe they have television prototypes, too.
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.600]   I mean, they're a very hands-on company.
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:32.600]   Most of the stuff that, as much as Johnny Ive makes wonderful stuff, he also makes the
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.720]   machines that makes wonderful stuff.
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:38.560]   Their design department does a lot of incredible things and their huge fans are prototyping.
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:39.560]   Yeah.
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:42.640]   So I don't think it's odd at all that some of this stuff is in the design stage, or is
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:47.400]   that old, quote, "1031," you make 10 design, three prototypes, one product, and there
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:52.240]   could be something along that stage of release that people are talking about.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.240]   I like that.
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:56.840]   So it's at three, not 10, but it's not one yet either.
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.360]   Now, a couple of people have weighed in on this.
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:03.520]   Ryan Block, way back when Apple killed the Square Nano that people were wearing as a
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.800]   wristwatch, and people said, "Why?
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:07.800]   Why?"
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:11.880]   You step towards your wearable computer.
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.920]   Ryan Block said, "No, no, this makes perfect sense.
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:17.600]   They're going to kill that because people are using it that way, but it's not as good
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.280]   as it could be.
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.720]   So they made something not wearable."
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:25.320]   And that's, he thought, definite indication that Apple's looking at making a wearable
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.760]   watch.
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:35.240]   And then now, ask Tog Nizini, Bruce Tog Nizini, who's a longtime Apple guy and Apple watcher.
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:39.760]   Now, he says, "The eye watch will fill a gaping hole in the Apple ecosystem.
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.360]   It will facilitate and coordinate not—" Now, he's not speaking for Apple.
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.680]   He's no longer at Apple, but he's still a designer.
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:48.320]   "It will facilitate and coordinate not only the activities of all the other computers
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.880]   and devices we use, but a wide array of devices to come."
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.520]   He says, "It's a digital hub."
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:57.040]   Well, I mean, that's so speculative.
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:00.560]   The thing is about—I agree with that when you see something in the New York Times and
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:04.800]   the Wall Street Journal, usually, I don't—you don't know for a fact, but one of the things
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:09.320]   you put on your little whiteboard of possibilities is that this is a controlled leak for purposes
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:13.520]   to which we can't really guess as to why there—why such a leak would be made.
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.960]   But it is very much a content-free leak when you read both these articles.
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.960]   There's very little you can really sink your teeth to.
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:22.480]   I was going—I, of course, went through my archives and I wrote about an Apple watch
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:27.240]   in 2011, I think it's still up on Macworld, talking about, here's what they could do
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:30.120]   just as a design thing and as a cool thing to do.
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:34.600]   But when we talk about—now everybody's sort of letting their imaginations get away from
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:39.000]   them because they're talking about how Apple will create a watch that will coordinate every
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.800]   single thing we do and every single one of our computers.
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.480]   They have yet to produce another product that works that way.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:49.440]   They make a lot of devices that communicate with each other very effectively, but they—if
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:54.600]   they were to produce a watch that were to unify all of your devices into one experience
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:58.160]   that would be pretty much an unprecedented product for them to make.
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:05.080]   They keep talking about things like OS services like Notification Center and Siri of all things.
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:11.420]   Those are both OS X services and we'll remember that iOS and Mac OS are both different build
[00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:13.280]   outs of OS X.
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:17.400]   If you're going to be using a really, really muscular operating system that can do that,
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:20.560]   you're going to need a real CPU for it, you're going to need a real CPU for it, now you're
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.240]   going to need a new battery for it.
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:26.400]   That's how sensible sane men wind up with a watch design like this.
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.400]   So, Homer, since he's watched.
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:34.080]   So, I'm not really sure that I like the idea of an Apple watch.
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:40.200]   I think that when I—every time that I think that that's a really good rumor, I always
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:45.440]   think about the opening lines in the keynote in which Tim Cook shows it off.
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:49.640]   And I can totally imagine him saying, "We were all around our conference table at a
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:53.520]   meeting and suddenly we realized that none of us wear digital watches.
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.160]   We all wear analog watches."
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:59.600]   And we discovered the reason why we wear analog watches is because we've never been able
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:04.400]   to find a digital watch that's so good, we would want to wear it every single day.
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:09.160]   So we made one and then roll up a sleeve and hold up for the camera.
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.600]   You can really—I can really see that sort of thing happening.
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:17.400]   What I don't see is we don't—when we have a watch that is going to be sold to consumers
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:22.240]   or remember that Apple is a consumer electronics company at this point, not a computer company,
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:27.280]   they have to make a product that really speaks to the average person who has everyday problems.
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:32.560]   And right now, nobody has described a problem where I'm—I have a problem where it's very
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:37.120]   difficult for me to reach into my pocket over here and pick up my phone and look at a notification.
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:40.840]   It's very, very difficult for me to look to the left of my salad plate at a restaurant
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:44.800]   where I've left my phone and checked for a notification.
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:49.080]   You have to sort of train people to look at this expensive thing on their wrist for
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:53.040]   something that is not going to be able to tell them what the real problem—excuse me—it's
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.680]   going to give them sort of a go or a no-go.
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:58.600]   So yes, you should look at your phone right now and here's the reason why.
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:02.240]   It's not something that makes an obvious compelling case.
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:06.480]   Apple could do—if any company could make a compelling case for a wrist wearable computing,
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:07.480]   I think they could do that.
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.520]   Remember, they did do that with the iPad.
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:13.080]   But I think that a lot of people letting their imaginations get away from them, to thinking
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:18.440]   that a device that is reasonable to wear on your wrist and practical to actually operate
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:22.920]   would do all of these sort of things and that it would do them in such a way that you would
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:28.080]   three weeks later still be choosing to wear this expensive watch that whose battery dies
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:33.200]   once a week instead of the really nice watch that you bought for exactly $30, whose battery
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.200]   lasts for three years.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:39.240]   I have to say, though, that—I mean, it's an easy target for journalists to just look
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.840]   out the end because obviously they're looking for the next big thing from Apple and, you
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:46.440]   know, as I said, they did the Apple TV to death and now, "Ooh, a watch, you know, we haven't
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.440]   covered that."
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.800]   I'm just going to have to use the Pebble for probably, you know, four or five days now.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:55.400]   I can actually say a use case for it because, you know, it is an elegant device.
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.800]   It's not as thick and chunky as Andy's, but it's, you know, it's an instant slum.
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:16:59.960]   It's a permanently on display.
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:01.880]   It has this nice paper display.
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:03.840]   I hold it that way round.
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:07.920]   Fairly chunky buttons on it, but it does, you know, communicate with the iPhone seamlessly.
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:12.600]   Once you've set it up over Bluetooth, if a message comes in, it displays on the screen,
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.200]   you know, it will actually notify you.
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.200]   There's a message.
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.440]   You can just look at your wrist rather than clean your phone.
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.880]   I mean, I never were a watch.
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:22.760]   I always use my iPhone as my timepiece, but I have started to wear this now because it
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:23.760]   is fairly convenient.
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:27.120]   You know, you actually do see that you don't get just a notification of messages in.
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:29.960]   You actually do see the message on the watch and you can scroll the message using the watch
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:30.960]   as well.
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.680]   You can control the music on your iPhone as well.
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:37.160]   So, you know, although it's certainly not an Apple device, it certainly, you know, has
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.280]   the beginnings of something that I could, I could imagine Apple, you know, going to town
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:45.880]   or not and turning it into quite a nice device that people would actually want to use with
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:49.200]   the iPad or with their iPhone, especially if we're going down the route of, you know,
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.800]   a smaller iPad that perhaps you do carry about with you, but you don't want to always sort
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.280]   of take it out to just check on the time.
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:59.160]   You know, you have your Bluetooth enabled eye watch.
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:02.680]   The kind of bridge between what Andy and Don was saying, there's really two classes of
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:03.880]   Apple products.
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:08.720]   And one is the iPhone and iPad where so far Steve Jobs has stood up on stage and told you
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:13.480]   why the keyboards and styluses of old sucked and how Apple was going to re revolutionize
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:17.840]   it or the 10 things that the iPad would do better than your computer or your smartphone.
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:22.080]   But then there's the smaller class of devices like the hobby devices like the Apple TV,
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:26.160]   where all Apple wants to do is to increase the value of their ecosystem.
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.480]   And those aren't expected to sell in the hundreds of millions.
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:32.200]   They maybe sell in the single or double digit millions and they don't have app platforms.
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:38.000]   They don't have all the same resources and, you know, the same scope as a full on iOS device,
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.800]   but they do bring added value to own in all of those devices and makes it more likely
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:44.960]   that if you choose a device, you'll choose an Apple one because, hey, look, look at the
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:46.920]   awesome other stuff I can do with it.
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:52.520]   And I think so far the technology that we've seen, whether it's Siri or iMessage or anything
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:57.560]   else makes an eye watch look more like an Apple TV style companion device than a full-on
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:00.200]   iOS device.
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:03.680]   And we should point out that as the Pebble watch is very limited in its capabilities
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:08.240]   because it's not made by Apple, presumably if Apple made a watch, it would have complete
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.640]   integration into the iPhone.
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:13.080]   I mean, it would, it would, it would, it would, it is, well, good news and bad news as I see
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:14.080]   it.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.720]   The good news is that notification center is such a powerful resource.
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:17.720]   It's not just pop-ups.
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:21.760]   It's not just, hey, look, they took this side of this scroll down idea from Android.
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.720]   Hey, look, they took growl style notifications.
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:26.960]   No, I mean, it's part of an infrastructure that goes all the way back to the very first
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:31.800]   iPhone where any app can communicate to any other device, no matter what amount of networking
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.760]   exists between the originator and the recipient of that device.
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:41.360]   So what's so encouraging about this idea is that if all Apple had to do was to wire
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:47.000]   up this watch to notification center so that an app, without knowing that the target, the
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.360]   ultimate target was a watch, it could actually send notifications to that watch.
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.960]   That would be a very compelling product.
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:55.680]   On the other hand, Apple's exactly the sort of company that could screw up any product
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:59.640]   that requires, that requires like outside work and outside help.
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:04.640]   One of the things that was so encouraging about Pebble was the idea that we're going
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:05.800]   to come up with an API kit.
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:09.520]   We're going to pursue as many people as possible, want to develop as many great apps out there.
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:13.680]   We have our own ideas for how people will want to use that watch, but we know that our imagination
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:14.680]   is limited.
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.480]   We know that the imagination of the entire community is unlimited and we want to tap
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.640]   into that power.
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:23.920]   You could sort of imagine Apple saying, and we've decided to create and drumroll everyone's
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:29.000]   thinking, and everyone, the honest thinking, "Oh, APIs, APIs, strategic partnership with
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.280]   unlimited numbers of highly selected content providers."
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:33.280]   Swatch.
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.280]   Mikey.
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:35.280]   Mikey.
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:36.280]   Yeah.
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:40.680]   So if it's a $150 thing that doesn't do very much, that requires you to learn a brand
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:42.840]   new behavior, that's a problem.
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:45.440]   I think people are out of the habit of wearing watches.
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:50.000]   I think this is a non-starter, but I also thought the Apple TV was a non-starter.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:56.400]   It really feels to me like Apple's throwing up trial balloons and saying, "What if we made
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.360]   that?"
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:02.040]   This does not inspire, to be honest with you.
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.160]   It's not an iPod Wi-Fi caliber.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:06.680]   It's an iPod-high-fi caliber device.
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:07.680]   Right.
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:08.680]   Not even.
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.360]   It's not even iPod socks.
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:11.360]   Exactly.
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:13.360]   It's...
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.760]   Nobody wears watches.
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:16.840]   There's no watches in the front row of...
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:19.520]   Yesterday I asked the Twitter audience or Sunday I asked the Twitter audience.
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:20.960]   One person was wearing a watch.
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.200]   People don't wear watches anymore.
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:23.200]   Me either.
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.480]   So I think once you get out of the habit of wearing a watch, it's pretty hard to get
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.040]   you to wear a watch again.
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:31.840]   The other part is that my meat master is wearing a watch.
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:32.840]   One person.
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:33.840]   Representing.
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:37.120]   Your battery died and he wishes he had his watch.
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:38.120]   All right.
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:39.120]   All right.
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.120]   So I take it back.
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:41.200]   And I ask where's a watch.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.200]   Why do you wear a watch?
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.200]   I ask, what are you?
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.200]   Crazy?
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.200]   It's a gift.
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:48.680]   And yeah, because I think this is jewelry more now than anything else.
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:53.440]   Well, and John Slanina says, "I don't have to take it out of my pocket to see what time
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.440]   it is."
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:57.760]   And I agree that is a little bit of an annoyance when it comes to using your phone.
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.480]   But you do have a timekeeper all the time.
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:02.240]   And I just suspect people don't want watches anymore.
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.240]   But maybe I'm wrong.
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:06.560]   You're forgetting the crucial point, though, Leo, that Apple will tell you that you really
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:07.560]   do need a watch.
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:08.560]   Yeah.
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.400]   Well, how many times can Apple go to that well?
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:14.800]   No, because they always say they don't focus groups.
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.080]   They don't research what people think they want.
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:18.480]   They define a need.
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:19.840]   They develop the engineering.
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.080]   They develop the product.
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:25.440]   We know that's a lie, by the way, after the Apple Samsung trial and the depositions
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.080]   that in fact Apple does do focus groups.
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.400]   They do do research.
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:32.520]   And I think this trial balloon, and it's clearly coming from Apple or it wouldn't be the New
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:36.640]   York Times and the Wall Street Journal, this trial balloon is market research.
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:37.640]   They're watching.
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:38.640]   Now, what do they think?
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:39.640]   Should we make this?
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:40.640]   I don't know.
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:41.640]   I think it's a dumb idea.
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:45.120]   Or they're just flashing around so people think that they're busy and stop bothering
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.600]   them while they work on their other stuff.
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:47.600]   Oh, it could be.
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:52.160]   I like your notion that this is a way of reassuring a stock market that they're still
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.160]   innovating.
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:54.160]   I mean, it could very well be that.
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:59.800]   I mean, I imagine that there is some publicity in full gear, some publicity department in
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:04.160]   full gear trying to bring the stock price back up a little bit maybe.
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:08.360]   That's like telling your kid, your birthday is coming up in three weeks and wait until
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:13.800]   you see the great surprise we're going to get the kid to settle down.
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.200]   She'll go to bed early.
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.200]   If you're good.
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.120]   Yeah, if you're good.
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:21.560]   And then when she doesn't get the watch in three weeks, she gets twice as angry as she
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:22.560]   would have been.
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:23.560]   It doesn't work.
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:24.560]   It's a bad.
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:28.440]   No, I'll put an extra color nano.
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.880]   You're welcome.
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:32.320]   All right.
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:37.200]   Well, I suppose we could spend some time thinking about what this, what would make this watch
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.280]   a good idea.
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:40.800]   I did not say the iPad was a dumb idea, Hawaii Dave.
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:45.840]   In fact, I loved the iPad and said this is the computer Apple was born to make.
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:49.760]   I don't think this is an iPad quality idea.
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:51.840]   And I put the TV too for a long time.
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:53.240]   So I mean, we'll see.
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:55.960]   I just, I don't think, I don't think this is an actual product.
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:24:00.000]   I do think there's a lot of interest in wearable computing from, from a lot of companies, including
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.920]   Google and Apple.
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.440]   And they're trying to figure it out.
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:11.000]   But I don't think that this is a, to me, this is not a solution for a problem that exists.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.880]   They're trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist.
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:19.800]   Nobody's demanding, you know, we need a better way to wear our phones.
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.800]   Is that a market?
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:24.200]   We need a better way to wear our computers.
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:26.280]   If you could plug it into my brain, that might be something.
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:28.280]   I don't want to wear Google Glass either.
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:31.160]   Yeah, we were testing wearable computing.
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.160]   There's a thread there.
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.160]   We're pulling at it.
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:34.160]   We have the watch.
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:38.160]   It's a hobby, but it's an area of intense interest and maybe we'll go to the glasses
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.160]   one day.
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:41.640]   I think it make the Apple TV better.
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:42.640]   Yeah.
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:43.640]   Instead of all this.
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:48.440]   Right, right before the show, I filed a column about, about these rumors to the sun
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.800]   times, it should be hopefully by the end of the show.
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:55.960]   And I ended by saying that I don't believe we'll see an Apple watch anytime soon.
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:59.280]   Of course, it could be very wrong, but I don't believe we'll see one anytime soon.
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:03.000]   But I ended by saying that what I would really love to see them do is something very, very
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   simple.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.280]   If they just simply, I would love to see Apple design go nuts on a simpler device that doesn't
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:10.640]   have about a thousand different variables with it.
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:15.600]   If all they had to do was guys, we want you guys to design and we want that you, this
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:19.840]   is probably simply design a beautiful digital watch that everybody would want to put on
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:22.800]   their wrist in terms of cool advanced features.
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:26.440]   Put some sort of a dingus on there so that if there's a reason for me to look at my phone,
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:30.280]   it will simply when I'm checking the timer when I feel a buzz, I know that, oh, I see
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:34.040]   that the cow is actually landed on the moon and is having tea.
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:37.000]   That means that that's the watch is way of telling me check your phone.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.040]   There's something you wanted me to look to tell you about.
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:44.920]   But could you imagine a beautiful Apple design device that doesn't cost $200, $500, $1,000,
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:52.280]   $2,000, $2,000, a beautiful Apple design digital device that costs $100, $79, maybe even $50.
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:54.480]   That would be fantastic.
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:26:00.280]   A lot of people were very happy with a nano as a watch, just making an iPod.
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:02.320]   It's also hard to imagine what comes next.
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:06.920]   Before the iPhone, we had those renders of the iPod with a click wheel dialer and it
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.480]   turned out to be something very different than that.
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:12.520]   The idea of just a shrunken down screen with four icons on it is what we're imagining
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:18.720]   now, but it's hard to tell what Apple would actually make as a go-to-market product.
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:24.080]   Somebody in the chat room said, "What about something just simple?
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.480]   This is from YYZ99.
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:30.800]   A simple watch well-designed shows notifications, like a better pebble."
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:32.720]   It's a small screen iPod.
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:35.640]   It's a revolutionary internet device and it's a fun--
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:36.640]   And your email.
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:37.640]   Small screen iPod.
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:39.880]   So you get it yet.
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:41.560]   It tells you the time.
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:45.800]   It holds a piece of scotch tape and you're wrapping a package and it rips the hairs out
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:46.960]   of your wrist.
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.160]   Are you getting it?
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.760]   It tells the time.
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:52.600]   It holds a strip of scotch tape and you're wrapping a package.
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:55.200]   It rips the hairs out of your wrist.
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.920]   This is one device.
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:59.000]   What if Siri were built into it?
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.600]   What if you said if you could talk to them?
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:04.200]   I don't know why that's an improvement than talking to your phone, but--
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:07.480]   Well, Siri is really well geared toward-- There's a philosophically, I mean.
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:09.520]   It is because you don't type and you can't type in a watch.
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:10.920]   I'm not even talking about not typing.
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:15.120]   I'm talking about it's focused on the user is going to ask me a question.
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:16.720]   It might be a complex question.
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:20.840]   What I'm going to give them in response is the shortest, most effective thing I can say
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:21.840]   back to it.
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:23.920]   That's better wear a jacket.
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:33.200]   It's 28 degrees outside today or the bad red socks be the Marlins 8 to 7.
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:37.320]   Snippets of information that are really very useful for a tiny, tiny little screen, whether
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:38.320]   it's speaking or not.
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:41.720]   Isn't Google Glass better to do all of the things that we're talking about than a wrist
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:42.720]   watch?
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:43.720]   It's very different.
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.520]   Do you want to have it on your face all the time?
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:49.560]   Well, the advantage of faces is that it's near my ears and it could talk to me.
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:51.200]   Because I kind of wanted to talk to me.
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.040]   Again, would you want it on your face all the time?
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:59.560]   Would you want your main point of user interface to every other thinking person in the world
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:03.120]   is they get to see you wearing these special glasses.
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:04.120]   Yeah.
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:07.600]   I mean, we all wear glasses all the time.
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:12.640]   I know that's not a big deal, but that's such a big hurdle for so many people to get over.
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.400]   We're checking your watch.
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.840]   As a matter of fact, a friend of mine had the Pebble watch.
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:20.360]   The first time I actually had held one in my hand, we could go at dinner.
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:22.720]   And we're having a conversation about it.
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:26.040]   It's a nerdy table of about six to eight people who work in tech.
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:31.480]   So there's not a social faux pas involved in having a phone on the table next to the
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:32.480]   plate.
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:33.480]   That's what everybody does.
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:34.880]   You go to the restaurant.
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.000]   Everybody has their phone on the table.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   Right.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.200]   And we talk about the social, the wall, if you have it on the watch, you can actually
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.200]   check things less obtrusively.
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:46.320]   Well, wasn't there a time when wrist watches first came on the scene where, you know, this
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:49.200]   the root thing where I'm having conversation, but I need to make a train.
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:50.640]   I'm going to look like this.
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:51.640]   Yeah, that's rude.
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:53.200]   Can I do that without people thinking?
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.200]   Yeah.
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:57.360]   Again, what is the big, it's a big step between I'm going to look at my wrist like this versus
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:00.680]   I'm going to simply take out my phone and take a look at it.
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:01.680]   It's weird.
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:02.680]   It's a little bit of a factor.
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:04.880]   I think it's a real nice one.
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:05.880]   Go ahead.
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:10.000]   Well, the thing I was going to say is about the phone and its size and sort of being permanently
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.800]   on your wrist and using it for something like Siri.
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:15.160]   I mean, at the moment with the iPhone, you know, if you use Siri on the iPhone or the
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:18.640]   iPad, it actually calls back to the Apple Central servers.
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.600]   And there's a lot of processing power involved for it to return the results.
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:24.840]   I can see in the next couple of generations, you know, they'll probably move that down to
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:28.200]   the iPhone or the iPad so that the processing is done on that device.
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:32.880]   And then really, you could envisage the watch just being a conduit to your iOS device.
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:37.840]   So, you know, it literally be just a method to capture the audio and transmit it to your
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:40.280]   iPhone and your iPad and back again, the results.
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:45.080]   So although, you know, Siri really just take a lot of computational processing power, the
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:49.080]   size of the device really I don't think it will matter because it will really, you know,
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:53.520]   be in constant communication with your iPhone or your iPad and a lot of heavy lifting will
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:57.200]   be done on your device that's in your pocket rather than your wrist.
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:00.200]   There's one other thing that I think if we look at the history of Apple, they have been
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:05.400]   relentless in mainstreaming and democratizing computer technology from the Apple II to the
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:06.880]   Mac to the iPad.
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:12.000]   Their one goal is to make computers more accessible and more usable to non-power users, to mainstream
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   users.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.320]   And there are people for whom even a smartphone or a tablet are still too much computer.
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:21.400]   So if an iWatch is bound to those things, then it's a peripheral like an Apple TV.
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:25.120]   It's something that takes your existing gadget and lets it do a few more things.
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:29.800]   But if Apple believes that there's a market for a highly stripped down, very specific
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:34.960]   device that will just let even more people have access to computing, then I think that
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:37.480]   is another interesting possibility for them.
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:39.880]   Yeah, but does that really do that?
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:44.480]   I mean, if they were really committed to that, they would find a way to make a really beautiful
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:45.480]   $500 MacBook.
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:46.640]   They don't care about that.
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:51.320]   They make $1,000 MacBook that's beautiful and elegant and probably better designed than
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:56.040]   most people need it to be, they could take a smaller margin if they really wanted to
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:58.200]   make devices more affordable to people.
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.200]   That's important.
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:00.800]   I'm talking about interface.
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:05.560]   Well, accessible to people with money.
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:08.120]   Most people have a harder problem with that.
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:12.760]   But the other thing that made me think about that though, is the solution.
[00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:16.960]   Again, I play out the keynote in my head.
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:20.720]   And I could imagine Google coming out with a watch exactly like the one that's being
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:26.480]   rumored and then saying, some people seem to think that the solution to the problem
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:31.360]   of complex notifications and our devices interrupting us all the time is to make the
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:34.040]   interruptions easier to see.
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:39.360]   Our solution is let's make sure our devices never call for our attention until we need
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.360]   it.
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:44.640]   We have an intelligent assistant that can handle your win box handle your flow, handle
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:47.480]   your notifications, I'll tell you get to wear whatever you want.
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:52.080]   If you ever use Google now, you start to see that there is a strategy with Google now.
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:54.520]   It's coming at the same problem from a different angle that's kind of interesting.
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:57.960]   They have a huge advantage because Google owns that voice technology where Apple is
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.280]   using it from nuance.
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:02.560]   Apple doesn't have the rights and the abilities to do with it, what Google can do with Google
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:03.560]   now.
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:05.560]   Google has been collecting signals for a long time.
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:11.680]   We're going to take a break, enough with the watch.
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.720]   Let's talk about the Mac Pro.
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:15.360]   Somebody in the chat room said, and I agree with him.
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:19.880]   I hope this isn't taking energy away from Apple's working on a new Mac Pro.
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:21.600]   I guarantee you it is.
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:23.240]   It almost promised you.
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:26.520]   That's exactly what it's doing.
[00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:31.160]   I think they're working 400 times as hard as a Mac Pro.
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:34.200]   Whatever numerical number you can put into the amount of effort they're putting in the
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.760]   Mac Pro, double it.
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:36.760]   Double it.
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:37.760]   How is that?
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:38.760]   A thousand times.
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:45.160]   Hey, if you are putting any energy into a blog, into a company, into an invention, you
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:50.120]   probably know that there are -- it's a very good idea to protect it legally.
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:51.960]   You might be saying, "I can't afford a law firm.
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:53.360]   I've got an idea for you."
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:54.360]   LegalZoom.com.
[00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:56.000]   It's not a law firm.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:03.520]   It gives you self-help services to get those legal documents and legal things done.
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:05.360]   This is how I did the LLC for Twitch.
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:06.360]   You know what?
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:07.360]   It's such a good LLC.
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:08.640]   Here we are eight years later.
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:09.960]   Still using it.
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.240]   Worked great.
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:13.640]   For incorporation, for LLC, for trademark.
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:14.640]   Yes.
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:19.360]   The thing about the OMG chat is he's trademarking OMG chat, right?
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:20.440]   Yeah, my username.
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:21.440]   You should.
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:22.440]   Yeah.
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:23.440]   Trademark.
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:26.200]   You're an IRC handle.
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:30.280]   Beatmasters put a lot of energy into cultivating the Beatmaster handle.
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:32.000]   You don't want anybody else to use that.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:40.120]   It's less than you think $99 to form an LLC, $69 for a will or a legal trust.
[00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:44.920]   In the past 12 years, over 2 million Americans have used LegalZoom for LLCs and wills and
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:46.520]   trusts and trademarks.
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:50.360]   It's a simple step-by-step questionnaire online.
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:51.360]   You walk through.
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:52.680]   They've got great customer support.
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:57.000]   And if you feel like at some point, God, I'd love to ask a lawyer.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   One question.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   Good news.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.680]   They have now an extensive network of attorneys.
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:05.200]   They call them LegalZoom's legal plans available in most states.
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:09.680]   You can search online profiles and unedited customer reviews to pick that attorney.
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:11.840]   And they've pre-negotiated low, low rates.
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:14.120]   So if you just, I just want to ask one question.
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:16.840]   You can get great legal advice as well.
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:19.240]   I think LegalZoom is fantastic.
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:25.240]   As I said, even for this company, this was the solution.
[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:26.720]   And I think you should think about this.
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:30.840]   Get help from attorney, but do as much as you can by yourself as well as well.
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:35.640]   Affordable personalized documents, wills, LLC, trademark.
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:39.480]   I want you to visit legalzoom.com.
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:40.480]   And let them know.
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:41.560]   You heard about it on MacBreak Weekly.
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:44.760]   When they ask you for an offer code, use MBW.
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:48.160]   And as our thanks to you, we'll give you 10 bucks back.
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:51.640]   You know, I know it's not a huge amount, but it's just a way of saying thank you for saying
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:54.720]   MBW that way they'll know where you heard about.
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:55.720]   LegalZoom.com.
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:35:00.040]   If you're starting a business, trust me.
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:02.280]   This is the thing to do.
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:04.240]   LegalZoom.com.
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:10.680]   You're watching MacBreak Weekly with Andy Anako from the Chicago Sun Times, screencasts
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:14.840]   online, Don McAllister, and from iMore.com.
[00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:15.840]   Renee Ritchie.
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:19.200]   What a great -- I love the panel on this show.
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:24.200]   You're not going to get a better group of experts on what's going on in Apple.
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:28.000]   Speaking of which, we talked about this on Twitter.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.240]   And while we are a generalist on Twitter, I'd like to get the Mac centric panel to respond
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:37.280]   to this notion that the Mac Pro is coming.
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:39.480]   There's two data points on this.
[00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:45.680]   One, as we mentioned last week, Apple's not going to be able to sell its Mac Pro in Europe
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:48.960]   starting March 1st because of some minor regulatory changes.
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:51.640]   It means that, for instance, the fan needs a cover.
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:54.760]   And instead of putting a cover on the fan, Apple says, "Yeah, we're not going to sell
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:55.760]   that Mac Pro anymore."
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:57.600]   Some say that means they've got a new one coming.
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:59.600]   Otherwise, why would they give that up?
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:02.400]   Others might say, "Well, maybe because it's such a small part of their business, they
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.400]   don't care."
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:12.040]   And then there is a reseller, France Cistem, who says that Apple will have a Mac Pro replacement
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:14.680]   ready to ship within months.
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:22.000]   Now we don't know if this comes from Tim Cook's statement last year that Mac Pro users -- he
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.800]   said, "Apple has something really great for you Mac Pro users."
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:29.240]   He didn't say it has a Mac Pro.
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:32.880]   So these rumors are floating again.
[00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:34.480]   Let's go to imore.com.
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:36.120]   That's the rumor central.
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:38.320]   Renee Ritchie, what do we think?
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:40.960]   Mac Pro on its way this spring?
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:44.720]   The thing about these rumors is when you start chasing them down a lot is that they have
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:46.160]   interesting origins.
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:51.480]   It's highly unlikely that anybody outside of Apple and their direct manufacturing partners
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:56.800]   have anything substantive about timelines or product releases.
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:01.800]   A lot of times what happens is whether they're a manufacturing accessory maker, a peripheral
[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:07.080]   maker, whether they have an Apple certified reseller or store, they'll go talk to a friend
[00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:08.920]   and they'll say, "Yeah, I've heard this thing."
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:12.840]   And sometimes they read it on a blog and they told it to somebody and then that person goes
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:14.840]   and tells someone else, then they tell a blog --
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:16.840]   That becomes gospel.
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:18.040]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:22.640]   So 90% of the time when you see these stories is just based on broken telephone.
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:26.200]   It's someone's wishful thinking or someone read something and over the course of two
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:32.440]   or three people it becomes Apple has told me that this thing is going to be released.
[00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:33.920]   They certainly do for a refresh.
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:38.920]   The Radeon 5770, the older Intel chip set.
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:44.320]   I mean, it seems as if you're a Mac user.
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:45.320]   No Thunderbolt.
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:49.200]   No Thunderbolt is a huge missing piece.
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:54.000]   I can't even use my Thunderbolt cinema display with the Mac Pro.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.240]   No USB 3.
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:56.240]   No USB 3.
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:58.280]   That would come with a new chip set.
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:01.880]   Are there a new Intel chip set they're waiting on?
[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:02.880]   Is there something --
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:03.880]   There's always a new Intel chip set.
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:06.880]   That's a problem.
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:07.880]   Yeah.
[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:15.920]   Currently the high-end Mac Pro is 12 cores with 12 gigs of RAM, 2 2.4 gigahertz 6 core
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:17.760]   Intel Xeon processors.
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:19.800]   I mean, it's a beast.
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:22.160]   It's expensive beast.
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:24.160]   Let me just order one and see.
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:25.160]   It says --
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:26.160]   Well, I'm just curious.
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.160]   It says in stock.
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:28.160]   If you want to learn Leo, then you won't get to announce tomorrow.
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:29.840]   Next business day shipping available.
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:31.680]   It is in stock.
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:37.200]   I can bump it up to a 3.06 gigahertz 12 cores for $6,000.
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:40.200]   How much RAM can I put in?
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:42.480]   64 gigs of RAM that only adds 2 grand.
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:44.960]   Now I'm up to $8,000.
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:45.960]   Let's put in --
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:49.960]   Leo, maybe you should have a spotter next to you.
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:52.560]   I might fall off.
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:57.600]   I want to put in an SSD for -- it doesn't have -- which is too bad that great fusion drive
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:00.680]   that I have in the new iMac would be nice to have in this.
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:02.560]   Not a choice.
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:04.600]   But I can't put -- let's see, there's four drive bays.
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:07.880]   So I could put eight terabytes and a SSD drive.
[00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:10.200]   You can get an optical drive still, Leo.
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:11.960]   Oh, look.
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:12.960]   Optical drive.
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:15.640]   Should I get two super drives just for the heck of it?
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:16.640]   It's like can.
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:20.760]   Why would you want two super drives?
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:24.640]   Oh, now I can get a 5870.
[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:25.640]   A little bit better.
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:28.840]   See, the thing with the Mac Pro, though, it used to be sold on two accounts.
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:32.680]   One was the fact that it was expandable and one was the raw performance.
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:36.160]   You know, performance, yeah, we could still do with these high performance machines.
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:40.960]   But expandability is probably a bit moot now because we've got the expansion via Thunderbolt.
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:45.040]   So I can't see them really creating a similar beast of the Mac Pro.
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:49.280]   I think it will be a very different machine if and whenever it does arrive because I think
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:53.400]   they're going to rely on the Thunderbolt bus in the USB 3 to offer the expandability for
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:58.720]   people and to just concentrate on the pure performance and extra memory and stuff.
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:03.440]   The Apple cheese grater they call it because of the holes on the side.
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:04.440]   I still got my Mac Pro.
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:06.240]   I look at it lovingly from time to time.
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:08.000]   It's not that fast anymore.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   No.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.160]   Your new iMac is probably run circles around it now.
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:14.360]   Yeah, the new iMac with the Fusion drive is notably fast.
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:17.360]   I'm going to review it on before you buy later today.
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:19.240]   But it's like a MacBook Air now.
[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:20.440]   It's all hemetically sealed.
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:21.520]   You know, you can't get to it.
[00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:22.520]   Right.
[00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:25.040]   It's it's I can add memory, I think.
[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:26.640]   Now, I'm becoming SUVs.
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:33.080]   Why is he is saying, and I think he's right, the fusion capability is built into the OS.
[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:38.080]   Can I not kind of just say designate a SSD drive and a solid and a spinning drive and
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.040]   say fusion those?
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:42.040]   I think there are some hacks you can do some terrible.
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.640]   Oh, you have to hack it if you can't.
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:44.640]   Yeah, yeah, there is a hack.
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:47.160]   It's not so fully supported unless it's installed at factory.
[00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:49.480]   It's not built into a disk utility or something.
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:53.920]   No, if I have a different version of disk utility on a machine with a fusion drive.
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:54.920]   Yeah.
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:59.560]   Yeah, I've got a Mac Mini, which has a fusion drive and I have to say it's a very impressed
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:04.440]   because I actually bought it because I've got my I move from the Mac Pro to my Retina
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:06.840]   MacBook Pro and use that as my main production machine.
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:07.840]   Interesting.
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:08.840]   Yeah.
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:09.840]   It's actually faster.
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:15.400]   I mean, if it was the 2008 Mac Pro, so it's a bit long on the tooth, but it is actually
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:19.040]   faster in all respects to the original Mac Pro that I had.
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:24.400]   But I needed it to go into the shop for some work on the screen and I had no sort of equivalent
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:25.400]   machine.
[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:31.640]   So I got a Mac Mini with a fusion drive and 16 gig of RAM and the i7 processor.
[00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:34.120]   And that's nearly as fast as the Retina MacBook Pro.
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:35.120]   It's just incredible.
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:37.120]   The performance we're getting out of these.
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:39.480]   It's my same exact reaction.
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:43.840]   I did, you know, Blackmagic has a disk speed test available on the App Store.
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:44.840]   That's what I use.
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:47.600]   I presume that it's competent.
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:49.840]   And in fact, here's the results.
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:56.840]   The results on the right are from the other world computing SSD that I put into my MacBook
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:57.840]   Pro Retina.
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:04.160]   So that's about as fast as you can get pure SSD, 308 megabytes, right 504 megabytes read.
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:06.280]   I'm very close to that.
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:08.480]   But the fusion drive, and I've got three terabytes.
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:14.400]   And it gets faster, by the way, as you run the test, the fusion drive says, ah, this
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:18.280]   is a file you want and moves it over to the solid state drive.
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:26.040]   286 megabytes per second write and 383 megabytes per second read, it's pretty darn good.
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:27.720]   Pretty darn good.
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:28.720]   I agree with you.
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:29.720]   I like the fusion drive.
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:32.840]   And you don't have that limited capacity that you have with it.
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:37.760]   Or I presume cost, I don't know, with the SSD.
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:38.960]   So I like the fusion drive.
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:39.960]   I think that's brilliant.
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:41.560]   And yes, there are ways to do that.
[00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:44.960]   YYZ is pointing to another world computing link.
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:49.960]   And I guess you use the command line to create your own fusion drive.
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:53.040]   Macworld has also a link to that.
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:57.720]   Is there anything left nowadays where a tower Mac is really a deal breaker?
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:01.520]   Where if you don't have a tower Mac available, you just can't do the sort of work you want
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:02.520]   to do.
[00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:06.560]   The usual explanation that I keep getting is that I just need lots and lots of peripheral
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:10.480]   baits for how I need to outfit this.
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:15.320]   Sometimes asked for, I really wish there were 128 core processor version of that I could
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:16.320]   outfit.
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:21.160]   But I have to sort of confront the fact that it's disappointed as I am that there's no
[00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:26.560]   really big huge impressive Stonehenge like tower Mac that so many of the devices that
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:30.480]   are out there already are really in the class of anything we would have been happy with
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:32.560]   about a year, year and a half ago.
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:35.640]   The only reason I don't do the sort of work that the people need a tower for.
[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:37.400]   So I don't know what I'm talking about.
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:42.240]   Yeah, and Twit, the only reason we need a tower is because we use a fiber network.
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:44.560]   We have to put a sand card in there.
[00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:46.320]   And that's not unusual in video production.
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:49.800]   There are a variety of say black magic cards that you might want to put in there, capture
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:50.920]   cards and so forth.
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:56.280]   You do need card slots for some of these specialized applications, audio production I believe also
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:59.920]   there are cases where you'd want to put some specialized cards in there.
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:04.480]   We are seeing some sort of dedicated enclosures now so that if you want to attach it, yeah,
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:07.720]   flunderbolt, you can get them for all sorts of cards now.
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:13.720]   We're a dedicated external enclosure that you just slot in and you don't need that internal
[00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:14.720]   card anymore.
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:17.320]   I suppose we could do that.
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:20.960]   Is that a box that gives you the card slots or is that the same functionality in the form
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:21.960]   of a thunderbolt box?
[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:24.440]   No, it's a box that gives you the card slots.
[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:26.720]   You see in a couple of those over and over and over.
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:30.960]   Thunderbolt, is that as fast as the I/O bus on a Mac Pro?
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:34.200]   I think it's fast-ish enough.
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:36.200]   Pretty close enough.
[00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:37.960]   Close to as fast.
[00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:40.600]   I think it's not as fast as the bus.
[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:41.600]   I don't know.
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:45.120]   Interesting thing, I got one of these new Drobo 5Ds I arrived today.
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:51.720]   I think I've put 12 terabytes of drives in there and it connects via thunderbolt and
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:55.600]   it's got a little SSD card in there as well and it's just unbelievably fast.
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:56.600]   I love USB.
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:57.600]   I love USB.
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:03.040]   Yes, I stay and it's 12 terabytes of data hanging straight off my laptop that's as fast
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:05.320]   as the nearly as fast as the local hard drive.
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:07.320]   It's just incredible.
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:10.000]   USB 3 is 5 gigabits per second.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.640]   Thunderbolt has dual channel 10 gigabits per second.
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:22.560]   That's 10 gigabits is as fast as the 6 gigabit SATA connection.
[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:29.600]   I think that is in theory as fast if you get that native two-way 10 gigabits.
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:32.920]   Interestingly at Mac world, I think it was Corning, Glass.
[00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:37.680]   They're just about to launch some optical cables for both thunderbolt and also for USB
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:38.680]   3.
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:39.880]   They don't improve the speed.
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:41.680]   It's still 10 gigabits both ways.
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:47.720]   But on the thunderbolt cables, you can run up to a hundred, I think it's 100 meters of
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:52.480]   connection at 10 gigabits speed and also interconnect various devices as well.
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:56.120]   You have just a little box on your desk and everything else in a server room, you know,
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:46:00.040]   100 meters away and you've still got the thunderbolt speeds to those external devices.
[00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:04.040]   In a theoretical world where Apple one day has a retina thunderbolt display, they'll
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:06.920]   need double thunderbolt to move that many pixels.
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:08.920]   So we'll get twice what we have now.
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:12.000]   So increasingly that looks to be the future.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.440]   Soon says Apple, you'll be able to connect a host of thunderbolt and able to find some
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:18.960]   things any day now.
[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:20.440]   It's a beautiful dream.
[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:26.440]   There are video capture solutions from AJA and Blackmagic and Matrox.
[00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:32.280]   There is a sand fiber link adapter from Promise, fiber channel adapter from Promise.
[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:35.480]   So presumably we could do that.
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:39.680]   Sonnet, you know, PCI Express chassis.
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:42.440]   I guess there's, I guess you could solve this.
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:45.800]   So that Apple would probably is, in fact, is pointing to this stuff and I think that
[00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:48.640]   they would probably say to anybody who says, "Well, I need the expansion capability of
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:49.640]   a Mac Pro."
[00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:54.400]   But look, all you need is an iMac with thunderbolt.
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:58.480]   I use my Mac Pro as a 2009 Mac Pro just to do Skype for this show now.
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:01.680]   Everything else I'm doing on my written a MacBook Pro because it's so fast and convenient.
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:02.680]   Right.
[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:04.320]   Yeah, I like my Mac right now.
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:07.880]   The only thing with the iMac that my professionals might be put off by is the actual, although
[00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:11.280]   it's a beautiful display, you know, they might want to use their own custom display or...
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:13.160]   Well, you could still do that.
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:14.720]   Yeah, true.
[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:16.360]   But then you're paying the extra.
[00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:19.120]   People always perceive you're paying the extra for the display and if you don't really want
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:20.800]   it, you know, it's a bit extra expensive.
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:22.920]   So I'm back in a small box.
[00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:24.360]   Mac Mini?
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:26.960]   Is the Mac Mini as fast as the iMac though?
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:29.120]   I don't know about the iMac.
[00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:33.360]   It certainly, as I said before, is as fast as my written a MacBook Pro.
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:34.360]   It's still a laptop.
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:36.000]   I think it's a laptop.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   It's a laptop part.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   The iMac has desktop parts.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:43.840]   And the iMac fastest processor, they don't put Zions in there.
[00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:46.480]   Those are all i5's, i7's, right?
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:50.680]   So that's the advantage of the Mac Pro's stills that you're getting server-grade parts,
[00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:55.600]   getting server chips and server-grade hard drives and giant fans.
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:48:01.120]   I just know, I think Pro's are still going to eschew the idea of using an iMac instead
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:04.040]   of a Mac Pro.
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:05.320]   I think, you know, Don had a good point.
[00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:10.880]   In the future, you could see a Mac Pro without as many, maybe, optical drives, thinner, not,
[00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:15.280]   you know, maybe an iMac makeover for a Mac Pro, whatever that version is, whatever that
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:16.280]   would be a good solution.
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:20.200]   Just say, look, you got to recondition people, say, no, you know, you keep thinking you have
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:22.440]   to put stuff in a case all at once.
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:24.320]   That's actually not a good idea.
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:30.720]   Why don't you have the CPU is one unit and the other things are units and then you can
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:31.720]   combine them.
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:34.360]   Maybe if they made them stackable, so you could like, maybe that's what they're going
[00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:35.360]   to do.
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:38.360]   That would be a good, don't you think that would be a good marketing plan?
[00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:39.360]   Makeover-grade units.
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:40.360]   Yeah.
[00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:41.360]   Yeah.
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:42.360]   And have it stackable.
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:46.560]   So you could say, okay, now you have the Thunderbolt stacking solution on top of that
[00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:48.720]   and you could actually build a Mac Pro.
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:51.160]   It's still a truck, but it's not an 18 wheeler anymore.
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:52.160]   Right.
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:57.800]   I think that would be a very interesting way of recut textualizing it.
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:01.480]   I don't know if an onboard bus, DaVinci Wonder says the onboard bus is the advantage
[00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:02.480]   in our chatroom.
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:03.880]   I don't know if you need an onboard bus.
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:08.560]   Do you, can you not, could you, could you not say the Thunderbolt is the bus, the I/O
[00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:10.560]   bus and is as fast?
[00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:16.360]   It would be interesting if you could actually hook up a number of processor units via Thunderbolt.
[00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:19.360]   I mean, I don't know, even if technically that's possible, but you know, to actually,
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:22.360]   you know, as many processes as you want to stack them up and connect them via Thunderbolt.
[00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:23.360]   Yeah.
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:24.360]   Yeah.
[00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:26.360]   Well, there's an external GPU market that they keep talking about.
[00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:27.360]   Mm-hmm.
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:29.560]   I bet you that's what happens.
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:33.680]   Because I don't think that the iMac is a solution for Pros, because for the reasons
[00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:34.680]   we've mentioned.
[00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:38.680]   Well, you also, if you want to stack them in a closet, they're not very space efficient.
[00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:39.680]   Right.
[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:46.920]   I like the idea of a kind of a modular, oh, somebody's already thought this up at fcp.co
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:50.760]   finalcutpro.co.
[00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:56.360]   What the new Mac Pro could look like, Peter Ziggich proposes a modular design exactly
[00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:58.640]   as I was just mentioning.
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:03.000]   Although it's kind of ends up looking exactly like the cheese grater.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:09.520]   But that's what I'm kind of thinking is, you know, and then it's even more flexible.
[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:10.520]   What do you need?
[00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:14.720]   Want to want to make it a faster processor swap out the processor module?
[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:18.000]   How about that?
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:22.320]   But it all, it all is contingent on the Thunderbolt bus being sufficient.
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:26.320]   I wish if next time Alex Lindsay's here, we'll ask him.
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:28.160]   He buys Mac mini, doesn't he?
[00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:29.840]   He buys a lot of Mac mini.
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:30.840]   He buys everything.
[00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:31.840]   Yeah, he buys everything.
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:33.520]   That's not a test of anything.
[00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:36.080]   Let's take a break.
[00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:39.600]   Come back with some Apple tidbits in just a little bit.
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:47.640]   And we'll also talk about the lawsuit, the silly, silly lawsuit and more.
[00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:51.360]   We're talking about Macintosh and iOS with all.
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:52.360]   It's been, it's been great.
[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:55.720]   It's been a Mac conversation.
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:58.000]   Let's talk right now about squarespace.com.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.080]   It's just watching a Twitter conversation.
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:01.080]   Who was, who was it?
[00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:05.360]   Somebody I know they were asking him, what's the best hosting solution?
[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:06.360]   Squarespace?
[00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:07.840]   Very simple.
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:10.400]   Squarespace is hosting plus the best software on top of it.
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:13.040]   There's a real advantage to coupling the two.
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:15.960]   First of all, the software, the content management system has always kept up to date.
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:20.840]   But also, and this is something less obvious, but the server is more efficient too because
[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:22.600]   it knows what software is running on it.
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:26.360]   It's one of the reasons you cannot bog down a squarespace site.
[00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:27.560]   It's very clever.
[00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:32.480]   The serving technology that they're using on squarespace basically throws more power
[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:38.480]   at your site whenever it's necessary, which is one of the reasons that I think this unlimited
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:42.400]   squarespace plan is such a good deal.
[00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:47.480]   $16 a month when you buy an annual plan, you get unlimited pages, unlimited galleries, unlimited
[00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:53.440]   blogs, but you also get unlimited bandwidth and unlimited storage and unlimited contributors.
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:59.200]   So that means you can make a massive site and not worry about getting slashed out of
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:00.760]   or twitted.
[00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:05.000]   You bring down sites routinely, but not squarespace sites never have been able to bring a squarespace
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   site down.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.360]   Go to our blog inside the Twit, inside.twit.tv.
[00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:11.160]   Can't bring it down.
[00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:13.760]   A million people could visit it.
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:15.360]   Very, very cool.
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:19.040]   And squarespace sites always look great because of course they have the best content management
[00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:20.040]   system.
[00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:21.040]   Go to squarespace.com.
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:22.040]   Click the Get Started button.
[00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:24.480]   You could try it free for two weeks.
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:26.800]   You select a design, they say more than just a template.
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:27.800]   I think this is apt.
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:31.760]   You select a design to start with, but then you completely customize it through point
[00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:32.760]   and click.
[00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:36.680]   Although if you're a developer, you have full access to the JavaScript, the CSS, it's an
[00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:38.160]   HTML5 compliant.
[00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:40.440]   It's mobile responsive too, which is great.
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:44.480]   If you're a photographer or a designer and you want a portfolio and you want that portfolio
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:50.440]   to look the same and work the same no matter what size screen, this is such a good solution.
[00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:51.440]   It resizes itself.
[00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:57.400]   In fact, when you upload images to your squarespace site, you're going to, it's actually going
[00:52:57.400 --> 00:53:02.240]   to resize the images in I think seven different formats.
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:03.440]   Here's a Q-Birt.
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:04.440]   I like this one.
[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:08.240]   It kind of looks a little pinteresty, but that's just the beginning, right?
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:16.000]   Now you completely control this and the beauty of it is it's true CSS.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.920]   So your content is completely independent of the design.
[00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:20.680]   You decide you want to try a different design?
[00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:21.680]   No problem.
[00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:22.680]   Boom.
[00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:25.200]   You don't have to re-enter any content.
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:31.120]   You can import and export from all the existing templates, blogger, WordPress, all the existing
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:36.760]   APIs, which means you're never trapped because you can always exit a squarespace site as
[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:37.960]   easily as you got into it.
[00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:43.160]   In fact, it's worth doing the two week trial because what will happen is you can import
[00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:49.160]   your existing site, all the links are preserved, all the SEO is preserved, and you can really
[00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:52.320]   see what it's going to look like very quickly within the first day.
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:53.320]   Try it for two weeks.
[00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:57.160]   And if you decide you want to keep it, you can finish the import, all the SEOs, preserve
[00:53:57.160 --> 00:53:58.280]   all the links.
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:02.680]   And if you do register for the one year plan, they'll even do the domain name and the hook
[00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:03.680]   up and all that for you.
[00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:05.080]   It is a really great deal.
[00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:10.840]   I do invite you to use the offer code MACBRAKE2 if you decide to buy because you'll save 10%
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:11.840]   on your first purchase.
[00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:15.280]   Again, another reason to do the full year.
[00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:16.760]   squarespace.com.
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:19.120]   Try it out if you decide to buy.
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:24.560]   Use the MACBRAKE2 for the month of FebUweary.
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:26.800]   Each of our offer codes has changed every month.
[00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:31.360]   So MACBRAKE2 for this month, and you'll save 10% off your first purchase.
[00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:32.360]   Really great stuff.
[00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:36.200]   Really talented designers and technologists squarespace.com.
[00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:39.920]   Give it a try.
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:44.920]   Today, 25 billion.
[00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:49.640]   That's the number of songs sold on the iTunes Store.
[00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:52.720]   25 billion.
[00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:54.160]   They released it.
[00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:57.680]   That's with a B.
[00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:03.600]   Eddie Q says that Apple averages 15,000 songs a minute downloaded.
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:09.280]   The iTunes Store now has, this is kind of an amazing number, 26 million songs.
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:10.760]   That's the biggest number I've ever heard.
[00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:14.120]   I don't even know they're worth that many songs.
[00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:16.800]   In 119 countries.
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:24.800]   And Philip Lupke from Germany downloaded the 25 billionth song and received a 10,000 euro
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:25.800]   gift card.
[00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:29.920]   That's a lot of euros.
[00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:38.640]   The 25 billionth song was Chase Buke's Gotsell Vadinson remix of Monkey Drums.
[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:41.200]   That's where you get 26 million songs right there.
[00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:43.120]   At least it wasn't something embarrassing.
[00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:45.720]   I want to hear it now.
[00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:47.720]   Let me go.
[00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:50.480]   Eddie Q says we're grateful to our users.
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:51.480]   Here it is.
[00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:52.480]   Oh, no.
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:53.480]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:59.480]   By the way, Merlin Man's yellow submarine iPod still missing.
[00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:00.480]   Okay.
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:02.200]   Wow.
[00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:05.760]   Monkey Drums.
[00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:10.840]   This is it the the Goxsell Vadinson remix of Chase Buke's Monkey Drums.
[00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:15.080]   Listen, ladies and gentlemen, the 25 billionth song.
[00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:16.080]   Should we stand?
[00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:17.640]   Yeah, let's stand.
[00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:19.040]   Put your hand over your heart.
[00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:20.040]   Are you hearing anything?
[00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:23.320]   No, it's a very quiet song.
[00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:25.160]   Very quiet.
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:26.880]   I don't know if it's playing.
[00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:29.840]   There's a lot of people downloading it.
[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:32.080]   Maybe hoping I don't know some of the magical runoff.
[00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:33.080]   It was a rebel.
[00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:35.040]   It's the most beautiful song ever recorded.
[00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:38.040]   It's only a fool can't hear it or everyone.
[00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:39.040]   What do you think about it?
[00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:42.000]   Oh, I love it.
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   The orchestration.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:46.640]   You don't believe that the strings are a might bit heavy?
[00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:50.480]   No, when it comes crashing in with the kettle drum.
[00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:55.320]   I feel it's a full sonic palette.
[00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:56.320]   Is it me?
[00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:57.320]   I know.
[00:56:57.320 --> 00:56:58.320]   I'm glad.
[00:56:58.320 --> 00:56:59.320]   I don't know.
[00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:00.320]   Here.
[00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:01.320]   Yeah, I'll just play it.
[00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:02.320]   You play it.
[00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:03.320]   Monkey Drums.
[00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:04.320]   Monkey Drums.
[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:05.320]   Monkey Drums.
[00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:06.320]   Monkey Drums.
[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:11.600]   I can never defeat the boss on the end of this level.
[00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:13.200]   It sounds like that.
[00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:14.200]   Let me go cool.
[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:16.720]   It sounds like Nintendo.
[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:24.880]   We have a whole minute and 30 second preview of this song.
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:27.360]   You know you could loop it and get the whole thing.
[00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:29.880]   Wow, that's worth 10,000 euros.
[00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:30.880]   That's disgusting.
[00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:36.280]   I'm not embarrassing at all.
[00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:42.320]   It's like one of those Saturday Night Live segments.
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:48.680]   I'll just leave this plane in the background.
[00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:51.200]   Here comes the drop.
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:53.760]   No, it's wrong.
[00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:56.920]   We have monks singing in the background now.
[00:57:56.920 --> 00:58:04.040]   I don't know if that's the Goxel-Vanson edition.
[00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:07.200]   Let's just listen to the original Monkey Drums.
[00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:09.960]   Maybe the original Monkey Drums sounds different.
[00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:10.960]   Why don't you?
[00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:11.960]   It's right above that.
[00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:15.600]   Here's the original Monkey Drums.
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:19.200]   It's pretty similar.
[00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:24.160]   Now is the time on that Great Weekly.
[00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:25.160]   What we're done?
[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:27.200]   Yeah, we now believe the latest.
[00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:28.200]   Fantastic.
[00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:31.120]   Would you like to touch my Monkey Drums?
[00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:32.120]   It was so good.
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:33.120]   It required a remix.
[00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:36.480]   I'm getting Donkey Kong Country flashbacks.
[00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:39.360]   I see where he was going with this.
[00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:41.360]   Absolutely nowhere.
[00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:44.600]   It's a trap.
[00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:47.320]   All right, enough.
[00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:50.920]   25 billion song, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:54.240]   There are now you know why there are 26 million songs.
[00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:56.680]   That one tune has eight variations.
[00:58:56.680 --> 00:59:02.480]   Oh, also the upside is that with 25 million songs that reduces your risk of accidentally
[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:03.480]   encountering that one.
[00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:12.160]   Go listen to 25 million, 999,999 other songs.
[00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:16.200]   Tim Cook will be sitting with the first lady during the State of the Union tonight.
[00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:18.600]   Did you hear him this morning, Leo?
[00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:23.760]   He was on that Goldman Sachs call this morning for about an hour.
[00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:24.760]   Tell us about it.
[00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:25.760]   What did he say?
[00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:26.760]   It was very similar.
[00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:30.320]   He had the exact same talking points as an Apple conference call, but he had some interesting
[00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:31.320]   things too.
[00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:34.640]   He's always going to stick to talking points.
[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:37.320]   He's a high-profile CEO of a high-profile company.
[00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:39.880]   He's not mad living up there.
[00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:43.400]   But he did say Johnny Iave is now in charge of all of software and he's the best designer
[00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:47.200]   in the world and he's ecstatic to see what he's going to do with Apple software.
[00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:53.000]   He said Apple couldn't figure out how to make a good network so they made the iPad instead.
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:57.440]   He gave his usual talk about where he sees the tablet market is becoming the PC market
[00:59:57.440 --> 01:00:00.520]   where a tablet is going to increase in their share.
[01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:05.120]   With cheap products, they keep asking the same questions, cheap iPhone, big iPhone.
[01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:08.200]   He just said, "When you look at what Apple has done historically, they've made old iPhones
[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:09.200]   cheaper.
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:10.200]   They made an iPad mini.
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:14.000]   They made an iPod shuffle that is not impossible to see them doing that.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.800]   They'll have a strategy in place for the iPhone going forward."
[01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:24.080]   It was the same stuff he always says, but it was good to hear it all in one place with
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:26.280]   better questions and average being asked.
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:29.880]   He did say that Apple stores are like Prozac for him.
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:33.600]   Whenever he's depressed, he just goes to an Apple store.
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:34.840]   Over prescribed small children.
[01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:35.840]   I agree.
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:37.840]   I agree too.
[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:48.400]   I hope this someone gets to Mrs. Obama and simply says that if you could just take anything
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:54.040]   you have around the house that's clear, plastic and weird and just wear it on your wrist,
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:58.600]   it would really freak everybody the hell out and I think it would be funny.
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:01.280]   Keep looking at it for no reason than just…
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:02.640]   She controlled the internet.
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:06.480]   She had to just keep typing it.
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:09.880]   And look at Tim and knowingly everyone's in a while.
[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:11.640]   Usually, don't they usually like…
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:14.280]   Well, Lorraine sat with…
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:17.600]   Lorraine Powell Jobs sat with Michelle Obama last year.
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:18.600]   Steve's widow.
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:22.640]   He got name checked in the address, I think.
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:25.400]   So usually if you're sitting there, they're going to say something.
[01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:30.560]   Tim Cook, poor guy, he was in Alabama at Auburn and he had nothing going for him and then
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:33.440]   thanks to the Jobs program now he's the CEO of Apple.
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:34.440]   Something like that.
[01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:35.440]   Only in America.
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:38.680]   Only in America.
[01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:41.360]   Also Bobak Firdowski will be there.
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:43.960]   You know what that is?
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:44.960]   Yawwoo.
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:47.480]   Mohawk guy from the…
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:50.520]   Oh, from the University of Atlanta.
[01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:51.520]   JPL.
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:57.800]   I feel so sorry for that man's mother.
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:06.280]   It was only because when I had a ponytail, my mom never let me stop giving to people.
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:07.880]   Oh, but you should really cut your hair.
[01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:10.040]   Oh, but he looks so good without it.
[01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:11.120]   And now he has to…
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:15.840]   He can say, "Mom, I got to meet the president and sit there in the union because of this
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:16.840]   Mohawk."
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:17.840]   Because of Mohawk.
[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:20.280]   Never ever say anything bad about this Mohawk.
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:23.040]   Thing is, that was he going to have to wear that until he's 18 now because he's the
[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.040]   Mohawk guy.
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:25.040]   He is the Mohawk guy.
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:26.040]   That's it.
[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:27.040]   Like Mr. T.
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:28.040]   Poor guy.
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:29.040]   It's still be his thing.
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:35.000]   Also, a startup from San Francisco Council, CEO and co-founder Ramji Srinivasan will be
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.240]   there.
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:40.400]   Council is for parents planning to start a family.
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:44.520]   You can identify more than 100 recessive genetic conditions that result in birth defects,
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:47.200]   chronic disease, intellectual disabilities and early mortality.
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:49.800]   Do they really want to highlight that?
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:50.800]   What is the…
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:52.560]   So now you've got this test.
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:55.640]   Now you know, what are you going to do?
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:56.640]   That…
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:57.640]   Right?
[01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:00.240]   I don't know if that's an odd thing to support.
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:01.160]   But I guess it's again.
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:03.560]   We started this company, he says…
[01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:09.560]   Ramji says, "We started this company out of a dorm room not long ago drinking Red Bull.
[01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:12.880]   To be invited is quite an honor.
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:14.520]   Maybe it's an ad for Red Bull."
[01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:15.520]   Red Bull to White House.
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:17.160]   Anyway, I just thought a little heads up.
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:18.160]   Look for Tim.
[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:21.200]   I just didn't want people to be shocked when they looked and they saw Tim Cooks sitting
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:22.200]   there.
[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:28.840]   It's an opportunity to see if he has adopted an official costume.
[01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:35.280]   If he decides, "I'm at the state of the union, I'm going to wear a jacket, I'm going
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:40.000]   to wear a tie, I'm going to dress up," versus if he wears the same sort of thing he usually
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.600]   wears to the keynotes, that will be a data point.
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:46.840]   Will you be shocked if the president holds up his wrist and says, "I'm wearing the
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:48.840]   new eye watch."
[01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:56.000]   I'll be pleased if he interrupts and say, "Tim, ever since I updated this new update,
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.400]   my battery life is like nothing."
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:01.200]   I got GPS turned off.
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:06.680]   As a BlackBerry user, I would like to thank Apple for fixing my 3G issues on the iPhone
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:07.680]   4S.
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:11.000]   I wasn't able to play tank work.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.600]   Come on, man, it's been two years.
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:14.360]   We've been doing a version of pages.
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:22.960]   Get ready, according to reports from OLED-A.org, Apple has hired OLED television expert James
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:27.680]   Lee from LG's R&D team.
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:31.640]   He's working on AMOLED TVs.
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:33.720]   Which Tim Cook trashed today on the conference.
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:34.720]   He did, yeah.
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:35.720]   Yeah.
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:39.040]   He said they were oversaturated in poor technology, and then he had this other thing where he
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:43.480]   said, "Apple usually acquires talent, but we don't put them in the same role.
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:48.640]   PA Semi was a power PC company, but we've pivoted them to work on our architecture for
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:49.640]   our phones."
[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:50.640]   Wait a minute.
[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:54.800]   So this guy's an expert on AMOLED TVs, but we're going to have him work on LCDs instead?
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:59.360]   Yeah, it doesn't sound like OLED is something that Apple's that interested in.
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:00.360]   Or disinformation.
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:01.360]   Perhaps.
[01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:02.360]   They are oversaturated.
[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:04.360]   I mean, there is a lot of problems.
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:09.680]   That's so weird that he picked OLED to take that out in the call just to say it.
[01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:10.840]   It's weird.
[01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:14.440]   He was talking about in general, he said that Apple's focused on the AHA moment.
[01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:18.360]   When you open up a product and you say AHA every day, when you use it over and over again,
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:19.560]   it always excites you.
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:22.720]   And that seldom the product of specs or pricing.
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:26.720]   And as part of that discussion, he said that some companies who don't nail a user experience
[01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:29.280]   try to compete using specs or pricing.
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:31.200]   And then he singled out OLED as one of those things.
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:36.960]   I got to tell you, having looked at the ultra HD OLED displays at CES this year, they're
[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:38.600]   spectacular.
[01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:39.600]   They're spectacular.
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:42.640]   I mean, that's that's an interesting variable.
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:46.920]   Just like how the Beats by Dre headphones have terrible, terrible oversaturated bass.
[01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:51.960]   But people like oversaturated bass, especially with the kind of music they listen to.
[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:52.960]   So here's this.
[01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:53.960]   You're right.
[01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:57.840]   And of course, if you go look at any television in a showroom, you'll see it's oversaturated.
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:05:59.200]   They said it's a dynamic mochs.
[01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:02.480]   It looks best in the showroom and people like that.
[01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:09.480]   But our home theater guy, Scott Wilkinson specifically asked the companies, can you set
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:11.360]   this to a more natural and they did?
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:12.720]   And it looked great.
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:18.240]   So I think judging it by what you saw at CES, the point being that the blacks are very,
[01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:24.640]   they're perfect black and that the response time is virtually zero.
[01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:25.840]   These are very impressive.
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:30.680]   The only question in my mind about OLED, and I think Tim Cook's completely wrong.
[01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:33.880]   The only question in my mind about OLED is how long they'll last.
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:37.440]   There's still some question about the the dye is wearing it.
[01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:40.800]   Or he's just saying that no one wants video on their iPod Leo.
[01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:42.360]   You know, it could be disinformation.
[01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:44.200]   I don't understand why he would single it out.
[01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:48.440]   Besides the fact that he's completely wrong, I don't know why he would single it out.
[01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:50.640]   I mean, what Apple's using.
[01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:51.920]   Yeah, guess not.
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:54.880]   So maybe they don't want anybody to think that's what they're using.
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:56.880]   And they didn't exist.
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:58.520]   I don't like to look at things in a vacuum.
[01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:02.200]   So I asked Phil Nickinson, who runs Android Central, our Android site and he has tons
[01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:04.800]   of OLED screens and he doesn't like them as much either.
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:08.520]   And he finds them oversaturated and not as good as their oversaturated.
[01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:09.520]   I agree.
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:11.040]   They're oversaturated on phones.
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:12.040]   These are small screens.
[01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:13.200]   These are not TV screens.
[01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:16.160]   I don't think that that's I think that's completely wrong.
[01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:17.360]   And I think you're going to be surprised.
[01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:19.280]   And I think everybody's going to want to led TVs.
[01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:21.320]   They will be the TV of choice in the next couple of years.
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:26.280]   So as the prices come down, this is wrong.
[01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:29.680]   You can't and you can't compare what you're getting on a Samsung phone to what you would
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:31.400]   see on a 55 inch television.
[01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:34.760]   Although Apple's probably talking about them from a phone perspective at the time.
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:35.760]   Maybe that's it.
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.920]   Maybe it was so he didn't say TVs.
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:38.920]   He just said OLEDs.
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:39.920]   He doesn't like OLEDs.
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:40.920]   Yeah, you saw technology.
[01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:44.080]   Yeah, he didn't say TV about the phone was there.
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:48.200]   Yeah, it was it was in a hunk about phone design and larger screens and that sort of stuff.
[01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:49.200]   Oh, all right.
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:50.200]   Okay.
[01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:51.200]   So maybe he's saying for their screens.
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:52.200]   Well, they're not going to do OLEDs.
[01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:53.840]   They're going to continue with IPS screens.
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:54.840]   Right.
[01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:58.320]   So yeah, obviously OLED would be terrible till they do it at OLED.
[01:07:58.320 --> 01:07:59.320]   Yeah.
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:00.320]   Yeah.
[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:04.080]   And plus, I think we tend to like put too much emphasis on what he says.
[01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:09.640]   I don't think he's it's for his positions for ease of room to a state and opinion and
[01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:13.440]   a perspective that fits very well for their own goals.
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:15.080]   Ever someone to think, Oh, read that.
[01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:18.640]   I think, Oh, well, he's slamming all phones that have this other display technology when
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:22.280]   actually he's just saying, no, we have the reasons why we make the iPhone the way we do.
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:25.000]   OLED is not the technology that will help us achieve our goals.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000]   We don't want to use them.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000]   Yeah.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.000]   Yeah.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.280]   I'm actually I use almost exclusively OLED phones.
[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:32.280]   I like them.
[01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:35.760]   But a phone, you're not trying to do naturalistic color on a phone as you are on TV.
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:36.760]   It's very difficult.
[01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:37.760]   Different.
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:39.080]   I think they look fantastic.
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:43.680]   And by the way, all the Samsung phones have settings that you can make them more net.
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:46.800]   You can mute the saturation.
[01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:48.120]   Huh.
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:51.120]   I just it's a strange thing to say.
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:55.560]   Strange thing to be on somebody else's analyst call for that matter.
[01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:59.200]   Apple says it's paid $8 billion out to developers.
[01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:02.240]   That's one billion more than last month.
[01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:04.560]   They announced those numbers January 7th.
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:06.380]   Now in February, it's a billion.
[01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:10.800]   So are they does that mean they're paying a billion dollars a month or it's ramping up,
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:11.800]   obviously, right?
[01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:12.800]   It was back in October.
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:16.320]   They had six and a half billion paid out to developers.
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:19.880]   Then January 7th, they announced eight billion paid developers.
[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:23.320]   And now I'm sorry.
[01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:27.280]   They announced seven billion developers and now eight billion dollars.
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:28.280]   That's amazing.
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:30.280]   How much of that was Leo Simpson's money?
[01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:36.920]   Those in app purchases that up on that Simpsons game, I could tell you, donuts are not cheap.
[01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:37.920]   Or candy.
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:40.040]   To a lot of people are getting bitten on candy.
[01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:43.240]   It's essentially when you break them down.
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:46.440]   I mean, it's it sounds really, really great and it is.
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:50.240]   But when you look at the distribution of that money, it's not as though it's being distributed
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:52.360]   equally top 10%.
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:56.880]   Oh, yeah, amongst many categories of apps, if you're if you're a game developer, you're
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:00.480]   going to get that money if you're making if you're one of a very small handful of game
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:02.840]   developers, you're definitely going to be making that money.
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:05.840]   If you're trying to get in there with a really good productivity app, something that really
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:11.520]   does support this statement that in the future, people are not going to have regular computers
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:13.800]   are going to have tablets.
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:17.600]   That doesn't really the kind of apps or people are paying for that really doesn't support
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:18.600]   that.
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:23.600]   It also sort of colors interpretation of the characteristic of people who use apps on other
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:31.400]   platforms where if it means that this platform is is more popular for apps, that's one thing.
[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:36.360]   If it means that the iPhone and the iOS devices are more popular as gaming devices, that kind
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:40.200]   of colors the attitude on what the with the revenue generation is.
[01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:45.960]   We all know that Android people who own Android devices tend to spend less money in in app
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:50.720]   purchases than the iOS people who just absolutely just shoveling money into their into their
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:53.280]   their feeds day after day after day.
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:57.440]   I would like I would love to see a real breakdown that lets us understand what kind of users
[01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:01.280]   are spending money, what kind of users getting the free content, what kind of users paying
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:05.760]   money to be productive with their device as opposed to what they're going to be spending
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:07.880]   to actually just be entertained by it.
[01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:12.560]   Because we we all believe that these little tablets are great devices for productivity.
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:17.960]   I use mine every time I'm writing outside the office, but it really only becomes a revolution
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:24.960]   if you're using it for things other than making making firing birds of pigs and slicing fruit
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:29.040]   or building a fabulously lovely Springfield.
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:33.240]   Well, I mean, there was a controversy, well, not controversy, but this week they announced
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:37.440]   that it looks like real racing three, which is one of the most successful franchises in
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:41.400]   iOS history, probably the most successful racing game is going to be free to play and
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:46.040]   then have in app purchases so that you can get your cars back on the track faster and
[01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:47.880]   power them longer.
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:51.680]   And that's the model that companies like Zinga, I mean, we've proven over and over again
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:55.600]   that people will not pay two dollars for a great game, but they will make a free game
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:58.000]   and spend $99 on some earth berries.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.960]   So their hut looks better than the hut of the internet.
[01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:00.960]   Isn't that amazing?
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:03.400]   It's a sort of setting actually.
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:07.680]   I mean, you've ever ever read about how casino electronic games are made.
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:12.680]   They really are made to manipulate brain chemistry to just keep you there, pushing you up,
[01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:16.200]   pushing a button, pushing the button, feeding more money in, feeding more money in, and
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:20.560]   not not just as even as an intellectual thing, we're thinking, oh, well, if I increase my
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:21.600]   bet, I'll make more money.
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:26.360]   No, it's about chemicals in your brain and how you can trigger happy chemicals and how
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:33.000]   you basically trick people, people into a real fugue state that makes them stop thinking
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.640]   really critically about what they're doing and just do what they have to do to keep this
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:37.640]   flow going.
[01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:38.640]   Is it the bells?
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:39.640]   Is that how they do it?
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:43.200]   Well, they also they analyze in-game data so they'll see when people start dropping off
[01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:46.840]   and they'll tweak the game to make that point easier to keep people going.
[01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:50.680]   I remember they have sessions at GDC, the game developers conference, where they go
[01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:54.720]   through and they explain how they use psychologists to analyze this data and they use behavioral
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:56.800]   metrics and sentiment analysis.
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:00.760]   And they really try to map behaviors so that they are always giving you something to keep
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:03.000]   you on that game and making that purchase.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.720]   And if you look at top-grossing apps used to be iWork, it used to be productivity to
[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:07.720]   make money.
[01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:10.680]   And now is all these free games where not only are you not gambling because you can't
[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:15.600]   win something back, but you're literally just shoveling money into them, ad nauseum is
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:16.600]   an item.
[01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:19.840]   I think we'll see more of not just games using in app purchases, but you know, just standard
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:20.840]   applications.
[01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:23.000]   I mean, we've seen some like papers for iOS.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.720]   That's a good example.
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:25.720]   Yeah.
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:26.720]   It's great.
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:27.720]   And you know, you can buy the additional tools.
[01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:31.880]   I saw another app yesterday, a finance app that was an accounts package and it's a free
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:32.880]   app.
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:33.880]   You download it.
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:36.680]   But then you can switch on on them to transactions for I think it was 20 quid or 20
[01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:37.680]   dollars or something.
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:41.320]   And then there's like four different sort of major pieces of functionality built into
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:42.320]   the app.
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:45.600]   They can switch on, you know, as you need them or if you don't need them, you don't
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:46.600]   have to buy them.
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:50.480]   But you know, I can see more and more people creating the applications that way because
[01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:52.040]   it's a way around the free trial.
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:56.240]   You know, you can't do a free trial through the app store or through the iTunes app store.
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:00.360]   So if you create a free app with an in-app purchase and you give people just in a functionality
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:04.120]   in the free part, so they can try it out and they can sort of get a feel for whether
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:08.600]   or not it's going to be a good fit for them and then hit them with the app purchase.
[01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:10.520]   It's a much better fit for all really.
[01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:13.640]   We've known about this for a while, the success of Frameium and it's interesting that the
[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:20.760]   Apple store probably inadvertently kind of pushed that through this lack of trials.
[01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:23.400]   But Frameium really works for things like Evernote.
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:26.440]   A lot of apps where they give away the app.
[01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:30.600]   Was it, who invented Frameium?
[01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:31.600]   Was it?
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:32.600]   Was it?
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:33.600]   Did it early?
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:34.600]   Zinga did it early?
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:37.520]   No, it goes back to like Doom.
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:41.320]   Well Shareware was basically from you downloaded it and then you...
[01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:43.320]   Commander Keen.
[01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:48.720]   The early games from id.
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:51.160]   Yeah it's very interesting.
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:58.440]   I just feel a little immoral to program a game to take advantage of somebody's in unconscious.
[01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:03.600]   I think it's a very consumer friendly approach for productivity apps where like Don said,
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:06.760]   you get to test it out without having to purchase it beforehand.
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:11.720]   Also to an extent it lets you just buy whatever level of features you actually need.
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:16.400]   If there were an art app, I would love to be able to buy just here is a...
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:21.120]   For free I get a red crayon and a screen that I can give to a kid and they can play in
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:22.880]   the backseat of the car.
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:25.920]   But as I decide that, "Oh, it would be really nice to be able to put a photo behind this
[01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:28.000]   and onion skin it and be able to trace over it."
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.640]   I'd be willing to pay 99 cents for that feature to add that.
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:37.120]   So instead of buying the $30 app suite, you wind up buying a $16 app that only does things
[01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:38.120]   you want to do.
[01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:44.800]   But I am starting to feel like Renee really hit on the head that the way that it's manipulating
[01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:49.680]   people and trying to get people to do things that they would not do if they had full control
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:52.240]   of their rational, higher processes.
[01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:58.960]   I think that we're sliding into a highly ethically troublesome area by selling apps that way.
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:15:59.960]   I agree.
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:03.600]   Dan Ariele of the author, particularly irrational, would probably say, "Well, all marketing has
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:04.600]   always done this."
[01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:05.880]   It doesn't feel right.
[01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:06.880]   Yeah, but no.
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:10.800]   I mean, there are tricks to every sales trade, there are tricks to marketing and all that
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:11.800]   sort of stuff.
[01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:13.280]   The idea is that it's...
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:18.920]   You would agree that there's one thing for a car salesman to not mention that, "Oh, by
[01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:23.080]   the way, I've put paint on the gas pedals so you don't actually see how worn down it
[01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:24.080]   is."
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:26.800]   Actually, I've put a couple drops of vanilla in the back seats.
[01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:28.280]   You sort of think that it's a newer...
[01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:30.000]   You have a sort of sense of everything.
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:35.040]   And that guy saying, "I'm going to take you on and get you a good and drunk."
[01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:37.320]   When I take over for the test drive, I'm going to get you a good and drunk.
[01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:39.000]   I guess we know where the line is.
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.000]   Yeah.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:45.200]   I mean, you always bake cookies when you're trying to show a house.
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:50.720]   Is that... I mean, sure, that's playing on people's unconscious, you know, monkey mind.
[01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:53.520]   And yet, I think nobody would say that's crossing the line.
[01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:58.320]   I think the real issue is when it's games for kids, when you haven't purchased this
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:16:59.320]   for kids, because that's...
[01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:03.080]   I guess, except that the point is that we are as kids.
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:07.960]   We are as children, even adults, when we're confronted with these technologies that take
[01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:09.600]   advantage of our unconscious mind.
[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:14.640]   We're as ignorant as a kid is, as unable to defend ourselves as children are.
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:17.320]   We're going to be talking to our egos and is praying to everything that makes us want
[01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:18.320]   to do things.
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:19.800]   And they've done a lot of research to do it.
[01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:22.560]   So it's not that they're accidentally fell upon this.
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:24.560]   They're deliberately targeting it.
[01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:25.560]   Right.
[01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:31.400]   It's like these ads you sometimes see on both... I see a web ad for...
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:37.360]   Excuse me, ads for inside iOS apps and Android apps, where they know that on iOS that we
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:42.320]   often see a back button at the top left-hand corner of the screen.
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:47.000]   And so we're going to put now that has a big arrow button right where you would be aiming
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:51.320]   for if you wanted to go back out of this level of the gamer, out of this level of the app,
[01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:53.600]   to sort of trick you into thinking, "I'm not going to look at this ad.
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:55.800]   I'm just going to simply click on that button that I always click.
[01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:59.800]   And what do you know now you're looking at an ad or now you've just activated a piece
[01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:02.360]   of script that you didn't want to activate before.
[01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:06.680]   On Android, you also see the same thing where there's a bank of wired in buttons at the
[01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:11.320]   bottom to, again, make you not really look at this, but you get sort of this muscle memory
[01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:13.080]   thing where I'm done with this now.
[01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:14.080]   I want to go back.
[01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:15.640]   I will hit this thing that's familiar to me.
[01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:16.640]   That's just...
[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:17.640]   That's just...
[01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:22.040]   And it's interesting because, by certain extent, good developers, like the productivity developers
[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:25.800]   at Andy mentions, they've learned that, for example, people will not make in-app purchases
[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:26.800]   to get rid of ads.
[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:29.400]   They don't consider them annoying enough that they'll actually pay to get rid of them.
[01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:30.880]   I think you're right.
[01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:34.000]   David Barnard from AppCubby has done a lot of research on this and he's written a lot
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.000]   of it up on his blog.
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:38.880]   He's done it very transparently, trying out different models, different kinds of freemium,
[01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:41.080]   what things people will pay for and what they won't.
[01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:43.240]   And it's really hard for a non...
[01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:47.040]   For developer who doesn't want to do these sort of shady tactics to make good income
[01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:51.360]   anymore on the App Store, it's become a very hit-driven business for them.
[01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:53.320]   So I think that Apple has tried.
[01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:54.320]   They've eliminated...
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:57.160]   You can no longer say if you download this other app, we'll give you points towards this
[01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:58.160]   app.
[01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:01.640]   And you can't make your app look like an App Store anymore and they tried to make an eye
[01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:02.640]   ad.
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:06.280]   But I think as the person who owns the platform, it behooves them to take more responsibility
[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:11.080]   and try to allow developers who make really high quality apps and aren't trying to prey
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:15.240]   on people to have just a better chance of earning revenue because I still have this
[01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:19.400]   thing in the back of my mind of Atari ET cartridges being buried in the desert.
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:23.640]   And I don't want all the value to be taken out of Apple's app ecosystem.
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:25.880]   Yeah, this is a good...
[01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:30.480]   I'm just reading David's blog post, "I Was Wrong."
[01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:31.480]   That's when you're talking about...
[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:34.720]   He has a series of them there and that was his experiment with an app called Timer where
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:38.440]   he made it free, but he made one of the icons an ad and people couldn't determine...
[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:41.680]   People didn't like an ad that looked like an icon because it felt like a cheat to them.
[01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:44.480]   So that was the one that he was apologizing for.
[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:46.400]   But he's trying a lot of different mods.
[01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:50.960]   I would love it if more people would try these experiments and report back, not keep
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:51.960]   it to themselves.
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:54.400]   It's fantastic.
[01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:56.160]   Great way to learn.
[01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:57.160]   And I think...
[01:19:57.160 --> 01:20:00.880]   I mean, yeah, he's apologizing, but I think it's also great.
[01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:03.680]   Give Freeman a chance as the post before that.
[01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:05.240]   I think this is really interesting.
[01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:08.280]   Because at the end of the day, he's got to be able to feed his kids or he's going to
[01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:10.840]   stop making me apps and I want him to make me apps.
[01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:14.400]   Everybody needs to make a living.
[01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:18.400]   You can't say to people, "Hey, you should really give everything away for free."
[01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:20.880]   It just doesn't work.
[01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:22.440]   It doesn't work.
[01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:23.440]   And it's always a catch.
[01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:25.760]   Nothing is really free.
[01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:26.760]   Nothing is free.
[01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:27.760]   Yeah.
[01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:28.760]   Some things are free.
[01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:29.760]   I don't think that's true.
[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:33.520]   I think some people are dumb enough to give stuff away.
[01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:35.840]   Well, I'll give you an exam.
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:37.680]   But many things they have other ways of making living.
[01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:39.000]   We give our shows away.
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.920]   I don't want to ever have to charge for shows or any of the content that we produce, but
[01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:43.120]   we put ads in them.
[01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:44.120]   That's how we support them.
[01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:45.920]   Somebody can see televisions?
[01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:51.040]   Yeah, it seems like we're about to have a doctor-house-style conversation about doing
[01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:52.520]   things for others.
[01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:59.120]   Because on the one hand, you're not giving them away for free partly because you're a
[01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:00.120]   very, very good person.
[01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:01.760]   You're doing something altruistically.
[01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:05.800]   But also because you know that the key to getting people to come back with their money
[01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:10.080]   is for them to have confidence in you and have confidence in anything they see with
[01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:12.080]   it with a Twit logo on it.
[01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:16.000]   And putting DRM on something, selling something at a very, very high price, putting obstacles
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:20.400]   between somebody and your content is going to prevent them from getting that sort of
[01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:22.560]   loyalty to you and the stuff that you do.
[01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:23.560]   Right.
[01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:24.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:27.480]   I mean, look, everybody makes that calculus.
[01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:29.480]   But I do believe there's true altruism in the world.
[01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:30.480]   I mean, you do stuff.
[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:31.480]   Oh, exactly.
[01:21:31.480 --> 01:21:35.600]   You like it's there's so many reasons for creators to do what they're doing.
[01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:40.600]   A lot of there are a lot of folks that they certainly would love to have a successful product,
[01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:46.040]   but they have that sort of one that that wonderful little sector of Apple's mentality,
[01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:50.840]   which is we just want this great people to have this great thing that we came up with.
[01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:55.280]   And again, if they make enough money to make their mortgage payment, absolutely wonderful.
[01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:58.320]   And they want to be able to sustain themselves and sustain the project.
[01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:01.480]   But that's the idea of making $100,000 a year off of this one app.
[01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:03.080]   They know it's not a very attainable goal.
[01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:07.160]   So in lieu of that, they much rather charge 99 cents and make give it as big an audience
[01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:08.160]   as possible.
[01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:11.040]   So there is a certain hint of altruism there.
[01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:12.040]   We're going to take a break.
[01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:13.040]   I'm going to make some money.
[01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:14.040]   How about that?
[01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:20.360]   Hey, Andy, not go is here from the Chicago Sun times Renee Richie from iMore.com.
[01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:24.320]   And of course, it's great to have Don McAllister all the way from Liverpool.
[01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:27.160]   He's the creator of Screencast online.
[01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:29.400]   You do the same freemium thing too, don't you, Don?
[01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:30.640]   I mean, you have free.
[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:32.120]   Yeah, I have free.
[01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:33.880]   Well, it's a membership system.
[01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:38.640]   But I do about once every five weeks, once every six weeks, I give away an episode completely
[01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:39.640]   free.
[01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:43.080]   And again, it gives me back, but it's also to attract new members as well, because people
[01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:46.600]   hopefully will see the free stuff and they'll like what they say and they'll build one together.
[01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:48.000]   The weekly shows that I do.
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.840]   Heck yes.
[01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:50.840]   Why wouldn't they?
[01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:53.000]   Wouldn't be why wouldn't they?
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:54.000]   All right.
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.240]   Let's take a break, talk about backing up.
[01:22:56.240 --> 01:22:57.240]   See, this is altruistic.
[01:22:57.240 --> 01:23:02.000]   This isn't really, it might seem like an ad to you, but I'm trying to save your butt
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:05.800]   by giving you a great way to back up your family photos, your financial records, your
[01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:09.880]   emails, anything that's on your hard drive that you don't want to lose.
[01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:16.600]   If you aren't backing it up, you're basically just running, how can I describe riding without
[01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:17.600]   a helmet?
[01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:18.760]   Running on empty.
[01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:20.920]   You're taking a huge chance.
[01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:24.240]   You're flying that rocket pack without any asbestos underwear.
[01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:26.920]   You've got to get out there and back it up.
[01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:30.680]   And I tell you, if you're going to back up, you're going to want to do it three ways.
[01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:32.880]   You're going to want to do it automatically so you don't have to remember to do it because
[01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:33.880]   you won't.
[01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:34.880]   I won't.
[01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:35.880]   Nobody would.
[01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:38.040]   You've got to do it continuously so you make a change that's backed up right away because
[01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:43.600]   you don't want to lag between when you create the data and when it gets preserved forever.
[01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:45.440]   And most importantly, I think people ignore this a lot.
[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:46.440]   It should be offsite.
[01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:47.440]   It should be away from the computer.
[01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:48.840]   It's good to have local backup.
[01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:49.840]   I do that too.
[01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:53.640]   But if you don't have an offsite solution, then you're really courting disaster if the worst
[01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:54.640]   happens.
[01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:56.720]   Fire, flood, earthquakes, somebody steals everything.
[01:23:56.720 --> 01:24:00.000]   If you've got a laptop and you leave it on the conveyor belt at the airport, that is
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.280]   the disaster scenario you've got to plan for.
[01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:03.280]   That's what backing up is.
[01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:05.240]   And that's what carbonite does.
[01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:14.280]   Unlimited backup for your Mac or PC is $59 a year, less than $5 a month.
[01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:17.440]   And I got to tell you, it's cloud storage too.
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:18.920]   So you can see your stuff anytime.
[01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:21.800]   Just log on to your carbon and account from any computer or their smartphone apps.
[01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:22.800]   Those are free.
[01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:23.800]   And there's your stuff.
[01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:26.520]   So you get cloud storage, you get automatic continuous backup.
[01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:31.920]   They do have plans for business and home premiere and so forth.
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:36.600]   All at one low flat monthly rate, actually yearly rate.
[01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:38.640]   I want you to try it free for two weeks.
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:40.000]   You don't need to give them a credit card.
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:45.040]   Just download the free trial installed on your Mac or PC and see what you think.
[01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:47.560]   Try it for two weeks.
[01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:51.000]   If you decide this is something you want to buy, use our offer code MacBreak.
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.000]   You'll get two free months.
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:55.640]   Actually, you should use the offer code when you set up for the free trial.
[01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:59.800]   And then I think you automatically get it.
[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:01.640]   The alarm is going off Renee.
[01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:05.800]   It's immediately it says North Korea, duck and cover.
[01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:07.840]   Atomic attack.
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:09.800]   Carbonite.com, use the offer code MacBreak.
[01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:10.800]   Nuff said.
[01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:12.920]   It's all you need to know.
[01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:16.120]   So this lawsuit, Tim Cook calls it a silly side show.
[01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:21.400]   David Einhorn is saying Apple should distribute its cash.
[01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:22.600]   Apple's got how much cash?
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:23.600]   I don't know.
[01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:24.600]   Billions.
[01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:25.600]   20 odd billion.
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:26.600]   Yeah.
[01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:37.440]   And Einhorn, David Einhorn is the founder of Greenlight Capital, I guess a big stockholder.
[01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:41.360]   And he's filing suit against Apple over a proposal that he says will eliminate the
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:43.080]   option of preferred stock.
[01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:45.280]   He wanted shareholders to vote against the proxy branding.
[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:48.640]   Apple's tactics is symptomatic of someone who suffered through money troubles.
[01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:50.440]   I don't know what he's saying.
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:52.480]   Tim Cook was really funny about that today.
[01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:55.160]   He said, you know, I'm not mailing out proposals to people.
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:57.720]   I don't have a prop two sign on my lawn.
[01:25:57.720 --> 01:26:01.640]   I just think that it's fair that if Apple ever does issue preferred stock, we let the
[01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:03.480]   shareholders weigh in on it.
[01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:06.600]   That's all Apple apparently wants to do is make it something that shareholders have to
[01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:10.440]   vote on and that the board can't do in and of themselves.
[01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:15.720]   They say Einhorn says Apple has a cash problem.
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:21.160]   They have so much in cash, 23 billion more last quarter ending the period with a hundred
[01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:25.000]   thirty seven point one billion dollars in cash.
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:30.440]   He says, it's like my grandma who lived through the depression.
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:31.440]   They're hoarding.
[01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:33.160]   He says Apple is a hoarder.
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:36.840]   They should be on Bravo.
[01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:38.480]   This guy's clearly good at this.
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:42.080]   He says it's a business of a hundred dollars bills instead of dead cats.
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:43.080]   Not at that right.
[01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:45.560]   He's just lying around the house.
[01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:47.760]   You know, I don't.
[01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:48.760]   I agree.
[01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:49.760]   Who knows?
[01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:50.760]   I don't even care.
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:52.480]   I'm sure they'll work this out.
[01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:55.040]   Apple says, by the way, they have explored.
[01:26:55.040 --> 01:27:00.920]   Tim Cook says, we have explored some major acquisitions and we are not against the idea,
[01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:02.520]   but we just we haven't found anything we want.
[01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:05.280]   He said this in the Goldman Sachs call today.
[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:10.560]   It's interesting, he said that they acquire an average of somebody every every other month.
[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:13.120]   But these are little, you know, acquires and things.
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:14.560]   It's of expertise or...
[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:15.560]   The technology.
[01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:16.560]   ...or IP.
[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:19.920]   Anybody who loves the company doesn't want Apple to acquire them because we think about
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:23.880]   things like La La and Siri, which Apple acquired and then gutted.
[01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:28.320]   I don't generally speaking with Facebook or Apple or Google, a lot of times when they
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:33.320]   acquire these companies, Google has a really terrible track record of basically gutting
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:34.320]   companies.
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:36.560]   Remember Jaikou Leo?
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:37.560]   Loved Jaikou.
[01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:38.560]   Me too.
[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:39.560]   Don't get me started on Jaikou.
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:44.240]   It was a Twitter early, Twitter replacement that I...
[01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:48.440]   It was actually kind of going under and I discovered it and I told everybody, "Oh, I'm
[01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:49.440]   moving to Jaikou.
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:50.840]   This is what I left Twitter.
[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:55.760]   It's so much better, but nobody believed me."
[01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:56.760]   So anyway.
[01:27:56.760 --> 01:27:57.760]   So much...
[01:27:57.760 --> 01:28:00.560]   The only thing that's interesting is if Apple could buy a company that would give them a
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:05.640]   springboard into services, the kind that Amazon and Google and Facebook run, really
[01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:10.800]   high scale, high reliability, high availability, server-side technology, but it's almost impossible
[01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:15.360]   to think of a company that's next like enough that Apple could do to their services and web
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:27.600]   objects, what they did to OS9 and OS10.
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:29.960]   I made everyone sad.
[01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:31.960]   I'm just looking for another story.
[01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:32.960]   I don't know.
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:34.760]   Anything else we haven't talked about?
[01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:36.400]   We talked about the watch.
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:41.080]   Apple's iPads were neutered for the US government.
[01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:42.880]   Hey boy.
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:43.880]   Hey boy.
[01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:44.880]   I'm sorry.
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:45.880]   I'm sorry.
[01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:49.320]   I was off the mic solve the supply problem.
[01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:52.640]   I'm not sure if that's a far thinking strategy.
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:56.720]   You mentioned Andy and I think you didn't just, but some iPhone users are saying the
[01:28:56.720 --> 01:29:02.760]   new 6.1 of iOS is draining their battery faster causing overheating as well.
[01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:04.160]   We heard much about that.
[01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:08.840]   I've heard a couple of complaints from users about that.
[01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:13.360]   It looks like that it seems like every time there's a major update to the iOS, there was
[01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:16.880]   some sort of use case and when someone is either their GPS is disappearing or their
[01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:19.560]   Wi-Fi is disappearing or they're getting a battery drain.
[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:23.200]   I think Vodafone as a matter of fact issued a...
[01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:24.200]   Did they...
[01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:26.320]   Was that last week that they were telling their users, please don't update right now because
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:30.280]   for some reason the latest update is knocking out our access to 4G.
[01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:32.000]   So just hold steady for now.
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.000]   That was...
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.000]   I found 4S only.
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.600]   Yeah, that was 4S, right.
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:37.280]   And that was patched in the update yesterday.
[01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:39.200]   That's a 6.1.1 update.
[01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:40.200]   Okay.
[01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:42.000]   And just announced it's okay to upgrade.
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.720]   So Vodafone's giving the big thumbs up for that.
[01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:45.720]   Yeah.
[01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:47.640]   The exchange issues too.
[01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:48.640]   Yeah.
[01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:53.040]   Well, that's an advantage that Apple will always have of R&D right and everybody else.
[01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:59.360]   I mean, if my Samsung phone, if it's GPS started dropping out, I know that, damn it.
[01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:02.520]   So now AT&T is going to have to argue with Samsung, which is going to have to argue with
[01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:05.600]   Google over where the problem is and who has to fix it.
[01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:09.600]   Rass Apple is going to be sufficiently shamed in just saying we will do an update.
[01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:11.160]   That update will go out to all users.
[01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:12.800]   It will be fixed in due course.
[01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:13.800]   You don't have to...
[01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:16.840]   It might take us a while to locate the problem and fix it, but it will get fixed and everybody
[01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:18.320]   will get it that fixed.
[01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:24.560]   We used to joke about PalmOS updates taking like 12 years to get through Palm and the
[01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:26.000]   individual carriers.
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.720]   So it's a whole different world now.
[01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:29.720]   Yeah.
[01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:30.720]   Yeah.
[01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:31.720]   Well, Apple changed.
[01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:35.440]   That's something Apple successfully changed, right?
[01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:37.200]   I think Andy is absolutely right.
[01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:40.760]   Every time there's a firmware upgrade, there's a percentage of people who suddenly have battery
[01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:42.800]   issues or one of those issues.
[01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:46.360]   And often it might just be because the restore process that happens in the background, something
[01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:47.360]   gets corrupted.
[01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:48.480]   There's some cruft that builds up.
[01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:52.440]   There's some extra notifications going on or some extra GPS hits or it's having a harder
[01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:53.440]   time finding a radio.
[01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:55.880]   So the device gets hot and it drains.
[01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:59.040]   And most of the time if you just restore it as a new iPhone, as big a pain in the butt
[01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:05.400]   as it is, that fixes most of that stuff.
[01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:07.600]   Tim Cook says, "I never wanted to sue Samsung.
[01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:10.520]   It was that stupid Steve Jobs."
[01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:12.520]   I mean...
[01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:18.240]   Steve says, "According to people with knowledge of the matter, Cook worried that...
[01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:19.800]   And Cook is the supply guy, right?
[01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:24.560]   He worried that Samsung would cut him off on critical components for the iPhone and the
[01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:26.200]   iPad.
[01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:33.800]   But Steve, according to this story in Reuters, had run out of patience suspecting that Samsung
[01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:37.880]   was counting on the supplier relationship to shield it from retribution.
[01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:41.480]   It's not going to get the impression that Steve probably took it more personally than
[01:31:41.480 --> 01:31:42.480]   Tim Cook.
[01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:44.080]   That seemed like the guy had takes things personally.
[01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:48.200]   No, but what was the famous quote that Steve said about going to thermonuclear against
[01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:49.200]   Android and whatever.
[01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:51.920]   So I think he did take those sort of things very personally.
[01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:56.560]   I think Tim's a little bit more detached and sees things from a higher plane.
[01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:59.120]   But now he's stuck, right?
[01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:00.880]   Because I mean, it's too late.
[01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:03.600]   You can't say, "Oh, never mind."
[01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:04.600]   Or could you?
[01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:05.600]   Because an interesting difference.
[01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:09.320]   I mean, and Horace Didio had a really good post on this where he said that basically Apple
[01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:13.600]   taught Google how to make smartphone software and they taught Samsung how to manufacture
[01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:16.760]   massive quantities of phones by pushing through all that stuff.
[01:32:16.760 --> 01:32:19.600]   And now those two companies are their biggest competitor.
[01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:24.160]   But there's a huge difference between being tactically smart enough to learn and adapt
[01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:26.440]   these things and legal theft.
[01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:30.480]   And you can be really upset and really angry and you can have legacy issues about Microsoft
[01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:31.840]   stealing your PC technology.
[01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:36.000]   And that can, because companies are people, that can influence your decision making.
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.920]   But at the end of the day, these are just Google and Samsung were really smart and they
[01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:41.320]   pivoted really, really fast.
[01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:46.640]   Finally, Alicia Keys, who I didn't know this, but is apparently the global creative director
[01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:52.720]   for Blackberry, she came up on stage during the Blackberry 10 announcement.
[01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:55.920]   But apparently she's still tweeting from her iPhone.
[01:32:55.920 --> 01:32:59.400]   And that she says, "Oh no, I was hacked."
[01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:04.800]   She should talk to Anthony Wiener before she really pursues that line.
[01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:06.040]   I didn't post that.
[01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:07.040]   I was hacked.
[01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:08.040]   Whoopsies.
[01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:13.880]   Well, interesting week because Stevenson-Ovsky a couple weeks ago was posting from an Android
[01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:14.880]   device.
[01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:20.520]   And then Joe Fiore, who runs UI for Windows Phone, was posting from an Android phone on
[01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:21.520]   Twitter.
[01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:24.480]   And it seems like Twitter is this place where everyone experiments with different phones.
[01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:28.040]   People I think often don't understand that when they tweet, you could see what client
[01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:29.680]   they used.
[01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:31.000]   And it seems the web interface.
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:32.000]   Seems to bite them.
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:33.600]   Yeah, because well, Twitter got rid of that.
[01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:35.520]   They didn't want anyone to know there were other clients.
[01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:38.480]   So maybe if you're just looking at official Twitter apps or the Twitter website, you think
[01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:39.480]   you're in Cognito.
[01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:40.480]   That's right.
[01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:41.480]   Those of us who still use Tweetbot.
[01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:42.480]   Tweetbot tells you.
[01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:43.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:44.480]   Whoa.
[01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:48.400]   At the same time, can we get a little past this?
[01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:49.400]   Yeah.
[01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:54.520]   Also, there's a few months ago who runs the exact same problem.
[01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:56.680]   And they had to be explained to the entire world that--
[01:33:56.680 --> 01:33:57.680]   Oprah.
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:33:58.680]   Yeah.
[01:33:58.680 --> 01:34:02.400]   Well, I don't think I'm not thinking Oprah specifically, but it's like, yeah, I have
[01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:06.360]   to explain to you that I have a team of four people who do my social media.
[01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:09.320]   So oftentimes, it's me who's tweeting.
[01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:12.640]   Sometimes it's because I've told my assistant to please tweet up this at a certain time
[01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:14.880]   on a certain day because I've agreed to do so.
[01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:15.880]   Maybe they didn't use the iPhone.
[01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:17.240]   Maybe they didn't use the Android phone.
[01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:18.560]   Maybe they didn't use the right phone.
[01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:19.560]   But you know what?
[01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:20.560]   Just give it a rest.
[01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:21.560]   Yeah.
[01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:22.560]   I mean, certainly that's what happened.
[01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:23.560]   I keep checking Andy's--
[01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:25.960]   I've got a lot of his assistance mess up.
[01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:26.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:27.960]   Excuse me?
[01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:30.000]   I keep checking Andy's phone for when his assistance mess up.
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:31.000]   I haven't caught him.
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:33.000]   Have you missed out?
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:34.000]   Have you missed out?
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:35.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.760]   Did you post from a surface?
[01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:38.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:39.760]   Finally, before he died, according to business--
[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:42.600]   I'd be pleased to post from a surface quality product.
[01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:43.600]   It is.
[01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:45.640]   Do you have your surface lying about?
[01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:46.640]   Uh, indeed.
[01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:47.640]   Do you?
[01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:48.640]   Is it the Surface Pro?
[01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:49.640]   Isn't he the Pro?
[01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:50.640]   Ah, look at that.
[01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:52.640]   One of the rare ones.
[01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:54.640]   You're going to do it 10 Sundays.
[01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:55.640]   That's what people do when it happens.
[01:34:55.640 --> 01:34:56.640]   Where are the rare ones?
[01:34:56.640 --> 01:34:58.640]   It's been used within the past 48 hours.
[01:34:58.640 --> 01:34:59.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:01.680]   No, they sold out of the 128 gig.
[01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:04.760]   You can't even order it anymore in the Microsoft store.
[01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:07.120]   Yeah, I mean, you definitely want the 128 gig.
[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:08.120]   Yeah.
[01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:10.000]   It's a fine product.
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.160]   It's not for everybody yet.
[01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:19.320]   It's good, but I was kind of disappointed that it got real like Zoom 1 type of views.
[01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:25.560]   Because it was one of those days where I posted my review and everybody else's review.
[01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:29.600]   And I had to go back to my review saying, was I high to not see that?
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:31.400]   I think this was a horrible, horrible product.
[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:35.400]   Or is there's expectations that other people have that I do not have?
[01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:37.960]   Well, they-- I mean, Microsoft said it was no compromise.
[01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:39.920]   And every review hit them for it being compromised.
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:43.240]   It was probably a dumb thing to say because it set the stage for all those reviews.
[01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:44.240]   Yeah.
[01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:46.240]   Because we got-- yeah, it has a compromised product.
[01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:49.240]   Everything's a compromised product.
[01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:50.240]   Yeah.
[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:54.000]   And finally, before he died, according to Nick Bolton--
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:55.000]   Nick Bolton.
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.000]   And I'm Michael Bolton.
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:01.800]   That I watch story-- this is a little lower down below the fold.
[01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:06.920]   He told John Markoff of the New York Times, if he'd had more energy, he would have liked
[01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:09.720]   to take on Detroit with an Apple car.
[01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:10.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:15.920]   I think Jobs, toward the end, he was at this point he's going, I'm going to screw with
[01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:16.920]   him.
[01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:17.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:22.000]   I'm going to make a car and a watch and a bike and an espresso meter.
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:27.840]   I just hope that my zero gravity point singularity spaceship gets finished in time for me to see
[01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:30.440]   the first launch.
[01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:34.120]   And I just hope those damn regulators don't prevent us from actually having to be able
[01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:38.960]   to show off and ship it because those damn regulators prevent us from showing it publicly.
[01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:42.080]   Did you know, though, that Eddie Q is on the board of Ferrari?
[01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:43.320]   I did not know that.
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:44.320]   Yes.
[01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:45.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:51.320]   And Phil Schiller in his Twitter bio says he's into Apple, sports, cars, and science.
[01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:52.320]   Yeah.
[01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:53.320]   Yeah.
[01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:57.280]   And so that doesn't help you at all, but I just throw that.
[01:36:57.280 --> 01:36:58.480]   They all own cars, Leo.
[01:36:58.480 --> 01:36:59.480]   Where does the money go?
[01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:00.480]   They all own cars.
[01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:04.160]   Now we know where that $137 billion is going.
[01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:05.320]   Let's take a break when we come back.
[01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:08.040]   Your picks and tweets and tips of the week.
[01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:12.520]   But first, a word from Ring Central, a tip about our phone system.
[01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:15.240]   What a great phone system we have here at the Brick House.
[01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:18.160]   One of the problems when we move from the cottage.
[01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:20.840]   In the cottage, I mean, everybody use their cell phone.
[01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:23.480]   You use your cell phone, I said.
[01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:24.480]   What do you think I am?
[01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:25.800]   Made of money?
[01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:29.320]   But as we got to be a bigger business, I realized you actually have to put phones on
[01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:30.320]   people's desks.
[01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:34.120]   And I was kind of thinking, I don't-- what am I going to put a PBX to the basement in
[01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:35.120]   contract with the phone company?
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:40.640]   And it's going to cost me a mint-- then Russell, our IT guy, said, you know, I've installed
[01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:43.280]   Ring Central in a bunch of our clients, and they seem to like it.
[01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:44.280]   It's cloud-based.
[01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:45.280]   Maybe you want to take a look.
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:46.280]   We did.
[01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:47.280]   We installed it.
[01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:48.560]   We've got Ring Central phones everywhere.
[01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:49.560]   In fact, it's kind of cool.
[01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:52.800]   Because my phone is like a traditional two-line desk phone.
[01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:55.960]   Conference room has the polycom, you know, traditional conference phone.
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:59.120]   But then a lot of the producers have a phone that basically looks like the home cordless
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:00.120]   phone.
[01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:02.720]   They can carry it around and walk around.
[01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:03.720]   And it's fantastic.
[01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:06.560]   We can do all sorts of things with a Ring Central account.
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:08.560]   You can't do it with a PBX.
[01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:12.760]   Phone calls can originate from your smartphone using the Ring Central app.
[01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:15.200]   They now have business text, too.
[01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:17.600]   This is kind of interesting.
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:19.600]   Some more reusing text to communicate with people.
[01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:21.880]   Let's say we've got an interview coming up on triangulation.
[01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:24.880]   We want to text the guy, "Hey, we're about to talk to you."
[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:27.000]   You don't want to do that from your cell phone, your private phone.
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:30.400]   But with the Ring Central app, you can send the text from our 800 number.
[01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:32.760]   It looks like it came from Twit.
[01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:35.160]   Response comes in on the 800 number.
[01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:36.160]   Goes to your phone.
[01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:41.920]   Of course, all calls can go to your cell phone or go to voicemail and then to your email.
[01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:44.880]   You can send faxes, receive faxes.
[01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:49.800]   I just think this is, of course, much more flexible because it's a cloud-based phone
[01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:50.800]   system.
[01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:53.160]   New features are added just kind of automatically.
[01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:55.520]   There's zero startup cost.
[01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:57.200]   There's no hardware to install or maintain.
[01:38:57.200 --> 01:38:59.800]   You just buy a phone and plug it into the wall.
[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:01.280]   It works so easily.
[01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:04.720]   Complete customization of our phone tree and everything.
[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:06.800]   And it's as low as $20 per month per user.
[01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:09.120]   And that includes long distance.
[01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:10.120]   It is a great deal.
[01:39:10.120 --> 01:39:11.120]   Call 800.
[01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:12.120]   We have a special number for you.
[01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:19.640]   You can visit RingCentral.com and enter the promo code Twit.
[01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:22.960]   You'll get 30 days free and a special offer.
[01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:27.080]   When you buy one desk phone, you'll get a second phone free up to 20 phones total.
[01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:28.720]   So you can save on your phones as well.
[01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:32.800]   RingCentral.com, use the promo code Twit or call 800.
[01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:33.800]   543.
[01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:34.800]   9980.
[01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:35.800]   There it is.
[01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:36.800]   800.
[01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:37.800]   543.
[01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:38.800]   9980.
[01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:39.800]   I can tell you a year and a half in.
[01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:40.800]   How long have we been here about a year and a half, right?
[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:41.800]   No more than that now.
[01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:42.800]   Two years.
[01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:45.680]   Holy cow.
[01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:48.200]   We are still very happy with RingCentral.
[01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:49.200]   RingCentral.com.
[01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:53.040]   Give it a try today.
[01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:55.560]   So I'm going to start because I've got it all set up.
[01:39:55.560 --> 01:40:00.960]   I was taking a little energy to set up my HBO Go on my iPad.
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:05.000]   I've been watching a little bit of a, a little bit of a VEEP on here.
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.960]   But notice they've added a new feature.
[01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:10.800]   Finally, I can AirPlay it.
[01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:15.320]   Let me get that AirPlay icon and see if I can get it to the brick house.
[01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:17.120]   Can you, can you play this back now?
[01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:20.880]   If I play this here, can you pull up brick house on your switcher?
[01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:23.200]   That's our Apple TV, right?
[01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:25.480]   So now this is, I don't know why they didn't have this before.
[01:40:25.480 --> 01:40:28.080]   I guess because they didn't want to compete with themselves or something.
[01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:34.200]   But now I can watch VEEP on my iPad or any HBO on my iPad and then I can transfer it
[01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:37.000]   over to my Apple TV and start watching it there.
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:38.000]   Let's see what it looks like.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:39.000]   It looks like.
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:40.000]   You're not seeing it?
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:44.040]   I'd hit that thing again because usually when an AirPlay is, it stops the iPad version.
[01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:45.720]   Oh, it's blue.
[01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:46.960]   You're right.
[01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:50.400]   It's one hard, tiny tap targets.
[01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:52.640]   It says brick house.
[01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:54.480]   Well, over here, I'm not getting it.
[01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:57.200]   So never mind, it doesn't work for quite yet.
[01:40:57.200 --> 01:40:58.400]   Or maybe I'm on a different, you know what?
[01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:00.480]   I'm probably on a different Wi-Fi.
[01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:01.800]   Production?
[01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:03.200]   But I'm seeing brick house.
[01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:04.200]   Yeah.
[01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:06.720]   So that wouldn't make any sense.
[01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:08.960]   Well so much for that.
[01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:09.960]   Try it at home.
[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:10.960]   See if it works at home.
[01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:13.160]   If not, we know why they did it.
[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:14.880]   Yeah, because it doesn't work.
[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:19.760]   I like HBO Go because I do like the idea that I can, you know, of course with HBO Go,
[01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:24.560]   everywhere but Norway, you have to be an HBO subscriber through a cable company.
[01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:27.760]   So this way they don't put themselves out of business.
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:32.480]   The cable company is a system that but it does mean I can watch HBO on my iPad.
[01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:44.560]   And now in theory, if I've got an Apple TV, I don't have to have a cable hooked up to
[01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:45.560]   it.
[01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:49.800]   And you should be getting a channel for HBO on your Apple TV fairly soon too.
[01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:50.800]   Yes, right.
[01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:52.600]   That's not part of the new update.
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:54.600]   Not yet, no, but it's soon.
[01:41:54.600 --> 01:41:58.600]   Soon, obviously they're inching their way towards this.
[01:41:58.600 --> 01:41:59.600]   Why is this not?
[01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:00.600]   It's not.
[01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:01.600]   I don't know.
[01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:05.520]   Let me take it back and switch it over again.
[01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:08.440]   Sometimes if the Apple, I hate these tiny tap targets.
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:11.120]   One of the problems is that an media company is usually don't want to use the built-in
[01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:13.120]   Apple control so they recreate their own.
[01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:14.120]   Yeah, nice, huh?
[01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:15.120]   Isn't that smart?
[01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:16.120]   Makes it so much.
[01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:17.120]   There it goes.
[01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:18.960]   Now it's not froze.
[01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:19.960]   Nope.
[01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:23.760]   She's complaining about all of the play.
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:24.760]   Play it.
[01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:27.280]   Amiel, maybe it's only audio because there was a.
[01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:28.840]   Are you hearing the audio?
[01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:31.160]   Well, I don't have that over.
[01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:32.160]   No, you're not.
[01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:33.160]   It's not.
[01:42:33.160 --> 01:42:34.160]   How could it only be audio?
[01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:37.000]   But there was a little audio button when you stopped and started.
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:40.200]   Over the last several years, HBO is making streaming.
[01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:43.280]   Additional of air play.
[01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:47.200]   The rumor, of course, that they'll be rolling out a standalone app for Apple TV.
[01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:50.240]   Could just be buggy launch day stuff.
[01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:51.240]   Yeah.
[01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:52.840]   Oh, well.
[01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:53.840]   Someday.
[01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:57.400]   Andy, what's your pick of the week, sir?
[01:42:57.400 --> 01:43:00.840]   My pick is a free app that I started playing with four days ago.
[01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:06.120]   Unfortunately, I was writing up and I was working on a piece up and just up until like three
[01:43:06.120 --> 01:43:07.320]   seconds of programming on the studio.
[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:09.560]   So I don't have a demonstration I can show you.
[01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:15.800]   But it's a sculpting, 3D sculpting app called Sculptriss from Pixilogic.com.
[01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:21.280]   And it's just a very, very, it's just like sort of, you just got a hunk of plasticine
[01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:25.600]   and you just keep listening and squishing it and just playing with it without any real
[01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:26.600]   purpose.
[01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:29.840]   You're just sort of like, you know, working with it and just seeing what happens.
[01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:33.920]   It's that like, it's that kind of app for 3D modeling where if you are a professional
[01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:38.480]   designer, I'm sure you could develop really wonderful models with it.
[01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:40.200]   You can also paint models.
[01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:43.520]   It is like a junior edition of a professional product that they're hoping that you might
[01:43:43.520 --> 01:43:44.520]   want to buy later on.
[01:43:44.520 --> 01:43:49.120]   So it's another one of those freemium sort of things, I think, where if you learn the
[01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:53.920]   tools for Sculptriss, maybe you will spend, you will want to apply those skills towards
[01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:56.880]   another Pixilogic app later on in the future.
[01:43:56.880 --> 01:44:01.400]   But the idea is that it really is the least intimidating 3D sculpting app I've ever played
[01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:03.600]   with because you can just play with it.
[01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:07.000]   You can start with a primitive and just start pushing and pulling at it until you suddenly
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:08.440]   have, hey, look, it's the goblin.
[01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:10.840]   I wonder if the goblin also have a Mohawk.
[01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:12.440]   Hey, look, the goblin has a Mohawk now.
[01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:14.280]   I wonder what the goblin looks like from the back.
[01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:17.080]   Oh, the guy in the goblin in the back of his head.
[01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:20.280]   Ooh, let's give him a little crease in the middle of the back of his skull.
[01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:21.280]   There he is.
[01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:22.360]   I just got a crease in the back of his skull.
[01:44:22.360 --> 01:44:26.520]   And then three hours later, you realize, oh, that piece I should have written three hours
[01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:30.280]   ago is now still having been fun because I've made a painted version of a goblin that
[01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:32.080]   now I can't reuse.
[01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:35.240]   But the other nice thing is that it's not just a simple demo app.
[01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:37.880]   It is like a full featured app in and of itself.
[01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:41.160]   So that if you do find out that you have accidentally built something kind of cool and
[01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:44.400]   you want to export it as a model so you can use it in other apps, you can export it,
[01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:46.120]   you can handle it with other apps.
[01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:47.120]   Really cool.
[01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:48.120]   Any company the price is free.
[01:44:48.120 --> 01:44:50.560]   All it costs you is your personal information.
[01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:53.800]   They didn't want your email address before they'll send you a download code.
[01:44:53.800 --> 01:44:54.800]   But good stuff.
[01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:56.640]   It's really fun to play with.
[01:44:56.640 --> 01:45:00.800]   Sculptris, a C-U-L-P-T-R-I-S.
[01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:04.400]   Pixel Logic is the company that is ZBrush so many years ago.
[01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:06.680]   Which is still it's still out.
[01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:07.680]   It looks like.
[01:45:07.680 --> 01:45:08.680]   I believe so.
[01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:12.600]   Yeah, neat.
[01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:14.720]   And it's freemium, you said.
[01:45:14.720 --> 01:45:15.720]   Well, I'm sorry about that.
[01:45:15.720 --> 01:45:16.720]   It's free.
[01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:17.720]   It's free.
[01:45:17.720 --> 01:45:24.840]   I first came across it after looking at my comic artist blog who normally builds clay
[01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:28.400]   models when they're going to be involved in a very, very long project so that they can
[01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:31.800]   see a character from whatever angle they wanted to pick it from.
[01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:33.280]   And they decide, well, I'm going to try this app.
[01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:36.800]   And two and a half through hours later they had pretty much the models they wanted.
[01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:38.960]   And they were surprised by how quick it is.
[01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:43.920]   I think Apollo Rivera, I think he's a really great artist.
[01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:45.520]   He's an inspired man.
[01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:47.880]   He's done Daredevil.
[01:45:47.880 --> 01:45:49.400]   He's really my favorite artist.
[01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:52.560]   I think he was also using sculptures for a lot of these same things.
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:55.200]   So it's a very playable app.
[01:45:55.200 --> 01:45:56.200]   That's what gets me.
[01:45:56.200 --> 01:45:58.800]   You actually have to have ability to use these things.
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:45:59.800]   It just drives me crazy.
[01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:03.480]   No, I mean, you start off by just getting a hunk of clay and whacking at it.
[01:46:03.480 --> 01:46:08.640]   And then you start, your first drawing is a piece of paper and a crayon.
[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:12.480]   And the first 100 pieces of crap, your first thousand are kind of okay.
[01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:16.440]   The first 10,000 have promised, but once you get those 10,000 awful ones behind you,
[01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:22.640]   as long as you have fun, you'll be promoted within yourself to try to do the second thing,
[01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:25.640]   which is going to be a little bit better than the last one.
[01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:26.640]   Kind of the story.
[01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:27.640]   At least this one.
[01:46:27.640 --> 01:46:28.640]   At least this one.
[01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:33.400]   What I'm recommending, this piece is that I've used a lot of different 3D apps where all
[01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:39.360]   I wanted to do was, I mean, it's like, okay, here's what I want to make.
[01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:42.960]   Because I make a lot of like simple furniture like around the office.
[01:46:42.960 --> 01:46:44.760]   And I'll often model it first.
[01:46:44.760 --> 01:46:47.840]   So it's like, okay, I've got a one by two.
[01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:51.160]   I want to fix it to this little panel right here.
[01:46:51.160 --> 01:46:53.960]   I want to know if I should put another spar here or here.
[01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:58.160]   Okay, so let's appear as a piece of it's one and a half inches by wide.
[01:46:58.160 --> 01:46:59.480]   It is three quarters of an inch thick.
[01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:01.040]   Oh, wait, no, it's not a cube.
[01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:03.360]   Okay, what I have to exclude it.
[01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:05.200]   I can't say, okay, I'm extruding it.
[01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:07.320]   Okay, I don't want an eight foot long.
[01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:09.400]   I just want something that's big.
[01:47:09.400 --> 01:47:13.000]   Okay, no, what if I actually, it's like, you actually make furniture?
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:16.040]   Is this something I'm learning about you for the first time you make?
[01:47:16.040 --> 01:47:20.600]   It's saying it's a bit much to call it furniture.
[01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:25.480]   More like I've run in front of me right now is in fact a, but the latest project, which
[01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:27.440]   is sort of an easel sort of thing.
[01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:31.560]   So I have like one, two, three tablets on my phone on top of it.
[01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:35.000]   And it's exactly the right height and it's exactly the right angle.
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:39.640]   When I actually went out shopping for something like this, I couldn't find the thing that I wanted.
[01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:41.800]   And the closest thing was like $300.
[01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:46.800]   And I thought, okay, look, I can build it out of pine and get it to actually work once
[01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:50.280]   it's once I've got the proportions right, then I can remake it on maple and do it right.
[01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:54.440]   Are these skills you learned in woodshop in high school or?
[01:47:54.440 --> 01:47:56.800]   Woodshop, partly woodshop, partly my dad.
[01:47:56.800 --> 01:48:02.120]   We did a lot of unlicensed contracting for the family.
[01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:05.720]   So yeah, get the in that go edition at back.
[01:48:05.720 --> 01:48:12.240]   I know how do we do a lot of things that might not be up to code if houses never got sold.
[01:48:12.240 --> 01:48:13.480]   I think that's great.
[01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:15.480]   That's really cool.
[01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:17.400]   Renee Richie, you got to pick for us?
[01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:18.400]   I do.
[01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:23.040]   And my pick is in honor of the lunar new year because that kicked off this weekend.
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:24.760]   Don't hate fat, Troy.
[01:48:24.760 --> 01:48:25.880]   Don't hate fat, Troy.
[01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:30.120]   And I think like you, Leo, I spent a lot of my college years doing Chinese studies.
[01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:31.480]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[01:48:31.480 --> 01:48:32.480]   That's new.
[01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:33.480]   Yeah.
[01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:35.360]   My Mandarin is much worse than my French, though.
[01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:36.720]   Yeah, mine too.
[01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:37.720]   Yeah.
[01:48:37.720 --> 01:48:40.080]   So I spent a lot of my 20s in Chinatown.
[01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:43.280]   I went to China a few times and I've always really enjoyed the culture.
[01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:48.720]   And what I could find for the lunar new year is this case from Element case.
[01:48:48.720 --> 01:48:50.160]   It's called the Ronin.
[01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:54.600]   And it was actually they have an edition that was specifically made for the lunar new year.
[01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:58.600]   And they make a lot of high end, usually racing inspired cases.
[01:48:58.600 --> 01:49:01.800]   But this one was inspired by Asian sword making.
[01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:10.160]   So it's got woods and it's got metal and screws and it comes with a nice little pouch.
[01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:12.840]   It comes with a variety of backs.
[01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:15.880]   Tell them how much it is so that you understand what you're getting.
[01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:18.320]   This is an Alex Lindsey level pick.
[01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:20.920]   So it's a $200 iPhone case.
[01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:21.920]   Wow.
[01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:24.120]   I didn't want to I didn't want to lead with the lead on this one.
[01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:27.600]   And there's a more expensive version that has actual gold on it.
[01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:31.840]   Oh, just for just for context, if you were to drop your phone into a toilet or off a cliff,
[01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:34.400]   how much of the apple store could replace it?
[01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:35.400]   200 bucks.
[01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:36.400]   Yeah.
[01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:41.520]   So I mean, it's not for the fact you could buy an iPod nano and stick that in a red envelope
[01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:43.560]   and go about your business.
[01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:48.440]   But if you want to celebrate the lunar new year in style, this is just this is a nice
[01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:51.480]   sort of an ode to that culture.
[01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:53.280]   I want to get the gold one now.
[01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:55.080]   Oh, that's out.
[01:49:55.080 --> 01:49:56.360]   Yeah, the gold one is pricey.
[01:49:56.360 --> 01:49:57.360]   Pretty pretty pretty.
[01:49:57.360 --> 01:50:06.360]   It's a nickel plated aluminum CNC machine exotic wood rails made out of the what is that?
[01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:08.600]   How do you pronounce that tree?
[01:50:08.600 --> 01:50:10.600]   I do not know.
[01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:15.320]   I'm certain I'm certain I'm certain I'm sensible wood and leather and ultra suede backplates.
[01:50:15.320 --> 01:50:17.600]   And then they do have a gold edition as well.
[01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:21.800]   But it's interesting to see we saw this at Mac world and it's as well as that the it used
[01:50:21.800 --> 01:50:25.920]   to be everyone just wanted the quick cheap little plastic bumper for their iPhone.
[01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:31.480]   But now companies are making a case mate was making gem in lays and you know wood in lays
[01:50:31.480 --> 01:50:33.920]   and they're really experimenting with materials.
[01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:37.480]   And instead of just making something that's utilitarian, everyone's using the iPhone as
[01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:40.800]   a platform to express their own designs and their own fashions.
[01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:42.560]   And I think it's really interesting.
[01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:44.000]   Very nice.
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:45.520]   Very nice.
[01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:48.640]   Mr. Don McAllister screencast online.
[01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:49.840]   Your pick of the week.
[01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:51.440]   Well mine's a lot cheaper than that one.
[01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:52.680]   Mine's actually a free app.
[01:50:52.680 --> 01:50:53.680]   Oh, I like it.
[01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:56.600]   Free app for the for the iPhone and the iPad.
[01:50:56.600 --> 01:51:00.720]   Now we've got a drop on OS 10 and that's quite a handy thing to have you have multiple
[01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:01.720]   Macs.
[01:51:01.720 --> 01:51:02.720]   You can just use a drop.
[01:51:02.720 --> 01:51:05.840]   But it calls if you've got your iPhone or your iPad that doesn't appear within a drop.
[01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:12.000]   So there's a new app out called Insta Share, which is sort of like a drop between iOS and
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000]   also OS 10.
[01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:15.320]   And they've got the iPhone app at the moment.
[01:51:15.320 --> 01:51:20.080]   They're working on an iPad app and there's also a free OS 10 menu bar thing sticking the
[01:51:20.080 --> 01:51:21.080]   menu bar.
[01:51:21.080 --> 01:51:22.080]   But it's just super simple.
[01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:23.080]   It's really easy.
[01:51:23.080 --> 01:51:28.400]   Basically, you just to transfer a file from your Mac to your iOS device, you just go to
[01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:31.720]   the menu bar, tap open the window, drag the file to it, let go.
[01:51:31.720 --> 01:51:34.400]   It has a look on the network to see what other iOS devices have got.
[01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:38.960]   The application running, you drop it on the particular device and it just works.
[01:51:38.960 --> 01:51:39.960]   It's great.
[01:51:39.960 --> 01:51:41.400]   And it's not restricted to any particular file type.
[01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:43.560]   It's not, you can use any file.
[01:51:43.560 --> 01:51:47.360]   I think there's a new version come out, which also allows you to transfer folders as well.
[01:51:47.360 --> 01:51:48.560]   But it's both ways as well.
[01:51:48.560 --> 01:51:52.560]   So on your iOS device, you open up the application.
[01:51:52.560 --> 01:51:54.560]   It gives you access and you can just drag a file in.
[01:51:54.560 --> 01:51:59.920]   Or if you're in another application, so you're in a PDF reader application, you want to send
[01:51:59.920 --> 01:52:03.560]   that across to your Mac, you click the share button and it appears in the list of applications
[01:52:03.560 --> 01:52:07.640]   you can share with, share with Insta Share and then it will appear on your Mac.
[01:52:07.640 --> 01:52:10.160]   It's really, really nice and it's free.
[01:52:10.160 --> 01:52:12.960]   There is, it's supported by app ads.
[01:52:12.960 --> 01:52:19.240]   But if you pay 69P or 99 cents, you can get rid of the ads and I did it within about 30
[01:52:19.240 --> 01:52:20.240]   seconds.
[01:52:20.240 --> 01:52:21.240]   It's actually downloading the application now.
[01:52:21.240 --> 01:52:22.880]   But this is for me.
[01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:24.760]   I'm sorry.
[01:52:24.760 --> 01:52:29.680]   I'm a little distracted because my pick of the week was the edible arrangement.
[01:52:29.680 --> 01:52:30.680]   [laughter]
[01:52:30.680 --> 01:52:33.800]   We're Valentine's Day, which is going quickly.
[01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:35.600]   I don't know if there'll be much left after.
[01:52:35.600 --> 01:52:37.600]   Save one for me.
[01:52:37.600 --> 01:52:38.600]   Rade.
[01:52:38.600 --> 01:52:43.640]   They said online, it said pineapple shaped hearts and I don't know what that is, but
[01:52:43.640 --> 01:52:46.560]   I think they meant a heart shaped pineapple.
[01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:51.160]   Anyway, happy Valentine's Day everybody.
[01:52:51.160 --> 01:52:52.520]   It's so great to have you all done.
[01:52:52.520 --> 01:52:53.520]   It's great to talk to you.
[01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:55.800]   I'm sorry we didn't see you when you were in town, but I'm glad we could get you on
[01:52:55.800 --> 01:52:56.800]   via Skype.
[01:52:56.800 --> 01:52:58.600]   It's almost as good as being there.
[01:52:58.600 --> 01:52:59.600]   Well, that's right.
[01:52:59.600 --> 01:53:01.560]   And you won't catch my cold that way.
[01:53:01.560 --> 01:53:03.080]   Don, is that screencast online?
[01:53:03.080 --> 01:53:04.800]   What's your latest screencast?
[01:53:04.800 --> 01:53:08.880]   I'm just working on one this week.
[01:53:08.880 --> 01:53:09.880]   You know what?
[01:53:09.880 --> 01:53:12.280]   I actually did an AirPlay one last week.
[01:53:12.280 --> 01:53:13.280]   I actually...
[01:53:13.280 --> 01:53:14.280]   I prefer.
[01:53:14.280 --> 01:53:15.600]   Because a lot of these screencast online viewers can't come to Macworld.
[01:53:15.600 --> 01:53:19.440]   I actually did a special version of the presentation ago at Macworld on AirPlay.
[01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:21.080]   So that was quite interesting.
[01:53:21.080 --> 01:53:25.560]   And I'm still doing a weekly iOS tutorial as well.
[01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:26.720]   But I also have the magazine.
[01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:30.040]   So if people want to check out the magazine in the newsstand, they can just search for
[01:53:30.040 --> 01:53:32.400]   ScreenCatsOnline monthly.
[01:53:32.400 --> 01:53:34.240]   It's an iPad magazine in the news.
[01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:35.240]   It is.
[01:53:35.240 --> 01:53:36.240]   It's in the newsstand.
[01:53:36.240 --> 01:53:37.240]   Yeah.
[01:53:37.240 --> 01:53:38.240]   Very cool.
[01:53:38.240 --> 01:53:39.240]   Great to talk to you, Don.
[01:53:39.240 --> 01:53:40.240]   Thank you for being here.
[01:53:40.240 --> 01:53:41.240]   Thanks to Renee Ritchie.
[01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:42.240]   He's here almost every week now.
[01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:43.240]   I'm more.com.
[01:53:43.240 --> 01:53:44.240]   Always a pleasure.
[01:53:44.240 --> 01:53:45.240]   Thank you very much, Leo.
[01:53:45.240 --> 01:53:46.240]   Stay warm.
[01:53:46.240 --> 01:53:47.240]   Trying to...
[01:53:47.240 --> 01:53:49.320]   You did Burning Andy's books as fast as I can.
[01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:54.480]   Everybody's saying that the series you did on Evasion, the new jailbreak for 6.1, was
[01:53:54.480 --> 01:53:55.480]   excellent.
[01:53:55.480 --> 01:53:56.480]   A must read.
[01:53:56.480 --> 01:53:57.480]   Thank you very much.
[01:53:57.480 --> 01:53:58.480]   Thank you very much.
[01:53:58.480 --> 01:54:00.240]   It's fun to be able to jailbreak again after a long drought.
[01:54:00.240 --> 01:54:01.480]   We talked about it last week.
[01:54:01.480 --> 01:54:04.280]   This is the most downloaded jailbreak ever in history.
[01:54:04.280 --> 01:54:05.880]   Millions of people downloaded it.
[01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:08.040]   It's kind of an interesting thing.
[01:54:08.040 --> 01:54:11.200]   This stuff available is really because iOS 6 added a lot of basic features.
[01:54:11.200 --> 01:54:13.920]   You'd think there's not much left to do, but some of the tweaks that the really smart
[01:54:13.920 --> 01:54:17.080]   jailbreak developers have come up with are really impressive.
[01:54:17.080 --> 01:54:18.480]   Yeah.
[01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:20.480]   So worth doing.
[01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:21.480]   It's worth doing.
[01:54:21.480 --> 01:54:24.880]   If something frustrates you about your iPhone, if you came from another platform, there's
[01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:27.120]   just something that you want to do that you can't.
[01:54:27.120 --> 01:54:31.400]   And even if it's just changed the theme or add five icons to your dock or use gestures
[01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:35.040]   like the iPad on your iPhone, these all these little enhancements.
[01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:39.160]   And because you can just restore and go back to stock, immediately if you want to, it's
[01:54:39.160 --> 01:54:41.160]   very low risk.
[01:54:41.160 --> 01:54:45.920]   Evasion is spelled with a zero instead of an O, but otherwise it's evasion.com.
[01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:50.080]   It is a simple one-click jailbreak.
[01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:55.080]   But before I do it, I would absolutely read the series of articles at imore.com.
[01:54:55.080 --> 01:54:59.520]   And the jailbreak itself is a brilliant piece of engineering to get around everything that
[01:54:59.520 --> 01:55:01.960]   Apple's done to steal off the system.
[01:55:01.960 --> 01:55:03.560]   Very cool.
[01:55:03.560 --> 01:55:05.960]   Very cool.
[01:55:05.960 --> 01:55:11.960]   Andy Inaco from the Chicago Sun Times and a regular also on Mac Break Weekly hiding right
[01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:14.440]   now between the chocolate dipped fruit.
[01:55:14.440 --> 01:55:16.320]   We'll just slide that over.
[01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:18.320]   Thank you for being here.
[01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:19.320]   We're having me.
[01:55:19.320 --> 01:55:23.600]   Thank you for at least putting it within proximity of something delicious.
[01:55:23.600 --> 01:55:25.360]   This really is good stuff.
[01:55:25.360 --> 01:55:28.360]   I got to say, does someone love you?
[01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:31.040]   Do you have a sweet heart?
[01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:33.280]   Actually, I gave it to her and she gave it back.
[01:55:33.280 --> 01:55:35.160]   So there you go.
[01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:37.960]   I guess that's love.
[01:55:37.960 --> 01:55:43.400]   We do this show every Tuesday, 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern Time, 1900 UTC on twitter.tv.
[01:55:43.400 --> 01:55:44.520]   Do watch live if you can.
[01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:47.600]   If not, please download it after the fact.
[01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:57.120]   We'll make on-demand versions available on all the better podcast platforms or at twit.tv/mbwhappyfatTuesday.
[01:55:57.120 --> 01:56:00.080]   By the way, Marty Groh.
[01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:01.560]   And we'll see you next week.
[01:56:01.560 --> 01:56:03.960]   Now get back to work because break time is over.
[01:56:03.960 --> 01:56:05.520]   Would you like some chocolate dipped fruit?
[01:56:05.520 --> 01:56:20.480]   [Music]
