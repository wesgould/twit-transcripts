[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.680]   multi-touch on Mac OS is that a really good idea or is that a really fantastic idea?
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.220]   We're gonna be complaining about iCloud. I'm not gonna be talking about the adult point in that
[00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.280]   We're not really very happy with iCloud and because of news of this week
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.160]   We've been giving lots of good reasons to renew are not hatred but not likely good of iCloud
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.420]   And then finally we're gonna talk about what would it take for us to switch away from Mac OS?
[00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.520]   Would it actually take a National Guard detachment and a certain amount of plastic explosives?
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:56.040]   I will not reveal the ending but suffice to say that the duck is wearing a hat in the playground
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.240]   I think you know what I mean all this and more coming up next

[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.840]   Although you might want to keep a spreadsheet or something up on your desktop just in case the boss walks by I'm Andy
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.560]   Not go Chicago Sun-time technology columnist substituting for the I'm assuming very very tanned and still
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:46.400]   Lightly drunk Leo report who is enjoying some time in the lower latitudes on the geek crews and probably spending time figuring out
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.680]   How to fix his back after all those hours on an airplane?
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.160]   But we got a great show lined up for you with some of the wonderful
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.400]   Members of what I call my League of substitute heroes that I draw on on those rare times when I get to host
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.400]   But first we have to introduce
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.040]   My fellow weekly host of Mac break weekly Renee Richie from I'm or Renee
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.600]   How is life up in the upper latitudes?
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:15.880]   It is it is excellent Andy as everyone who watches Game of Thrones knows winter has come the wall is very tall and
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.840]   I will be shivering during the show. But everything else is good
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:27.160]   Now is it though is HBO lying to us is like when you go into the cold clams you basically see burly men and heavy fur coats and naked women
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.440]   We cling to your borders for warmth, so it's not it's not quite that bad
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.600]   But yeah, I think vampires should move here because we don't see the Sun for about six six months at a time
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.960]   It's it's overrated. I've been I've seen the Sun, baby
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.760]   It's it's I believe it leave it where it is what I like this time of year
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.640]   But it tends to leave me alone from 33 3 in the afternoon onward
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.640]   But also this week we have some special guests of the senior editor of Mackerel Chris Breen Chris
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.400]   How you know you're in the San Francisco rough general area where life is easy the the surf is high
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.440]   And the guitars are tuned almost automatically is that still the case?
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.800]   That is still the case surface up today the surf report is very positive
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:14.920]   It's a miracle that I'm here today at all except for the fact that I don't surf because I'm not all that great a swimmer
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.080]   But if I were I would not be here
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:23.600]   I'd be out there where the other stooge is waiting for that wave that comes by every 20 minutes or so that you can try to surf on
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:29.360]   Because I am in the Santa Cruz area if you're no good the other surfers will let you know by drowning you
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.800]   That's it's it's a very clean user interface and every every time you're on a podcast
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.520]   I do have to ask you what is the album of the week?
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.080]   probably
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:48.480]   Is right there in the background is Nick Lowe and his cowboy outfit and and I brought that in today because as you know
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.560]   DC DC has come to the iTunes store, but there's a solid chunk of the nicklo catalog missing from iTunes and
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:00.280]   This is part of the period that's missing. It's too bad because the cowboy outfit albums are some of Nick's best
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.920]   Definitely the category of misfit songwriters
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:09.400]   He is but it's a very solid songwriter and Nick is one of my favorite songwriters
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.920]   He's kind of gone into the crooning thing now after
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.800]   Realizing that unlike
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.680]   AC DC and some of these other bands that when they hit their 60s and 70s doing the same stuff they did when they were 23
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:28.040]   Sometimes doesn't work very well. So Nick has decided to write about adult themes not adult themes, but themes for adults and
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.360]   It works out pretty well
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:37.680]   Excellent and running out our cast is Tonya angst editor-in-chief of tidbits publishing Tonya always great to talk to you
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.480]   Hi, it's really nice to be here
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:48.120]   Now you're actually you're you share much the same weather pain as I do because we're both like Northeasterners
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.560]   You know New Englander, but you're both Northeasterners
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:57.280]   That that's absolutely right. We have you know 40 degrees kind of sunny, but the sun's so low
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.920]   It hardly gets over the horizon, you know
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.520]   We're all into squash and apples and pumpkin seeds and things like that right now
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.920]   Yes, you're you're you're most of your time these days to spend mauling things
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.000]   Exactly if we're not mauling food
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:19.640]   We're mulling you know philosophical things that you can only think about when it's not very sunny so you aren't just out surfing
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.140]   You have to go more internal or something
[00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.480]   Yes
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.000]   Well, we got a whole bunch of really cool topics to talk about this time
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.480]   Let's start off with the potpourri category of just roundup of
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.920]   interesting stories and Chris you
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:42.320]   Kind of teased most interesting one of the interesting ones AC DC long been one of the few remaining holdouts from the iTunes catalog
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:48.520]   Big press release saying that you can tire AC DC catalog is now available through iTunes
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.600]   It's got to be think thought of as sort of a
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:07:01.520]   The front man is a man who stomps around stage. He's a septigenarian am I correct dressed as a school in a schoolboy uniform
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:08.400]   Yet treat a demand that we treat him with the dignity accorded with some in artists who does not want his songs to be digital
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:15.760]   Why what what finally broke broke his usual dignity decorum and composure on this topic? Do you think?
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.040]   Well, Andy, there's something in the world called money and
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:24.520]   And when people I'm a freelancer you don't have to explain this concept to me. Oh, okay
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.840]   well back in the day when
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.400]   We had this stuff called gold and you would put it in large amounts
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.640]   And you'd give it to people because it was rare and therefore it was valuable now
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.800]   We printed on paper, which is really worth nothing
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:43.960]   But we say it is and so what they've done is apparently they printed enough of this stuff and put it in large enough boxes and delivered it
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.320]   So the members of AC DC that AC DC has now said ah
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.480]   Well, there seems to be enough in here
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:57.080]   So yes, we would we would more than be happy to abandon our previous stance that people couldn't buy our stuff as
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:01.160]   Songs but instead they'd have to buy them as albums because as you know
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:06.280]   AC DC's work is through composed. I mean, it's the kind of thing that Schubert
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:10.840]   Considered seriously whenever he was creating, you know
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:17.680]   Some of his work and and certainly Mozart was the same way didn't feel that their work should be parsed out in little bits and pieces
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.680]   And just take it around to various courts
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:27.360]   But instead they wanted the entire piece played and that is the kind of integrity that AC DC has until you bring them a large enough
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:33.160]   Box of money at which point that concern seems to go out the window
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:42.440]   So you want us to imagine like a giant like two balance scale with one of those balances the pan containing the dignity of AC DC
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:47.560]   And their rights as an artist and the other being a empty pot and for the past what ten years
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:52.360]   Apple's have been dropping like one gold coin at a time and again the guy in the shorts was saying come on
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.360]   Keep it coming. Keep it still a little more well
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:59.520]   Still still still have integrity still keep it coming too much integrity. They have a new album out too
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.800]   Which just makes a big difference. So I think it was at this point. They said well
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:10.800]   How are people acquiring albums these days? Are they going down to their local top? No, that's gone. How about no, that's gone too. How?
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:18.640]   Damn, who's selling music anymore? Well, it appears to be that it's we could go to Amazon or
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:23.840]   You know, but the thing is that that AC DC's fans are sort of at that demographic
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.840]   That's 60s and 70s who aren't still quite sure how to use Amazon
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.240]   So they're trying to get them into iTunes and so at this point
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:34.960]   They said all right fine if people are gonna buy our new stuff. They really need to get to it
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.960]   And I think I've I've enraged every AC DC fan
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.960]   And
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.800]   There's their their lovely human beings their catalog is perfectly fine
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:50.080]   I've only the only times I've ever been disappointed with them is when I did need that one or two tracks of theirs that I've heard of that
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:56.720]   I'm really that I'm really into wanted to buy them like is that usually the reason why there there are any holdouts whatsoever
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:01.400]   Is it hasn't always been about hey? I saw that the Beatles managed to get a great deal because they held out
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:08.840]   We're as good as the Beatles even though we just completed our three three non-continuous state tour of east of east coast and west
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:12.160]   Coast or is there principle involved here?
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:18.480]   There there actually are of our some artists who hold out for principle for example Garth Brooks
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.120]   Who you know is the guy who?
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.120]   Hang on the author the author you know Chris Peterson's
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:31.720]   Yeah, I got to do this and that no the demand famous for jamming his thumbs into his belt
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:35.000]   Which was a huge look during the 80s
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:43.800]   So he was he was demanding that this his catalog be introduced by eddy q coming on stage with his thumbs in his belt
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.680]   And that would interrupt a whole shirt outside
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:50.080]   You know untouched shirt thing because you know that's how Apple does it these days
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:55.160]   So he he refused to do that so so far Garth Brooks is not in there because he can't get that from Apple
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:11:00.940]   But actually King Crimson which is one of my favorite bands run by a guy named Robert Fripp
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:05.760]   They are not on iTunes and unlikely to be because Fripp is very very
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:10.120]   Concerned about the quality of their music and he wants it marketed a certain way
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:15.080]   He wants the sound quality to be a certain way and this is much like the zappa estate that actually came to
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.120]   iTunes not terribly long ago
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.640]   So yeah, there are some artists
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:24.120]   Just say you know we really want to preserve the quality of our music and the way it's marketed and in case of a
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:30.440]   Wonderful but kind of a niche band like King Crimson Fripp is making enough money and he feels like I don't need to do that
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:35.880]   So yes, there absolutely are artists out there who who feel like they don't want to market their stuff through them
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:41.440]   But increasingly zappa kid rock is just coming on AC DC
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:47.280]   You know Garth if you can get the belt thing working will be there as well. So yeah a lot of it's about money
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.400]   Excellent now
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:56.760]   Everybody's expecting this is the time of year when as people who are known to their families and circles of friends as
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.840]   People who know stuff about Apple and they usually assume that we have everything a year in advance before it's being released
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.480]   So we get all those kind of cool questions
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:08.240]   This is but this is the one time out of the year when we're asked when's a good time to buy a Mac?
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:16.840]   Do they ever go on sale because the day that we're recording this two days before Thanksgiving the black Friday sale is the one time all year when we can say
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:22.480]   Yes, in fact, they might give you knock ten bucks off the price something price of something
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:30.680]   CNET is reporting that there's been some news in that broke in in Australia of all places where
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:36.420]   Well for having likes they're not Americans, but they should have a lot to be thankful for the beaches the beer
[00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.960]   The they're right here. Oh
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:42.880]   Home of AC DC. There you go very close to Weta studio
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:49.480]   So you might see vacationing hobbits also you get to see Leo report and some other people who are there for the past few weeks
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:55.520]   What are we really expecting very much out of the sale? I'll throw open to anybody
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:59.000]   What last year last year that I think it was like what was what was it?
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:05.600]   $50 off of a couple of iPads a hundred dollars off of a couple of specific desktop Macs nothing to be thrilled about
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:09.840]   especially in on a selling day when they're willing to sell you a
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:13.200]   97 inch TV for ten dollars and a half a cheeseburger
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:17.880]   On on that kind of a sale day is it any reason to be lined up in front of an Apple store?
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:23.840]   It's the only time that Apple exactly what you say and it's the only time that Apple ever does an Apple store
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:28.040]   sale and they will take a very small amount of money off of
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:36.320]   Certain products not every product by any stretch of the imagination and even though black Friday is an American thing Apple does it as their only international
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:41.440]   Sales so in Canada and Australia and all these other countries. We're getting black Friday sales
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.640]   We have no idea what black Friday is but it's an Apple sale
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:48.400]   So we'll show up but more interestingly is that competing retailers Apple
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:53.120]   Authorized retailers will typically sell for less than Apple especially the online ones
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:57.440]   So while if you go to an Apple store you will get that ten dollars knocked off your thousand dollar computer
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.040]   If you shop around a little bit you can often find a better deal from a reseller
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:04.040]   Now do you do you celebrate up in Canada?
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:11.400]   We have boxing day the day after Christmas where we put on the pugilism gloves and wait into the stores and try and beat our way to a deal
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:15.360]   So we don't actually have black Friday except Apple does the black Friday sale
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.600]   So everyone is very confused but winding up
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:25.320]   Well some things don't translate it's I should have known because I could see you've got a nice camera there a nice HD camera
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:30.480]   So I can see the big gains of your big black handlebar mustache because for the pugilism you do want to get the old deal timey
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:34.960]   You know, you know, buck the swimming costume the hair real cream down the middle
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:40.800]   I saw a film strip on Canadian culture when I was in fourth grade
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:44.560]   And that's pretty much what they said that they do up there could have been incorrect at the time
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:49.200]   It was a 1963 strip, but I know you've had a couple changes in prime ministers since then so I hope I didn't
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.840]   But I'm getting anything wrong
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:55.840]   Let's see also
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.840]   reports that
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:04.360]   LTE based fourth the fourth generation iPads are finally arriving in the Apple stores not yet available for sale sales
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:09.720]   But they are at least arriving in stores again. I'm just going the idea that maybe they're going to be on sale
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:15.760]   Slash for sale on Friday for black Friday is has anybody like pre-ordered one of these things?
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:23.160]   Silence
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:28.040]   Exactly you have now what was it that made you pull the trigger on this one?
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.000]   I
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.800]   Always get the LTE iPad because I use them for tethering and that it just lasts 24 hours
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.800]   It's the best tethering device I've ever had
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:42.920]   So I ordered both the iPad 4 and the iPad mini with LTE and the iPad 4 I just yesterday got the shipping
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:49.960]   Notification saying would arrive late November. I still haven't gotten one for the iPad mini and I ordered within minutes of it going live
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:53.000]   So I'm guessing they're still struggling to get those things out
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:01.400]   Yeah, it seems though. There really is that gap between the people who are really really into iPad
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:09.280]   They really really want to get the hot hardware, but they know that the LTE model with the iPad mini as well as going to be delayed about a month
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:14.400]   So there's always that one month period in which sort of the neophytes who just wanted an iPad
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:18.320]   I bought the Wi-Fi as soon as available are being asked by these experts like
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:24.800]   Can I could it kind of run a benchmark on your iPad? Can I hold your iPad for I heard it was a little bit heavier than the old one?
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.920]   Gosh, I want an iPad for
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:30.040]   It's nice to have a little bit of equity and balance, isn't there? I
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.320]   Bought the Wi-Fi ones I needed to get a review up on time
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:37.360]   But then I gifted it to a family member and I'm waiting on the LTE version
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:41.440]   Can I be your family member Renee? Yeah, you already are
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:47.040]   And you are like a regular co-host, so now we're all part of the Twit family
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.680]   Absolutely, you're next on the list
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:54.880]   Excellent. It's either this or I'll sleep on your sofa for four days and then extend that to four weeks
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:58.640]   But until until the heat goes down back in my place
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.160]   other really good news
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:10.520]   Speaking of things heating up more companies that are famous for their maps are trying to get their maps into the iOS app store to make up for
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:19.200]   perceived and real deficiencies in iOS 6 is built in maps app Nokia released here maps which I installed yesterday
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:25.560]   I think and really the best way to describe it and the best way to compliment it and the best way to
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:32.800]   To promote it is to say essentially gives you back everything that you lost from the iOS 5 maps app
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.600]   So you get scrolling maps you can download
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:40.000]   Manually map sections into into the device so you can use it offline
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:46.600]   It will give you route directions. It would also give you walking directions and subway transit directions. It includes
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.960]   traffic as well
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:54.880]   This is also in the heels of more information that Google is working harder and harder on getting their own Google maps app
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:58.480]   iOS native and ready for app store deployment
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:01.400]   I'm wondering if
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:09.680]   Of all the things that went wrong with the deployment of apples maps app the worst thing that they did was to open the door
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:17.400]   So wide to all of these competitors because you don't want if you're making a mobile device and making an operating system for that mobile device
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:21.840]   You really don't want anybody else to be using a different photo service
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:28.480]   You don't and you don't want people to be using things like a different map service because that's one of the most forward facing
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:37.040]   user-centric apps that they use in a mobile device and I just I'm hoping that this doesn't turn into a thing where maps becomes the
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:40.040]   built-in maps app becomes sort of like the third string or just
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:45.040]   One of three that are available and if you put six iPhones on a dinner table when you're going out to eat
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:48.200]   You might find a complete spectrum of different mapping solutions
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:56.840]   And do you think that that's going to be kind of a problem going forward Chris or does Apple have a chance to just keep getting the maps app better and
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:03.640]   Take sort of the Internet Explorer approach where the fact of this thing is pre-installed and all devices means it's going to be the de facto
[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:06.160]   Wonderful app that everybody wants to use
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:12.200]   You know I conducted an experiment this morning and I looked at the number of followers that John Gruber has and so I'm
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:16.360]   Decided that that is the pool and that's about 250,000 people
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:21.560]   So these are the people that are really in a care about it and are the ones that are going to experiment with different maps apps
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:26.400]   I think Apple has sold about 70 trillion iOS devices
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:32.480]   Those people aren't going to care. They're going to get maps on there and say I don't even know that there's another maps app
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.760]   I don't care this look I tap this and I get a map
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:38.760]   That's what I wanted right so I don't think that they know that what they're missing for most for the most part
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:42.440]   I think those people that are picking up iOS devices get them and they use a
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:47.080]   Of a subset of their features and are happy with the features that come with it
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:50.960]   So yes among us in that 250,000 person pool
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:56.880]   It will make a difference, but I think long term and I have to suspect that Apple thinks this as well that
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:01.520]   Okay, so the next version of maps is going to have transit directions
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:04.400]   And it will have walking directions and they'll give you something
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.400]   Hopefully like Street View because people have been missing that as well
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:12.880]   I like here as as well, but I don't see that my mother is sister or
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:16.280]   Friends that are using iOS devices are going to jump on it say ah
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:21.800]   I haven't had transit directions. How was I supposed to survive on this thing?
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:27.640]   There are people that that's a key feature for but the general user. I don't think so so I think Apple's probably fine
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.840]   Has everybody used that that app yet?
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:36.160]   I thought I thought it was a nice app and I liked the having restored that those missing functions
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:42.800]   But it's definitely a port of something that was definitely not born anywhere in the Cupertino school district
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:48.040]   Yeah, I find those little tabs at the bottom kind of distracting I
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.080]   Understand why they're doing it
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:56.520]   but for those who haven't used it if you select a destination that shows you what's nearby and you can make that go away but
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:02.680]   Most of the time I don't care about what's about me if I need that I'll go to Yelp or go to something else
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:06.800]   So I think that they've taken up a little too much real estate for that kind of
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:12.280]   Functionality, I'd like it to be something I can optionally pull up and and show for just a bit and then have it disappear
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:15.480]   I had playing with it this morning
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:21.320]   I tried playing with it most of the morning and trying it with Apple Maps and trying it with the old Google powered maps on an older device
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:23.600]   And it's really interesting first of all
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:27.320]   I think they deserve a lot of credit for shipping while Google is like oh Apple digital maps
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:32.120]   We're worried they want to prove it and just Nokia just put out a press release and then put out an app
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:35.720]   It's nowhere near as fully featured as the windows 8 version of Nokia maps
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:39.960]   I don't think anyone expected it to be but it's a little bit oddly featured to for example
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:44.600]   There is turn-by-turn voice direction for walking but not for driving and arguably
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:48.160]   Thriving is much more valuable to have voice direction for than walking
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.320]   But the transit stuff was pretty good
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:53.680]   It was as accurate as the other maps when I tried it in my local area
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:57.760]   And it's not as sexy as Apple Maps, but I think it's it's the utility is all there
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.240]   Yeah
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:07.040]   As I happened I spent yesterday driving around Boston with Nokia's vice president who does like them the most of the mapping initiatives
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:11.880]   And he's also very involved in Navtech and explained to me how
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:18.160]   Every time I talk to somebody who works on maps for any different platform. I'm always amazed at how
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:26.320]   Delegate that balances between the analog features and the digital features because it's one thing to make sure that you can outfit a car
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:30.080]   With all these lydars and all these cameras and all these sensors on the wheels to map out
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:36.720]   Where all the roads are and where the traffic signs are but at some point if you want to make it useful you have to figure out how to?
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:40.960]   Get the greater sense of what that map information is telling you
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:44.200]   Later on as we're having coffee later on he was telling me about how
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:50.680]   Some things like hospitals are so important that they don't trust just the street information
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:55.920]   They don't trust any of the sources that they get they actually send a send someone down to that hospital to make sure that it's there
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:23:01.820]   That it accepts patients and not only that but they also make sure that they map where the entrance to the emergency room is because
[00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:05.820]   Nokia's map data is also provided to car in car -
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:11.080]   Navigation system so if they press that button on that user interface it says take me to a hospital right now
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.360]   They don't want to send people to the service entrance
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:15.960]   So I mean Nokia is kind of a stalking horse
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:20.520]   I think not people don't understand how much they have invested and involved in maps
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:24.880]   And so once we have it's it feels like we have three different
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.960]   Highly motivated companies here. We have Google Maps that is
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:36.640]   That could you could say that they were the people who first made the dumb investment in maps back when investing in mapping was just a dumb thing
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:38.440]   That was not going to turn to a profitable product
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:42.920]   You have Nokia that's been in this business sort of in a quiet way for years and years and years
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:48.440]   And I've got Apple that now has eight things that they need to that they want to prove and making things good
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:52.760]   I mean it's still it's still the great maps is still the prettiest mapping app out there
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:56.560]   It's still the one that if I'm plopped down in the middle of a strange city
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:59.760]   And I want to get a sense of where I am in that city and how to get from A to B
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:04.480]   I'm certainly not gonna be opening the Nokia app. It's certainly gonna it's certainly gonna be maps
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:10.960]   So I've this is one area in which I'm really hoping that it becomes personal and spiteful between the three of them
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:14.960]   And everybody's trying to deliver more and better features with each passing week
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.640]   Let's see
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:26.000]   Next let's see it's interesting thing. We're a flip board, which is that wonderful newsreader app that I'm sure everybody uses for for iOS
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.760]   New little twist. They've done a deal with Apple
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:35.880]   That they have the app can give you sections based on flip board based on Twitter based on curated feeds that they provide themselves
[00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:39.000]   Now Apple is going to be providing an iBooks section
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.920]   Which you would hope would be like Kindle previews where you can where will automatically give you the first
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:51.800]   Couple of chapters of every book that's interesting. It's more of an advertising thing where the flip board panel will give you the
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:58.840]   Cover the book and you'll also get to see sort of like descriptive information and all this it's more of a discovery tool than a reading tool
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:02.040]   But it's interesting that Apple is making that sort of
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:04.880]   out-of-body
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:07.280]   Insertion into into into an outside app
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:12.960]   The tawny is this what a company even Apple has to do if they're trying to sell books and introduce people to
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.640]   $30 hard covers that they hadn't heard of before I
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:21.000]   Thought the whole thing was just really unexpected. I was not expecting
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.960]   The Apple would be flexible enough to even consider something like this and I did
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:29.720]   update my copy of flip books and take a quick look and
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:36.880]   Naturally, of course what looked immediately at the computer book section to see what books I had helped work on or someone who I knew had written
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.880]   you know, what was there and
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:41.960]   You know, I think if I had a referee for one second
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:48.080]   We have multiple book authors here. We all do exactly that as soon as we go into any bookstore even a digital one
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:51.840]   We have to see where our books have been shelled. Oh, absolutely
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:55.520]   It's it's you you look to see if your book is there and then you kind of squint
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:58.440]   So if there's some horrible typo on the cover, you don't know this
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:03.280]   So I thought it was just completely unexpected
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:11.160]   Speaking as actually a publisher, which is more my current role. It doesn't seem like the iBook store is a very
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:15.840]   I don't know flexible turn on a dime kind of operation and
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:21.080]   It was surprising to me that the flip book people had managed to make this deal
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.160]   I think it's kind of interesting
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:29.000]   I wonder how many people reading flip book will kind of understand when they see the little iBooks logo
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.720]   You know exactly what they're doing
[00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:38.520]   You know what how they're interacting and then of course as a publisher. I also noticed that
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:46.280]   The various publishers are having varying levels of success with getting their book descriptions to show up
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:51.080]   With nice formatting and I certainly hope that's something that will improve
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:56.360]   Now is discoverability a solvable problem. I mean I was
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:27:02.160]   Yesterday happened to be the first time I was in a real bricks and mortar comic book shop in like three or four weeks
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:08.240]   And I wound up coming out with a lot of books because it was my I buy most of my books from komexology
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.720]   But in komexology you can't take it off the shelf
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:14.960]   Flip through every single page just to see if there's things are leaping out at you
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:17.280]   You don't get to it's more difficult to really
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:21.600]   Take that five-minute walk to the store and just look for book covers that are interesting to you
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:26.000]   I mean, how do publishers solve that problem of introducing new content to people
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.440]   Uh when there's a they they know there must be one good book in there
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:34.000]   That's just a case of making sure they get their eyeballs on it. I think it's a huge problem
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   And I don't think anybody really has a great answer. I mean the nice thing for a publisher with
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.120]   A real bookstore, you know back in the day
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:50.240]   Was you could as a publisher identify some books or authors that you thought had the potential to be very successful
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:54.560]   And you would do things like buy a position on the end of an aisle
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:57.440]   um, so your book could could be more featured or
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.880]   Uh, your author would go around to bookstores barns and noble
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:05.440]   uh borders whatever and your author would actually you know sign books and have
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:12.080]   Uh, you know events where your author could appear and and those things still happen and sometimes they happen online
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.760]   Um, but it does seem that the ability to sell a book
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:23.040]   You know sort of and to have it interact with the real world where you get some kind of control over the presentation of the book
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:25.440]   Is slipping away?
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:28.320]   When when a publisher is dealing with selling online
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:35.920]   Pretty much the main way that the publisher has any means at all of conveying anything about the tone of the book or
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:40.560]   Um, the style of the publisher is in the tiny little thumbnail
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.960]   That is used to show the books cover
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:49.120]   That's kind of it and then it just kind of goes out there into the online universe and you hope you hope the cover
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:51.600]   You know appears
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:58.320]   With the right proportions, so it's not you know squished or wider or something and and hopefully some of the metadata that describes the book goes with it
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:02.640]   But I think discoverability is a huge problem for for publishers
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:08.000]   It kind of levels the playing field in some ways because very small publishers can look
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:15.920]   Just as uh impressive is very large publishers, but with so many people wanting to write and publish books
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:19.280]   Um, it can make it more difficult
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:25.520]   For any individual person or publisher to draw attention to what they're doing because there's no
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:31.120]   There's not a lot of signaling that you can use to signal that this is important or at least, you know
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:33.120]   This has a lot of money behind it
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.200]   You know what?
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:38.800]   I wouldn't be too disappointed if one of my books were they're in flip board. It's like
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:44.160]   It's it's all it's often a little bit heartbreaking when you spend like three to six or seven months
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:48.880]   Writing a book and then people ask so if you got a new book out said yeah, it's been available for six weeks
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:51.840]   And they tried to promote it, but I did a good job on it
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:54.960]   Um, it's really nice that apples are pushing
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:58.320]   I think it's really nice that apples not waiting for people to go to the iBook store though
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:03.120]   And it's actually taking that content to where people already are which is in the flip book and flip board
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:08.480]   Maybe uh other apps that people go to for news and stuff like that will be a place where apple continues to
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:12.640]   To push it and i'm glad they're not doing the traditional thing where we sit in the iBook store and we wait for you
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:15.120]   Um, it's kind of nice to see them putting it out there
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:21.040]   Is that is is that unusual though? I mean, I think one of the one of the long time complaints
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:27.040]   A lot of people have had about other content in the in the iTune store is that it's hard to it's not as easy to
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:30.960]   independently recommend music and music and apps
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:35.040]   And tv shows and other content. There's a share link and there's a gift link
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:40.240]   But it's not as though it's easy for me to create let's say a storefront whose job it is that
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:46.000]   My own storefront that's nothing but recommendations of content you can buy through the through through these stores
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.040]   It just seems like this is sort of the first time apple has said we are going to actually
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:53.600]   Uh go to some trouble
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:58.960]   To give our store a presence and somebody else's app an app that we don't control christ if you ever seen that
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:05.760]   Ping what about the glorious ping? Well, we all we all we all know about ping, but i'm saying a second success
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:08.320]   Ah, right
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:12.880]   That uh, it may have been that after the disaster that was ping
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:18.880]   Maybe apple gathered together at least the people the great minds behind all this just like, you know
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.760]   We don't do this very well and we need to
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:29.360]   Get out of our little universe that we don't do very well and find other ways to expose people to this kind of content
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:31.120]   particularly when
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:37.680]   You have an outfit like amazon that uses your buying history and is able to recommend things to you
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:44.480]   So at least as a customer the discovery on amazon is really good because they're very smart about what they push at you
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:50.960]   So far apple doesn't seem to be very good at that they've they sort of tried that through ping and it was terrible
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:54.000]   Um, i'm glad to see that they are venturing out now
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:00.160]   And I would like to see them take customer data if I allow them to and push recommendations at me
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:04.400]   Their genius feature works pretty well within itunes and within some of the ios apps
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:10.480]   So bring that kind of capability shovel that out to a another app rather than reinventing the wheel
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:14.160]   But do things like flip board where people are custom to using it
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:18.880]   They can flip through here see the kind of customer recommendations that a genius feature might offer
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:25.520]   Share that data with the other application and you're going to drive traffic back to the i-book store or to itunes or to other things like that
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:28.080]   So discoverability is so difficult
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:34.640]   But having that customer data is key and I think apple really needs to try to leverage that a little better than they have so far
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:41.680]   And do you remember randy that they banned a bunch of well they didn't ban but they strongly suggested that people don't make clones of the app store in the app store
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:47.040]   But try to find different ways of displaying and discovering content and maybe that preface this a little bit
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:56.960]   Yeah, I mean it's I kind of feel as though apple is coming to the realization that they use the last of their magic marketing beans on the ipad
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:04.080]   And so now if they can't they can't just simply say here is our non non compatible completely self-contained social media service
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:09.440]   Now wait, wait, don't please don't everybody rush it once let our staff stay to the side so we don't get trampled
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:13.600]   Anybody where we're safe to the sides now. Thank you for waiting
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:17.200]   Rickets rickets got punch and pie
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:20.080]   It's free beer
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:26.240]   Uh, one last thing before we take a break, uh am using blunder apple made on their official
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:30.480]   Official tech specs pad sheet for the for the ipad
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:35.280]   They were supposed to on the dimensions of the thing they were supposed to say that it was
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:41.760]   0.37 inches thick. They said it was actually 0.37 millimeters thick
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:49.120]   Uh, and it has since been fixed but not before everybody was able to screenshot it have a good laugh at it expense and now it's our turn
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:51.280]   uh
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:53.280]   Because here's a list of things that are
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:59.200]   That are about a third of a millimeter. That is the size of one pixel on a standard standard CRT
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:06.800]   Uh, a if you take a third of a millimeter slice of a mouse brain according to a biologist that contains just 20 layers of neurons
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:13.440]   Uh limestone is composed of the corpses of single-celled organisms each of which are about a third of a millimeter thick
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:19.440]   Uh porcelain teeth veneers known to some I will not say who of apple senior statins senior executive team
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:26.560]   Also one third to one half of a millimeter the smallest spider in the world is the patu diga spider
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:29.040]   Anybody want to take a guess as to where that spider can be found
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:33.280]   Yes for email show notes. It's in columbia
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:37.520]   Uh, it's body the male of a species is just a third of a millimeter long
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:44.880]   Uh human hair if it's in no, I learned as I was researching this the human hair has a resting phase and a growth phase and a resting space
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:45.840]   phase
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:49.840]   As the uh as the name implies, it's not actually growing much at all in a growth phase
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:52.800]   It grows about a third of a millimeter per day
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:56.480]   But the now we've had a bit of fun, but now here's the operative question
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:03.280]   Since they actually said that the ipad 4 is about of a third of a millimeter on their official company site
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:10.400]   And this has been well documented. Can we create a class action suit to force them to build a version of the ipad?
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:14.480]   For and sell it to us for $499 that is one third of a millimeter thick
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:15.920]   Uh
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:19.360]   Chris we got to go to you because you are the ipad ipad ios expert
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:26.960]   Right. Well the fact is this was not a mistake. It was a leak and so um, you know ipad 5 clearly
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:31.040]   It's going to be one third of a millimeter thin
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:38.240]   I know I know I know I know this is the last time i'm going to be given advanced product, but here is the new
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:40.400]   ipad 4
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:43.840]   I don't know if you can i'm going to try this. I can't really zoom it in but i'm holding it on edge here
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:49.200]   But oh man and also the responsiveness. It's also very very light is the thing. Yeah of
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:52.240]   Oh
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:57.600]   I just dropped it. I just dropped it. Okay. We're gonna we're gonna go. We're gonna take a break while I look for my ioh crap
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:59.520]   It's just it was a loan or two
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:03.760]   Um, we're gonna take a break leo loport has an important message from our friends

[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.560]   but still

[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:20.240]   I just I love this idea. So play similar music
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:24.800]   And uh if you hear something you like in your mp3 player

[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:36.800]   95 mac has some reports about mac o s 10.9
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:40.800]   Uh, not anywhere close to being released to developers yet
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:46.480]   But they they they say that they have talked to people who have had their hands on a pre pre pre pre pre pre release
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:51.040]   Development edition and they claim that it might include serie on the desktop
[00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:55.360]   And it's incorporated much the same way that it's incorporated in ios 6
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:59.360]   They also claim to believe that or they believe to claim
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:03.680]   That the maps is going to be coming to the desktop with mac OS 10.9
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:08.720]   They don't mention anything like an actual version of the maps app coming for mac OS
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:13.280]   But they do mention something akin to the map kit resource available for developers
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:18.720]   So that if a developer wants to include maps and maps maps data inside a desktop app
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:21.360]   They can just simply call these these apis
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:24.400]   And of course the apple does not yet create
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:27.040]   Desktop machines or laptops that have gps in them
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:32.880]   But remember that they all the find my mac features they do rely on network information to get a pretty good fix on where you are
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:34.880]   So it's not so they'll be starting from zero
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:36.240]   um
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:42.000]   Interesting ideas where it's it's still probably way too early to even talk about what 10.9 is going to contain
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:43.760]   uh, but
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:47.680]   The thing that sort of leapt out at me about all this stuff is that maps and serie
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:50.560]   They're both really really keyboard phobic
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:55.600]   Keyboard hostile sort of apps. It's the sort of apps that you have
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:40:00.160]   That that either are enabled by having a big flat multi touch glass screen in front of you
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:04.400]   Or they allow you to just completely ignore the fact that you have a keyboard
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:05.360]   I mean
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:09.360]   If i've got a keyboard in front of me and on a desktop and I have a search
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:13.840]   Dialogue why would I necessarily want to have to reach out?
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:16.800]   Press a button on the keyboard take my hand off that keyboard
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:23.360]   And then say something that serie might then misinterpret when I could simply type that same sentence and get greater accuracy
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:29.440]   Um, Renee if you you were a little bit closer to the ground on things inside of apple then I know that I am
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:36.720]   Uh, what do you think about these features for 10.9? Is that makes sense to you that we're gonna see those in the next version of uh, the o s
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:43.840]   Yeah, I mean apple started that with back to the mac that event they had about two years ago when they started talking about how
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:50.000]   Things they developed for ios like quick time x would have value on uh, o s 10 and then mountain line
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:55.120]   Only increased that by making all the apps that you're giving them the same names as their ios counterpart
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:58.960]   So instead of address book you have contacts and instead of ical you have calendars
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:05.200]   And I think that the next version is just going to continue that so they'll still have their own underpinnings their own architecture
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:11.040]   They won't be the same o s yet but the interface and the way that we relate to them will become similar
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:14.880]   Uh, for example right now with ios maps you can share location
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:19.920]   But that goes to a mac and apple has no web map component the way google does
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:22.160]   So it makes it a challenge what do you do to resolve?
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:28.560]   Shared location when you're running a mac and having uh, ios 6 style maps on the mac would make that
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:31.920]   You know very sorry windows users, but that would make it very easy
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:37.600]   For mac people to share a location back and forth and syri if you listen to the way apple talks about it
[00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:41.440]   It's almost like the natural language interface and it's not there yet
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:44.800]   It's the apple one or the lisa not really the apple two or the mac yet
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:48.960]   But it's the the next sort of interface where apple gets these headless
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:55.440]   applications and a lot of the stuff that they've been doing with both ios and macos things like
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:56.720]   um
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:42:01.840]   splitting springboard and springboard and backboard and porting over x pc to ios
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:04.560]   i think we'll let apple do this kind of
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:07.200]   communication and
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:12.320]   Almost invisible applications that's going to make using a mac even with you have a keyboard or no keyboard
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:15.040]   Just much more powerful in the next year
[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:22.480]   Yeah, but i i do think that if they're looking to bring the os for the desktop os forward
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:30.400]   Uh, i've never been a fan of the idea that apples has a plan to get rid of macos and infuse their mobile and their desktop operating system
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:32.400]   The same thing at the same time
[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:38.240]   We're we're kids are growing up in a world in which they expect computers to have a touchscreen on them and
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:43.280]   The so i can't tell you how many times when i've been using my iphone or my ipad for a couple hours
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:47.360]   And then i switched to my my notebook and of course i reached out to the screen to tap something at oh wait
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:49.600]   This is i need to do the trackpad for that sort of thing
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:52.240]   I mean i i really have been turned around
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:56.000]   From a couple of years ago when i think was during a steve jobs keynote
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:43:02.320]   He was saying that uh, we have looked into so many ways of integrating touch screens into the mac
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:05.760]   But we know that this is not a touch interface
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:12.080]   It's a natural progression that when i think when he was rolling out the ipad he was talking about how it does it doesn't belong on desktop operating systems
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:15.120]   i've kind of come around on that though because uh
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:17.520]   once you once
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:24.320]   There there is the commercial now for a bunch of windows 8 devices that uh uses the the heavily mocked and maybe justly so
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:26.720]   Uh a windows 8
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:31.120]   Desktop machine from i think sony that's a 22 inch desktop computer
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:35.840]   Uh, but it has a kickstand that kind of can collapse so that if you want to actually put it on an easel
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:37.040]   You can put it on an easel
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:41.120]   So it's fun to make make a make a joke about this being the 22 inch ipad
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:45.760]   But then you hand this you put this within on the table in front of a kid
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:47.440]   And they want to put their handprints on it
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:50.720]   They want to draw with it on the screen and when you have it on an easel
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:53.840]   That's next to your next year next to your sofa
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:57.840]   You do want to use it to control your tv and to look things up on imdb
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:00.560]   Am I just kind of nuts here or
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:07.600]   Would is there a way to put multi-touch into macOS that would make it a much much better and much more familiar experience for regular consumers?
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:11.520]   I'm the same as you andi i i did i had the same thought, you know
[00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:15.760]   Wouldn't be a good experience, but the more you get used to the disintermediation of ios
[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:18.400]   There's no keyboard to get in your way. There's no trackpad to get in your way
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:25.280]   Is almost one-to-one manipulation. It's like finger painting with your productivity. You're touching the interface. You're touching the software
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:30.080]   That's where you that's how you think of your interaction with the computer and it's it's not it
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:37.840]   Another thing to keep in mind is that more people are setting up their desks so that they can use a desktop computer
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:42.800]   But they're standing and when you're standing it's a much more ergonomically sensibles
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:49.600]   Set up for using your finger right on the screen. I think that's something that maybe i recall when Steve Jobs
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:56.400]   Was talking about apple did research and they felt that it wasn't a good ergonomics setup to have a touch screen on a laptop
[00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:00.400]   And of course he could have just been saying that to sort of distract us
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:07.520]   But i think also they might not have been considering the standing the standing desk and i think it would be fabulous at the standing desk
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:11.280]   Yeah
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:13.440]   I think that apple is engaged in them
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:18.320]   You know they're talking about apple not doing they think terribly disruptive right now and I think they actually they are
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:22.880]   I think they're changing the way we interact with our devices and with our information
[00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:26.960]   And I think one of the things they've done is gone back to ground zero and and thought well
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:31.040]   Let's let's rethink the whole way that we interact with these devices. So for example
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:36.560]   Using one of these things is kind of stupid if you've ever seen a four-year-old use a computing device
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:41.200]   You show them an iphone or an ipad and they're all over it and they've got it down in about 10 minutes
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:47.200]   You then put them in front of a computer with a mouse and they've got this level of abstraction where they say what i'm supposed to move this in order for this
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:54.320]   It's like the crank machines at the carnival, you know where you're trying to manipulate the joystick and get the little fuzzy animal out of it
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:57.120]   Which you never can get because it's it's rigged just so you know
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:02.400]   Um, but you can't get this inside of but it's it's a totally stupid way to interact with stuff
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:04.560]   We're used to it because we've been doing it forever
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:10.320]   But you don't have to touch is much more natural so remove that level of abstraction
[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:13.200]   And now you're touching things and that makes sense
[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:17.840]   So I do think that this is I mean, I hope this is a thought out effort on their part
[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:20.640]   That they've got the idea that five years from now
[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:24.800]   It's all going to be about touch and we're not going to be doing these abstract things instead
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:30.560]   We're actually be touching our data and moving it around and so yeah, I think that's kind of where all this is going
[00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:37.200]   If I could steal a page from uh, um guy english's notebook and he writes a very lot of really intelligent stuff about this
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:44.320]   Uh touch doesn't have to actually be physical touch and there was a lot of concern that you know, oh s 10 unlike ios is not optimized for touch
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:49.120]   There's no 44 pixel. Sorry 44 point touch targets a lot of the controls are small, but
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:52.160]   Uh natural language doesn't just have to be syri
[00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:53.440]   Um
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:58.160]   I know andy you speak to a lot of the same navigation people that I do and they originally said they didn't leave microphones on listening
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:03.680]   For you to talk all the time because of battery concerns, but now max are plugged in where they have really big batteries
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:10.720]   And not only could you keep a microphone plugged on so I can just you know that famous scotty line city computer and have it answer me
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:12.960]   But I can start using gestures in the air
[00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:17.280]   We have cameras and all of our max and when you get connect style gesture recognition
[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:26.000]   I no longer have to be directly touching a screen to manipulate objects, but I can still have the same almost tactile manipulation from a little bit of a distance
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:31.040]   We're already we're already seeing some of the problems that microsoft is having
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:35.440]   Trying to get all their users to understand that we're trying to give you something new to play with that
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:37.440]   We think is going to make the platform better
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:43.200]   Um, I I've always been disappointed that natural language even when you just simply type it out
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:48.240]   Uh, hasn't been embraced as widely as it really should be because I do want to create appointments by saying
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:55.360]   Schedule lunch with debbie a week from tuesday at the same place I had lunch with her last time and include a note to the last microsoft word document
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:59.200]   We discussed and have it be able to do the right searches to sort of parse that out
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:03.120]   I'm trying to figure out how many leaps it would take to get people to suddenly
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:10.480]   Both disagree on what the air gestures are going to be in order to in order to you know make things happen
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:17.280]   And then decide that they actually would prefer to do that as a learn how to you make those gestures as opposed to somebody saying
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:24.560]   Yeah, I mean you can sort of imagine like all the snarky comments. Yeah, you know what command option l wow
[00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:28.960]   That really wore me out. Thanks so much apple for making things simpler for me
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:32.480]   I mean apple does apple does have an advantage
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:35.360]   kind of an almost a disadvantage because
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:41.920]   Microsoft doesn't have to didn't have to bring everybody on board all at once because they usually are at least two years behind
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:49.280]   Where their users want to go? I mean it was only recently that xp stop being windows xp stop being the most popular i bring system out there
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:54.720]   Microsoft mike mak everybody's on the same page on the same drum beat by apples design
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:49:00.640]   So if they were to do something major to disrupt how people normally use their max and people didn't like that
[00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:05.920]   That could be a really bad thing. Don't you think but look who their their future customers are
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:07.040]   They're not mak users
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:10.720]   They're people that are coming up with iOS devices and so where we may
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:16.400]   Dislike some of the stuff that they've done with malion and some of these very iOS sort of features
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:19.760]   Those people have started out with an ipad or an iphone
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:23.360]   Run over to a mac and say oh, I know what that is launchpad
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:26.720]   I totally get that where the rest of us will go. Why would you launch things that way?
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:29.680]   That's clumsiest way you could possibly do it because i'm used to it
[00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:34.960]   So I think apple is looking forward and saying no our customer base really did start out with this interface
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:39.280]   And we're going to integrate as much of that stuff that we can so that they're familiar when they get in here
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:41.280]   And we're going to continue moving in that direction
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:46.480]   And I don't think that it has to be one or the other I would be very surprised if it was so
[00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:50.400]   Jester driven that people who are accustomed to keyboard shortcuts or
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:53.920]   You know menus or whatever they want to do that it still wouldn't work
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:57.920]   I don't see there's think there's any reason why you couldn't still have a mouse or trackpad working
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:05.040]   And also that's one of the limitations of the ipad if you're trying to make this $500 or my case
[00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:07.120]   $800 computer
[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:08.880]   Do pull its weight it's
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:13.520]   There are times when I really do want to reach out and touch the screen instead of using the keyboard
[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:18.080]   But there are times when I just want to boldface something by hitting two keys on my keyboard instead of having to
[00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:23.360]   Hit this little tiny little touch target in the middle of the screen. I wish they would work on that just a little tiny bit
[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:30.960]   But but but that that is an excellent point. I mean where we always want things to what's christmas the old saying that
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:39.680]   Whatever music you were listening to add it as a teenager will define what you think of as good music for the rest of your life
[00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:46.320]   And maybe it's the same thing going on with computer operating systems and interfaces because I grew up with the macho with i'm sorry
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:48.800]   I pre grew up with the apple to e
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:54.640]   But like for my first big boy computer defined as maybe age 14 15 onward
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:59.600]   Was a you know it was a mouse and a screen and that is the most natural way for me to use things
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:03.280]   Uh, I think I adapted nicely to multi touch but at the same time
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:08.480]   I still instinctively think that speed and power means keyboards and command shortcuts
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:15.760]   So I mean how how how long do people have to before this age of people dies out and lets the revolution
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:18.080]   Take control of the of the command center
[00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:23.520]   Yeah, I think that's happening. I mean if you observe again, I have looked at my daughter use this stuff
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:27.440]   And touch is so natural to her and speech would be as well
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:29.680]   And whereas this is clumsy
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:35.920]   Using a keyboard is clumsy to her and using a mouse is clumsy for so I do think that apple if it's smart and so far
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:38.080]   It's demonstrated that it generally is
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:40.080]   Is really say oh, okay fine
[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:46.000]   We're we're sort of like the republican party. We've got you know old white people that are going to die out and that'll be it for us
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.400]   Um
[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:50.560]   Sorry now i've now i've angered them
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:55.680]   Was was there like a three-letter acronym for like a m
[00:51:55.680 --> 00:52:03.040]   K m m i k for like mouse icon menu interfaces as generic
[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:08.960]   So now we're now we're going to talk about that as the ola on the old the owm the old white man interface
[00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:11.840]   Right
[00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:13.360]   They're really thinking
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:16.000]   Okay, so where is what's going to happen in the future?
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:19.200]   We've got the device we've got this under our belts
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:22.320]   We could continue to do things the way we happen doing it
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:26.160]   But really this this is the direction we need to go because it is more natural
[00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:30.640]   And and part of the evidence is that you see that microsoft started to do it, which I think
[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:35.680]   demonstrates like oh, this is a trend because they finally caught up a couple of years later
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:40.160]   Well another another part of it also is
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:42.640]   um
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:45.600]   Trying to help more people be able to use the computer so
[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:52.320]   Even back in the day when old older people were older now guy or girl used the max
[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:58.320]   Um, we spent a lot of time with the menus on the menu bar and the keyboard shortcuts listed there
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:04.960]   And we actually thought it was interesting to read tips that lit us on to special keyboard shortcuts that weren't in the menus
[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:09.280]   I don't think anybody does that anymore because for the most part
[00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:14.240]   What where we look at our applications to figure how to get things done is on toolbars
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:18.640]   Or on little doohickey controls that are are grouped right around the edge of the monitor
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:22.080]   So the whole menu and keyboard shortcut thing
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:29.200]   I would argue is is already old and just speaking personally. I used to be a total keyboard shortcut girl
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:32.400]   I mean, oh my god. I was all over them, but um
[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:39.600]   Since I had my son almost 14 years ago and went through the whole lack of sleep thing and now the working mom thing
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:45.120]   It's like my brain can only hold so much and a lot of those keyboard shortcuts. They're not in my brain anymore
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:50.080]   So I'm myself have moved forward. I'm not saying it's a good thing because I think it's sort of a stupid thing
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:56.080]   But I've moved forward and I'm much more dependent on the user interface and I bet Andy and Chris that you guys actually are too
[00:53:56.080 --> 00:54:04.800]   Um, and so I think it's just kind of a natural evolution away from using the written language and asking people to memorize a lot of
[00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:12.800]   Information to more of a situation or what you need to know just appears in front of you in a somewhat more visual or graphical way
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:20.560]   Well, there's there's actually a good example of that. I'm starting to wonder if discoverability is as big of an issue as
[00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:28.080]   I and a lot of other people used to make it out to be I definitely resisted the full the first time that I encountered pulled a refresh in an ios app
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:33.680]   I didn't hate it. I thought it was a good way to hide the refresh button at the same time
[00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:37.920]   I was wondering well who's gonna just some are people gonna just sort of accidentally find it and if they don't
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:45.280]   How many times are they gonna drill through like the the one tap button interfaces to try to find the refresh button if they don't find it
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:47.360]   And now it just seems like the most natural thing ever
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:54.160]   It seems like some of the alchemy of developing a really great app no matter what platform you're running it for is to figure out ways of
[00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:56.160]   Hiding
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:55:01.440]   Interfaces now it's sort of like how the way a mom would like hide spinach inside of brownie to trick people into
[00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:05.120]   Having having power features that they otherwise would be repulsed by
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:11.440]   I gave both my little godchildren one is four years old and one is seven year old
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:17.200]   I gave them both the brand new ipod touch because they like taking pictures and syria became their new best friend
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:22.000]   They they the older one can write of course younger one has no ability to write but he can talk to it
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:26.320]   He thinks it's his friend need to ask them to launch apps for him to do different things for him
[00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:31.280]   And it's it's exactly what tanya said it is my mother uses the ipad to as her principal computer now
[00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:35.600]   She finds it way more accessible and way less intimidating than her iMac even
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:40.240]   Because she didn't grow up with computers and my godchildren are one end my mom at the other end
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:44.960]   It is just made computing technology available to people in a way that it never was before
[00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:49.920]   I feel like every time I see a kid interact with a computer
[00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:55.360]   I learned something about interface and learn something about usability that was just completely foreign to me before
[00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:59.200]   Because i'm amazed at things that I think they're complicated are actually intuitive
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:02.960]   I think that it's a sense of play really that you need to bring to these apps now
[00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:07.440]   And that you're push every button pull every lever wait for the clown to come up on the spring
[00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:09.920]   Either laugh or start shrieking and horror at it
[00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:14.560]   And then repeat the things that give you good good mental chemistry feedback
[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:18.240]   And avoid the things that cause you to have horrible mental chemistry feedback
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:21.120]   Absolutely
[00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:22.160]   Go ahead
[00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:24.160]   I'm sorry go ahead. Go ahead tanya
[00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:26.240]   As as the mom of a boy, right so
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:32.480]   He will sometimes kind of literally bounce off walls and going into
[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:33.680]   um
[00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:36.240]   A computer room of seventh grade boys
[00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:38.960]   First of all, they're physically bouncing off the walls
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:43.120]   But second of all if they will actually put themselves in front of the computer screen
[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:48.640]   They don't just you know gently move the mouse or tap the key and see what happens
[00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:53.040]   They just bounce all over the machines also and they absolutely do that
[00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:56.560]   They try everything if a button doesn't work on the first click
[00:56:56.560 --> 00:57:01.440]   Well click it 10 more times and see what happens or then go bounce off another wall and come back
[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:06.480]   So these kids are completely playing with the machines in a way that we probably never would because
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:13.360]   You know the thing caused, you know, umpteen thousand dollars and you was probably fragile and you were supposed to be careful with it
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:14.960]   These kids are not
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:18.800]   Careful at all and it's amazing. This stuff doesn't doesn't break
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:24.400]   But that whole playfulness where you just you know keep poking at it's more like a game where you see what it can do
[00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:26.560]   Definitely
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:29.440]   It's very different from the way as a teenager, you know
[00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:33.120]   I recall the high school computer rooms where we're much more careful and quiet
[00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:36.480]   There's a guy named uh
[00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:38.320]   Go ahead, rini
[00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:40.080]   So I was going to say there's a guy named josh clark
[00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:44.400]   He's global moxie on twitter and he goes around teaching people about gesture based interfaces
[00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:50.480]   And the future of them and it's interesting because he'll suggest things like if someone stabs a screen three times or probably lost
[00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:53.440]   And maybe you want to pop up a hint to show them how to go somewhere
[00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:55.600]   But after they're navigating for a while
[00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:59.360]   Really functionally you want to start ramping down the hints almost make them disappear
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:02.960]   And we have these powerful computers and they're really in binary modes either
[00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:06.000]   It's full hints or no hints and there's no ramping up or ramping down
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.080]   But if we start going to gesture
[00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:13.200]   Controlled max and max that can read us via the camera or talk to us via the speaker
[00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:16.880]   I think once you support putting that kind of behavioral programming into it
[00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:23.280]   It it just unlocks all those those concerns so you don't have kids slamming buttons 10 times you have them hitting it twice
[00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:27.920]   Oh, do you need help with this here's where this is and then that just disappears and you go on about your business?
[00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:30.240]   There's clippy though
[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:32.880]   There's always clippy
[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:39.760]   It's good to have a release valve specifically for the so that you don't vent your anger against the useful parts of the app
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:45.120]   That does remind me of part of the conversation i was having with uh that no key maps guy yesterday
[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:50.640]   Apparently one of the reason one of the ways that they test out their software and how well their algorithms are is that
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:56.960]   They they're test drivers who are using the using their software and using the directions are actually wired up with biometrics
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:59:02.400]   So as not only the collecting information where how how long do the car pause at this intersection?
[00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:05.520]   How long did he go did he take the wrong rights of the wrong left?
[00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:09.600]   It's also taking information where how what was his blood pressure? What was his pulse rate?
[00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:12.240]   You know, what was his what was his galvanic skin response?
[00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:18.240]   So it's getting information about how well what would kind of affect the software was having on him on a on a second by second basis
[00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:24.400]   So you you imagine how good like the next uh the next facetime camera will be if it also can do a heat map
[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:28.560]   It can basically sense you fidgeting around and sort of sensing that okay
[00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:34.720]   I don't know what he's saying into the microphone, but the microphone just kept clipping four times in a row with something that was very very loud
[00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:38.160]   I think we're going to try to cool it on the air that maras messages
[00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:44.880]   What if we just like put a tiny warming little yellow light in the corner when there's an error instead of putting something in his face and stopping
[00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:50.480]   Stopping the app from working. So you don't have to swear out loud and that's the only time it really just
[00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:53.360]   Yeah, so
[00:59:53.360 --> 01:00:00.240]   Like it gives you a lot louder for opportunities for localization because in one country, it's like this and another country. It's like this
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:08.080]   Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I thought you're saying peace, brother. I'm having this
[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:12.080]   I'm having a hit be positive moment. You're actually telling me up mine. Okay. Well
[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:19.920]   And on that happy note, uh, let's take another break. Uh, we've got another message from leo who's got something important to say
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:27.040]   Tell us about american express excuse me gentlemen. If I may interrupt, I'd like to talk a little bit about american express savings bank
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:30.560]   Yeah, I'm really I'm really thrilled
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:34.960]   I is there somebody in american's press who says you know
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:42.960]   That backbreak weekly show that's a good show probably a lot of people on mac break weekly who listen to mac break weekly are saving money
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:49.840]   They're good americans. They're probably putting aside a bit of their paycheck every week to buy a new mac or maybe a new car a home
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:54.560]   Well, just putting aside money for a rainy day. We really ought to tell them about our bank
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:56.640]   Do you think that that's what's that what's that happened?
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:01.360]   They said well, let's get some ads on that a mac break weekly show
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:04.880]   I think actually it is what happened because here they are
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:08.240]   Uh, i'm talking about american express now
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:12.160]   I'm in a long time. I'm a member of american express really happy to have them on as a sponsor
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:14.400]   since 1981
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:17.520]   I'm a amx platinum card holder now. Love it
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:22.640]   And guys by the way, I wouldn't mind that black card, you know if you just wanted a
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:26.720]   Uh, I wouldn't I would like I have a friend
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:32.560]   Who has the amx black car? I don't know how you get that. It's not it's not you have to like know somebody, right?
[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:38.800]   That would be cool. It's it's very cool when you pull it out because if you're at a nice place
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:42.560]   They might know most of the time they go what the heck is that and then they go, oh
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:46.480]   Ooh
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:52.960]   So, uh, but that's not what i'm here to talk about today here. I'm talking about the american express bank now. I want you to visit
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:57.600]   Uh, the website and it's kind of an unusual URL so make a note of this
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:02.160]   It's personal savings.com slash online savings
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:06.800]   Personal savings.com slash online savings
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:09.200]   Now what what that'll do is take you to
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:18.720]   Uh american express bank fsp member fdi c now. This is a high yield savings account that works in conjunction with your existing
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:24.000]   Bank account. So this is not a replacement. It's a compliment to what you're using already
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:32.320]   It's online, which means it's uh easy to use you can control it via phone or the web or anytime 24/7
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:34.560]   There's no minimums. I like that
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:40.320]   No fees really good phone support and a high yield of competitive variable interest rate
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:42.960]   To help you reach your savings goals
[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:48.480]   If you're not saving you know, you might want to be saving for that new mac pro if it ever comes out
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:57.600]   This would be a great way to do it personal savings.com slash online savings. That's american express bank fsp member fdi c
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:00.160]   We uh, we thank them
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:04.640]   For supporting mac break weekly and we encourage you to visit personal savings.com
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:08.320]   Slash online savings to learn more now back to you guys
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:13.680]   Leo don't know if you're listening to this wherever you are, but if you get yourself a 3d printer
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:18.080]   You can have yourself as many american express black cards as you want. Anyway, uh
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:25.520]   We had we had one of those iCloud service outages early this week that sort of puts that really
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:27.600]   brown
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:31.520]   Dodding of the i over iCloud for that we've become so used to
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:37.280]   Um, monday morning, uh, many many many many users myself included found that iTunes match playback
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:42.720]   Just didn't work anymore for ios or macos could not access your playlists or your content
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:49.120]   Also on sunday for a great deal of time both iMessage network and uh, facetime apps. We're not working
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:52.720]   Uh facetime didn't work at all if you tried to use the messages app
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:04:00.160]   On your phone, uh, you would all it would work, but it would have to default to text because the iMessage network was completely down and
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:05.440]   There is a class of uh services and apps all across the industry where
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:12.000]   Uh, if something doesn't work properly, I assume that maybe i've screwed something up or there's something wrong at my end
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.720]   When twitter goes down, I know it's twitter's problem
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:18.320]   Uh, and i cloud is definitely in that category
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:23.840]   Um, I was very so that my my spite pump was very much primed for this sort of news
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:26.000]   Uh, because uh just i
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:31.440]   After what a year or two of of iCloud and a year of iTunes music match
[01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:36.880]   Uh, and not getting it to work at all i'd managed i just sort of switched it off and went back to manual syncing
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:40.800]   But then at some point i decided myself well, you're supposed to know about these things
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:46.800]   If it doesn't work if if nobody can make this work that apple would have had an apologetic letter of some sort up there
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:51.600]   It must work for some people you should burn yourself into one of those people who can make iTunes match work
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:54.480]   And so I spent hours going through every
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:05:01.360]   I did a smart playlist and looked for every single track in my library that had some sort of an iCloud sync problem
[01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:07.280]   One by one by one. I I got rid of duplicates. I downloaded new copies of of of tracks
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:12.160]   Solved every single problem that I could find I finally got iCloud does
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:18.480]   Uh playlist syncing working fine for about four days and then of course my favorite playlist in the entire world
[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:22.880]   Disappeared off my iphone and was not available to me for a 90-minute drive
[01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:26.080]   So i'm prepared to once again think that oh man
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:31.920]   I cloud i don't want you to fail. We all want you to succeed
[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:39.680]   We all want nothing but the best for you, but it's so hard to keep loving you iCloud when you keep having problems like this
[01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:41.840]   And this was uh
[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:47.360]   Just hot on the heels of a letter press game which had absolutely the best PR campaign ever
[01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:53.920]   By with with the help of iCloud and game center by saying it's the game that was so hot it brought game centered down
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:55.920]   It was so popular with so much traffic
[01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:57.200]   Um
[01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:04.800]   Oh, Chris is it me? Is it iCloud or is it just a relationship that was forged in the pits of hell and that a quick divorce and
[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:09.360]   Acrimony and silence for the rest of our lives was just what was intended for this entire relationship
[01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:16.320]   Well, Andy there's a word that's gone out of fashion that I think it's time we bring back and that word is crimony
[01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:19.280]   And crimony
[01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:24.560]   Generally refers to any online effort that apple has ever undertaken and we can start with
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:26.400]   e-world
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:30.560]   We could go iTools we could then go to uh, let's see what happened after that
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:38.880]   Um dot back and then mobile me and we said no this time they've built this into the operating system
[01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:41.680]   They built this into ios they built this into os 10
[01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:44.640]   They're really serious about it this time. They're gonna make it work
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:46.880]   I'm not gonna have duplicate
[01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:51.600]   Contacts anymore and all my calendars are gonna have just one event instead of 12 of the same one
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:54.160]   And this guy doesn't have 12 birthdays on the same day
[01:06:54.160 --> 01:07:00.960]   And my music is gonna be perfectly because they have it all in the i2 store and how can they possibly screw up rubber soul?
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:04.720]   For god's sake, which is one of the most popular albums ever made
[01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:10.800]   And the answer is crimony. They just can't seem to get this together
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:12.320]   Um
[01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:14.000]   We are getting to the point now
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:19.040]   At least where this is so important to these operating systems because it is built in and we're
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:23.440]   Reliant on these things where you are saving data to the cloud by default
[01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:28.480]   That this has to be like your utility where it just works and when it goes out
[01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:30.880]   everyone is surprised instead of
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:38.560]   Criminy so yes i2's match which came out just a year ago. It's
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:43.040]   I think this is the doesn't work very well anniversary
[01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:46.560]   And that not much has changed since the thing was launched
[01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:52.720]   Oh, we still have i-match or itunes match where you have album artwork that is screwy
[01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:57.920]   And you have tracks should match and they don't or you have an album and suddenly
[01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:03.360]   Taxman is over in all by itself in this other album when it should be with the rest of
[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:08.080]   Revolver, but somehow it's not because I don't know why
[01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:09.680]   Uh
[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:14.480]   I'm hoping that this delay of i2's 11 is a lot about them saying
[01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:18.720]   Really, this is at least in terms of music. Let's get this part cleaned up
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:22.960]   Can we just make itunes match work for the obvious stuff for the beetle stuff, right?
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:27.280]   If you want to you know do the weird stuff with captain b-fart albums
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:30.400]   That's fine because not many people are going to notice but for this stuff
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:33.840]   Let's get it right and having these kind of outages where people do
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:38.320]   Depend on it where they now depend on things like messages
[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:44.720]   You just you can't do that. It's just it's got to work and we thought it would and it's still not working yet. So
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:51.760]   I think we we have backups in place a lot of people tried iCloud. They're not happy when they've gone back to dropbox
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:58.560]   People using google services because those seem to be up all the time and iCloud doesn't so you know apple
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:00.880]   the only message to you is
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:03.680]   Crime andy and you know act on that please
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:06.800]   Like
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:12.800]   Who here is the only thing that i'm using iCloud for that I kind of rely on is documents thinking because that
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:16.960]   Usually mostly works. I don't always know that it's
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:22.480]   Sink to my i devices without having to check for it first, but it works kind of okay, but
[01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:25.200]   Let's chris like you said, I mean
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:26.720]   It works it works for what it does
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:32.480]   But if I use if I store it in dropbox instead there's so much more I can do with it if I put it in a microsoft skydrive
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:37.280]   It's so much easier to share a link and and export it so other people can access it and use it
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:42.080]   And I mean I don't know it's it's I feel as though i'm using it because
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:46.080]   iCloud works well enough and it's an apple product
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:49.760]   And they've made it a very frick frictionless process for me to use it
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:55.200]   But if it were one micron more heavier to use I would drop it in a sec
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:58.400]   It is the same, but else is anybody else really relying on iCloud or
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:03.200]   We all members of the I give up or I who we want you to succeed
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:07.760]   We'll be back to see that success in 10.9 and in iOS 7
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:12.320]   Well, you know I use iCloud services, but I don't
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:18.000]   Depend on them the way, you know a brain surgeon would depend on their scalpel being in exactly the right place
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.760]   So for me
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:23.520]   It hasn't been too much of a problem, but specifically what I use a lot is I use the
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:27.600]   the calendar thinking to get it on all my devices and
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:31.920]   You know if there's been some kind of small delay that was caused by an outage
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:33.840]   I haven't noticed
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:38.400]   Um, I use the thinking in safari for bookmarks tab reading less blah blah blah
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:42.640]   Seems seems to be good, but again, you know if my tabs don't think instantly
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:46.320]   Probably not going to notice. I've certainly got enough of them as it is
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:51.680]   So if I was missing a few who could tell um, I use find my friends a lot
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:55.760]   Um as a tracker on my teenage son. He knows it's there
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:11:00.000]   It's cool with him because I pick him up a lot better if I know where he is
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.600]   um
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:02.480]   So
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:07.440]   None none of that oh and photo stream photo stream is absolutely flaky
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:12.800]   I can see it being flaky, but I still love it because I can take photos. I was I actually went on vacation
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:16.400]   Um by myself this summer and I was taking photos
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:21.120]   Uh in europe and not doing a saying but taking them on my iphone
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:24.480]   And my husband and my son could watch them on the apple tv at night here at home
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:28.640]   And that was just totally cool even though some of the photos never showed up
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:33.040]   So I guess what i'm saying is it's not like we can see it's not working perfectly
[01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:36.880]   But i'm not counting on it to work perfectly. It's more like
[01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:40.000]   What it does is so cool that if it's just 90
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.440]   I'm cool with it. Um, yeah
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:45.440]   To completely get there together and make it perfect
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:48.160]   Driving for 90 percent
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:50.400]   First that is
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:56.400]   That is so so hoes like because you you've already got like that speech down pat's like son
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:02.560]   I'm not really angry with you that you're dented the car that you weren't supposed to take out because
[01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:06.080]   I just have learned not to expect so much of you that's all
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:11.680]   And so we'll we'll get it fixed. We're glad that you didn't you crashed into a pole instead of a person
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:19.120]   That's wonderful. We're really glad you did that but just realize that every day you disappoint us just a little bit
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:21.840]   You want fun
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:24.720]   It's all fun
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:29.680]   A gentlemanly be you get to keep your scholarship on your and your and your athletic grill your spot on the athletic team
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:32.320]   The thing for me is not so much that um
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:38.640]   I cloud and the associated services go down because everybody goes down microsoft goes down amazon goes down
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:43.520]   Gmail has been a pain for me for five years, but i cloud even when it's working
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:49.680]   It's not great. And I think I think cloud services are one of the two biggest challenges that apple's gonna face
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:53.600]   You talk about google and they don't have great native apps. They don't have great interface as well
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:56.880]   Guess what? They bought snapseed they bought sparrow they bought slide
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:01.120]   You can hire designers and developers and fix that problem
[01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:06.000]   Much easier than you can fix a cloud infrastructure. That's not a trivial problem
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:12.160]   To solve and there's very little indication that apple is spending I mean they could be doing it really secretly but
[01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:18.320]   The store is still running on web objects. They still have to take down the store in order to change small things and put it back up
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:20.400]   Uh, I did a and well
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:25.840]   We did a a 90-minute interview with lorn britter about game center and the game center api is in building letter press
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:31.440]   And it's it does not sound like a battle hard and well tested dog-footed api
[01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:37.760]   And serie i mean the joke a lot of stuff like we were laughing about i cloud and we're laughing about i message and we're laughing about serie
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:39.280]   but um
[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:42.240]   That's the future apple needs to nail services
[01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:45.360]   To exist in a world where google has a great
[01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:51.920]   Interface and microsoft has a really good products on the line and amazon and facebook or maybe getting into mobile devices
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:57.280]   And i'd love for there to be this big aha look we've totally rebuilt our entire server infrastructure
[01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:04.560]   We're no longer buying asia boxes and sun boxes and sorry oracle boxes and whomever and we've got this as fantastic as cocoa touches
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:07.120]   We now have you know cocoa cloud and it's just
[01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:12.000]   Revolutionary but again, there's there's very little sign and that makes me incredibly scared
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:17.680]   About apple services going forward. Yeah, I mean google did sort of a really cool thing
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:21.600]   But you could also interpret it as a victory lap for all their web apps and our cloud services
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:28.560]   Where there is a landing page for for people who are doing all kinds of things during this this holiday week in the us
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:31.040]   Where it's sort of like a path that shows you
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:35.920]   With little like little web app boxes for you can actually access and use so here's here's the web
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:39.600]   Here's the google service that you'll use to to prepare your thanksgiving dinner
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:43.840]   Here's the here's a recipe box here is a google live google hangout
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:49.360]   For for for live cooking lessons. I should say that when I first opened that link
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:56.160]   It said join live cooking lessons over hangouts. I miss an wrist read that has joined jive cooking lessons over hangouts
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:56.720]   Oh, go ahead
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:03.840]   Because the the little frame grab was of this very lovely lady in the kitchen who's seen you making a gesture like this
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:06.560]   And so I thought anyway, that's not here. No there
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:12.800]   And there's a use the use our flight trackers for for people who are traveling use our sports ticker when you're keeping up with the games
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:15.440]   On and on and on and on I mean they are
[01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:20.400]   No, well, you know, it's no wonder that they're good at web services because they started off life as a web services company
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:24.800]   But it does show you that if more of the more of the world is going to be the connected web
[01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:28.640]   Google's at an advantage there and apple's going to have to catch up
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:33.840]   Look at syria. I mean we spoke about this before syria is a Pixar character come to life on your
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:35.440]   iOS device
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:41.760]   But google now has already got localized search half the stuff that syria goes to the internet for it does not need to go to the internet
[01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:47.200]   For it should be able to do that locally and that would increase perceptive speed and google now is even doing predictive
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:49.200]   Answers where I don't have to ask a question
[01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:54.720]   It's already providing me with this and I don't know how equipped apple is to push that kind of technology as fast as google is
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:56.080]   Yeah
[01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:59.840]   type of kitchen another thing to keep in mind with iCloud and why I said well
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:07.040]   I don't care that much and it's good enough is for the stuff that I would care more about and where I think iCloud has significant problems
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:12.560]   As does apple is they don't understand that a lot of what I do online is sharing stuff with other people
[01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:17.760]   So like documents in the cloud where you can have your pages files available to you and pages on different
[01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:21.360]   Max and iOS devices that you own, you know, whatever big deal
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:26.000]   I wouldn't consider using that because I need multiple people to get at my files all the time
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:30.800]   So I'm you know going to be in Dropbox or some service that acknowledges sharing and google
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:36.560]   And there are services a lot of it is all about people working together in groups people hanging out for cooking lessons
[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:41.920]   I don't think we're ever going to see, you know, people hanging out for cooking lessons in iCloud because apple is all about
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:43.920]   For some reason
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:50.000]   Their products really are all about one person in one device one set of data and that that's a big frustration that they're
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.200]   Definitely going to need to figure out how to get over in addition to
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:57.920]   Some of the more sort of you know low level hardware and software stuff with our cloud
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:05.600]   Is this a problem that they can solve by writing checks and buying the right companies as a blog post by that was linked to by
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:08.800]   Patrick Gibson who's making the case that apple should buy twitter
[01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:14.400]   That it's twitters and that's sort of is in a sort of vulnerable mode where they could be
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:20.080]   Much much like these short-panted one from acdc once the right amount of silver gold is put in the pot
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:26.560]   They could decide they no longer want to be an ipo that they actually want to be bought out and become part of a part of the apple family
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:29.520]   But i mean more now is if apple has the money
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:35.280]   You know if money can solve this problem apple's got the cash, but i think it's really a philosophical approach
[01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:39.600]   Yeah, it's a get over in in there every day just approach to everything
[01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:42.720]   It's like new wants
[01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:46.640]   It's it's it seems as though part of it is
[01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:51.120]   Google is a company that is culturally about sharing
[01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:55.520]   Muchly personal information that you wish that they weren't sharing with so with advertising partners
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:18:02.320]   But it's like it's like it is true tiny that it seems like part of their dna is why why wouldn't you want this information to be shared
[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:07.360]   With as many people as possible why wouldn't you want this document to be indexed and linked to for other people?
[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:12.720]   Rest apples philosophy is sandboxing saying we're going to protect you. We're going to control the experience
[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:18.240]   Where it's going to be like disneyland where we're going to make sure you have a good experience and we're going to do that
[01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:21.600]   So aggressively we're going to make it impossible for you to try to have a bad experience
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:25.680]   And so it seems as though they just if even if they bought the right company
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:32.160]   They would quickly after after being in the same air conditioning as apple for the past 10 or 15 years
[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:36.240]   They would also be saying I web version five
[01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:43.040]   Now we're using our own version of a syndication feed that doesn't interact with anything, but it's better
[01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:45.520]   You're welcome the web
[01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:48.080]   Right
[01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:54.080]   I think you look at apple in this culture. It's and one reason they can't do social. It's because basically they're an anti social
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:56.000]   company
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:00.080]   And so I mean they are and it comes back to acdc as usual as
[01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:02.560]   I would have seen some
[01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:06.480]   But they are I mean they're very internalized they look inward all the time
[01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:09.440]   They know best so even if they did acquire a company like twitter
[01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:14.800]   You know that they put the apple screws to it and then it becomes not so social anymore, but it becomes
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:18.960]   We believe this is the box that you should live in when you're doing social networking
[01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:24.000]   Even though we haven't had any success doing it prior to this. We think this is the way it should be done
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.320]   So yes, it would be great if they had that the engineers and the technology
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:32.240]   But again, I just think there's something about that culture where they don't get it
[01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:34.800]   They don't want to open up they want to close things down
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:38.880]   Make sure they have control of it and in a lot of cases that's that's helpful to the users
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:41.520]   But for these sorts of things, I don't think it is
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:45.360]   It's one of those things where apple really needs to sort of you know take a drink
[01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:48.960]   Settle down a little bit and and let things go for a while
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:54.960]   A sandbox is not a sandbox if it only allows one kid inside the plate with it at a time, right
[01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:58.480]   They did hire the amazon server guy and there's an argument
[01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:04.000]   You know they could theoretically want to buy nuance because they're they're relying on nuance technology for a lot of theory or maybe
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:08.000]   Bertrans-sur-lays new cloud startup would one day be an acquisition target for apple
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:13.040]   But billions of dollars can't buy you time and a lot of other companies have a huge lead on them
[01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:16.480]   And like you all said you can't buy you culture so apple
[01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:20.400]   I think at some point they're gonna have to do a microsoft and just decide they're gonna go all in on
[01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:26.480]   Server infrastructure and come up with something as compelling as amazon or google or facebook is fielding
[01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:35.760]   We have some some competing theories from apple insider and cnet about the future of the new iMac
[01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:42.000]   One is saying that it's going to be delayed until early 2013 because of a manufacturing issue
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:47.040]   I believe cnet is saying no, we will see them very very soon. However, they'll be in slight
[01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:49.360]   Claiming that they believe that's going to be in
[01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:51.360]   a short supply
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:54.480]   Internationally because I think I know that I've been getting a lot of questions from people about it
[01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:57.280]   Or why can't I why can I walk in a store and get it right now?
[01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:04.000]   It does point out that apple is kind of unique amongst all of the the high the high level
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:11.120]   Hardware manufacturers that they are almost always experimenting with a new process for assembling and manufacturing something with every
[01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:18.320]   Generation of product every year they come out with something which is the reason why it's usually why when apple comes up with a radical new
[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:22.080]   Manufacturing process or a radically new design such as this new iMac
[01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:27.040]   Which is designed to be super thin so thin that it's too thin even for an SD card slot on the side of it
[01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:32.880]   When they when there's something this radical. That's why I always caution people to don't order one of the first
[01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:41.440]   Units of these off the boat wait about 30 days until there's several hundred thousand copies of this in play at once
[01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:43.920]   And that's when they're going to start refining their processes
[01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:48.960]   Identifying places where okay, this works just fine, but this if we were to make this adjustment
[01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:54.880]   Then we will be able to assemble them a little bit better this problem that says cropping up in a very very small handful of machines
[01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:58.960]   Will no longer come up at all. So that's just a free piece of advice
[01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:00.400]   um
[01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:05.920]   But it does give us some extra time to think about like our own futures with the mac that
[01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:13.840]   I'll else I got it. I got to have a confession that I had I spent some time with the intel last week
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:17.600]   uh showing me a whole bunch of different machines and I saw at least two
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:20.640]   It looked really good
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:23.360]   Two two windows eight machines and they all be honest with you
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:30.000]   They look real good. I've forgotten I I've temporarily forgot my marriage vows to the macOS
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:36.480]   While I was in this cocktail lounge just looking at this wonderful wonderful device. Um, there was a samsung
[01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:39.200]   convertible tablet where
[01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:41.360]   uh, this following here
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:43.840]   It was a windows eight multi touch tablet
[01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:51.840]   About as thin as an ipad for about as light as an ipad for it was wide screen instead of the the these the ipads
[01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:54.400]   Aspect ratio, but in all
[01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:59.040]   Respect me hold on to it. It is a regular regular ipad like device
[01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:06.160]   It clicks into a really hard dock that gives you a full laptop experience with a working hinge and everything
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:09.520]   This isn't like the smart covers you see you might have seen on surface rt
[01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:11.280]   Where it's this really thin
[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:15.280]   Plastic II sort of thing where it types very nicely, but it was designed to be really thin and light
[01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:19.760]   This is really something almost identical to a macbook air just a little bit thicker
[01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:23.840]   But otherwise identical to a macbook air the two clinchers here
[01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:28.560]   when you compare it to an 11 inch macbook air, which costs a thousand dollars
[01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:30.240]   the
[01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:31.280]   tablet
[01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:37.920]   Partion of portion of it costs 599 the keyboard station cost about another $130
[01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:41.360]   Uh, so already it's way way underneath
[01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:47.840]   Thirdly it runs all desktop apps as well as a nicely optimized multi touch uh operating system
[01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:52.640]   But the the kicker is that whereas the 11 inch macbook air
[01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:58.880]   Uh runs for about six hours. I found about five hours on battery. This will run at least 10
[01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:01.680]   And that's when I started thinking to myself
[01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:05.120]   I don't want this I still want a mac
[01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:10.240]   But this is probably the first time I've ever thought that if in 2013 2014
[01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:17.200]   There's a lot of good software available for modern the modern version of windows 8 or the multi touch operating system
[01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:21.600]   And I've got a thousand dollars in my pocket that I thought I was going to spend in an ipad 5
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:30.320]   I could see myself maybe getting swayed by this thing solely because this is exactly how I outfit my ipad for travel use
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:37.280]   A separate tablet for like really cool fun and games and then I click it into I drop it into a keyboard dock for full
[01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:42.720]   A keyboard style keyboard and experience and there are times when I wish it could run desktop apps
[01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:45.040]   But I do without them because i'm traveling for a week
[01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:51.360]   So it kind of invites a little bit of thought. I mean I don't necessarily think that anything's better than the mac right now, but
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:52.880]   uh
[01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:57.200]   All the this group of people here together we have more than a half a century of
[01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:03.760]   Full-on mac os used between us where that's been our primary computer in most cases our sole computer
[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:08.880]   What can you what what would it take for you to ever switch away from the mac?
[01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:12.640]   I'm not and i'm not necessarily saying switch to windows 8 or switch to anything else
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:18.480]   I'm saying is there anything any other kind of device or anytime operating system or any kind of feature set or any kind of price set
[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:22.960]   That would make you think you know, I had this pile of money. I was going to spend on a new mac
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:25.760]   I think i'm gonna spend it on this thing instead
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:29.520]   And tanya, why don't you start off with the
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:32.880]   Well, sure yeah, it's a little
[01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:37.680]   Uh, you know, no one to talk about this because it's too creepy to contemplate them. He's staring at something that's not an apple
[01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:45.120]   Back in the day I used the apple twos and I use I use doss and I even learned some unix and you know
[01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:48.800]   I used early versions of windows and all this stuff and at some point
[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:54.000]   Long ago. I said, you know, if I learn any of these other stuff any better
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:59.360]   I'm gonna have to help people use that and the actual operating system that I enjoy using is the mac
[01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:01.920]   So I'm gonna kind of ignore this other stuff
[01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:07.040]   Mostly so I will never get good enough at it that I can actually answer a sensible question about it
[01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:09.360]   So that way people just ask me about the mac
[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:16.800]   And so for me I came to enjoy the consistent vocabulary that we have when we talk about the max interface
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:19.760]   You know apple has whole style guides, you know, as does microsoft
[01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:23.360]   But you know the consistent vocabulary the consistent user interface
[01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:27.760]   The pride that the entire mac community and apple takes into in the design
[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:30.880]   And I learned a lot about using the mac
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:37.600]   And of course in my professional life. I edit books about using the mac and ios
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:42.080]   So I actually know quite a lot about it. So for me to switch
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:44.640]   um
[01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:52.000]   I think that the people in in my broader community and my friends who are developers my family
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:57.120]   People my colleagues they'd have to be thinking about switching too because if I was going to switch
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:00.560]   It would be a huge effort because I have to learn all this new stuff
[01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:05.840]   Um, and I might not have time to learn all that new stuff. So in order
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:10.320]   I mean basically the mac would have to suck it would have to suck so much more
[01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:15.520]   Then whatever I was switching to it would just have to be just unacceptable
[01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:20.800]   So I mean, you know, I'm in my mid 40s and I've been doing this for a long time
[01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:23.760]   And I think it's cool that other people use other machines
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:29.600]   And I think it's cool that there are other machines that make apple work hard to keep their stuff good
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:35.760]   But I I think it would take something really compelling to make me switch operating systems
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:39.760]   And you know if someone's recording, I mean, I know I know this is recorded but in 10 years
[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:45.520]   You know if someone pulls this clip out and says, you know, look at you now tanya here on this totally different operating system
[01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:51.280]   You will have a laugh then but right now it feels improbable. I'm I'm too entrenched
[01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:53.440]   Hmm
[01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:58.640]   They'll take the national guard and i'm gonna break a c4 to get you to get you out of the out of the spaceship
[01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:00.880]   Yeah at gunpoint. I'm sure I could switch
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:07.280]   How about you guys mean is there is there?
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:11.600]   Part of it is that I guess part of it is just the problem of familiarity
[01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:17.520]   That I keep expecting the next version of uh of macOS to be as
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:22.960]   Revolutionary and revelatory as some other steps. I've seen forward. I mean
[01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:25.200]   Unfortunately
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:28.160]   Apple has the success of getting things right early on
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:34.320]   That they haven't felt a need to really say well why don't we just toss out this and start something brand new they can do these simple incremental things
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:40.640]   All wrapped around the exact same interface. Meanwhile, it's I guess I guess the best example is that it's sort of like when
[01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:43.760]   Uh, I thought I had the same watch for three or four years
[01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:49.600]   I did not even look at what other watch companies were doing and then when I came back to when this finally broke and I said great
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:51.680]   I haven't looked at digital watches in four or five years
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:57.120]   I bet they've done really exciting and wonderful things and I was disappointed because well was the same watches
[01:28:57.120 --> 01:29:01.280]   I'd ever seen so there's really no reason for me to go back to this model that I had before
[01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:03.920]   So I mean is it familiarity? I mean
[01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:06.640]   I'm sorry. Let's go back to the real question
[01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:11.600]   Chris was there is there anything that could get you to switch away from using the Mac as your primary machine?
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:13.680]   I will I will include iOS
[01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:15.600]   If they're if they're ever became let's say a little
[01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:20.160]   Well, let's say that apple did a little bit of more of a professional iPad
[01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:24.720]   I made a little bit easier to make it like a daily use machine like or any other operating system
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:27.760]   Do you feel like so you're your your Mac guy forever?
[01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:34.320]   Let me anger yet another group of people and that would be that would be audio files
[01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:38.400]   um, I care more about music than I care about sound
[01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:40.080]   so
[01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:42.080]   That's why I've got my technology as well
[01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:46.080]   if my tools are providing me with the
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:53.600]   Functionality the I need to do the things I really want to do which is write or create music or play games or something else
[01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:56.080]   I'm happy and so
[01:29:56.080 --> 01:30:01.920]   As much as I look at devices and think well, this is a good price or this is really powerful
[01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:05.840]   It's got a better processor. It's got this it's got that from a tactical perspective
[01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:09.040]   I think that's all fine, but that's not really what I care about to me
[01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:11.360]   That's like listening to sound instead of music
[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:17.360]   What I want is a device that allows me to get my work done or get my play done as uh,
[01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:19.840]   efficiently and as um
[01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:23.360]   Enjoyably as possible now currently that's the Mac now
[01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:27.840]   I completely agree with tanya in terms of oh, you mean I have to learn a new thing to do this
[01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:33.360]   What a new device would have to present me is some way that I can
[01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:36.080]   Have as much fun or more fun
[01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:42.400]   Doing this thing and getting it done efficiently instead of having to learn a different way and end up with the same result
[01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:48.080]   So ideally I'd like this to be results driven can I get a better result from this piece of technology?
[01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:50.880]   Do I have to suffer a lot to get there? No?
[01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:53.920]   All right, maybe that's tempting and I think on the iOS
[01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:59.040]   We're starting to see some of that there are reasons I go to the iOS instead of a Mac to do things
[01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:02.160]   but I won't embrace the iOS entirely because there
[01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:06.400]   Certain things that my Mac does a whole lot better than an iOS device. So
[01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:09.920]   Um staying away just from the geek enjoyment of things
[01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:15.840]   It's going to be tough unless somebody can present me with something that it's going to produce a better result for me
[01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:18.800]   Renee, how about you?
[01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:23.760]   We the way our network works is that we have a site for iOS which I take care of
[01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:28.400]   We also have an android site a blackberry site a windows site and almost always once a year
[01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:32.320]   We each take a week and we swap devices and try out all the competing stuff for a week
[01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:36.080]   So I get a little taste of the other stuff that's out there and I'm not
[01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:40.320]   I'm showing you how to post to switching. I started off with an apple too. I went DOS
[01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:44.480]   I went to an amiga for a while. I went back to Mac. I went to windows machines
[01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:49.520]   But the difference now is that it's not so much of a of a single device play
[01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:55.040]   But there's such an ecosystem investment and I have an iPhone and iPad and apple tv a mac
[01:31:55.040 --> 01:32:00.880]   I have all the apps and uh ripping and replacing becomes then a much more expensive time consuming
[01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:06.720]   And involved or deal. It's not the same as when I ditched a vista laptop at work for a macbook pro
[01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:12.320]   I would have to figure out a way to you know get my media onto the devices get that stuff onto my television
[01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:16.480]   Um, what would I need to have a tablet? What would I need to have a computer all just
[01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:20.560]   Just working together. What would fill the iCloud void? What would fill?
[01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:24.800]   Um the airplane void so it becomes a much more complicated
[01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:30.800]   Question and I think like tanya apple would have to descend to such a pit of darkness and insanity
[01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:34.960]   That all of that became better than living with what I have today
[01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:39.360]   Uh to get me to actually get my lazy ass off the couch enough to do it
[01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:43.040]   So kurtl kurtz would absolutely have to go up river
[01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:46.000]   Yes and see himself as the new ceo
[01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:48.240]   Uh in order in order for that to happen
[01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:53.760]   Yeah, absolutely at this stage. Absolutely. I think it's it's an odd question because I think that
[01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:55.200]   uh
[01:32:55.200 --> 01:33:00.800]   A lot of what I do is becoming just independent of device completely where
[01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:04.800]   Uh, so long as I have a system that can
[01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:09.360]   Uh run a good version of microsoft where so long as it can allow me to share and access files
[01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:11.520]   So long as it can cover
[01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:18.080]   Eight core critical features and usually that involves one of six apps that are available for just but every every operating system
[01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:21.280]   I feel so it's not as big a deal for me to switch
[01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:24.880]   It would not necessarily be as big a deal for me to switch platforms
[01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:28.480]   And so it's it's sort of like what I was going through over the summer
[01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:36.000]   Uh with the samsung galaxy s3 where at that I felt as though android had matured to such a degree where it wasn't as good as ios
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:40.880]   But it was close enough that to get getting back on that big two balance scale
[01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:44.160]   Uh, you know, uh, ios is ios is still better
[01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:48.320]   Uh, but then when you put on yes, but apple will not build a device with a large screen
[01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:53.920]   Oh, that is nice apple won't build a device with this kind of video camp. Oh, that is nice
[01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:57.440]   Uh, and it sort of balances each other out
[01:33:57.440 --> 01:34:01.920]   And I think that if apple were to ever sort of lose sight of
[01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:08.160]   Who's out there buying computers these days and what they're using them for it could be a day where
[01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:13.520]   Mac OS still wins every single usability and customer satisfaction index
[01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:21.520]   But the damn fact is that people want a tablet that runs a desktop powerful operating system and apple still doesn't believe that that's a good thing for them to do
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:30.160]   So I don't know. I mean, I I I reassure if they're there people get upset every time I write something positive about something that doesn't have an apple logo on it
[01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:36.960]   Uh, and uh, I I understand that fear because I see that fear every time I look at look in the mirror and shave every morning or
[01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:40.320]   I'll be honest three times at most out of every week
[01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:42.240]   Uh
[01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:44.240]   At the at the at the same time
[01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:45.760]   Uh
[01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:52.160]   You don't want to keep you you you you want to make sure that you keep voting from the heart from the head and not from the heart
[01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:58.160]   I would hate to have to be one of these people remember the dark ages in the in the late 90s when
[01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:01.680]   Okay, I need a new computer
[01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:03.920]   I guess i'll buy a
[01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:06.240]   Performa 821 cd
[01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:08.640]   Why
[01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:14.720]   Because it's an apple but this other micro so this other windows machine I know but I can't buy a windows machine
[01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:16.080]   Why not?
[01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:22.960]   Because it would be less expensive more reliable and I could run more software on it. That's why I can't buy a windows machine
[01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:27.520]   I just I just don't want to be one of those people ever again
[01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:31.600]   I don't I want to make sure that I could always be arrogant about my choice of an apple product
[01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:34.640]   I'm not I worry that if that apple continues to make their
[01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:38.000]   $2,500 laptops that don't have an ethernet port
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:46.480]   They might like lose the the lose the common the common man the joe the jane six pack the the johnny lunchbox says the
[01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:50.560]   Gop campaign commercials so very badly portrayed them and
[01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:59.680]   Larry you're trying to portray a construction worker. Could you please take off the monocle? Oh, I'm sorry. It means it
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:01.360]   I agree
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:05.760]   But maybe this does come back to to tiniest point about familiarity where
[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:12.240]   I'm fine on a windows machine until I go off road and at which point I have no idea what's happened
[01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:14.720]   And I have plenty of experience with the max
[01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:21.120]   So if I go off road there and something terrible happens if I have a kernel panic or something crashes or or this is a little funky
[01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:24.880]   I know what to do with it once I get on a windows machine and that kind of thing happens
[01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:28.880]   You know, I I go look at the tech site so they say reinstall windows which seems like
[01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:32.480]   A poor solution that there must be some people who know
[01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:37.040]   Who have bought a new windows machine because it was too hard to fix the old one
[01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:43.280]   Yeah, they're like no, I'm not going to reinstall windows. I'm just go buy a whole new machine. This one's going out the window
[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:49.120]   But but um another thing to consider because you know, we're all getting a little older
[01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:54.960]   But for instance my centrist and he doesn't really have things on his computer per se
[01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:58.160]   his music spotify his
[01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:03.520]   uh, homework documents all that kind of stuff google docs his um
[01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:08.240]   You know stuff he we don't actually I don't even know if we back up his computer
[01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:11.040]   We probably do but there's no urgent need to
[01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:16.800]   Um, so for him he actually doesn't care too much which computer he uses which is good because he has to do homework
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:20.400]   Like all the time everywhere so he uses whatever computer is available
[01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:27.280]   but I wonder if for um, you know, sort of this younger generation coming up if they actually will care less
[01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:29.680]   um because
[01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:35.760]   It it won't matter what they're interacting with is really just in a web browser and some kind of app that's talking to online
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:39.040]   Hmm
[01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:41.040]   So so just just
[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:45.920]   So all the conspiracy theorists who worry about the un trying to impose a one world government
[01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:49.760]   You think that their first beachhead is going to be operating systems and hardware platforms
[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:57.280]   Oh sure and and stealing all your passwords and bank account information by uh, key logging what you do on them
[01:37:57.520 --> 01:38:00.480]   Yeah, but we'll we'll facebook welcome the competition on that
[01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:09.760]   Okay, let's take another break after the break we're going to be coming back for our picks of the week
[01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:15.280]   But before that we have another wonderful message from our friend leo la port who wants to make your life better
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:24.320]   Through the magic of audible audiobooks. Excuse me one more uh word if you don't mind in your ear about audible.com
[01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:29.760]   And Andy when you come back you can give us your audible picks and some not here right now, but I got to tell you I uh
[01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:32.720]   I should show you my mini
[01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:34.800]   Because I loaded it up
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:38.080]   14 and a half hour plane fight
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:41.600]   To uh to uh, australia you better believe
[01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:47.200]   I have put a ton of stuff on here. One of them is I think when you recommended any the peat towns and
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:53.440]   Um, uh, biography or autobiography. Who am I? I've got among others from joe waltand
[01:38:53.440 --> 01:39:00.240]   These are mostly recommendations from, um, our hosts the end of money. Look at what is this 11 books
[01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:06.640]   That's how how scared I am of this 14 and a half hour plane ride. There's no way I could but these are all great books
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:08.640]   I've been dying to read
[01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:11.680]   I can't wait to read and I'm actually I read kill decision
[01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:15.920]   So I'm gonna take that off the list and I just finished cloud atlas and now i'm ready to see the movie
[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:20.480]   I gotta tell you audible is fantastic if you haven't yet tried audible.com
[01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:24.400]   I do not know what's keeping you, but I urge you to give it a shot
[01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:29.760]   100 000 plus books it's the best bookstore in the world and they're all audiobooks
[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:31.440]   They're
[01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:36.640]   You're right john hodgman is missing yo ho jones, but that's because i've already read all the john hodgman's books
[01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:39.840]   Uh just such great stuff
[01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:44.160]   It gets me it got me back in the books. I have to be honest
[01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:49.840]   Um, I just didn't have time, you know, I got busy. We had the kids. I was you know working hard at tech tv
[01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:55.840]   I just didn't have time to read but but in a way the the commute when we moved up here to a petaluma
[01:39:55.840 --> 01:39:59.280]   Was it was the blessing was it turned everything around because
[01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:05.840]   Spending a couple of three hours a day in the car means I have two or three hours a day to listen to audiobooks
[01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:13.760]   And that was it man. I've since then I've read over 300 books or listened to over 300 books on audible.com
[01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:15.920]   And the neat thing is with the audible app
[01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:22.000]   All those books are still available to me. Let me show you the audible app. It's available for windows phone for iphone
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.640]   Here it is on on on android
[01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:31.280]   We pull it up on my android device and I I listen on my sonos. I have it playing throughout the house
[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:33.840]   So this is the audible app
[01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:38.720]   Which is a great way to keep track of everything you you've got these are all the books
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:43.120]   By the way, you notice these are much of the same books that I had on my ipad
[01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:46.160]   I also have my android phone because I I'm so paranoid
[01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:52.720]   Well, what if I lose the ipad so I can listen here and whisper sync is great because when I stop listening on one device
[01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:58.560]   And pick it up on another it will immediately jump to that position on the other device, which is very very handy
[01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:03.280]   Audible is just fantastic. I want you to give it a try. Here's the deal
[01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:09.440]   All you have to do is go to 324 books in my audible library. So I'll correct I stay corrected
[01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:15.920]   So you just load the library and everything. Oh, I gotta get who am I on there download that

[01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:27.200]   I'm just
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:28.320]   To me
[01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:31.920]   It suddenly makes a 14 and a half hour plane ride something i'm looking forward to
[01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:38.160]   I'm gonna get so time to listen to like oh, here's another one. I got to download the girl who kicked the hornet's nest

[01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:52.880]   Oh, man. Just it's just fantastic. This is a good one christopher buckley's book about his father
[01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:55.440]   William f buckley losing moment pup that was a great book
[01:41:55.440 --> 01:42:01.680]   Loved that it's kind of fun to go back the life and works of Chopin. I don't even remember listening to that
[01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:05.520]   I'm bitter
[01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:07.520]   That was humer Simpson you could ignore that
[01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:10.720]   Did you hear that see biscuit what a great book that was?
[01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:14.400]   And i've got secretariat too. I know that was one Andy who really liked

[01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:20.640]   Uh, yes, I do but i'm going to be reserving it for next week since you were did so eloquent job recommending your own pick of the week
[01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:27.840]   And also there are only 24 hours in the day at leo and that but if I spend exactly eight minutes looking at my audio audio book
[01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:32.320]   A list and then picking one to pick then that's time that's well invested in more on-air promotions
[01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:37.360]   It is it what you what you then when you just witness there though everybody that's exactly
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:39.840]   uh the way that it goes with the
[01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:45.680]   Your your audio book collection is exactly like your bookshelf where you can't just something you think you're just going to tell
[01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:50.320]   So I got these shelves at ikea, but you know if you go down the hardware store and replace the fittings and
[01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:56.080]   Oh, have I ever shown you this this pichy woodhouse anthology? I got it's all the golf store
[01:43:56.080 --> 01:43:59.360]   And you just keep talking about the books do you like them? It's hard not it's hard to get off of it
[01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:04.320]   Uh, but let's get off of it and start talking about our picks other week and we're going to start with you rene
[01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:06.000]   What is your pick?
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:11.760]   And my pick of the week is colitis scope two colitis scope was originally made by sofa and then they were bought out by
[01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:17.200]   uh facebook so uh colitis scope was sold to black pixel and black pixel is an interesting company
[01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:21.600]   They make a lot of the best apps that you're not actually aware that they make uh their third party
[01:44:21.600 --> 01:44:23.280]   They do a lot of contract work
[01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:26.240]   But they started to kind of take care of these apps and they bought
[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:32.240]   colitis scope and they bought net news wire and colitis scope two is the first black pixel version
[01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:36.400]   Um to come out of the gate and they're doing a public beta with it
[01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:39.280]   So you can download a free 15 day trial
[01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:44.960]   If you do you qualify for a 50 off pricing, it'll be in the mac app store
[01:44:44.960 --> 01:44:49.760]   You'll be able to buy it from black pixel. You'll have a variety of sales up when it goes live
[01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:53.280]   But if you're not familiar with colitis scope, it's a great tool. It's for people who
[01:44:53.760 --> 01:45:00.800]   Uh want to compare two different things two different images two different text files two different uh programming files
[01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:05.200]   And it'll just go through and run a diff and show you what the differences are between the two pictures
[01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:08.160]   The between the two documents between the two lines of code
[01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:13.360]   And it's got a very elegant interface. It's been redesigned from the ground up
[01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:17.520]   If had some incredibly talented designers and developers working on it
[01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:19.760]   I'm enjoying it quite a bit
[01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:26.640]   So if it's not for everybody but it's for people who really do care about getting that final version to contain every
[01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:29.440]   bit and pixel
[01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:31.680]   That you want to be in it
[01:45:31.680 --> 01:45:35.760]   I probably need that for myself every every time I get a new mac book
[01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:38.080]   I just copy the old documents folder onto it
[01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:43.120]   And so if there's like novel sketches and things i've been working on for like a long time
[01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:45.120]   I might have like nine instances
[01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:49.040]   Starting with like the first notes about how about a book about pirates
[01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:55.520]   So then there's and that 11 different versions of chapter one and so I could I could probably benefit very much from kaleidoscope too
[01:45:55.520 --> 01:45:58.080]   Excellent pick tony. What is your pick?
[01:45:58.080 --> 01:46:00.880]   Well, Andy my pick is a little bit of um
[01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:06.240]   Explanation, which is uh, you may recall when you asked me if I could be a mac break weekly
[01:46:06.240 --> 01:46:10.960]   I said yes and in fact it fits in my schedule so well because my schedule is very light this week
[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:15.360]   But the reason my schedule is light this week is because um, I've just spent
[01:46:16.080 --> 01:46:21.600]   the past, I don't know month basically pumping out ebooks for uh take control books and
[01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:26.000]   Really all i've been doing is um editing and producing ebooks
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:31.280]   Uh very tightly so my my pick if you will is just something i've been working on a lot
[01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:35.360]   Which is um a new ebook. I've got it on my ipad here
[01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:39.040]   And i'll try to center it, but i'll also tell you what it's called
[01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:44.320]   It's called take control of mail on the ipad iphone and ipad touch
[01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:51.600]   It's written by joe kistle who writes for mac world and other uh popular
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:55.280]   Publications so a lot of people have probably
[01:46:55.280 --> 01:47:02.240]   Read his work and he just walks you right through exactly how to set up mail on your ios device
[01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:05.680]   How to make it work with iclog mail how to make it work with gmail
[01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:10.560]   All kinds of great stuff and uh, I think it's a great read. It certainly helped me a lot
[01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:16.240]   It's being very popular with our readers you can pick it up for ten dollars on the take control site
[01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:19.680]   and um, I think it's a pretty cool book
[01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:23.280]   Well, it must be pretty cool because it is a take control book
[01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:28.480]   I sometimes refer to take control as my off site deep understanding of things of
[01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:32.320]   Last time i had explained something in detail about a certain mac app
[01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:38.880]   As might have been like eight months previously and if i just buy a simple effective and inexpensive take control book
[01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:44.400]   I will remember everything that I thought I remembered knowing from the previous thing and I suddenly become smart again on that topic
[01:47:44.400 --> 01:47:49.680]   Chris what do you have for the first time i edit all the books it's because otherwise i wouldn't be able to use my mac
[01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:54.480]   Exactly you get a free copy with every every eight week
[01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:58.240]   editorial cycle not a very good compensation plan
[01:47:58.240 --> 01:48:01.840]   Chris, what do you have for us?
[01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:04.560]   Well, you know, we we are talking off a lot about um
[01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:09.040]   the kind of cool things that we can do with our computers and with iOS devices and
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:14.720]   Things that used to be difficult and expensive are now easy and quite affordable and one of the things that
[01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:17.760]   Um, I do in my off time as i'm a musician
[01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:21.920]   Um on the piano player, but I do other kinds of musical work as well
[01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:28.960]   And there is an application out for iOS called the dm-1 which is dm-1 the drum machine
[01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:30.640]   It's seven bucks
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:36.640]   And what it offers you is um a virtual drum machine that way back in the day
[01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:44.000]   We used to pay a lot of money for so people who know about this stuff if you think about the like the tr seven oh seven t r nine oh nine
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:47.440]   These are all cork beatboxes that have been adopted
[01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:51.920]   Um in the last 10 years or so by people who are doing hip hop and that kind of thing
[01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:57.920]   Um if you were buying one of these vintage boxes it would cost you a lot of money and even buying hardware
[01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:02.480]   Uh drum boxes are not cheap and now for seven bucks
[01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:06.240]   You can get a really wonderful drum machine
[01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:12.560]   Emulation so they've got all those samples in there from the old days plus they have new ones plus you can create your own samples
[01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:18.880]   So not only do they have grid recording, but they also have pads that you can tap on and you can play live if you want
[01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:22.480]   There's a mixer on there so you can do that you can add effects to things
[01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:27.520]   Um you can create songs just as you could in the old days having to strain together
[01:49:27.920 --> 01:49:30.400]   Patterns of beats which honestly is a pain in the neck
[01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:35.920]   But if you sort of like that old school way of creating beats and putting together compositions
[01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:43.920]   It's really cool. So this is just one example of this kind of thing where you can do for you know under ten dollars
[01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:48.880]   Have this very very powerful musical technology at your disposal
[01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:55.440]   Um, we have synthesizer modules that do the same thing that again 10 to 20 bucks that you're getting an old
[01:49:56.640 --> 01:50:01.920]   Mogue synthesizer for for nothing whereas you would pay you know thousands of dollars for these things
[01:50:01.920 --> 01:50:05.360]   So this is a great interface good sounds
[01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:09.680]   Cheap at seven bucks if you are at all interested in
[01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:13.760]   Creating little rhythm backgrounds to go with the other kind of stuff that you're doing elsewhere
[01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:18.320]   I heartily recommend it. It's a great app plus you can export your work
[01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:23.360]   And then take it into anything you like you can put it in a garage band if you want you can put it into logic or
[01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:27.600]   Former or Cubase or what one other music application you like
[01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:31.520]   Check it out if you're a musician or a wannabe musician you should give it a try
[01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:34.960]   Sounds like a fun thing to play with in a seven bucks
[01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:37.760]   You're there a lot of people are going to be having bar mitz
[01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:43.200]   They're gonna be having hanaka and or christmas gift money to spend or winter tree solstice money to spend
[01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:46.240]   In this form of it doing gifts cards kind of a cool thing to play with
[01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:49.280]   My pick of the week is not necessarily something that came out recently
[01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:53.280]   But it's something that I have recently rediscovered and found completely indispensable
[01:50:53.760 --> 01:50:59.280]   Um, this is not my pick of the week. This is the one of the very very early rifton technology
[01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:07.040]   Uh, ipad keyboards ipad stand and it's the aluminum murdered death weapon that actually keep right here next to my chair
[01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:12.080]   In the podcast studio to hold the machine that I use for squirrel pictures and stuff like that
[01:51:12.080 --> 01:51:19.680]   Um, but ipad stand technology has made incredible leaps forward and the exact same work being done by that device
[01:51:19.680 --> 01:51:22.320]   Is now being done for me on a daily basis by this device
[01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:25.200]   This is the epic wing stand
[01:51:25.200 --> 01:51:29.840]   Uh, yes, it is that simple that small but so much nicer
[01:51:29.840 --> 01:51:33.360]   Uh, what you're seeing it here is and it's portable of mode
[01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:36.000]   It's actually two halves that you can split apart
[01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:42.160]   That you can split apart. There you go. They click together for storage, but as i'm sure you can kind of figure out
[01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:43.360]   Uh
[01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:47.920]   You on the profile like that you just put one next to the other and then you can just simply
[01:51:48.320 --> 01:51:53.600]   Hang your hang your your ipad mini or your full-sized ipad or your kindle or any other device
[01:51:53.600 --> 01:51:58.000]   Ideally you would not be holding it all in one hand, but you i think you get what i'm talking about here
[01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:03.600]   Uh, the fact that there are two separate devices two separate elements means that it'll work with small devices
[01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:06.080]   It'll work with large tablets. It will work with little phones
[01:52:06.080 --> 01:52:09.840]   Uh, and the reason why it's becoming so critical for me is that
[01:52:09.840 --> 01:52:14.400]   Uh, as i said, I do use my ipad just as my normal like outside of the house computer
[01:52:14.400 --> 01:52:19.680]   Whether i'm uh going to be in a hotel room for a week or just going to be in a coffee shop near my house for two or three hours
[01:52:19.680 --> 01:52:22.160]   And i keep finding that i'm using these
[01:52:22.160 --> 01:52:28.320]   These nine-inch tablets sort of like as a second productivity screen for what as as a second window
[01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:30.720]   For whatever i'm doing on the ipad
[01:52:30.720 --> 01:52:35.360]   You know because the ipad is just a one window interface i can keep a web browser on the ipad mini
[01:52:35.360 --> 01:52:38.000]   I can keep like a netflix app or a music app
