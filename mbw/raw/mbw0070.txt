[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   Alright ladies and gentlemen, I guess you probably gathered.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   There's a pretty big panel here for Mac Break Weekly,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   our year ender.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   I'm going to do it in alphabetical order.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Hey.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Alex Lindsay, ladies and gentlemen, he is with the Pixel Core.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   What are you laughing at?
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   I have to go through. I'm looking at my fingers.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Alex, into the Pixel Core.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Can we talk speak?
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   And actually, not only a founding member of Mac Break Weekly,
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   but really the founder of Mac Break Weekly since you started Mac Break.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   And that spun off into the audio only version of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Yes, which is now the biggest thing.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Well, audio distributes a lot.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   You know, it really does.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   I think I was a much more of a video guy at the beginning of this year than at the end of the year.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   So we really look at the two of them working together,
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   and we really see that the audio for us will be, you know, when we look at podcasts now,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   we think those ones will have more listeners than the video ones.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   The video ones just serve a different use.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   They're getting all the attention because everybody thinks video is so sexy.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   So it really garners more attention.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Let's see.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Also in the A's, Andy, Ennaco from the Chicago Sun Times,
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Tondimes, and the colossal waste of bandwidth, and many, many books.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Hello, Andy.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   God bless us, everyone, Leo.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   And he's the tiny Tim of the bunch.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   I like that little wood-cross you fashioned out of your own.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   A lot of people like to take the Christ out of Christmas.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   I like to put them four of them back in to take this place.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Okay.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   We're treading on thin ice here.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   So where the fort?
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Yeah, it is.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   I know you've been shoveling.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Yes, I created a brick.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   I was so excited because it's been, we've had such a warm winter-like last year.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   We got basically nothing.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   I can't, I was so excited about snow that I actually like was watching it come down
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   and spent three minutes trying to put together the perfect snow shoveling I mix for, you know,
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   where like it's like nothing but like 70s funk, you know, not too fast so that you get a heart attack,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   but enough that you can get a good swing with a shovel and with an opera break every 10 minutes.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   It was really quite, and I understand you'll be offering that to our audience a little later on in the show.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   It is online.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   I make no money from this.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   I just want to help people, Leo.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   He's so generous.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Chris Breen is the Mac Daddy, the Buffont of all Mac knowledge from Mac,
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   from Mac, Mac, World Magazine, Hi, Chris.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   I got a T-shirt.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Put it on a T-shirt.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   I know I want a T-shirt at Expo, you know, out to everybody.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   I would like my own T-shirt with just the Buffont honey.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   You don't have to put me in there just there.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   And we really credit to Mac, for pointing that phrase.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   He's not with us today only because I've already got six people on Skype and I'm afraid I could actually
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   collapse the entire Skype infrastructure if I add any more people.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Oh, let's try.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Should I?
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Skype can collapse on a phone.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   It doesn't need help.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   It's very selfish.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Wait.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Andy's taken the role of Skype Hater away from Alex Lindsay.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Now that Alex is a T-1, he likes Skype again.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Yeah, it's nice.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Now that I have a fast connection.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   I'm ordering a T-1 actually.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   That's my Christmas present to it.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   I would suggest it to everyone.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   You know, if you have it, everyone should have a T-1.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Well, it's only 260 bucks.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   I was surprised to have an expense.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Well, if you were in Korea, you would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   You would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   You would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   You would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   You would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   You would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   You would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   You would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   You would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   You would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   You would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   You would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   You would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   You would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   You would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   You would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   You would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   You would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   You would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   You would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   You would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   You would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   You would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   You would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   You would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   You would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   You would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   You would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   You would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   You would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   You would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   You would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   You would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   You would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   You would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   You would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   You would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   You would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   You would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   You would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   You would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   You would say, "Why would I want that?"
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   I have a little bit of a medical thing in my throat,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   so if I sound craggy, there's a reason.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Oh, dear, I'm sorry. You actually sound great.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Sorry to hear that. I hope it all will be well.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   It will, someday.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   You ate too big of a turkey for dinner last night.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   I got stuck in your throat.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   No, no, no. I did the doctor have to leap on the table
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   and use a big pen to save your life.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   No, actually what happens is my neighbor asked me
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   to come fix his computer, and I thought he had a Mac
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   because I seen him bring a Mac box in,
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   and then I walked in and there was a Windows machine
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   and much like Kryptonite-fect Superman,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   I was immediately stricken.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   I thought I could have been mistaken here,
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   and then maybe it was just a flashback to better days,
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   but I just could have sworn I heard a little Merlin man
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   in the background there. That would be...
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Mm-hmm. Oh, hi, Leo. How are you?
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   Oh, my God. It's Merlin, man.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Hey! What are you guys doing in my room?
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   [ Laughs ]
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   This is awkward.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   That's the old Frank Sinatra line.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   How'd all you guys get in my room?
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   So Merlin, congratulations on the baby.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   We haven't talked to you since then.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Yeah, thank you. It's a lot of fun.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   She's enough. They weren't adorable.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   We'd be throwing them in a river.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   She's really cute and a lot of fun.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   It's really cute.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   And she's... I don't know.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   She's... I don't know. It's hard to describe.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   It's... You know, nobody cares.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   If you've had a kid, you understand,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   and if you haven't had a kid, you don't care.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   So... I think... Let's not gloss over this.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   Let me just ask you, is this, in fact,
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   the first baby that you conceived?
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   [ Laughs ]
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   That I'm aware of.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   That you know of.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   I'm just sort of picking up on something you said earlier.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Just to clear things up.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Mr. Man, I'm your love and love son.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   [ Laughs ]
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   I'm hoping there's not going to be...
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Maybe there are previous attempts
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   where the kid just didn't make the grade
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   after the pictures.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   It's room in the river?
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   I dropped for the police station.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Merlin's been watching.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Are there like four...
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Are there like four Merlin Man Moses,
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   like, saving the Israelites?
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   All my also rans.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   They're out there just talking really fast.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Not getting much done.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   [ Laughs ]
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   Who's my daddy's doing that?
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   This is the eighth-read basket
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   that Merlin Man has purchased.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   Now, I have to ask you, Merlin,
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   'cause I've been watching all your pictures on Flickr.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Are those public or are those...
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Yeah, most of them are public.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   They're great pictures you've been taken
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   with that 50-millimeter lens of...
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Oh, thanks.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   The Life with Eleanor series.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   Oh, you're nice.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   You know, it's really...
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Gosh, what do you say?
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   It's a lot of fun.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   And in the 50-millimeter lens,
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   it's something that might actually be interesting to people.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   I just can't say enough about that lens.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   And if you're gonna try and take stuff really fast
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   and you don't have time to think and get all fancy,
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   it's a hell of a lens.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   But how do you get a baby to wink on command?
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   That's what I'm curious about.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   I don't understand that.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   A lot of kind of idle threats
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   that we'll probably never follow through on.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   You know, we want to raise her to be very strong
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   and, you know, happy.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   But, you know, she's young.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   She's developing slowly.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   All the stuff that she's written a screenplay
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   that has no second act.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   So, you know, we were doing all kinds of things
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   to try and really bring her along, but she's still a baby.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   She's adorable.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   Merlin Man's photos are Flickr.com/photo/merlinman
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   with two ends.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   And yeah, there's some great pictures,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   just beautiful pictures of her.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   She's a beautiful baby.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Well, I appreciate you having me back.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   I mean, I just...
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   Oh, you know, we never have you back.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Oh, that is stuff out of the way.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   I mean, I've missed being with you guys,
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   and it's awfully nice of you to have me back.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   And thank you for your patience with my...
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Well, no, no.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   I figured you made a deal with Madelyn,
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   and she'd castrate you if you didn't take some time off.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   Oh, that's too late for that.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   That's...
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   It already happened, huh?
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   I'll get those back when Eleanor starts calling.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   Only child.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   She's a singleton.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   So, just out of curiosity, is this a return for good,
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   or are you going to take some more time off
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   and come back in February as planned?
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   No, the plan, I mean, really has just been to...
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   I mean, if there's one piece of advice,
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   because, you know, once you have a child,
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   you're entitled to give everybody advice about their life.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   The only piece of advice that would give people
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   is for as long as you can, trying to avoid commitments.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   It's mostly just...
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   It hasn't been a thing of like,
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   it's not like I'm not on the internet.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   I'm on Twitter 60 times a day.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   I know, you know, I noticed that by the way.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   No, it's just a question of, I think,
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   trying to not have more commitments than you can manage,
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   because there's always going to be something more important
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   that you need to be working on.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   So, that's what it's been.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   And as far as the show, yeah, I mean,
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   as far as I'm concerned, you know,
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   once we start back on a regular schedule...
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   Go on, start back until January anyway.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   This is our last show of the year, so...
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   Yeah, yeah, I mean, I don't see any reason
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   why not.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   Good.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   And I can pimp myself talking at Macworld for the first time.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Oh, excellent.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   Will that be part of the conference schedule?
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   No, I'll be out front.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   (laughter)
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   Passing out flyers.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   If me and Frank Chiu will be out front
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   talking about the 12 galaxies.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   (laughter)
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   Because we're going to be also on the show
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   floor there in the West Hall,
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   and that you can get into without a conference pass.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   So, that's what I asked.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   No, I'm speaking on the stuff that I talk about.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   I'm in the Visual Track talk about the stuff I talk about.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   The stuff you're talking about.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   Well, you know, your Merlin's mannerisms compiled
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   by John Hoffman has been a very big hit.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   I want to say I deeply regret my mistake on the last program
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   offering.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   I just said, you know, I don't know what I was thinking.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   I said, well, send me an email and I'll send you a copy.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   You hate email.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   Why would you ever say that?
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   Well, I really hate email now.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   Let me tell you.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   And I thought, well, I could easily set up an auto responder
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   and I won't have to do anything.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   And I struggled with Apple Mail for a long time
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   and never got a working auto responder.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   In fact, the people who first sent out notes to me
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   know because they got seven or eight blank emails from me.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   In fact, they would have continued getting blank emails from me
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   at the order of a dozen or so a day
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   had I not turned that thing off.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   So, I've been hand answering all of these.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   I'd like to tell people stop.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   Please stop.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   I've sent out Merlin.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   You'd be glad to know more than a thousand of these.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   That's ridiculous.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   I mean, half of them don't even make any sense.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   What am I on on this show?
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   I just, I...
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   (laughter)
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   Paging Merlin Man.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   No, they're great.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   But they're out of context, you know, in many cases.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   And as Merlin pointed out in his email,
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   giving permission for us to do this,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   some of his best stuffs on Twitter.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   So, what I'd love to see is a compilation of Merlin's Twitters.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Yeah, that would really...
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   I think it's fun that it's like a haiku for you,
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   isn't it, that 140-carat limit?
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   It's just like with Delicious.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   This is gotta be the most boring episode of this show ever.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Just like with Delicious, you know, you gotta fit that into whatever
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   100-some characters.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   I think it's a form type.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   It's just like poems.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   Well, you're quite good at it.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   See you next year, everybody.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   Thank you, Merlin Man, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   Anyway, please, if you want the Merlin's mannerisms,
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   it is a PDF, it is available for download,
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   and it couldn't be more simple.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   You just go to leoville.com/merlin.pdf.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   And that's all I've been sending people.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   I'm sorry, I got it wrong.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Already, I got it wrong.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   It's twit.tv.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   You email Leo if you have time.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   Oh, God, help me!
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   [laughter]
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   Twit.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   A thousand of them.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   Twit.tv/merlin.pdf.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   So, that's all you need to do.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   And then, if you go to Lulu and search for Merlin's mannerisms,
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   you can buy a printed version at cost.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   Are you kidding me?
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Oh, and not only that, Paul Stewart made an I-Cal version.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   So, you just add that as an I-Cal calendar.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   Lord.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   And every day of the year for 2008, you'll have a Merlin's mannerism.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   What a blessing.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   Isn't it great?
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   I think Merlin, I'm sorry to kind of take this away from you.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   It's baffling to me, but it's very sweet.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   We had a guy send me an email saying,
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   "I've registered merlin's mannerisms.com, and I'd like your permission."
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   And I said, "You know, I think Merlin would probably prefer you to do that."
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   Don't do that.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   He has a website.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   It's called 43folders.com.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   Am I still doing that?
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   Is that still up even?
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   Do you post to it?
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   You must...
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   Yeah, there's stuff all the time.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   We're going to edit all this out, right?
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   You'll fix all of this in post.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   I think that's Merlin's mannerism number 32, as a matter of...
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   It'll be a pure, like, 11 minutes of solid, mac-pundatry discussion of the news and issues of the day.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Thursday, July 17th, 2008.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   It's like an iPod bowling ball.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   Mac Break Weekly, number 27.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   Anyway, I'm just going to read those.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   One of those at the show.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   We don't have much Mac news.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   That's the problem.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   Let me get quickly to the Mac news.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   GarageBand...
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   What is it?
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   4.1.1.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   There's some new release of GarageBand.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   Chris Breen, what does this new GarageBand do?
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   Well, it enables a command to send GarageBand tunes to the iPhone.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   Woohoo!
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   So it...
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   You know, it's...
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   And typically, under mines, Apple's business model here on the...
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   Yeah, but you notice they didn't jump out and say, "Okay.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   We give, fine.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   You could put custom ringtones on your iPhone."
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Instead, they'd just sort of sneak it into GarageBand at the time, thumbing their nose at Windows users,
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   saying, "Oh, yeah, you could do it."
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   Oh, I'm sorry, you had to...
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   At least it was a 4.1.1.1.1.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   So you just push it out.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   Oh, I see what you're saying, then, 40 seconds.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   Nobody can do it.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   No Windows user can do it, because they don't have GarageBand.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   They don't have GarageBand.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   Whoops.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   Yeah, but isn't it cool when you see these features and you see somebody at Apple inside their little cubicle saying,
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   "To hell with this, I want this feature for me.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   I never have to tell anybody that it exists.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   I just want this piece of software to do this."
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   Oh, you don't think he went to Steve Jobs' hat and hat and hat and said, "May we please?"
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   Or...
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   Well, they're a bunch of other...
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   They're a bunch of really cool things.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   Like, when I was screen-shotting my Leopard book, you know, I'm using all these third-party utilities and all these stupid hacks to try to get really good, clean,
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   like, Windows and dialog boxes screen-shotted.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   And then I find out that the best tool is actually Command Shift 4, because Command Shift 4 Spacebar,
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   which gives you just a screenshot of the front with a specific targeted window, but in Leopard,
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   they change the way it gets done so that it doesn't just give you this punched-out window.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   It gives you a really cool drop shadow.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   It looks really, really professional, really, really slick.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   It turned a four-step process or an $80 utility for me into a built-in free thing.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   Look at that.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   Of course, this was after I spent $80 on Snap's Pro.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   I'm using Skitch, actually.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   I love Skitch, but you're right.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   This is very clean and easy.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   And when you do Command Shift 4, you have the little cursor selection, too.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   Does it do a shadow on that?
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   I don't believe it does a shadow on that.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   Let me try.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   But I've never had any for it.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   I will say that the one thing about Snap's that's nice is that when you can set up naming
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   conventions and stuff, when you do Command Shift 4, it's always like Picture 1.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   So if you're doing a lot of them, when we do, for the average person doing it, Snap Shift 4,
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   I mean, Snap Shift 4 is funny.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   I mean, Command 4 is plenty for like 90% of what you need, but if you're doing a whole bunch
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   of documentations is when it becomes a little bit.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   That's why you Skitch, because I can do some modifications, put arrows on and stuff.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   You know how to do a--
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   It's been a bit of a bit of a--
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   It's been a bit of a bit of a--
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   And you're using Skitch, have you figured out how to make a menu capture?
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   Yes, you know, it took me a while because it wasn't obvious.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   You turn on the timer.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   So there's a little timer.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   If you hold the Shift key when you do the-- so you take the Skitch menu, you select-- you
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   say, "Select Crosshair."
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   And then you press the Space-- I mean, the Shift key, and you'll get a counter.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   So you crosshair what you want, let's say, crosshair menu.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   And then you get counting down, and then I can select the menu while it's counting down.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   It has a little-- it does the little like movie countdown.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   Yeah, and then it gets the menu.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   And funny to get you to ask that.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   So it's the Skitch.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   Yeah, Skitch.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   I love it.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   And it's free.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   How ever-- Oh, I don't know.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   I mean, it's paid every now.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   You can use the best sign up for beta, yeah.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   They'll give you an email.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   But it's-- I wonder if--
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   I'll be free forever if they're going to-- they must want it to--
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   Plastwatch, or-- Sure, no charge.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   It's so good.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   It's worth paying for.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   Well, speaking of paying for, it is interesting when I have to switch between being a pundit
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   who can simply send an email and probably get things for free.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   And when my ethics tell me that, "Well, no, this is something you're getting just for personal projects,
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   so you have to buy it yourself."
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   For me, I love Snaps Pro's a great tool, but I just don't think it's an $80 good.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   Yeah, it's a little speck.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   For me, it's not an $80 good tool.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   It's like a $30 or $40 tool.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   If you did video, you would think it was.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   I mean, that's really real advantages.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   More than I should--
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   I show you.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   You look at better than I show you.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   No.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   Yeah, well, here's the thing.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   We now use-- I show you probably 80% of the time.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   For Mac break.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   For Mac break.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   And the reason is that Snaps Pro has this long delay.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   You just-- when you're done-- you know, you do--
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   It's a save app.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   It renders.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   You have to wait another 20 minutes for it to come out.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   Now, they've said-- they're working on it and everything else.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   But I show you is $20 and it'll do it when it's done.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   When you're done, you're done.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   Now, here's the problem with I show you is that if you do anything that requires video
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   or high-end 3D or anything else, it is much more processor-intensive than Snaps.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   And so if we record something that really needs that's going to be using a lot of the
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   computer OS as it's working, we go back to Snaps.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   And then for then, it's $80.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   It's still cheap because all the hardware that would be required to capture it well
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   is much more expensive.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   So if you're doing higher-end stuff, I think the $80 is cheap.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   I mean, on the PC, the one that's like Snaps is about $300.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   There's a really-- oh, no, there's a really-- oh, okay.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   For video?
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   Okay.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   Well, there's a really great screen capture gap for Windows called Snagit.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   Same people.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   That's the same people in version.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   Text mics.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   Okay, cool.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   No, Snagit's great.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   But you need Camtasia Studio if you want to do the Hia.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   Textmith's doing something for the Mac too, right?
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   What is there?
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   They're doing the same thing for the Mac.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   They have jinx.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   Isn't jinx?
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   J-I-N-G.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   That's what it is.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   That's actually a very interesting product.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   It's great.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   You know, what it's really designed for is not guys like us trying to do something
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   that's kind of professional, but what it's really designed for is if you want to send
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   someone something a little bit of how to do something or ask someone a question,
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   it's really what's great about it, set up a piece of Mac.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   And if you just want to just, it's like a visual note, like I can't really understand
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   why this isn't working or whatever.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   It's a much easier way to do video on that as well as screen capture.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   Exactly.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   And it's free.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   And they plan to keep this one free.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   jingproject.com.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   We've mentioned all of these I think is as freeware.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   But to get back, do you come back for one minute and we're at whole mania?
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   I mean, it's- I wasn't going to say anything, but we were talking about making
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   ringtones and garage bands.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   Can we pop the stack and get back to ringtones and garage band, Chris Breen?
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   Hello.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Thank you for your patience, Chris.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   Yes.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   Your call is important, guys.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   Thank you very much.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   You know, I was listening a little music in the background.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   There's Leo sled Zeppelin, I think.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   Dazed and confusing.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   It's like three versions of Dazed and Confused and that complete lead Zeppelin, by the way.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   I just want to let you know.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   Yeah, because you say, well, there's BBC live.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   It's a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a confusion.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   So, yeah.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   So you could do ringtones.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   Did I mention you could do ringtones and garage band now?
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   And you can't use it if you're using Windows because-
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   Article 307108, someone has very kindly added to the Mac break weekly list.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   How to create custom ringtones and garage bands.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   So this is an official thing.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   Website and everything.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   Yeah, they have an Apple tech note on it.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   They're trying to stay out of their record company's radar because the whole record industry
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   is adamant about the fact that a ringtone is a derivative use and should be paid for.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   I think their defense here, Leo, is that this is garage band with the idea that you're working
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   with royalty-free loops and stuff that you create.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   No, it's okay.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   So can you not use-
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   Yeah, but I think we get into this thing.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   Did it in iTunes?
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   If you made it available in iTunes, people would obviously be clipping copy-written material.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   If you put it into GarageBand, well, they could be doing anything, just like you could use
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   your VCR for many things, even though most of what we do is report shows.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.520]   So I think it's the idea that you're using it inside of something that has a lot of other
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.400]   uses, and I think that's probably why I ended up in GarageBand and not iTunes.
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:40.000]   But there's no reason that I couldn't import a wave that is an action song.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   You can do anything you want.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.200]   You just can't bring in the DRM stuff.
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.680]   Of course, there are ways around that as well.
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:50.080]   So you just do whatever you like and make any custom ringtone you want.
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:54.120]   But it has to be 40 seconds just as it is in iTunes.
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:59.440]   And nice things when you export it, it will offer to create the ringtone for you.
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:01.920]   If you've created something too long, it will cut it down for you.
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.840]   Or it will say, "All I have to do is press the loop button here and then it'll work."
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:06.200]   So cool.
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.520]   And then it just syncs up to your iPhone and there you have it.
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:10.720]   Yeah, it automatically tags it properly.
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:11.880]   So you've got the right extension.
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:15.320]   It shows up in the ringtone's entry in iTunes and you sync your iPhone.
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:16.320]   It works.
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:19.160]   I just, I think the record is pretty much taken.
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:23.640]   It still just seems like an awful lot of work to go through just to have my hums come on
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:24.840]   every time your mom calls.
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:27.640]   How do you know I have my hums for my mom?
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.680]   I just guessed, well, your mom emailed me.
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:30.680]   She's very concerned.
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:34.840]   She wants to know how to set up call screening.
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:36.360]   My nickname for is Lady Humps.
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:37.360]   That's why.
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.680]   You're a class actor.
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:40.680]   Is that not right?
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:42.280]   I'm going to go get a soda.
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:43.280]   I'll see you guys.
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:46.280]   Can we play the rat home music just so I can remember it?
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:47.920]   Oh, rat home music.
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.080]   Where have I stuck that?
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:54.440]   Another symptom of how out of the loop I am just on a kind of molecular level.
[00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.440]   I heard a thing on NPR.
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.680]   I had no idea how big the ringtone market was.
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.480]   I mean, so when you're talking about- Billions.
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:02.840]   Yeah, and I guess for some companies, it's a huge piece of their revenue stream and how
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:03.840]   they think about marketing.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:07.000]   And actually the piece that was on all things considered where all 40 year old people learn
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.800]   about popular culture.
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:13.800]   What was talking about this one artist, this dude who like, he's like the king of ringtones.
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.600]   He's got these like, just, I don't even know the guy's name.
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:18.960]   I'm sure one of you kids with the radio and the rat music can tell me what the guy's
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:19.960]   name is.
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.720]   But it's a huge, hugely lucrative market.
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.440]   And I would just have to imagine that this would really tweak their nose.
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:25.440]   I think so.
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:26.440]   I know that that's-
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:28.880]   They've been very adamant that the ringtones are derivative.
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.320]   What's interesting is that the artist doesn't get the money.
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.880]   And this is why the record industry is so adamant about it.
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:36.360]   It's pure profit right in their pocket.
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:39.880]   So along the lines of that crap that's going on with the WGA where the writers weren't
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:42.960]   getting paid for promotion stuff, that's tacky.
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.040]   Exactly.
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:48.960]   So they get, this is a big, those $9 billion or whatever it was, goes straight to the recording
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:51.200]   industry, not to the artists.
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.880]   Unless of course I'm sure their artists would have made a deal that they would get derivative.
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:55.880]   But-
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:56.880]   No, it's big bucks for them.
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:00.560]   And I'm gonna have to say it's because I think that as a matter of fact, Merlin Mann gets
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:03.480]   25 cents every time he plays this.
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.200]   Ah, there we go.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.200]   Come on now.
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:07.200]   Ah.
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:11.000]   No derivatives without maybe creating the more random stuff.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.360]   Does it make an excellent ringtone if we didn't talk all over it?
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:16.680]   But that's why we do.
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:17.680]   Not copy.
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:18.680]   Not copy.
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:19.680]   Not copy.
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:23.120]   Byron and this call is not for you.
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:25.520]   Who wants the copyright to heart and soul?
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.520]   Oh, whoops.
[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:27.520]   Wait a minute.
[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:28.520]   Whoops.
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:29.520]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.520]   Let's get the question.
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:31.520]   Let's find out.
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:33.160]   Paul Minshaw, the creator of that rat hole theme.
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:35.080]   And I just sent Paul a check.
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:39.560]   Maybe as our gift to the users, we should all go around the table and each like produce
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:43.160]   one clean ringtone, like a family of six.
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.360]   That's a great idea.
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:49.280]   Like, okay, so you start Andy and Akko if you've got in mind.
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:51.000]   We should have a minute to think about it probably.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.880]   Well, I'll get to you last then, Merlin.
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:56.320]   So so I'm the retard because I don't have one.
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:57.720]   Didn't you wait a minute.
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.240]   Did you get the memo about getting your ringtone ready?
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.960]   Cut my soup for me.
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:06.800]   I'll give you one from Merlin's mannerism Saturday, August 16, 2008.
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:08.800]   Mac break weekly number 16.
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:10.800]   They ate the booger.
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:15.840]   You know, you should do all of them for us because you've got that resonance.
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:16.840]   I could read them.
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:18.720]   I could read them.
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:23.240]   I sound like a like a balloon with the air slowly being released.
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:25.720]   And you have this resonant sonorous voice.
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:29.720]   I'll do it in the or some Tuesday, September 30, 2008.
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:32.600]   Mac break weekly number 38.
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:37.840]   Middleware has never been more important, especially as we look into server based tag
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.040]   solutions.
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.480]   It'll scale across the enterprise.
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:45.920]   Do you side work for NFL films by the chance?
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.520]   It was a rainy day on cross leave for you.
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:49.520]   But leave for you.
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:50.920]   And his ring, babe, packers.
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:53.040]   That would be another day.
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.560]   I interviewed that guy.
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:58.480]   But what's his name with the glasses glued to his forehead?
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:59.480]   He's great.
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:00.480]   Those are amazing.
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:02.920]   Anyway, Andy, do you have a.
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:03.920]   Wait a minute.
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:05.080]   Rad Hall.
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:06.080]   Do you have a.
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:07.480]   Rad Hall.
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.560]   Do you have we should make that a ringtone?
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:14.400]   Do you have a ringtone that you would like everybody will now be silent as Andy gives
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.200]   us his ringtone?
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:17.200]   Okay.
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:28.400]   Well, let's let's cut our cut, you know, for editing three, two, one.
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.560]   Just repeat that over and over.
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:30.560]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:33.560]   Boy, will you race to get that?
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:34.960]   That's a monster.
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:38.800]   Have you ever heard the most annoying sound in the world that was it?
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.200]   Does anybody else want to volunteer a ringtone?
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:42.280]   I'll try one.
[00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:43.280]   Okay.
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:44.280]   Ready?
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:47.080]   This is mainly for Nokia phones.
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:48.080]   Nokia?
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:49.080]   Nokia.
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.080]   Nokia phones.
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:52.080]   But it's a work on any of them.
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:53.080]   Are you ready?
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:54.080]   That should be the ringtone.
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.080]   Nokia.
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.080]   Nokia.
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:57.080]   Nokia.
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:58.080]   Nokia.
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.080]   Nokia.
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:00.080]   No, you're no.
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:01.080]   Kai.
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:02.080]   No, cut by.
[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.080]   Okay.
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:04.080]   Here you go.
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:04.920]   Ready?
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:05.920]   That's annoying.
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:07.640]   Oh, that's bad.
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:11.440]   Because we used to have a woman in the office that would just let her.
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.200]   Isn't that the first thing you changed is that stupid.
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.640]   Doody, doody, doody, doody, doody.
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:17.120]   And it just goes on and on.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:18.120]   And then there's a t-mobile.
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:22.480]   Everyone in the office would join us in singing that song every time we're on with
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.480]   her.
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:27.680]   We have a Twit theme actually that is me doing that and the very talented Ashley Whit turned
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.360]   it in to a tire theme song.
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:32.440]   It's really annoying.
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:34.400]   Really annoying.
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:37.920]   So yeah, a T-Mobile has its default ringtone.
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:41.720]   But every time I hear that, I wait for Catherine Zeta-Jones to show up.
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.920]   I actually never does.
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:45.720]   She can change your diapers too.
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:49.360]   I'm like, there's a picture of Eleanor that you've put tags.
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:52.280]   I use the flicker tags thing.
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:55.320]   This is what her eyes look like most of the time you never get to see them.
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.800]   And then of course it's got the diaper and she's got a Winnie the Pooh diaper.
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:58.800]   You just write the word pun.
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:27:59.800]   Right on the...
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:00.800]   It's true.
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:01.800]   I love that.
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:02.800]   It's full of poo.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:07.320]   Oh, here's another one.
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:09.400]   Wednesday, November 5th, 2008.
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:11.760]   Mac break weekly number 18.
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.160]   I still zap the P-ram.
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:18.200]   I don't even know why.
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:19.200]   It's going to be...
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:25.800]   Once it's edited down, this is going to be 11 rock solid minutes of pure Mac punt entry.
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.520]   Every opinion is going to be fact chapped.
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:28.520]   Is there any?
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:29.520]   No, no, no.
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:30.520]   I have one.
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:31.520]   Yes.
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:32.520]   Okay.
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:33.520]   I have a whole phone show.
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:41.000]   A guy sent me a blog post from Japan saying that the iPhone was doing really well in Japan.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.240]   And I couldn't understand that because it's not available in Japan.
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:49.720]   So this ringtone is for all those people in Japan who think they have an iPhone.
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:52.520]   Gomen nesai wakat dimasen.
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:56.040]   Gomen nesai wakat dimasen.
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.040]   And that means?
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:58.040]   I'm sorry.
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:59.040]   I don't understand.
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:00.040]   That's good.
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:02.480]   That's all the Japanese you need to know, really.
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:03.480]   Gomen nesai wakat dimasen.
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:04.480]   That's the way you get through Japan.
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.960]   Gomen nesai, excuse me, don't understand.
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:07.960]   Gomen nesai wakat dimasen.
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:09.960]   Don't touch my mustache.
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:12.400]   American speak my language, damn it.
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:15.400]   That's good.
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:16.400]   Yeah.
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:17.400]   Yeah.
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:18.400]   How about this?
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:19.400]   Women.
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:27.000]   You know, I think we've gotten raffles for our raffles on this show.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.480]   Speaking of custom ringtones on the...
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:32.480]   Here we go.
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:33.480]   And I got mine.
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:34.480]   Here we go.
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:35.480]   Hello, bardars.
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:37.320]   Oh, that's good.
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:38.320]   I like that.
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:39.960]   Well, we've got 40 minutes into this.
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:43.560]   For those of you who we've managed to cover one topic, Leo, we're really on spot on today.
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:44.920]   I think we're right on target.
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:46.920]   But we've covered so many things along the way.
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:47.920]   Friday.
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:50.000]   October 10th, 2008.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.120]   Mac break weekly number 34.
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:56.760]   Mine is not sexy per se.
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:59.520]   So what do we think we're going to see at Macworld?
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:02.120]   We asked that every damn show for the last six weeks.
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:03.920]   But it's closer to new news.
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:04.920]   There's new news.
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:05.920]   There's new news.
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:06.920]   What is the new news?
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:07.920]   I'm going to make a prediction.
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:08.920]   Okay.
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:09.920]   Okay, prediction.
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:10.920]   Two words, everybody.
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:11.920]   iPhone cases.
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:12.920]   Yes.
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:16.080]   I saw it on a rumor site.
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.160]   They have some pictures.
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:18.160]   I don't really believe...
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:21.120]   I think they've been photoshopped, but it makes sense if you think about it.
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:22.120]   iPhone.
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:23.120]   I don't know.
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:24.120]   I just... I don't see it happening, Andy.
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:25.640]   I just... I think that's not the right time.
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:26.640]   I think...
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:27.640]   I'm under NDA.
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.960]   I'm really limited as to what I can say.
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:34.560]   All I'm saying is go to the North Hall.
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:35.560]   North Hall.
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:36.560]   And look anywhere.
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:37.560]   Look anywhere.
[00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:41.000]   Look around anywhere you can see.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.880]   Look for the faces of people with shocked, astonished and delighted faces.
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:49.040]   Now seriously, does anybody have any real ideas?
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:55.000]   Because I have to go on Bloomberg television in three hours and say something.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.960]   Let's do a mind hack on the entire media.
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:03.000]   Let's feed Scott with lots of information that they'll eat up that will never have
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   eaten.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   No, it's two words.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.560]   It's Beatles iPod.
[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:13.520]   Even in my half-assed following of All Things Mac, it seems like there's a... whatever the
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:18.240]   opposite of a consensus is about what this mini laptop is going to be.
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:22.440]   It's going to be shiny or matte or silver or black or 13 or 14 or flash-based or hard
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:24.720]   drive or obstacle drive or no obstacle drive.
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.920]   So it's definitely going to be some combination of those.
[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:29.640]   Now, but Scott, you said there's new...
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:32.560]   What is the news information?
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:33.560]   I didn't say there was new information.
[00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:34.800]   Who said there was Chris Breen?
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:35.800]   Was there new information?
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:37.840]   No, I think that Piper has said it.
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:41.400]   It's more of just really getting down to... I think the more details... I was saying that
[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:43.440]   because I'm actually very interested in this thing.
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:46.840]   I think like Merlin, I really want something small that I can carry around and I'm voting
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:51.280]   for a big... I'm voting for a giant iPhone with a keyboard.
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:52.280]   That's pretty wonderful.
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:57.320]   On one of those endless site, I've got my little tab set for quote unquote "preparing"
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:02.520]   for this show where I learn what happened in Apple the week before.
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:04.560]   There are supposedly sightings.
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:05.560]   Where did I see this?
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:09.800]   Did you guys heard the sightings of a little skinnier notebook on Apple's campus?
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.360]   Has anyone else heard this?
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:15.120]   Yes, it's called an ACES EP-C.
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:16.600]   It's running OS X.
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:22.960]   I think there's actually going to be a new iMac and a new Mac Pro because I just bought
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:23.960]   one.
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:24.960]   I bought two of those.
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:25.960]   Wait a minute.
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:26.960]   Not too soon for the iMac.
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:27.960]   I have a bought one.
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:28.960]   I'm still asking.
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:29.960]   I'm just asking how much I bought.
[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:30.960]   No, I'm holding off.
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:32.760]   It was right after Mac World January.
[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:33.760]   I bought a 17.
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:34.760]   Do you remember that?
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:40.640]   I will say I have something that I found out by buying a iMac and a MacBook last week
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:44.480]   from Amazon is that you have to be really careful about.
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:47.320]   Those of you who still buy for Christmas and if you're buying for Christmas, you better
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:48.320]   hurry up.
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.920]   This is like your last day that you can do this.
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:55.080]   You got to make sure that there's actually leopard installed on the computer.
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:57.880]   Anyone who's not Apple.
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:01.920]   I think this is actually useful because we had a computer and I had Tiger on it.
[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:02.920]   I called him.
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:03.920]   I said, "It's got Tiger on it."
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:04.920]   They said, "Well, it says it's a Tiger."
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:07.000]   Somewhere in the fine print it says it has Tiger on it.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.600]   Then you have to fill out a little form and fax it to Apple.
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:14.240]   Then for $9.95, they'll send you leopard, but it'll ruin the Christmas experience.
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:17.920]   I just got an iMac for my mom.
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:21.480]   Tiger was on the hard drive, but leopard was in the box.
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:24.760]   Yeah, I had Tiger on the hard drive and Tiger in the box.
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:26.960]   Ooh, is it one of those is frustrating?
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:27.960]   Yeah, it's...
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:28.960]   Well, I understand.
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:32.440]   Here's the thing is I understand the Tiger in the...
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:35.240]   I understand Tiger on the computer and leopard in the box.
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:39.560]   What I don't understand is not getting leopard into the box or even packaging it.
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:40.560]   I mean, it's Amazon.
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:43.760]   It comes in a box like four times bigger than the actual box was.
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:47.960]   There's plenty of room to throw a leopard in there.
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.680]   They could have even charged me $10 more.
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:52.080]   I wouldn't have cared.
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:57.040]   What really stuck was that it showed up and then I have to sort this out when I have a
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.680]   couple of days to do it.
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:02.680]   I just got a copy of leopard.
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:04.520]   Historically, historically, how they handled that?
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:06.520]   What's the usual cutting off point?
[00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:11.000]   I mean, obviously, if you buy a refurbished laptop, it's probably not going to have leopard
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   on it.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   Chris, in Chris and your experience, when do they usually...
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   When's the cut off in terms of the...
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.640]   Well, in terms of the Mac that I got from my mom, this was Thanksgiving and Apple.
[00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:21.760]   I got it at an Apple store.
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:23.440]   So Apple was right on top of it.
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:28.080]   Yeah, I got my mom a MacBook for her birthday in November and it had leopard on it.
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:29.080]   Yeah, I think that's...
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:30.440]   If you find it from Apple, you're going to...
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:31.440]   This is...
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:32.440]   I bought it from Amazon.
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:33.440]   Mostly because I've just gotten to go...
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:35.440]   How dusty was that box?
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.960]   I made that a plastic or was it metal?
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:38.960]   I was surprised.
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:43.120]   Do you think that Amazon is a big reseller of Mac products?
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:47.960]   I just figured that they would be current and they weren't.
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:52.320]   So it's just something people to look at with the third party.
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:54.080]   I usually buy all the hardware just from Apple.
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:55.440]   I don't even try to find anything else.
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:57.080]   I don't look at anything else.
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:00.840]   But I've been buying so much stuff from Amazon lately for Christmas and around the baby.
[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:02.040]   I mean, with the baby and everything else.
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:06.320]   I mean, the great thing about Amazon is we own the top of a third story and it's kind
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:07.320]   of inconvenient parking.
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:11.280]   And I won't even go shopping because I just know they'll carry it up the stairs and deliver
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:15.280]   it to my apartment.
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:18.400]   So I just order everything from Amazon right now.
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:21.160]   And this was the first time I've really had any kind of real problem.
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:24.200]   But anyway, it was just one of those things that it was a real surprise.
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:29.680]   And I think that if you're listening and you're buying computers as I did, you might want
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:30.680]   to keep your eye on that.
[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:32.280]   Wednesday is the cutoff.
[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:35.800]   Wednesday is the cutoff for free two day shipping if memory serves.
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:36.800]   Is that right?
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.800]   Wednesday the 19th.
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:39.800]   The real thing.
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:45.000]   But I got to say also, I have Amazon Prime and it's $3.99 or I have them ship a radiator
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   heater.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.480]   Oh, yeah, that's our best thing about Prime.
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:52.440]   It's like it's like it's a radiator heater that must weigh like 20 or 30 pounds.
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:55.320]   And I have them send it to me overnight for $3.99.
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:58.760]   I mean, my Amazon Prime usage.
[00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:00.760]   It's not a big funny amount.
[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:02.240]   I was a Prime usage would make Al Gore cry.
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:04.240]   It's just it's stuff that I have delivered as pathetic.
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:05.240]   I have trucks.
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:08.920]   You sort stuff by weight when you order at Amazon just to see the heaviest thing you can
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:10.400]   send them for the last amount of money.
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:13.680]   Well, the thing is that here's the other thing that was that then my Apple care costs $3.99
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:14.680]   to FedEx as well.
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:16.320]   You know, so it's anything.
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:17.320]   Everything's happening.
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:19.600]   Send you a concept in a number.
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:22.840]   They give you a box inside of a box with packet.
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:24.840]   But what they're all just out the window.
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:27.600]   I'm thinking of getting a washing machine like sent to us overnight.
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:28.600]   No, get a piano.
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:29.600]   Okay.
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:31.000]   So this is portable.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.120]   This portable now now based on what you guys here.
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:37.120]   Do you think this is going to be is a LCD screen flash drive?
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:39.520]   What do you what I have not been keeping up?
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:40.520]   What do you guys think it's going to be?
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:41.960]   I think it'll be that screen.
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:44.080]   That's screen LCD for sure.
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:45.080]   I think I have a flash.
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:46.080]   I don't know.
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.080]   You'll have a flash drive.
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:51.200]   And the reason is those those things were out way too fast and it's so much more expensive.
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:55.040]   A 60 gig flash drives 2500 bucks.
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:37:00.480]   So I know that I know that there are people who are making flash drives micro notebook
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.600]   like sub notebooks next year.
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:08.600]   I can't talk about them, but I know that this is going to be a brand new category for 2008.
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:10.120]   But initially we very pricey.
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:14.480]   And I think when people find out how quickly those drives were out, they're going to be
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:15.640]   sorry they bought one.
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:16.640]   So I don't see.
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:23.000]   They're out moving parts because every time you write flash it damages it slightly.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   So they all have limited right cycles.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.640]   I don't know.
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:29.440]   When was the last time?
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:30.440]   No, it's a fact.
[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:35.240]   When was the last time you bought a computer with Apple on it, Leo?
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:39.200]   Well, the IMAC, the metal IMAC was about six months ago.
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:40.480]   I'm due for a new laptop.
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:43.120]   I would like to buy a sub notebook.
[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:44.120]   Absolutely.
[00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:46.640]   I think everybody's got it wrong about the sub notebook.
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:50.960]   I don't you know, I don't see Apple going that direction as hard as everybody thinks
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:51.960]   they are.
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:58.440]   It's going to be a laptop to mirror the power book, the 12 inch power book in the Mac book
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:37:59.440]   line.
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:03.400]   But I don't think all this fancy stuff with flash drives and everything else they're
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:04.400]   ready for it.
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.320]   Because like you say, the price point would be too high.
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:10.640]   And it also goes against the way they tend to build computers, which they tend to build
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:14.320]   very powerful computers that look really good that are cutting edge.
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:16.680]   It might be the cutting edge part, but it wouldn't be that powerful.
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:18.240]   Do you think they'll do a touch screen?
[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:21.160]   No, Steve Jobs said.
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:22.560]   Unless he was doing one of his conditions.
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:26.240]   He also said no one will ever watch video on a portable device.
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:27.240]   I know.
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:28.240]   I'm just saying what he said.
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:29.240]   He said no.
[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:34.640]   He said that as recently as the IMAC launch, the new IMAC launch, Connie from Bloomberg asked
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:37.320]   him from the audience, what about touch screen?
[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:39.880]   He said, I look at that as like a personal project.
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.760]   He was very dismissive.
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:42.760]   Yeah.
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:43.760]   It seemed realistic.
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:48.000]   Well, I also have to wonder if they're if they have the if they have the resources at
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.720]   this point to launch, what's essentially a new operating system?
[00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:55.760]   I mean, they have a hard enough time getting leopard out the door now.
[00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:56.760]   Right.
[00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:57.760]   So they're like a whole other OS.
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:58.760]   That's a good point.
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:03.240]   Unless they, unless they, the hooks and the technology iPhone and just applying it.
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.240]   Well, maybe they put it in less.
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:07.440]   Yeah, but it's that going to be satisfactory in a in a laptop.
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:12.200]   I I've always said that there has there's a hidden reason why Apple delayed the release
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:17.080]   of the iPhone software development, the API, the software developer kit so long and why
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:21.480]   they didn't even want to announce it or give a target timeline for when it was going to
[00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:22.480]   be released.
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:27.360]   And I think that it's because the operating the the the software development kit is for
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:29.280]   writing more than just iPhone apps.
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:34.680]   It's also I'm guessing for writing software for devices and computers that have not been
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:35.680]   released yet.
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:36.680]   Touch screen.
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:37.680]   I would I would not be sure exactly.
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:40.040]   I don't think that we're going to ever see a touch screen Mac.
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:41.680]   I would not be I've said this before.
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:44.480]   I think I'm on on Scott's podcast.
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:48.520]   But if you take a Mac book screen like the the smaller the original Mac book, not the
[00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:54.600]   Mac book pro, cut it in half, get a tablet about that size somewhere between a little
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:57.080]   larger than that a Newton message pad screen.
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:00.840]   Make that into a touchscreen computer where it has a good on screen keyboard.
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:05.160]   It can has more real estate for real applications and give people the ability to have a wireless
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:07.160]   keyboard via Bluetooth.
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:11.080]   That is an interesting product.
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:12.080]   I agree.
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:14.440]   Yeah, I totally I so interested.
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:19.720]   In thinking about what would happen if you got some kind of a keyboard.
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:22.000]   Either a keyboard I guess a keyboard for your iPhone.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.320]   I guess sounds kind of crazy.
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:27.280]   But like to me that would that kind of changes the game.
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:31.440]   If you could if you could have a keyboard on your iPhone, of course, now I'm also required
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:35.120]   by law to mention that I'm still very interested in what Google and Apple will eventually come
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:37.360]   up with because I still think that's a game changer.
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:40.400]   The other thing is like what do you think they'll ever introduce something that's easier
[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:43.040]   use your iPhone as a modem.
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:46.280]   The problem with that is AT&T.
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:48.640]   And they don't I think that I'd be surprised if you see that.
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:52.400]   I mean they should it'd be a great product but AT&T first of all AT&T is edges too slow.
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:53.600]   So you have to wait a sec.
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:54.600]   HSDPA.
[00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:57.360]   I just I figure there's the thing here's the thing that I think is really interesting and
[00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:59.080]   crazy and I'm totally pointing this out of my butt.
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:04.480]   But the so they just came out with this really successful iPhone Mac books seem to be selling
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:05.480]   a pace right.
[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:08.960]   It's not like they're you know it's not like they're kind of rethinking.
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:10.520]   Oh Apple TV is not doing that well.
[00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:11.520]   So let's redo that.
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:17.560]   What what could they do that would really really really shake things up without cannibalizing
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:19.440]   either Mac books or iPhones.
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:23.040]   I mean do you guys like Andy do you think that's concerned that it would cannibalize
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:29.000]   the sales of either Mac books or I was because Apple has always been Apple has always been
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:36.880]   the single company that tells a consistent and deep story with its product line where
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:42.560]   you don't you know if if they were writing a romantic comedy they don't have three quirky
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:46.600]   single male next door neighbors when Cameron Diaz is the star because well look we already
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:50.920]   have the quirky next door neighbors she can confide and why are we gonna why are we building
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:52.400]   two or three these in here.
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:55.440]   They always make sure that okay we have a desktop solution.
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:56.800]   We have a notebook solution.
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:59.120]   We have a pocket portable solution.
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:05.680]   Anything that we add to this will have to not only stake out its own territory and do different
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:11.080]   things from the product line but also support and enhance everything you're doing.
[00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:14.920]   And you could you could argue in some ways that it was failing at that that caused a
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:16.400]   lot of missteps in the 90s.
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:17.400]   Yes.
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:21.040]   Because there was so much overlap and it was so confusing and that's kind of what I'm
[00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:22.040]   thinking here.
[00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:25.640]   So here's my only thought on this is that there there I don't know I don't follow this
[00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:30.280]   business stuff but I have to assume that on on some level between iPods and iPhones there's
[00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:34.200]   a fair amount of penetration into what it previously been thought of as uncharted territory
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:35.800]   being PC users.
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:42.000]   Now you've got as John Gruber pointed out in the awesome new Rankin Bass esque PC versus
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   Mac commercials.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:49.320]   They make a point of talking about the PC is a PC the PC is not Windows right.
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:51.720]   I mean that's kind of an important distinction.
[00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:54.480]   Macasing you know what not you better not cry.
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:58.240]   I've accidentally started the Rankin Bass go ahead and I'll start up play it after.
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:01.120]   Because anyway I'm kind of just gathering the thoughts but it just occurs to me that
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:06.320]   they've done so much to make this penetration into this area that they could have formerly
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:08.240]   never gotten into.
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:12.360]   When people can go out and buy a micro notebook right now right I mean they're making still
[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:14.120]   there's no making stuff like Sony Vios.
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:15.120]   Absolutely.
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:18.760]   You can still so I agree with you Andy I think it's really fascinating to think about
[00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:22.320]   like what could they do that makes somebody who loves their iPhone.
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:26.400]   Yeah where's the whole what's that there exactly their next Apple thing for somebody
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:31.080]   who loves their iPhone and loves the iPod like what is the thing that we totally don't
[00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:35.120]   expect the make a PC user go okay that's pretty bad.
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:40.000]   I do think we're looking at a tablet finally a tablet computer that really really works
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.840]   Windows the windows side has a tablet operating system as a matter of fact support for tablets
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:49.280]   is built into Windows Vista instead of being a separate operating system but it is you
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:54.400]   would not tell the difference between a screenshot of a tablet PC and a screenshot of a desktop
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:57.600]   PC except for the change in screen orientation.
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:03.760]   If we had a small tablets you could call it an iPhone but if you had a tablet sized iPhone
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:08.360]   and not the size of a sheet of paper and talk about the size of a good index card.
[00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:14.680]   You keep the same mode of use as with an iPhone and with most pocket devices where you're
[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:19.320]   doing one thing at a time and if you want to and if you want to switch from working on
[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:24.320]   a Word document to to working on the web browser you don't have overlapping windows you just
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:30.880]   mentally switch into a mode where you're using web browser that sort of a device would be
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:34.800]   a very very new and a very very well received product.
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:35.800]   Right.
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:39.960]   It's on the iPhone iPhone flavor of the West 10 runs this runs exact same runs exact same
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:45.680]   OS as iPhone uses the same APIs as the iPhone on top of everything else it would also be
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:49.840]   the most awesome movie player and the most awesome music library.
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:56.840]   Exactly. Throw in a book reader if you think the basic underlying idea is whereas the
[00:44:56.840 --> 00:45:01.880]   iPhone is a shirt pocket device think of this little tablet as a jacket pocket device.
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:05.880]   So more like a Nokia 810 with the OS 10 running on.
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:12.280]   Again nice clean black tablet with chrome board around it no visible buttons no visible
[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:16.800]   keyboards if you want to type really really fast find give somebody thirty bucks and five
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:17.800]   keyboard.
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:18.800]   I like that.
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:22.960]   Chris Breen what do you think what's the hole in apples product line.
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:28.560]   You know right now I think it's we're waiting for the other shoe to drop on the Apple TV.
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:31.680]   Recently somebody said it was a huge failure.
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:37.840]   Ten worst gadgets of 2007 according to popular mechanics number two of the ten.
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:38.840]   Not my Apple TV.
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:44.680]   I love my Apple TV and I think people who don't get it who don't have one but the content
[00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:50.040]   is the other part of it and that's what needs to be done if we had rentals that would that
[00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:54.920]   would be it you know we wouldn't have to do Netflix if we didn't care to anymore if
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:59.160]   the catalog is big enough but yeah you know I don't know how Apple is going to pull this
[00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:03.920]   off because apparently they're at loggerheads with the content folks so unless Apple is
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:10.640]   willing to give in a big way to people like universal NBC I'm not quite sure how this
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:13.200]   is going to happen but that's what's going to save the Apple TV.
[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:16.560]   What's your is interesting to think about I mean I just keep thinking watching all this
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:20.080]   horrible writer strike stuff.
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:23.200]   It's just it's so interesting to think about how disruptive that could be for a company
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:27.120]   like Netflix you know think about how much it's like right now people are kind of slogging
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:30.920]   it out and they're sitting through the same frickin J. Leno they've seen before God bless
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:36.760]   them and now so what happens they get their big screen TV right they get your new you
[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:40.360]   finally you're going to drop the money you know digital's coming in 2009 or whatever
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:44.680]   you drop the money on a big TV think about like how star people are going to be for
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:50.600]   content in January people got new TVs they got new iPods they got all this stuff boy
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:54.560]   it would be really an interesting opportunity to come out with something like imagine like
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:58.920]   so like Andy saying with this this tablet deal imagine that tablet deal with something
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:02.280]   like I don't know if they could ever combine with Netflix or something like that but be
[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:07.680]   that ability I sort of do kind of a voodoo tablet because each move think about how each
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:12.120]   move they've been making lately at least to my appearances the iPhone what so what's
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:15.120]   one of the things the iPhone does you can go to the Starbucks and you know there's music
[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:19.320]   playing and you can do stuff and you can buy music wirelessly you know over Wi-Fi there's
[00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:25.000]   a content component to most of this stuff that's an interesting gloss on it I think because
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.560]   they yeah make it a content they're not just they're not just they're not trying to compete
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:33.000]   with you know HP right they're not trying to put out the cheapest you know most or even
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:38.240]   most reliable hardware they're trying to do some really interesting lifestyle things so
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:41.560]   I don't know I'm not sure I'm not sure where I'm going with this but I like that idea of
[00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:46.200]   the small tablet PC but it also becomes like your little portable think about this you put
[00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:50.080]   you put a 40 gig drive in that instead of the Apple TV and that's something you can plug
[00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:54.520]   into your TV and run movies on take a look at the voodoo which is 400 bucks a little more
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:59.440]   than the Apple TV roughly the same idea but it gives you access to to 5,000 movies over
[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:04.000]   a peer-to-peer network and starts playing almost instantly because it has it cashed
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:10.760]   you know the four of the titles VU DU now that's an interesting you mix that maybe with a portable
[00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:13.960]   device that's that is kind of interesting yeah but I'm not sure that Apple is really
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:18.560]   into this whole idea of connectivity be cable anymore I mean they're really kind of like
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:25.040]   they're doing it wirelessly to your television now to your little new yeah but if your pad
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:31.200]   sinks if you so you hook that thing up via USB 2 to your Mac or I guess you could theoretically
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:34.640]   buy stuff wirelessly like music you like you do now but imagine again now imagine taking
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:38.440]   the iPhone idea like we're saying imagine you've got a little look at this way look at it as
[00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:44.640]   a bigger bigger iPhone or a bigger iPod touch basically Scott is that another way to look
[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:48.800]   at it yeah I think so Scott born is it does that make sense or do you see another hole
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:53.720]   in the in the Apple product well I you know I think it's fantastical to talk about this
[00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:59.880]   stuff I agree I'd like to see all of it but I my feeling is we're gonna get a surprise
[00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:04.080]   I mean Steve will talk about a new piece of software we've never heard of or something
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:08.320]   else I mean we know we're not gonna get a new I life upgrade because we just did I max
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:12.320]   were fairly recently upgraded we might get a Mac Pro bump that's not gonna be the big
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:17.280]   thing we will probably see a lot of focus on the iPhone he's probably gonna do the iPhone
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:22.960]   2.0 talk once again to allow the two new models this year now is the latest rumor yeah and
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:27.120]   he's got the FCC deadline story about with filing so he's got to get it out there I think
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:32.840]   that the iPhone once again takes inter-stage I'm particularly I think Merlin's on to something
[00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:37.560]   about the content deal because we keep coming back to why don't the iPod killers ever kill
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:43.400]   the iPod it's because they don't have iTunes yeah and I think the more Apple can do to tie
[00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:48.760]   things to content and I think it's brilliant to make things move through iTunes whether
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:53.280]   it's wirelessly or USB doesn't matter if it this these deals are up to Apple and it frankly
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:50:00.480]   it's moving against Apple with NBC moving off Fox moving off it's what I think the only
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:03.960]   thing to think about here I think also and I just cannot put this Google thing behind
[00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:07.800]   me because I keep thinking like if you get the cloud if you've got these two things if
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:11.880]   you've got the power of iTunes in the power of Google on a small wireless device with
[00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:16.080]   the big screen you can do a lot of really interesting stuff so now all of a sudden you've
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:20.800]   got this thing that's like a home entertainment device plus with I'm guessing the same kind
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:24.440]   of little screen for typing on you've got something you can grab and jump on a plane
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:27.840]   and go you can watch a movie on the plane and you can sit there and maybe there's a
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:31.520]   cached version of your Google documents or something like that I just boy you know what
[00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:36.440]   Google lacks right now is a device that's tightly integrated with their office with the
[00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:40.960]   Google apps I don't know maybe they're gonna want something more enterprise I'm like I think
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:47.440]   I think we have some consensus I like this idea that of Andy's idea this small pocketable
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:54.960]   tablet style device a big iPhone with much with Andy would it have more of an OS 10 feel
[00:50:54.960 --> 00:51:01.000]   to it no it would still it would still be an iPhone but most of the advantages of this
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:04.960]   device would be simply from the fact that it has larger real estate you mean that means
[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:08.120]   you can have bigger batteries which means you can support the bigger hard drive which means
[00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:12.880]   you can support a 3G chipset which means you can support all this other cool stuff right
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:17.640]   there are a lot of I think I just come from a larger screen and that's certainly one of
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:24.240]   them also let's not forget that one of the central big features better than features one
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:31.360]   of the central themes of leopard is that it helps to make the physical location of your
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:37.560]   data and your computer less relevant it can you can project content project features project
[00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:43.000]   abilities from your desktop computer to any computer any OS 10 computer in the world and
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:48.160]   we can't let ourselves forget that the iPhone is an OS 10 computer if we think about this
[00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:53.760]   as a way that if I'm inside the house it becomes controller for iTunes or I can project documents
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:58.840]   from my Mac desktop device it's that find it's that knowledge navigator that apple did an
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:03.960]   ad for 20 years ago video for 20 years ago well hi John Lee was wrongly got say again
[00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:08.660]   how much I'm gonna get out of the boat I'm how much did you pay what's the price point
[00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:12.600]   I would pay for the big this is for the big iPhone we're talking about I think I think
[00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:16.320]   I think go to the big iPhone I would pay as I would pay as much as the original Newton
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:23.860]   message pad around 799 because if I were thinking of it not as a big phone but as less than
[00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:28.660]   a notebook computer I would so totally go for that because it has to be an average range
[00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:33.380]   yeah so much of what I need what I would want this device to do so many times I need
[00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:37.180]   something that's bigger than my phone but I don't necessarily want to carry my entire
[00:52:37.180 --> 00:52:43.380]   computer with me 200 bucks less than the Mac book and if it's not a phone you get around
[00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:49.140]   some of this crap with with the AT&T right all the stuff Alex hates you're all the sudden
[00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:52.860]   you've got this thing where maybe you can't can you maybe run Skype on it I wonder if this
[00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:58.900]   deal that Amazon made with Sprint is a harbinger of other deals remember you get Sprint EVDO
[00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:03.420]   for free for a lifetime for a low price I mean it can't be too much of the cost of
[00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:09.140]   the Kindle you know but they're they're they're really eating it on every one of these kindles
[00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:13.860]   they really really are the cost of this internet connection is killing them not so much that
[00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:17.780]   you were the one doing any one you the one who wrote that piece about about how this is
[00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:22.380]   everybody's missing what's really going on that was those a good piece and yeah and it's
[00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:25.540]   a very interesting because this is sneaking in that very same kind of thing I mean every
[00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:29.300]   time anybody let's be honest they can make up the money by selling content Apple couldn't
[00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:34.980]   do that really probably not correct also if you look at the deal there was a good news
[00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:38.980]   bad news sort of thing as I was looking into publishing on the Kindle where it's kind of
[00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:44.700]   cool in that anybody with a document can convert it to the can can basically send it to Amazon
[00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:50.660]   and include it in the Kindle store after jumping through some very very very low and big hoops
[00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:55.940]   to make sure that it's content that you actually own but Amazon takes a huge slice of every
[00:53:55.940 --> 00:54:00.300]   single sale it's not a good book publishing model for but but the biggest I mean one of
[00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:04.060]   the biggest features of the Kindle is the simple fact that Jeff it's a pet project of
[00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:08.780]   Jeff Bezos Bezos is one of those really wonderful crazy billionaires he is putting hundreds of
[00:54:08.780 --> 00:54:12.500]   millions of dollars into building his own private space fleet if you don't think he's willing
[00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:17.940]   to take a loss on the Kindle for two three four years until it becomes the iPod the the
[00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:24.740]   predominantly the prohibitively saturated device for reading content either online or
[00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:29.380]   in portable to book format you know he is determined there's no for 800 bucks on him
[00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:35.380]   on eBay because you can't get them Amazon you know Amazon wants mine back and I keep promising
[00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:39.500]   to send it back to them but I might be I might be going on TV with it at the end of the week
[00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:43.660]   and I don't want to trust them that will send it back to me I might be going on TV in a
[00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:48.140]   month you never know let me play the rank excuse me I'm with and with some media perhaps
[00:54:48.140 --> 00:54:52.580]   you heard of us let me play the rank and best commercial you got to imagine it's you know
[00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:57.900]   remember the the what is Norelko brings you a frosty the snow like Santa Claus is coming
[00:54:57.900 --> 00:55:03.780]   to town or Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer that look so cool but John Hodgman and and
[00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:10.300]   and Justin Timberlake are no what is his name just long Justin are hey if you name Justin
[00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:14.940]   you got to live with that are kind of created in this claymation style here's the ad you'll
[00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:20.220]   hear the audio anyway as soon as I go to the Apple website it starts automatically thank
[00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:26.020]   you Apple hello on the Mac and I'm a PC you better watch out you better not cry you better
[00:55:26.020 --> 00:55:33.100]   not proud I'm telling you why Santa Claus is coming to town he sees you when you're in
[00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:39.300]   sleep mode he knows when you're awake he knows when you've been bad or good so by a PC and
[00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:46.500]   not a Mac this holiday season or any other time for goodness sake oh come on oh what I
[00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:52.060]   thought those were the lyrics I mean that's how I learned it yeah I think they did a better
[00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:58.340]   job capturing PC than Mac they did a great job on not if you look so I want him to be
[00:55:58.340 --> 00:56:03.220]   my make-believe friend he's so adorable what's interesting is that the if you just hear that
[00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:09.140]   ad you know it's it sounds like it's an ad for a PC when you can't see Santa Santa watching
[00:56:09.140 --> 00:56:13.380]   him but like not talking yeah like he's kind of kind of looking at the PC is yeah and then
[00:56:13.380 --> 00:56:17.580]   finally at the end it says happy holidays from Apple and they show a Mac it's in a way
[00:56:17.580 --> 00:56:21.740]   it's kind of cocky it's kind of saying we don't need to say buy a Mac it's just paint
[00:56:21.740 --> 00:56:26.380]   and Lee obvious you know buy it did you see did you run the run that misprint one is that
[00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:29.860]   is out the other is a one called misprint yeah I can run that one for you let me have
[00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:33.860]   you watch that one that's the one Gruber was talking about that I think makes make I agree
[00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:37.980]   with Gruber makes a nice distinction it's it's not the rank and bass it's another one it's
[00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:43.180]   another one but but check out what they now what is that it or podium podium we've played
[00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:48.300]   before let's try and now miss Prince Miss Prince is a I don't see it's basically you don't
[00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:52.300]   see it let's see let's see if now what maybe now what's it the hello I'm a man and I'm a
[00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:56.220]   PC you know Mac there are a lot of people looking to buy computers nowadays yeah I know
[00:56:56.220 --> 00:57:00.820]   there's so many questions and choices you're all alone out there that's why I created my
[00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:05.780]   book I want to buy a computer now what why are you talking like that buying a computer isn't
[00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:09.420]   easy actually it's really easy in an Apple store you know they've personal shop or stuff
[00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:12.580]   you pick up the Mac that's right for you there's even workshops for you after you buy your
[00:57:12.580 --> 00:57:17.220]   Mac yes I thought of that face to and that's why I created my companion volume I just bought
[00:57:17.220 --> 00:57:23.580]   a computer now what that's is that not it that's not it huh I can congratulate PC he's
[00:57:23.580 --> 00:57:27.940]   got to actually develop that into a series yeah I was it representing it's like the dummy
[00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:33.260]   guides oh here's Miss Prince here we go hello I'm a man I'm a PC Apple's P.A.M.A. world yes
[00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:37.900]   it's PC here I'd like to report a misprint a very serious misprint well you said and
[00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:43.220]   I quote the fastest Windows Vista notebook we tested this year is a Mac a Mac that's impossible
[00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:47.220]   oh wait I'm a PC I think that's actually true how can a Mac run Vista faster than a PC it
[00:57:47.220 --> 00:57:51.020]   goes against the laws of nature well you know what I'll put Mac on he'll tell you that I
[00:57:51.020 --> 00:57:56.260]   run Vista faster I'll talk to them but I can't say hello I'm a Mac yeah dude PC is definitely
[00:57:56.260 --> 00:58:02.060]   faster yeah we played that last week or the week before yeah I love that what if you got
[00:58:02.060 --> 00:58:07.100]   what a yeah it's decouples my I think he just notes that he's decoupling this idea of Windows
[00:58:07.100 --> 00:58:15.780]   equals PC ah so Mac runs Windows faster yeah well that's a big selling thing it's a it's
[00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:24.520]   a yellow submarine notebook it's it's got it's got the touchscreen and all the Beatles
[00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:31.880]   songs plus a whole unreleased album and Billy Preston Billy Preston brings it to your house
[00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:40.560]   yeah he's a little bit he's looking at you're the sixth beat you're the 17th any other news
[00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:45.240]   before we get to our picks anything else we're talking about wanted to mention something
[00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:48.460]   well you to pick up on a theme you guys are just mentioning I'm ganking this straight off
[00:58:48.460 --> 00:58:54.560]   of the MBW ideas list but there's a nice little command line little terminal thing you can
[00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:59.660]   run to improve the screen sharing did you guys see this yeah Rob Griffith published this
[00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:05.900]   really smart so smart yeah so just a great a couple of lines you can run in the terminal
[00:59:05.900 --> 00:59:09.980]   that will do stuff like add a bunch of extra buttons to screen sharing so that essentially
[00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:14.360]   you can just sit there and run in full screen mode and it actually really feels like you're
[00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:19.000]   on that Mac the other Mac it's totally mind blowing it kind of to this simple command
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:23.960]   it's sort of turn screen sharing from a feature into an application yeah you know like something
[00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:27.480]   you'd pay money for it's really is quite slick it was well it is an application if you go
[00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:31.960]   into course it is but mean it's a it's a one of those tiny little applications that
[00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:35.160]   tries to but this is you know what it's it's totally I don't see a Trojan horse because
[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:38.640]   that is the connotation but I mean this is really something interesting to slip in I know
[00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:43.520]   the kind of the desktop remote desktop stuff's been around for a while but you you do this
[00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:48.680]   little change you and you get more than you get a menu that automatically detects like
[00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:53.760]   things in the area that you can connect to a via Bonjour so I mean if you're again this
[00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:57.680]   is whole idea of kind of networking your whole house together and that it's that experience
[00:59:57.680 --> 01:00:01.400]   of being on another Mac like you're really really on it is it's pretty mind blowing it's
[01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:07.160]   basically a bonjour browser that you're launching yeah yeah so Chris that was Rob Griffith's
[01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:11.340]   idea or did you how did he yeah that was Roger you know he all that stuff comes through
[01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:15.320]   as 10 hints so somebody may have offered that as a hint and then Rob goes in and refines
[01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:19.500]   these things so he may have done on its own yeah Rob's great yeah yeah I have to say that
[01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:22.800]   the screen sharing is I mean that's one of the main things that I got my kids live in
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:28.440]   Pittsburgh Pennsylvania and I live here and in San Francisco and you know one of the main
[01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:32.300]   reasons I got them new computers was so that when I'm chatting with them I can get ahold
[01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:36.460]   of their screen you know Alex it just had a baby and you shifted off to Pittsburgh yeah
[01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:40.140]   exactly exactly no I have to I know a good place where you can get a little basket made
[01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:45.300]   out of reads I'm going there if you wanted to drop it off I'll be in Egypt next week
[01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:50.100]   so just a product in by Gosson that's for who's his basket if you see the first I for
[01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:57.800]   the first eight you know I said this is Sparta you know and so but no no my two older kids
[01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:02.660]   that are 10 and 10 and 13 you know that it's great to be able to talk to them and be able
[01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:08.100]   to you know kind of get you know get to their computer and it's it was just too complicated
[01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:12.820]   to do with Apple mode desktop hey tech support tech support can I ask a question when I'm
[01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:18.500]   in a tech support being all of you people when I'm in the screen sharing and I'm accessing
[01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:23.500]   the other computer sometimes to make it do a normal thing I need to hit option like
[01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:28.460]   when I click something do you can you think of any reason why why mine is doing that in
[01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:34.140]   other words if I click so if I click like on an application in the dock it exposes it
[01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:39.140]   in finder rather than opening it so it says though it's got this the option thing messed
[01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:45.740]   up does this make any sense at all is your mouse button stock this is on a Macbook pro
[01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:51.340]   accessing another Mac you guys don't get this at all so it's not your it only happens when
[01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:56.660]   you're accessing another Mac that's right it's as though that Mac has the option key push
[01:01:56.660 --> 01:02:04.100]   down stock do you have do you have any of the assistance controls enabled on the phone
[01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:10.740]   on the remote Mac yes as in like like I've got like I've remapped caps lock to control
[01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:16.980]   and I've got the universal which one Jake it on yeah I'm get I'm guessing if I'm gonna
[01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:21.340]   guess that if you mess around with universal access you'll find a feature that when turned
[01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:30.100]   off will cause that to go away oh thank you Rabbi should I buy an old mobile life is
[01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:36.660]   a bonus years in we want we sit back and wonder about the choices we're making in life do
[01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:44.460]   we phrase that is it right to my house mobile all right let's get to our pick that is actually
[01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:48.860]   a good pick that's a great all that you'll enter all of that out I will all that will
[01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:56.740]   be edited out no no because this is a this is Jubilee year and all is forgiven muddle
[01:02:56.740 --> 01:03:02.220]   top doesn't it doesn't it just affect the you know the slides against the Queen I absolutely
[01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:07.100]   anything slides against the Queen the Rabbi anybody awesome because there's a lot of reasons
[01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:11.380]   why I can't go back to London and this is just a really old and tall you bet yeah you're
[01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:17.180]   back to London you may go and and Andy that old Warren Oklahoma forget about it let's
[01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:23.540]   start with Mr Scott born as long as you're there you got a pick for us I do indeed and
[01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:29.860]   it's just a fraction of an Alex it's the monster I cable link headphone adapter for the iPhone
[01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:35.500]   oh this is instead of the one that you got from from Apple the sure no no no this is the
[01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:42.900]   this is the this won't work with any other clicking doesn't have a clicking thing this
[01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:47.700]   is just for people who just want to turn their regular iPod headphones into something they
[01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:52.540]   can listen to on their iPhone Belkin was the first company to make one of these available
[01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:58.700]   they had one at launch but it was gray and it was stiff and it was not very flexible obviously
[01:03:58.700 --> 01:04:03.300]   this one's black looks a little better with the phone and it's flexible so it won't cause
[01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:09.580]   damage to the headphone receiver Jack and it's ten bucks from monster they make good
[01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:15.980]   stuff 24 carat gold contacts all that kind of yada yada and I have both but I find that
[01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:20.700]   I prefer the monster one because of its flexibility I was concerned immediately by the Belkin
[01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:25.620]   one because I was afraid it because it was so inflexible that it might damage that Jack
[01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:30.420]   those put that jet those kind of jacks are are the usually the weakest link in any kind
[01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:35.900]   of device so this one is flexible and if you pull on it you won't necessarily yank on
[01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:42.460]   the Jack I am just to add to that one there's also a pro cable by rad tech and it's more
[01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:51.020]   flexible than both of those I have a small collection I bought all of them and so yeah
[01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:56.580]   but the monster one is really good as well very good how much and it's how many Alex
[01:04:56.580 --> 01:05:00.460]   is one seven it's just nine it's nine ninety five so nine ninety fifths of an hour and
[01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:05.660]   I have two sub picks okay Chris both Chris Breen and Andy and I'll have wonderful iPhone

[01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:15.660]   most of bad move last my ultimate personality spanning tool it's a personality spam device
[01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:22.380]   I'm happy about but see now it can be a good mood you know there are people starving
[01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:26.900]   it doesn't have to be a bad mood it also works with adiM so if you've got at you know
[01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:31.940]   use your adiM status messages it works with Skype your scope like what are you laughing
[01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:36.820]   at I'm just thinking that you know the internet will be a good perfect thing for these sort
[01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:41.340]   of tools like you know you've ever used a free rice dot com where it's a word game and
[01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:45.660]   for every what you get right is great yeah well we'll have a good a new computer site
[01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:50.780]   where it's linked into that same server but you intentionally try to take rice away from
[01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:55.460]   the people who are trying to feed starving people on the basis I think I think it's
[01:07:55.460 --> 01:08:02.380]   where you don't you don't know what you're doing we don't say again Merlin have I lost
[01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:06.020]   everybody if you Twitter about your it's what about your flight delay you should have to
[01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:10.500]   buy a bowl of rice for someone yes that's all it is did you follow Jason Kalick and
[01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:16.460]   this is long 16 part Twitter about how he'd forgotten his passport I thought in my not
[01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:20.140]   in my code or even I but I do think in the drinking game called Twitter I think I think
[01:08:20.140 --> 01:08:23.180]   you would have to definitely take a drink whenever someone has a flight the light the
[01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:27.460]   light would be a good one yeah I think this is for you if somebody like you and me Merlin
[01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:30.840]   who like to let it be I worry about I got to tell you now you're bringing it up so I
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:34.860]   worry a little bit about how these bleed over too much into one another I think something
[01:08:34.860 --> 01:08:40.340]   like Jai Koo is great for aggregating all of this stuff but I I actually am grateful personally
[01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:46.580]   when my friends turn off automatic Twitter additions in their tumble log in a tumbler
[01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:50.540]   site because I like those being different I mean personally to me Twitter is an art form
[01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:54.420]   that like deserves its own place and to me you know your tumble log is a place but we
[01:08:54.420 --> 01:08:58.540]   keep you the entries that's a whole different thing and I like those being separate and so
[01:08:58.540 --> 01:09:04.100]   like when I see the same thing across like six places that kind of actually makes me less
[01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:07.780]   rather than more happy that's it that's actually a good point is to to to write but you're the
[01:09:07.780 --> 01:09:12.900]   kind of person who custom creates hand creates your mood for each place I used to I used
[01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:16.580]   to I hired I hired some people in Bangalore now that are doing most of my updates for
[01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:21.380]   me isn't that nice yeah makes it so much it's a bit terrific yeah yeah and it's a lot less
[01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:27.780]   costly than me doing it do they do that in between ship breaking um between what ship
[01:09:27.780 --> 01:09:33.100]   breaking you know do you think oh he sees he's talking about talking about the thing where
[01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:38.220]   they send ships to these countries and people are paid like one penny per month people hazardous
[01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:41.580]   sort of cutting them apart and reducing the cycle I heard a thing I heard a thing about
[01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:46.060]   in China where they tear up our computers and it was very dispiriting yeah well you got
[01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:49.220]   to be very careful when you do the e-recycling it's not just shoes and they don't like they
[01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:52.940]   dump it in a river it's totally scary yeah because many of these e-recyclings that I just
[01:09:52.940 --> 01:09:58.660]   go to the cheapest bidder and often it's a similar it's just appalling and you know what
[01:09:58.660 --> 01:10:03.620]   if we had to make a donation when the show goes past a certain amount of time oh my gosh
[01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:09.980]   oh my gosh that's nice the next year we're not that long yet we're only a little long

[01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:37.140]   have much participation from them that includes art carney uh vr third chapter since art
[01:12:37.140 --> 01:12:40.820]   I have such a good story about this but I will let you finish
[01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:45.940]   and and and and Chewbacca's uh Chewbacca's father-in-law
[01:12:45.940 --> 01:12:53.060]   watch Diane Carroll do some dirty dance it's pretty uh I think you run it in the background
[01:12:53.060 --> 01:13:00.900]   what is that or somebody at the airport that was you don't have twitter about this
[01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:08.100]   now if you can get a copy of it Leo uh it all circles it centers around Han
[01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:14.100]   wanting to go home with chewy to make it to life day here it is the here's the five here's the short version
[01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:24.500]   from 1978 the two hours star wars holiday special he adjusts five no wars holiday special
[01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:33.060]   starring mark hamill as luke skywalker introducing Chewbacca's family oh jesus
[01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:39.620]   yeah tris author jennifer's in starship
[01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:44.020]   because your name get it their name was star ship
[01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:54.500]   i'd say i'm turning back i know your family's waiting i know it's an important day
[01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:58.260]   i'll get your back at the time now trust me
[01:14:02.580 --> 01:14:06.660]   we must have filled some additional material for this because i don't remember that star wars
[01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:14.980]   they were actually real crops only by the statue by the way oh my god it was real everything
[01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:20.180]   it's amazing luke's was distracted because he was working on uh empire strikes back at the time
[01:14:20.180 --> 01:14:23.380]   he kind of like waved his hands and said okay yeah yeah that sounds great holiday special
[01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:27.700]   he gave them like apparently gave him like a basic script and everything just went completely
[01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:33.060]   off the rails well it's on your tooth or closest the special by singing the lyrics to the star wars
[01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:40.980]   theme sauce what are the lyrics like we celebrate with open arms i've blocked most of this out
[01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:47.060]   but i i've got i've got to tell you this story this is in the pre i movie days i finally got my
[01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:52.500]   hands on a bootleg tape of this at a science fiction convention because i remember very very
[01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:57.460]   distinctly being a little kid and being forced to go out to a family like big family christmas
[01:14:57.460 --> 01:15:02.820]   party on the night this thing was airing which meant that i missed it forever and so i bought
[01:15:02.820 --> 01:15:08.580]   bought this tape for like 25 30 bucks it was like 90 minutes two hours long and was sitting there
[01:15:08.580 --> 01:15:15.380]   like just dumbfounded this like a 90 92 93 thinking that my god it was so much better in my imagination
[01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:21.940]   of how good this could have been and so i spent i'm not joking here like two months as a project
[01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:27.140]   figuring this is there's a two hour long special there must be some sort of way i can cut this down
[01:15:27.140 --> 01:15:32.580]   and re-edited so it's actually entertaining so i made it i made up a shot list i had a clipboard
[01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:37.940]   with like all these segments i built a new storyline out of like all the footage that was in here holy
[01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:45.300]   and i cut together a 41 minute long star wars movie hey i eventually should mention that there
[01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:48.980]   are points where for several minutes there's nothing but the wookiees talking to each other
[01:15:48.980 --> 01:15:56.420]   in like eke rowling let me play a little more of this because it you know this is we're all the
[01:15:56.420 --> 01:16:01.780]   same in our struggle against the powers of evil and darkness i hope that this day will always be a
[01:16:01.780 --> 01:16:07.620]   day of joy in which we can reconfirm our dedication and our courage and more than ever is that really
[01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:12.500]   princess land i love for one another this is the and that's really that's really art car
[01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:18.740]   art carney and this is life day here comes a song oh no this is a different one
[01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:33.620]   but it's not christmas day it's life day chaferson starship has never sounded better
[01:16:33.620 --> 01:16:39.700]   that was great slick ladies and gentlemen before the cigarettes and booze how are we ever gonna

[01:17:06.660 --> 01:17:11.620]   that your commitment to remain upstanding citizens will be reinforced that looks like it's required

[01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:48.660]   that's special you have to understand though this is this so so things were different in 1978
[01:17:48.660 --> 01:17:55.540]   in 1977 i mean i was voracious i would watch darth vader make hash browns yeah i was out of my mind
[01:17:55.540 --> 01:18:00.020]   insane for anything star wars and you would watch i mean there were abc i seem to remember abc having
[01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:03.620]   some kind of really weird special well you know it was just that they we had all this
[01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:08.420]   the stuff that they were making was not nearly as tightly controlled as it is now and uh and now
[01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:13.780]   we know why it is this gives you excellent reason for that i could think about poor lukis this is a
[01:18:13.780 --> 01:18:20.100]   guy who like you know he's probably he's probably like going back and having like toast he's made
[01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:24.580]   at weddings redone over the years you know the video i mean this is a guy who cannot be happy
[01:18:24.580 --> 01:18:28.420]   with anything and and yet he's got this thing out there and i do i feel for the guy well and there's
[01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:33.300]   no way you can suppress it now because it's everywhere it's too awesome it really is everywhere

[01:18:53.220 --> 01:18:59.460]   uh especially since we're just one week before christmas this is one of my favorite audio books
[01:18:59.460 --> 01:19:06.980]   of all time for years and years and years i would have a kiss the cassette edition of this in the
[01:19:06.980 --> 01:19:12.260]   glove box in my car and starting like the day after Thanksgiving i'd listen to this two or three
[01:19:12.260 --> 01:19:19.380]   times over the holiday season it is uh Patrick Stewart's one man show recording of charles
[01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:25.380]   dickens a christmas carol all by himself it's not a dramatic reading he does he used to do this as
[01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:30.580]   an annual stage show like an annual one man show during downtime from filming uh star trek the
[01:19:30.580 --> 01:19:38.420]   next generation and you would think that it's not a mighty python where hey mr. credit
[01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:45.700]   oh i'm doing pretty well i know although he does he does have to go up a couple of registers to
[01:19:45.700 --> 01:19:51.620]   the children's voices but it is such a pitch perfect performance i would actually go so far as to say
[01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:58.660]   it's probably the best adaptation of a christmas carol on video on movie because it is so absolutely
[01:19:58.660 --> 01:20:05.220]   true to all the really important things of the story i have always said that if you want to do a
[01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:09.860]   good version of a christmas carol you have whether you're doing an animation or whatever you have to
[01:20:09.860 --> 01:20:16.580]   understand that screw just not the villain of the story he is the hero of the story and uh Patrick
[01:20:16.580 --> 01:20:21.220]   Stewart absolutely understands this obviously he's cut down the book to fit into what's a little
[01:20:21.220 --> 01:20:27.380]   less than a two-hour performance but it is again just pitch perfect and i just get such pleasure
[01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:33.140]   out of listening to this every year wow that's great a great pick mac break weeklies pick

[01:20:59.780 --> 01:21:04.740]   remember that it's great when you come across a book that you wind up reading it three times
[01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:08.900]   when you write it when you read it once because you get to the bottom of the page and you're like

[01:23:46.660 --> 01:23:50.900]   i'll say this with only but an hour's worth of experience with marzett and again i'm writing a
[01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:54.900]   more full-featured review that will flesh things out a lot more careful and i'll solve more experience
[01:23:54.900 --> 01:24:00.420]   before i actually write about it but the thing that i really want in a in a blog editor is i want
[01:24:00.420 --> 01:24:05.940]   something that's a huge improvement over just editing html directly in bb edit then pasting it
[01:24:05.940 --> 01:24:12.180]   into the online editor and to me marzett is not that ecto lets me have some semblance of
[01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:17.060]   a whizzy wig editing obviously it's the web so you can't get real whizzy wig but i think that it
[01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:22.900]   can be more mac like and it can be more transparent than what marzett it allows i find i find marzett
[01:24:22.900 --> 01:24:28.260]   extremely usable and the reason that i like it is i i just get the sense that a lot of care went into
[01:24:28.260 --> 01:24:33.220]   what what they decided to leave out of it yeah and and that's why i like it i mean i ecto i used to use
[01:24:33.220 --> 01:24:40.580]   ecto and i don't know i i i i used to be a really big fan of ecto it feels like it needs a visual at
[01:24:40.580 --> 01:24:44.660]   least a visual ui refactoring from the bottom up lots and i think it's lots of little things sticking
[01:24:44.660 --> 01:24:48.820]   out very crowded but it has a lot of no no doubt ecto has great stuff it has stuff like those
[01:24:48.820 --> 01:24:53.140]   templates and things like that that are super helpful but personally i i mean i do all my stuff
[01:24:53.140 --> 01:24:56.900]   through the web so i don't really use that stuff much but in my testing of marzett i've been really
[01:24:56.900 --> 01:25:00.740]   impressed i use marzett it and skitched together that's how it goes to everything and it's just really
[01:25:00.740 --> 01:25:06.020]   easy yeah yeah second i'll talk i'll talk about more in depth later i this is actually a really
[01:25:06.020 --> 01:25:11.780]   kind of a funny and shocking display of again i i've yet to really publicize the the new blog yet
[01:25:11.780 --> 01:25:15.780]   and so sometimes i forget that this is actually connected to the actual web and that there are
[01:25:15.780 --> 01:25:20.420]   people who can actually find it and actually read it so i was reading so i was posting i was
[01:25:20.420 --> 01:25:24.740]   creating for for both of these tools both ecto and marzett it i was writing a sample
[01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:29.860]   blog post which is well here's okay i've just launched and gi can't find the italicized function
[01:25:29.860 --> 01:25:34.900]   g how do i paste this in and oh god don't tell me that you know i have to type in tags my oh geez is
[01:25:34.900 --> 01:25:39.700]   that the way it works then click post uh and there's nothing in those blog posts that i would take back
[01:25:39.700 --> 01:25:44.420]   but of course a half hour later so in twitter that oh my god and you not go totally slammed
[01:25:44.420 --> 01:25:48.740]   marzett in his review and then the author of marzett it was like also twittering about oh i don't
[01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:52.100]   know why he doesn't like me i thought i was getting all kinds of comments but oh geez
[01:25:52.100 --> 01:25:58.180]   you know websites would be awesome this microphone is on holy
[01:25:59.460 --> 01:26:06.340]   is there no idea he'd be recording this let's get uh to i actually i'm gonna download that
[01:26:06.340 --> 01:26:12.020]   black ink that looks really really great be useful it's such a mac i love it he does uh great stuff
[01:26:12.020 --> 01:26:16.420]   i like his letter stuff i like his software daniel's a great guy christa does flex time flex time
[01:26:16.420 --> 01:26:21.460]   which is i i won't go on but flex time is a really nice if you need to do like uh 43 folders ask
[01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:25.860]   productivity stuff flex time is a super cool uh timer for doing stuff like that that's actually
[01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:29.620]   how i first met daniel because i had written a little apple script for the radio show to
[01:26:29.620 --> 01:26:34.980]   let me know it's time to break uh because unlike this show i actually have breaks and uh i'm gonna
[01:26:34.980 --> 01:26:40.020]   say can we get that for this show and he said you should look at flex time christian give us all
[01:26:40.020 --> 01:26:44.500]   uh catheters for christmas all right we're almost done chris sprain what about the poor audience
[01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:50.340]   they've got to listen to this you got to pick for us uh for the high-doo last picnic here yeah increasingly
[01:26:50.340 --> 01:26:56.740]   uh podcasts that are looking for that coveted explicit tag are asking me to participate in
[01:26:56.740 --> 01:27:02.900]   their shows oh dear and uh and so i'm doing more podcasting and i i'm getting to be a microphone
[01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:06.580]   geek and i've tried out a bunch of different usb mics and i have not been happy with any of them
[01:27:06.580 --> 01:27:11.540]   so i keep going back to my traditional microphone and my very favorite one is an akg 414
[01:27:11.540 --> 01:27:17.140]   which is the old johnny karson mic and it's about the same vintage so it's a beautiful mic but the
[01:27:17.140 --> 01:27:24.260]   problem is it requires phantom power and i'm moving that mic from mac to mac and i've been using an
[01:27:24.260 --> 01:27:29.700]   edderall usb audio interface and the driver for it is funky and it causes different things to
[01:27:29.700 --> 01:27:36.020]   crash so i've been looking for some kind of portable uh usb preamp and i found one and it's
[01:27:36.020 --> 01:27:43.620]   made by a company called centrance that's c-e-n-t-r-a-n-c-e i love it yeah it's the mic or pro yep it's
[01:27:43.620 --> 01:27:50.660]   125 bucks it's uh it looks like just kind of the end of uh the bottom end of a mic so on one end
[01:27:50.660 --> 01:27:56.020]   it's got an xlr connection or a cannon plug and on the other side it's got a usb connected a little
[01:27:56.020 --> 01:28:02.260]   mini one a uh headphone port so you can monitor through this thing as well and best of all it's
[01:28:02.260 --> 01:28:09.060]   got a phantom power button on it so uh this akg 414 requires power that comes through the line
[01:28:09.060 --> 01:28:14.100]   and this adapter provides that so you push the button uh it's got you know attached to your mic
[01:28:14.100 --> 01:28:18.500]   it lights up so you can see your mic is actually working you can tell phantom power is on because
[01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:23.140]   you know it won't light up without it it's a nice clean interface it's really portable you can throw
[01:28:23.140 --> 01:28:28.340]   it in your backpack and you can take any mic you want now you're not stuck with using a usb mic and
[01:28:28.340 --> 01:28:32.740]   you don't have to bring along this bulky uh audio interface with you but instead just bring this
[01:28:32.740 --> 01:28:37.860]   little plug and it's beautiful yep and also converts it to usb makes instant use usb uh yeah that's what
[01:28:37.860 --> 01:28:43.460]   it does yeah i use that uh on the road i used to bring all this recording equipment now i just have
[01:28:43.460 --> 01:28:48.740]   the these the c entrance which is very tiny i mean it's just it's like um you know it's small and i
[01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:52.740]   could put that in the mic sack and i'm set i can record right to my mac which is fantastic right
[01:28:52.740 --> 01:28:56.980]   plus unlike a lot of usb mics this one has audio gain on it so you can adjust the
[01:28:56.980 --> 01:29:01.540]   end of your mic and you can monitor directly too so you don't have to worry about uh any latency
[01:29:01.540 --> 01:29:06.260]   are you using that right now yeah i'm using it right now yeah so with the akg yep wow
[01:29:06.900 --> 01:29:09.940]   how do i sound do i sound rich and luxurious you sound fantastic
[01:29:09.940 --> 01:29:14.980]   so your hair your hair sounds very large is that yeah yeah shouldn't have the big air
[01:29:14.980 --> 01:29:20.100]   yeah well it's just it's full and rich really luxurious it is rich and luxury
[01:29:20.100 --> 01:29:26.420]   rich creamery scott born what's your pick of the week i gave you one you already did so never mind
[01:29:26.420 --> 01:29:32.340]   that was an hour and a half ago and i forgot i forgot i thought we started a new shift was that
[01:29:32.340 --> 01:29:37.300]   episode 16 oh is this episode oh okay well i guess that leaves uh Alex lindsey we end
[01:29:37.300 --> 01:29:42.340]   maryland man Alex let's start with you i have a really simple one um that solves a really simple
[01:29:42.340 --> 01:29:45.860]   problem that i have um a lot of times i'll be working on something i just don't want my uh
[01:29:45.860 --> 01:29:51.540]   this came this actually came up on the mac break ideas the mbk ideas on delicious and i was just
[01:29:51.540 --> 01:29:56.180]   going through the stories and download it and just realized that it really solved a problem which is
[01:29:56.180 --> 01:30:01.540]   it's called caffeine have you guys did you guys see this on the list so it's a freeware so it's zero
[01:30:01.540 --> 01:30:07.060]   zero alixes um and uh all it does is it puts a little thing in your menu and all you have to do is
[01:30:07.060 --> 01:30:11.540]   click on it and when you click on it your your screen and your computer won't go to sleep when
[01:30:11.540 --> 01:30:15.620]   you click on it again they'll go back to whatever your energy saving is because a lot of times
[01:30:15.620 --> 01:30:19.380]   i mean i want my energy saber to be pretty aggressive actually you know to turn off if i'm not using
[01:30:19.380 --> 01:30:24.020]   it to save my battery time but there are many times when i'm working where i really want it to stay
[01:30:24.020 --> 01:30:28.500]   on and i don't want to go in and change energy saber every single time i'm doing that so this is
[01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:32.900]   like a nice little toggle switch um to let you just kind of say you know what don't go to sleep right
[01:30:32.900 --> 01:30:37.620]   now and i don't have to keep on a lot of times i'm doing presentations um and sometimes i'll be
[01:30:37.620 --> 01:30:40.660]   sitting in front of people and i'll just go up and be moving my mouse every once in a while and it
[01:30:40.660 --> 01:30:45.460]   looks like a nervous tick and it's mostly me keeping my monitor from going down because i
[01:30:45.460 --> 01:30:49.700]   forgot to do it and i don't want to set it up in the middle of the presentation so um uh this looks
[01:30:49.700 --> 01:30:56.180]   like a great solution to caffeine spell just like normal caffeine or with a k or yes yes it is and
[01:30:56.180 --> 01:31:04.500]   spelled the same way and um it's from the light head lighthead sw.com yeah lighthead
[01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:10.660]   s-great at you dot com caffeine cool very useful don't let your mac fall asleep
[01:31:10.660 --> 01:31:15.780]   maryland man you haven't had a pick and so long i bet you've got hundreds of of wonderful programs
[01:31:15.780 --> 01:31:22.020]   you'd like to tell us about oh leah where do i begin really where do i begin um i to tell the
[01:31:22.020 --> 01:31:27.220]   story of a love that never end i remember when i was little boy i want to be a fireman that's when
[01:31:27.220 --> 01:31:33.220]   i was eight i began there and his name was doother um so i don't know if we did this one before has
[01:31:33.220 --> 01:31:39.860]   anybody done menu calendar clock yes you poo pooed it when i did it but go ahead go ahead and love it
[01:31:39.860 --> 01:31:45.540]   now it's okay you know this is what makes you a maven um well i will do in that case i will do uh
[01:31:45.540 --> 01:31:49.860]   no no no you could talk about me your calendar clock i'd rather die than agree with you leo
[01:31:50.180 --> 01:31:55.860]   i'll see you in hell of a minute. Menu calendar clock is really useful it just puts a little
[01:31:55.860 --> 01:32:00.100]   calendar in your menu bar next to your clock with the to do listen everything it's just a well i
[01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:04.260]   like like so much i might have spoken too soon uh i i you know the thing is this is actually
[01:32:04.260 --> 01:32:10.020]   probably not exactly made for somebody like oh now you don't like it you know leah son of a bitch
[01:32:10.020 --> 01:32:14.660]   i'm gonna make an audible phone whenever i'm done with paragraph and you'll know it's time
[01:32:14.660 --> 01:32:18.500]   here's the thing here's why i like this okay so a lot of these these have been around forever
[01:32:18.500 --> 01:32:23.140]   there's this rich history on the Mac of these really cool little kind of menu things that let
[01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:27.940]   you do stuff with your calendar and there's several reasons why i like this one um uh okay so
[01:32:27.940 --> 01:32:35.140]   what are some of them you can make your own i'm not saying anything oh god i'm so angry right now
[01:32:35.140 --> 01:32:43.060]   hi man my flight's delayed let me twitter already did it for you the worst life day ever
[01:32:44.660 --> 01:32:50.180]   excuse me is this officially life day today i haven't even sent out my cards yet oh man
[01:32:50.180 --> 01:32:56.180]   anyway the reason i like this so basically you what this does is this pulls in your uh your to do's
[01:32:56.180 --> 01:33:03.300]   from um i cal and puts them in a list list under a nice little compact calendar uh and i also you
[01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:08.180]   can search all of these little it hasn't always had this this little search box i know they had
[01:33:08.180 --> 01:33:11.780]   that in the most recent edition uh there's a couple things that i don't remember being here
[01:33:11.780 --> 01:33:15.300]   before but like you the fact that you can search and if you're like me and you you capture a lot
[01:33:15.300 --> 01:33:19.620]   and have a lot of these to do's you can very quickly you know kind of winnow that down uh it's
[01:33:19.620 --> 01:33:25.300]   it's does something that i think um a good menu extension should do which is that it doesn't take
[01:33:25.300 --> 01:33:29.940]   up a lot of space when it's not open and then when it is open it affords all kinds of really
[01:33:29.940 --> 01:33:33.460]   cool further stuff that you can do like you can see this whole list or you can not see the whole
[01:33:33.460 --> 01:33:37.220]   list or you can jump to the preferences or you can click to go right into something and it's just
[01:33:37.220 --> 01:33:41.380]   it's neat because i think it's it's like a neat little like almost like a remote control for iCal
[01:33:41.380 --> 01:33:47.140]   that i like a lot and now so of course uh i'm an omni focus guy and omni focus syncs up with iCal
[01:33:47.140 --> 01:33:52.180]   and now actually round trips pretty well with iCal so you can create stuff and add projects and
[01:33:52.180 --> 01:33:56.580]   so on from inside of iCal well that's good because that was a complaint i had was that i was using
[01:33:56.580 --> 01:33:59.940]   omni focus on a bunch of different computers well yeah disclosure i work on omni focus
[01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:03.380]   blah blah blah but it's um it's not for everybody but for me it's great oh no i
[01:34:03.380 --> 01:34:07.380]   commented i think Alex recommended is a pick what you were gone we loved it well actually it's
[01:34:07.380 --> 01:34:11.780]   interesting because now that they've got the beta out there it's it's um i don't know i think it's
[01:34:11.780 --> 01:34:15.460]   it doesn't need stuff but i want to try to get as it you know whether any of us like it or not and
[01:34:15.460 --> 01:34:20.340]   a lot of us don't iCal is the lingo franca right if you've got to talk to iCal if you talk to iCal
[01:34:20.340 --> 01:34:25.060]   then you can talk to lots of different places right and increasingly with spanning sync handling
[01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:31.700]   my kind of g gCal sync up stuff and omni focus getting my tasks in there iCal as much as i kind
[01:34:31.700 --> 01:34:37.780]   of load the leopard version of it personally uh it's becoming a place that uh i can do lots of
[01:34:37.780 --> 01:34:43.860]   stuff and so something like um this uh what's the name of this menu calendar clock you're gonna
[01:34:43.860 --> 01:34:47.860]   edit all of this out right terrible name i agree with you you can't you can't remember but anyway
[01:34:47.860 --> 01:34:51.940]   it's just i like this though it's a very quick way without having to switch modes and go into iCal
[01:34:51.940 --> 01:34:56.020]   you can see your stuff it's really easy to use you can configure how you want the date displayed
[01:34:56.020 --> 01:35:01.380]   i think it's super handy um we had a first here we had a weo pick
[01:35:02.260 --> 01:35:07.300]   that maryland turned into a maryland pick and then a mac wine all at the same time
[01:35:07.300 --> 01:35:14.420]   i have so many leopard wines oh my god i have to say the fact that they took out that info bar on iCal
[01:35:14.420 --> 01:35:20.900]   is driving me crazy oh my god nirb is like oh commande commande and i'm like uh no it's ridiculous
[01:35:20.900 --> 01:35:26.100]   it is it's it's regott damn deculus that's a long time
[01:35:26.100 --> 01:35:31.700]   ridiculous the quote mr. john plain uh so i i like that a lot i'm gonna toss in this other one have
[01:35:31.700 --> 01:35:35.300]   you guys played with this uh little remote control app yet have you tried remote buddy have you guys
[01:35:35.300 --> 01:35:38.500]   talked about that no i don't think so i want to know somebody who's had the balls to run remote
[01:35:38.500 --> 01:35:47.380]   buddy because it looks really cool nobody nobody nobody let's you basically uh do uh apple little
[01:35:47.380 --> 01:35:53.140]   white multimedia remote type stuff via your iphone oh so you so so the thing is when i got to the
[01:35:53.140 --> 01:36:00.100]   installation screen and i saw insert into kurtl i i but i'm really somebody who's a total ipod nerd
[01:36:00.100 --> 01:36:04.100]   likes or excuse me i phone nerd like scott i'd love to see you use this because the list of
[01:36:04.100 --> 01:36:10.180]   it's at i-o i letter i letter o i-o spirit dot com they've got a ton of applications it supposedly
[01:36:10.180 --> 01:36:16.260]   works with and i'd love to know if anybody uh has had any luck with it maybe on a second computer
[01:36:16.260 --> 01:36:21.700]   it's a neat idea i was using i see the word kurtl when i see the word kurtl i was
[01:36:21.700 --> 01:36:25.460]   using sailing clicker and i used to love that but it doesn't work out any of the phones including

[01:39:14.340 --> 01:39:18.980]   show notes and it'll be a pdf and i'll give you the the whole schedule so pretty much we're mixing
[01:39:18.980 --> 01:39:25.220]   everything from uh we're doing a ton of podcast mac break weekly floss tech the tech guy twit
[01:39:25.780 --> 01:39:30.500]   uh this week of media, dig nation, jumping monkeys, neck break tech uh you know so all of that stuff's
[01:39:30.500 --> 01:39:35.780]   gonna be on the floor um over on the west hall now when we're not doing podcasts we're gonna be
[01:39:35.780 --> 01:39:43.220]   doing training and it really is uh um a very deep you know understanding green screen building
[01:39:43.220 --> 01:39:47.940]   you know camera how do you how to use your camera effectively um you know how to build opens how
[01:39:47.940 --> 01:39:54.180]   to do post production for audio or video how to do uh building animations using basic lighting um
[01:39:54.180 --> 01:39:58.180]   how to pick a camera for production you know so all of these things as well as uh some of
[01:39:58.180 --> 01:40:04.420]   craig cybers craig cyberson uh or severson um uh you know he builds these presentations i think
[01:40:04.420 --> 01:40:08.980]   some of you guys have seen some of craig's uh presentations yeah incredible and they're insane
[01:40:08.980 --> 01:40:14.340]   they are insane he's the best and yeah so so he's i he's got there's craig seversons video
[01:40:14.340 --> 01:40:19.860]   terminologies for beginners uh craig seversons video compression primer and craig seversons new
[01:40:19.860 --> 01:40:26.420]   media old media and they're just great presentations um so it's going to be in a very very dense um
[01:40:26.420 --> 01:40:31.140]   you know uh whole week on our side and that doesn't even include what pardangos doing in the
[01:40:31.140 --> 01:40:36.260]   conference end so uh you know this is going to be a mac world i really think that uh uh
[01:40:36.260 --> 01:40:40.980]   between what what scott and pardangos are doing and between what we're doing on the floor uh it is
[01:40:40.980 --> 01:40:46.500]   going to be probably some of the most dense training um you know you could get in building content for
[01:40:46.500 --> 01:40:53.620]   the web and content online uh anywhere else uh you know ever to date so um so i really think it's uh
[01:40:53.620 --> 01:40:56.820]   it's going to be really exciting we're going to put this as said we're going to put the schedule
[01:40:56.820 --> 01:41:00.980]   in the show notes the pdf uh we'll have more information coming up uh probably the week before
[01:41:00.980 --> 01:41:04.340]   when we do the next mac break we'll we'll kind of do the final little bits we're trying there's a
[01:41:04.340 --> 01:41:08.260]   couple other people we're trying to bring in uh to be on some of the podcasts and we'll be able to
[01:41:08.260 --> 01:41:13.940]   hopefully announce those names uh the week before uh but i'm really yeah really excited about it so
[01:41:13.940 --> 01:41:17.060]   it's going to be a big theater in the back of the west hall and you definitely want to be there
[01:41:17.060 --> 01:41:21.540]   fantastic yeah we look forward to that and scott you're doing some stuff at mac world as well you're

[01:41:29.540 --> 01:41:34.260]   pretty much everything including arpeo we're thursday the 18th and we've got luminary such as leo

[01:44:00.260 --> 01:44:04.660]   in fact the whole mac break weekly team will be in the front row there so you can come in and
[01:44:04.660 --> 01:44:09.540]   hang out and hear me and what we should do is get our pictures made on those little face placards
[01:44:09.540 --> 01:44:12.980]   that people hold in front of their face and make sure the whole audience has them so it'll just look
[01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:17.860]   like us there it's good you can just imagine us in our underwear and then and then uh that's when
[01:44:17.860 --> 01:44:23.460]   the oh god i'm always imagining you if you're underwear it's it's really all that gets me through
[01:44:23.460 --> 01:44:28.820]   the day is that image of Andy is under is Andy and when are you gonna launch your site you're
[01:44:28.820 --> 01:44:34.980]   working on it sounds like uh yeah i'm i've actually i did i did a post over the weekend to the people
[01:44:34.980 --> 01:44:40.500]   who have found the site have been watching it basically outlining the 12 stages of developing
[01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:47.700]   any project and also commenting that i'm ready to put a post-it note on oversteps 8 through 14
[01:44:47.700 --> 01:44:52.900]   that that basically read screw it i'm just gonna launch it dude just launch the damn thing just
[01:44:52.900 --> 01:44:57.540]   watch the damn thing i want to i need to put one more critical thing into place before i can really
[01:44:57.540 --> 01:45:03.460]   put launch it but again if you if you do some some some sense of hard google sign you will find it
[01:45:03.460 --> 01:45:09.940]   very very easily i'm i'm using that wimpy flicker slash google slash everything else practice where
[01:45:09.940 --> 01:45:15.460]   if i just put this little corner tag labeled beta on the upper screen i can get away with it being
[01:45:15.460 --> 01:45:20.740]   really slapdash and not very well put together at all but is it is it is it being served from
[01:45:20.740 --> 01:45:25.940]   your home computer at this point is that why you want to know mr scott bourn is uh giving me
[01:45:25.940 --> 01:45:31.700]   space on his mighty pada is not the pada go server as well as no it's it's even better it's on my
[01:45:31.700 --> 01:45:36.900]   private suite of servers there you go so there's a good chance that you might accidentally get
[01:45:36.900 --> 01:45:43.220]   porn so another good piece of the bookmark that you are really really or a picture of any anaco is
[01:45:43.220 --> 01:45:49.860]   louis the 14th the sun king your choice that's that is quickly becoming my official author photo i
[01:45:49.860 --> 01:45:57.220]   i i said i sent it to win on in the last days literally of producing iphone fully loaded i
[01:45:57.220 --> 01:46:02.100]   basically gave him like my usual collection of like official author photos and said oh by the way
[01:46:02.100 --> 01:46:06.020]   this is kind of a funny thing i did over the weekend and of course they decided to use that as the
[01:46:06.020 --> 01:46:11.620]   official author i could not i could not be happier because i really think it expresses it's very
[01:46:11.620 --> 01:46:15.140]   well done very well done but it's got a little bit of an uncanny valley thing going on
[01:46:15.140 --> 01:46:20.740]   it's a little disheart at least it's less photoshop work than on any cast member
[01:46:20.740 --> 01:46:23.460]   publicity photo for desperate housewives there you go there you go
[01:46:23.460 --> 01:46:31.700]   yeah so and he's uh of course in the chicago sun times cw ob.com is still the uh canonical site but
[01:46:31.700 --> 01:46:37.380]   soon to be changed uh that's the andi and aco's colossal waste of ban with soon to become celestial
[01:46:38.020 --> 01:46:42.820]   yes any mother we need if we need to prove we've already proved two miracles if we prove the third
[01:46:42.820 --> 01:46:46.260]   miracle the vatican will give us that's that's that right i think that's right we've got a
[01:46:46.260 --> 01:46:49.380]   fingers crossed there's a lot of paperwork ahead of us because they haven't still have in process
[01:46:49.380 --> 01:46:55.620]   jp too uh but they told me that as soon as the former pontiff gets in we're right next to him on
