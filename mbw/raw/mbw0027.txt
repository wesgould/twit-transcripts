[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.960]   We're Leelless.
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:56.840]   >> Leelless.
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.440]   >> And but back all in the same room, we've got John Foster here.
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.920]   >> Hey John.
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.880]   >> How's it going?
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.480]   >> We've also got, what's that guy's name?
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.680]   He's around here every day now.
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.760]   Merlin Mann.
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.440]   >> Hello Alex.
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.920]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.240]   >> And also our special guest that we've got Dan Aaron Dilger.
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.120]   >> Hey Alex, how's it going?
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.320]   >> Hey from roughly drafted.com.
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.680]   And so we're, we've got all kinds of things to talk about.
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.080]   I've gotten more into this whole jumping into the, into the conversation quicker.
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.480]   >> You think that's a good thing?
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.720]   >> Totally, it's very Stephanopoulos.
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.400]   Let's do this thing.
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.320]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.760]   >> See then, so what happens is I want to jump into it and go boom, boom, boom, boom,
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.160]   and then I go.
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.840]   >> But there's things I want to talk about.
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.840]   >> It's a show.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.920]   >> Have a show.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:40.360]   >> Have a show.
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.440]   >> There you go.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.480]   >> So we got a couple things.
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.640]   Big news today, shuffles.
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.720]   >> Did you guys see the new shuffles?
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.000]   >> I was disappointed that they didn't have the target version of the shuffle.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.840]   >> The target version?
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.080]   >> Yeah, the red one.
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.560]   >> The red one.
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.200]   >> Because it looks like a target logo and then the Steve version, which is the one that's in black.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.800]   >> The-
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.480]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.120]   >> Well, I do have to admit that I, that I would have, now just for those of you who
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.960]   haven't seen the news, of course the iPod shuffle now comes in five colors.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:20.160]   Five, so now you can get blue, pink, green, orange.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.040]   >> That's new, right?
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.840]   Those are all new in the original silver.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.200]   >> But it has the same colors as the iPod before, right?
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.760]   >> What?
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.640]   >> Same colors as the nano or as the different set.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.320]   I looked at it, but I looked like the same.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.040]   I didn't.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.640]   >> The shuffle, yeah, I believe it's the same colors.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.160]   I haven't looked at them side by side.
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.320]   >> Was it an orange?
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.960]   Is there an orange before?
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.840]   >> There was an orange before.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.320]   >> It was an orange before.
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.240]   >> It was the first generation nano.
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.920]   >> So that's- >> They're in shiny colors now.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:42.480]   >> Yeah.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.880]   >> The funniest part of that whole thing there was, you know, every any Tuesday morning that the
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.120]   Apple store gets that little sticky note and says, "We'll be back soon," or whatever it is.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.120]   Immediately, people go spiraling into this speculation about what it could possibly mean.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.200]   >> What I think is funny is that the build up, since we're right near an Apple store,
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.480]   the funny thing is, at 10 o'clock in the morning, though, literally when they open the doors,
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.240]   every morning at 10 o'clock, there is at least 30 or 40 people sitting at the door.
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.600]   And a store has 30 or 40 people sitting at the door every time they open.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.040]   >> They want to talk to the geniuses.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.080]   >> Yeah, part of that is the thing.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.440]   >> I know, I think it's mostly a genius thing.
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.560]   >> It's still just like- >> Yeah, it's always smoked.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:25.280]   >> Speaking of genius, it's not a Mac nano, or a Mac nano, a iPod nano, it's an iPod mini.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.840]   >> Minis.
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.280]   >> Minis.
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.840]   >> Minis.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.360]   Now, these are the shuffles that are now a color one.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.880]   I do wish that they, I think I might, I have the silver one.
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.960]   I would be tempted to buy a black one.
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.520]   I have no temptation to buy shiny colors.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.000]   >> I think the silver ones are pretty nice on their own.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.880]   I personally, I'm not a fan of the funny colored iPods.
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.880]   You know what, I got to say my wife's got one of those black first generation nano's.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.840]   And that's still to me like the coolest looking iPod there's been.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.640]   It's the perfect size, it looks great, the color is fantastic.
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.840]   It's a little scratchy.
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.720]   >> I like black.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.080]   >> Yeah, I do too.
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.960]   I do too.
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.320]   >> Wait, did you record albums?
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.400]   >> Of course, we're all wearing, just so you, for those of you listening,
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.760]   we're all wearing black shirts.
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.080]   Well, Merle has got a little bit of blue on him, but he's got a black coat over top of it.
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.600]   >> I've got the CBC logo on my shirt.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.680]   >> So wait, Merle, did you record music from a USB turntable and then put it onto your
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.200]   iPod nano?
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.800]   That's scratchy?
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.960]   >> Man, who have you been hiring, John?
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.440]   Man, no, no.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.960]   You know, that is the thing I got to say with the, I do have one of those
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.480]   minis, no, what are they called now?
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.880]   Nano.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.160]   Nano's the, yeah.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.720]   And I've got a green one of those that the Nike folks actually gave me.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.120]   And I do like that it's not as scratched.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.960]   I like that surface, but if I could have that in just silver, I think that would be fine for me.
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.160]   Do you think the kids like these colors?
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.280]   Are they excited about colors?
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.360]   >> I think some kids must like the colors because Apple keeps on making them, but I'm not a real
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.840]   color guy.
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.640]   >> I'm a watcher of iPods on the Muni here in town.
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.960]   >> Okay.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.760]   >> And I'm an observer of what the kids seem to have.
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.680]   I have seen, I got to say, in terms of, in the last maybe six months,
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.760]   I see a lot of people who still have minis.
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.880]   Minis seem to be the ones that a lot of people snatched up.
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.440]   And then after that, I think number two, lots of video iPods.
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.480]   You guys read Muni, right?
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.360]   What do you think?
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.560]   >> Lots of Mac, Mac minis.
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.800]   That would be awesome.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.440]   >> Yeah.
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.640]   You fit so much music.
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:17.200]   >> Well, I'm sorry.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.080]   It's like the new film box.
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.360]   >> It's a mini on each ear.
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.880]   >> It's multimedia.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.880]   [laughter]
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.000]   >> No, it's a iPod minis and it's shuffles.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.280]   >> You see a lot of the shuffles?
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.160]   >> I also see a lot of the new minis, or the new nanos.
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.400]   >> The new nanos are extremely useful, I find.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.440]   I have one.
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.440]   And I use it as a thumb drive too.
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.160]   >> I don't.
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.920]   >> Here's why I don't use it as a thumb drive.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.400]   I used to use my shuffle as a thumb drive all the time.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.400]   Maybe I am thinking of the shuffle.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.440]   Not the nano.
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.400]   I was thinking of the shuffle.
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.040]   I have a nano.
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.320]   >> Shuffle is the one you lose.
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.800]   >> Shuffle is the one that I'm constantly losing,
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.320]   but I'm using most of the time.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.760]   And I love the little clip-on.
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.600]   So I clip that on and I use that all the time.
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.640]   Especially when I'm working out.
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.000]   That's like the perfect little workout node.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.280]   And then my shuffle, I do use as a thumb drive.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.040]   Or as a big thumb drive.
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.880]   So half of it usually has data on it.
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:09.360]   And half of it.
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.720]   I talked to someone in Apple and they were like,
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:11.680]   "You should not be doing that."
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.640]   I just really--
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.840]   >> Not so much with the shuffle.
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:14.560]   With the bigger ones.
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.600]   Because I use on my video iPod.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.280]   Literally two thirds of it are my presentations.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.480]   So when I'm speaking at places.
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.040]   >> Really?
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.120]   >> A big chunk of my stuff is all my presentations.
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.720]   Because they're all backups.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.480]   Just in case I get there and my mat crashes or something doesn't work.
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:35.760]   I have everything I have to present on my iPod all the time.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.240]   So that I'm able to very quickly react
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.640]   and just plug it into a computer and figure it out later.
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.400]   So I'm pretty particular about that.
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.520]   But that's what I use that one as my backup drive all the time.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.880]   And the guys at Apple were like,
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:47.440]   >> Are you running it?
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.400]   >> You're just not built for that.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.200]   The hard drive is not built.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.720]   >> I was going to say, do you have a system on there?
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.360]   >> I don't have a system.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.720]   >> I put OS 10 on one.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.240]   And then I talked to somebody about that.
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.680]   Because I have my old white iPod.
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.160]   I thought, "What the hell?
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.240]   I'll make this into my emergency desk."
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.840]   I'll put whatever, just wear everything.
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.000]   And do you have any idea what you're doing to that hard drive?
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.560]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.120]   >> It's not rated for running a system on that.
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.440]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.080]   That's exactly where they were like,
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.920]   "Well, that thing's going to last you about six months."
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:13.040]   And I said, "Well, just long enough for Apple to release another iPod."
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.400]   >> It's like emptying a syringe of crystal meth into someone's neck.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.680]   >> Well, the funny thing was that I put OS 10,
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:24.160]   I think it was 10.4 on a first generation iPod.
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.000]   And I used it to upgrade all my machines.
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.560]   Because it took significantly last time to do it from the iPod
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.760]   than it did from the DVD.
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.720]   >> That's even faster from a Firewire hard drive.
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.280]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.640]   >> But I didn't happen to have a Firewire hard drive with me at the time,
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.120]   but I did have a first generation iPod.
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.280]   >> But you could hear the sounds of crests falling all over the internet
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.800]   as the disappointment bloom.
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.600]   Because people had some very fancy ideas about what was going to be coming out.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.960]   >> Somebody has been predicting wild and crazy things for this Sunday.
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:58.640]   >> I got to tell you, I got to tell you, this Sunday is going to be,
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.760]   there's going to be some very, if you want, we can get into it later.
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.040]   This is some very exciting thing.
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.080]   >> We're talking about iPods right now.
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.360]   It's going to be a big day for me.
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.560]   We all think that Sunday is going to be a big day.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.440]   We'd like to remind the crowd that Merlin has predicted,
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:17.040]   Merlin has unequivocally predicted that we are going to see a widescreen iPod
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:23.520]   hacked with Beatles songs in celebration of the Beatles and the widescreen iPod.
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.400]   >> Yes, absolutely.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:30.160]   I have my sources on this are extremely my butt.
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.520]   I have every reason to believe that, you know, that's Leo's fault.
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.760]   For the five or six people who listen to this podcast,
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.240]   you know that I am not any good at this stuff.
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.240]   And so I just threw that out for fun.
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:48.400]   And then Leo had an aneurysm, went on all these podcasts and told everybody.
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.240]   >> Is that a wire on wire.com?
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:50.720]   >> It's a wire.
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:51.600]   And wired, of course.
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.800]   And I had to say, I can't believe that this is being spread around,
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.000]   that there's going to be this.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.360]   And it's like, dude, it's.
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.200]   And this is the life that we chose in front of.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:05.680]   >> What was so funny was that Merlin made this prediction
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.880]   less than three minutes after he had said,
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.480]   I'm not going to do any more prograstic.
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.000]   >> No prognostication.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:12.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.120]   >> I'm thinking Merlin's completely phony man-up rumor
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.800]   should become a regular feature of this program.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:17.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.560]   By the end of this show, I will have another crazy rumor.
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.120]   >> Okay.
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.160]   >> That will be on dig.
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.480]   >> So did you make up the name of the yellow submarine iPod?
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:24.960]   Was that the-
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:25.840]   >> That wasn't me.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:26.880]   >> And someone else.
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.440]   >> Wait, they're going to ship a yellow iPod on Sunday?
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.640]   >> Well, I think someone took basically his idea and put a name on it.
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.080]   It was the yellow submarine iPod.
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.840]   >> No, see, I think you misunderstood.
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.760]   It's going to be an actual submarine.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.240]   Now it's going to be a full-screen submarine iPod.
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.680]   >> It's fully submersible in water.
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:42.240]   >> Well, yeah.
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.920]   >> It's going to have a periscope and everything.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:44.480]   >> A periscope.
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:48.160]   And it's going to have big seats for bass fishing on it.
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.440]   That it's going to have enough air supply for 20 minutes of diving.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.280]   >> It's going to be free like a bird.
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.520]   >> Well, because it's got 802.11 built into it,
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.080]   you'll actually be able to do a ping for real.
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:58.400]   >> Really?
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.760]   >> On the submarine iPod.
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:09:59.920]   >> Yeah.
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:00.560]   >> And ping, get it in.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.440]   >> And unlike the-
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.800]   >> For bear for dive.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:07.360]   >> And unlike the singular plan, theoretically,
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.800]   you're going to get strawberries forever.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.720]   >> Mm-mm-mm-mm.
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:11.760]   >> That would be great.
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:12.480]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.960]   >> So that means they're shipping a strawberry iPod as well.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:15.840]   >> Yes, exactly.
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.400]   >> So-
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:16.800]   >> So-
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.960]   >> How did I shut that one down actually?
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:22.160]   >> Apple ships 802.11N charges you a buck 99.
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.840]   So they went through with it.
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:24.960]   >> Wait, wait, the-
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.560]   it only costs $1.99 to get an 802.11 router?
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:32.560]   >> No, it costs $1.99 to have the one that's already in your computer upgraded.
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:36.720]   >> Oh, well, I read that if you bought the thing, if you bought-
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.280]   >> It's free if you buy it.
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:37.760]   >> Right.
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.920]   >> Well, it's $179 if you buy it.
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.840]   >> Now, but I'm saying if you already have it, so-
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:44.400]   >> It turns out-
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.080]   >> You're talking about the thing that enables your
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.120]   Macintosh computer.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.640]   >> Here's- let me back up.
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:49.120]   Let me back up.
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:49.760]   >> It's the driver.
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.960]   >> If you have a Mac Book Pro Intel Core 2 Duo.
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.120]   >> Oh, I've had this since we've been really long.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.880]   >> That's the second generation of Mac Book.
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.400]   >> Yeah, the Mac Book with Intel Core 2 Duo,
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.120]   the Mac Pro with Airport Extreme Option,
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:09.760]   and the iMac with Intel Core 2 Duo, they all have 802.11N there,
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.400]   like it was in the hardware when they shipped them,
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.160]   but it wasn't enabled because everything-
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.480]   the standards weren't finalized as that was at the deal.
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:20.480]   Anyway, so what they've done is that they now have a software enabler,
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.720]   and we talked about this a little bit last week, but it's now $1.99.
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.200]   >> Instant, you pay, you download it.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:27.760]   >> You run it.
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:28.240]   >> And you're done.
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.960]   >> And you got basket connectivity, theoretically.
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:35.760]   >> For all, even if I understand correctly, it's for all of those applicable devices
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.600]   that you have, right?
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.520]   You buy it one time and it works for all of them.
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:40.720]   The license goes for all of them.
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:41.280]   Is that correct?
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.480]   >> I don't know that for sure.
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.520]   It's probably per machine.
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.000]   >> But I thought it was something on Daring Fireball.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.800]   It said that you were covered for all of your-
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.240]   >> I bet you it's all of them.
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:50.960]   >> Well, here's the thing.
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.400]   If you're buying an 802.11N, or wait, that's what I'm going to be talking about.
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.880]   It's an Airport Extreme with N in it.
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.200]   You're getting that anyway, so save your buck $99.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.800]   >> The up data you mean?
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:01.040]   >> Yeah.
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:01.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:01.920]   >> So-
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.640]   >> It's the only reason you need to buy the driver from Apple for $2,
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:07.440]   is if you were using it with another computer,
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.280]   like if you had two laptops, two cord gos,
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.080]   >> Like this computer, well-
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.520]   >> And you wanted to work between them,
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.600]   then that would be a use case.
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.960]   Otherwise, like you said, you'd be buying the thing from Apple.
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:21.040]   >> Or if you already have an N router, then you want to be able to use it.
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.280]   >> Yeah, it's not from Apple.
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.000]   >> I wonder if the N router is the pre-N,
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.880]   if it works, if it's compatible enough to work with-
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:29.920]   >> It's got an N in it.
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:30.480]   >> Are they out there?
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.280]   >> 802.11N.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.680]   >> Well, there's a lot of N products that-
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:34.320]   >> Sure, but it's not-
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.560]   >> The things that people might have may not work.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.560]   >> Just have to get a new router.
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.040]   >> That would tell the problem.
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:41.840]   >> I would not-
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:42.720]   >> How fast is N?
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:43.280]   >> Fast.
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:43.840]   >> It's fast.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.320]   >> Pretty fast.
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:50.720]   >> Well, it takes about 20 minutes to get from here to Magnolia on the N.
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.920]   >> Man, John.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:55.360]   >> For those of you listening-
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.360]   >> Did you like Hire a high school kid?
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.880]   Where are you getting these from?
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:12:59.840]   >> I wrote them all.
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.040]   >> You hired a gag writer?
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:02.160]   >> I wrote these.
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.280]   >> You wrote these yourself.
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.240]   >> I wrote these myself.
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.280]   >> @Magnolia?
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:05.520]   >> No.
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:11.440]   >> So for those of you listening, John is referring to the-
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:14.480]   >> John's pun will now be provided with subtitles.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:14.800]   >> Yes.
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:17.440]   >> Hey, where's Craig Sanderson when you need him?
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.880]   >> For the San Francisco impaired.
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.800]   >> Yeah, so John's referring to the infamous N.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:23.520]   >> N.
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:24.240]   >> In Judah.
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:24.400]   >> Yeah.
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:24.720]   >> The N.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.320]   >> Judah in San Francisco, which is-
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.760]   >> It's a train.
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.040]   >> It's a train.
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.320]   >> And the N is it's theoretically fast.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.160]   But when we're talking about computer N's,
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.880]   what is the speed on an N?
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:35.440]   >> Yeah.
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.640]   Well, the theoretical speed,
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.160]   which is what they're usually given in,
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:42.240]   like 802.11g is what, 54 megawatts?
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:45.120]   So the theoretical speed for N is, I think, 200.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.280]   Or is it 200 or is it-
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.240]   >> Well, the mid-
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.520]   >> I think it's actually 500.
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:50.480]   >> I think it's 500, but I think-
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.280]   >> I think we-
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:54.160]   >> The typical speed is 200.
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.080]   >> So the typical speed for g,
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.960]   by comparison, I think is usually stated around 20.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:02.320]   So it's around 10 times the typical speed of-
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.400]   >> So now you're talking about being able to move.
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.400]   And what this is going to be important for, of course,
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:11.360]   is I think this is in preparation for dealing with the new Apple TV,
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.000]   on top of making just everything faster.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.680]   >> I can tell you what else is going to be useful for.
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.680]   I mean, I'll let the cat out of my own back here.
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:21.440]   I pop for one of those in-front ready NAS drives,
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.120]   which is changing my life.
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.400]   >> How do you like that drive?
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.440]   >> I love it.
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.160]   I love it.
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.960]   And to have that thing hooked up to that-
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.800]   >> And have real speed.
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.560]   >> And have real speed going at that kind of speed.
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:33.920]   Because it's the biggest to hang up right now.
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:39.440]   I mean, with backup, the hardest part is that first time you move your stuff over.
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.680]   The diffs after that are no big deal or the changes.
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:44.560]   But that first time that you move your whole movie library,
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.520]   or god, my iPhoto library, it's such a pain.
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:51.040]   And part of it is it's getting stuck at around a mega,
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.080]   now I get these confused.
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:55.760]   But what I'm getting over my network right now, hardwired,
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:02.400]   is like a megabyte a second in terms of the actual real data that's getting moved.
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:03.360]   >> Right.
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.000]   So and that's through the 8 to 11.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.240]   >> The ERG.
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.040]   >> Sorry, through the WRT54G.
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:11.920]   >> Right.
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:16.080]   So that's your cable going at 100 base T.
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.200]   >> Okay.
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.320]   So will I see a significant increase on the new guy?
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:20.880]   >> No.
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:21.360]   >> All right.
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.560]   Well, I'm still really glad I got that ready NAS.
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:25.840]   But-
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:30.240]   >> Well, you'd see a significant increase if you went to Gigabit.
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.240]   So if you got a new router, which-
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.440]   >> It's like 30 bucks.
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.400]   I mean, nowadays the Gigabit, no one should really be using.
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:37.280]   If you have a lot of-
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:38.960]   If you move in any kind of significant data,
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:43.440]   all these new Macs have Gigabit connections and you should be plugging them in.
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:49.120]   >> I would sometimes like John or Dan or somebody who's smart to talk about how you-
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.440]   No, that was not directed at you, Alex.
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.640]   But to talk about how-
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:53.680]   >> How you bring-
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.160]   >> You're gonna get a few Merlin sitting there staring right at me.
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.040]   >> No offense, Alex.
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:57.600]   >> Someone-
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.240]   >> Oh no.
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.680]   >> Merlin looks at me and he goes,
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:02.480]   someone and then he looks straight at me and he goes, "Someone's smart."
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.480]   >> No offense.
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:09.120]   >> I would love to understand at some future date how N enters into our life.
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.480]   And you mentioned something John that got me thinking in a previous episode where you talked
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:18.400]   about how if you've got this sort of impure mud network that's not purely N, it brings everything
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:18.640]   down.
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:19.200]   >> Yep.
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:19.680]   >> And so-
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:20.080]   >> If you have one-
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.400]   >> Do I need to run two networks to have B and G?
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:22.400]   >> Yes.
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.240]   >> You need to have a B network.
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:27.760]   If you have one device that's B, you need to have a separate only-
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.760]   >> You gotta teach to the dumbest kid in the class.
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:30.480]   >> You gotta teach right.
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:30.480]   >> And then-
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.600]   >> And what we're all doing really is we're all getting rid of all of our B stuff and we're getting
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.080]   all in.
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:36.000]   We gotta go get new extremes, right?
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:36.480]   >> Yeah.
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:38.720]   >> We have to go all the way up to get the full speed, get all the left.
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:49.200]   Oh, and one note, the software license for the 802.11N enabler software allows you to install and use it on all computers under your ownership or control.
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.040]   Otherwise pass it around.
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.080]   >> It's pretty good for a couple of bucks.
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.120]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:53.760]   >> Yeah, if you spill-
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:57.520]   >> So we just need one listener to pay the $2 and we're all good.
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:58.560]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.000]   >> You need to get control of your-
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   >> It definitely does look like Apple.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.760]   I mean, Apple's not trying to make any money on this.
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:04.720]   Definitely things that they-
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.840]   There is some concern whether it's grounded or not grounded.
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:13.440]   Even all the trouble that Alex, I was gonna say Alex, all the trouble that Apple's having with the SEC,
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:18.800]   I think that it's just them not taking any chances at all with anything and saying,
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:22.000]   one in the nine, they really don't care what happens to it after it gets out.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.040]   You know, they're literally just managing books.
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:26.560]   That's what it appears.
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:29.120]   >> And you think that's like a Sorbain-Zoxie kind of thing?
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:29.600]   >> It's-
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:30.080]   >> Or SEC.
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.400]   >> That's what they say and I'm inclined to believe them.
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.520]   I mean, you know, the-
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:36.400]   >> I don't know, money to be kind of worth the trouble in some ways.
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.840]   >> Yeah, if it was like 100 bucks, that gets people looking out pretty good about that.
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:40.560]   >> It's a $2.
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.240]   >> It's like half a latte.
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:42.960]   >> Yeah.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.880]   >> I think people were-
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:45.440]   >> Yeah, whatever.
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.880]   Whatever.
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:47.600]   That's all I gotta say.
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:51.840]   >> One thing that one kind of notable thing missing on the new router,
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:57.200]   the new en router, is that the actual ports on it has five as a built-in switch,
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.440]   but it's 10-100 ports.
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:00.640]   It's not gigabit.
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:00.960]   >> Really?
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:00.960]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.240]   >> So that seems like kind of a big-
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.040]   >> Yeah, but that wouldn't-
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.560]   But the thing is that it wouldn't help you.
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:07.200]   I think the theory is that it wouldn't necessarily help you
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.200]   because it's not going to go faster than 100 port, right?
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.360]   >> Well, ideally, say if you had a desktop and a laptop,
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:15.680]   you could plug them into it and go faster between the two, but you can't do that.
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.880]   >> I'm going to have a switch that's a gigabit switch anyway.
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:19.200]   >> Right.
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:19.760]   >> All the stuff that-
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:20.640]   >> It's nice to have it all.
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:21.280]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.320]   >> I'm going to get drawing of this or something.
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:22.880]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:28.400]   >> And so you have, you got your airport extreme that's going to be your router
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.640]   and your way you connect to your modem, however you're-
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:35.760]   >> No, I'm using the WRT54G hacked with DD right to be the leader.
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:36.080]   >> Oh, really?
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:36.400]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:36.400]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.760]   >> Oh.
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.400]   >> And then the airport plugs into that.
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:45.520]   And then there's another gigabit switch that plugs into somewhere else.
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:48.320]   >> And I'll tell you, I'll tell you from experience, we have a couple,
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.160]   I mean, I admit we have some fast drive.
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.920]   We have a couple of X-rays here.
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:55.520]   And then everything's all connected to the gigabit and you get used to gigabit and it's
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.960]   really hard to go back.
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.080]   >> It's like giga-
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:58.080]   >> It's like giga-
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:03.680]   >> Gigabit is like having a network with gigabit is like having a local drive.
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:04.640]   It's crazy fast.
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:07.120]   >> It's like having Fireware 400 hooked up to your Mac.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:07.440]   >> Wow.
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.160]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.480]   I mean, you can edit, you can sit there and edit full res plates over the, you know,
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.720]   over the network over the anyway.
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:15.920]   >> This might be a good Mac break.
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.600]   >> It would be.
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:20.240]   In fact, we could probably do handheld just in our little library.
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:23.040]   >> Because this is, I think it's, I mean, I don't know.
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:25.280]   >> Well, here's the finest, a little confusing.
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:31.040]   >> A lot of people who are Mac people, Apple people, don't want to be system administrators.
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:34.960]   They don't want to know anything about the IT stuff they want to plug it in and have it work.
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:40.400]   Which is really to Apple's credit for making these things that basically allow us to do that.
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.560]   But at some point, you've got to geek into the IT.
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:47.120]   You've got to go and, you know, have the, have a little bit of knowledge about your network.
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.680]   And the type and the topology of what it can do.
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:54.160]   >> Apple released a new document too that goes over that for the in router.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:57.600]   And it's really interesting to see how well they put together the documentation on it.
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.480]   I mean, it really explains a lot of things that are just going to just be able to get across.
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.960]   >> The screenshots of the app, the updated version of the app too.
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:07.760]   >> It's like the planning your wireless network document that was back in 19.
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:10.480]   >> Right. It's just updated for in and it has a lot of information.
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:14.800]   One of the things that I thought was interesting was that in also supports two different bands.
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:20.000]   So it used to be that with B and G are on one band and A was that weird band.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.760]   It's kind of like G, but it's on a different band.
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:23.920]   Where N can actually operate on two different bands now.
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:30.000]   So you can actually have, like you're talking about, run a standard airport network on one channel.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.600]   And this would be running in a totally different band.
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.040]   So it wouldn't interfere with it.
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:36.480]   Depending whether you have cordless phones or other things, depending on what band they work on.
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.600]   >> Get rid of your cordless ones.
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:42.880]   They're evil. Go to 900 megahertz and then all your problems are solved.
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:47.520]   >> I'm sorry. I just have to say we have this.
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:51.840]   When we shoot Mac break, we shoot some of those stuff,
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.760]   we shoot little things here.
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.360]   We have someone in the back room connecting.
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:21:01.520]   We have someone in the back room doing the capture and the camera just sits by itself
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.280]   in the front room and someone's sitting there talking.
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:06.960]   And the person who's doing the slate sits there and we've got wire.
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:07.520]   >> Walkie talkie.
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:08.320]   >> Walkie talkie.
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:12.160]   >> You know, little Motorola walkabouts, you know, going, you know, roll camera.
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:16.720]   And then you hear this speedy, you know, and then you, okay, you know,
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:20.480]   and then you go, you know, whatever, Mac, Greg, Jake, you know, and then you walk out.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:26.560]   And we got this thing where we go roll camera and then you hear this.
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:27.760]   Hello.
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:30.800]   >> Hello.
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:33.040]   >> You're on somebody's wireless.
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:37.040]   >> Some construction guy, some construction guy upstairs is like his little walk about
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:41.360]   saying he's hearing roll camera and he's like, I do not understand.
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.680]   What do you mean roll camera?
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.720]   >> So Verizon evidently has rejected,
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:49.040]   it evidently two years ago, Apple came to Verizon.
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:54.480]   Verizon was their number one choice, I guess, evidently for, or their original choice for
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.560]   doing the iPhone, partnering with the iPhone.
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:01.280]   And Verizon has, I guess it turns out they rejected Apple.
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:02.320]   They said, no, nye.
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.640]   They didn't, they didn't, they didn't want it.
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:08.480]   It turns out that I guess Apple, Apple wanted a lot of stuff.
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:11.280]   And we don't know what Apple's getting from singular, but this is the kind of stuff that
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:14.560]   Apple wanted from Verizon.
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:18.720]   One is, is they wanted to share on, you know, revenue for the subscription.
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:23.680]   They wanted a discretion on whether to replace or repair the phone.
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:28.880]   They did not want it to go, they wanted to be able to sell it at Apple and Verizon stores,
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:32.400]   but did not want it to be sold at Walmart, Best Buy, or other Verizon distributors.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:37.200]   You know, and so there, there was a lot of, you know, control, and they wanted to have a lot
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.280]   of control over how the iPhone was distributed.
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:40.880]   And this is typical Apple stuff.
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.320]   This is why Apple does what it does.
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:46.160]   It keeps a lot of close tabs in Verizon said, thanks, but no thanks.
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:50.640]   Was this a, was this a good thing or a bad thing?
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.320]   Do you think that Verizon really screwed up here?
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.400]   Or do you think that they just would have lost too much control?
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.960]   >> It seems like the interesting thing is why Verizon is telling us this.
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:00.400]   Is it kind of an announcement of not really sour grapes?
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:04.560]   Or why did they have to come out and release information saying that they were asked and
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:05.120]   turn it down?
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:10.960]   It sounds kind of like more of a cover our tracks kind of statement of like,
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:17.760]   >> Like the guy who is in charge of that deal, he was like, no, no, this is how it went down, guys.
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.560]   Just remember everybody remember how this happened.
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:24.560]   >> Well, and I think that they might have, and I don't have the background on why this came out.
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:27.280]   It seemed, it appeared that they were getting questioned about it or whether they had been in
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:31.040]   talks with Apple and they said, and I think that they had to say we were in talks with Apple.
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:38.000]   We turned it down. This is why, I think that it's all over the web over the last couple days of
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.600]   them doing it. And there's a wide variety of, this might have been a good thing because they
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:47.360]   would have lost a lot of control over how they do all their phones. But the thing is, I think that
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:50.640]   that they're going to be in trouble with is I'm a Verizon customer until June.
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:54.080]   You know, I mean, that's, I think that's these, I mean, I'm a Verizon customer.
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:58.480]   I've been a Verizon customer for two or three years. It's probably the best coverage in the
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:01.600]   United States and I will be moving to singular when I buy my iPhone.
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:06.480]   >> This is an interesting thing because this shows just how old-school phone companies really are,
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:13.040]   that they think they're thinking like three years ago or two or 10 years ago, for that matter,
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:19.280]   where cell phones have, are this mystique. And when you think about it, voice is nothing more
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:26.400]   than an application sitting on top of a computer. That's what a cellular network is.
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:33.280]   When you look at it as just a pure bit play, and it's only cell providers here in the United
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:36.480]   States. I mean, the big thing is, is that you go somewhere else and you go to Europe,
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:42.160]   or you go to Africa, which I see a lot. And it's all about the phone. You know, everyone's
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:48.480]   selling the phone, whoever you use to happen to hook up with your phone is not nearly as important
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:53.200]   as which phone you get and all the different features that it has. And like Wi-Fi phones,
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:57.520]   for instance, are pretty common in Europe or much more common than the United States because
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:04.080]   the cell carriers don't have the same kind of leverage. But I think that Verizon stands to lose,
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:09.680]   I will say something. I'll make a profit for not thinking. I mean, I think that they stand to
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:14.480]   lose anywhere from one to five million subscribers over two years. That's like a couple of billion
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:21.520]   dollars. It's a lot of money. I mean, they're going to lose mine. I pay, I don't know, I think
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:26.480]   my service is 100 to 100 bucks a month. One thing that's interesting about Verizon is,
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:31.440]   you know, everyone's locked into a contract of some length, but Verizon just changed their terms
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:37.200]   of contract recently. And that opened up a loophole so that anyone who has a Verizon contract
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:44.000]   can ask to be taken out of it. And so anyone who wanted an iPhone and who was on Verizon can
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:51.760]   escape their contract between now and then, I think it expires in March or April.
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:55.200]   That's an important thing for people to know. You can Google on the web.
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:26:00.240]   Because I'm on a month a month. My contract ended a while ago. And I was about to replace it,
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:05.760]   you know, get a new trio. That was, or actually I was looking at like the N95, I think, or something
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:11.040]   like that. And as soon as I, I mean, literally I was waiting for Macworld to find out whether
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:13.920]   the iPhone was really going to come out. And once it did, I was like, man, I'll just go
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:17.840]   month to month until I drop them. You know, so it's, are you getting an iPhone?
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:24.800]   Yeah, getting one for free, remember? Exactly. We're hoping that God born is going to get
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.520]   us one. I'm already getting signals from Scott that he's going to renege.
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:33.360]   I think his, I mean, he's well, I told you that if it was at Macworld and I could hold it in my
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:37.920]   hand, I'd get it for you. We could have. I think he's, he's trying to find some little weasel way
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:42.160]   to get out of that. If we would have known that that was the case, we would have folded up the
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:45.840]   little paper thing and given it to him. And then he's got points of businessman, John,
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:50.800]   next time we're going to get it in writing. Are you having an iPhone? Yeah. And sprints losing
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:55.760]   a customer. Yeah. Are you on, are you, who are you on now? What, you know, you know, you know,
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:27:00.400]   how you're making a couple of three new podcasts every day here. I want to just do a podcast on
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:06.640]   sprint. I just think it's funny that, you know, there's stuff, you know, the, the, the phone industry
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:11.040]   and the cable industry are, are two of these industries that sometimes seem like they really
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:15.120]   just go out of their way to kind of throw it in your face that you've got to contract with them.
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:18.720]   And you've just kind of kind of suck it up and deal with whatever their service is. And there's
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:22.960]   just, it seems to me there's a funny zeitgeist in the air right now between this and Vista.
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:29.760]   There's a funny zeitgeist about, wow, I may have just reached an important financial breaking point
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:33.600]   where I have to really reconsider where I want to put my money. Yeah. Right. So on the one hand,
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:37.680]   you've got people going, well, okay, you know, increasingly this phone is becoming a really
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:42.400]   important part of the way that I do things. And I really want this iPhone, you know, I'm speaking
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:48.480]   here as a notional person. And dido, you're going, wow, you know, if I want to run Vista,
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:54.080]   I really need to go buy some new hardware. Yeah. And I just think that my, my, my good friend,
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:59.040]   the Macalope was talking about today and the whole idea that this is a, when is the Macalope
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:02.880]   going to be on, on, on this show? That's what I want. Okay. So, you know, the thing, the reason I'm
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:05.600]   here all the time, yeah, Macalope's going to do that.
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:10.320]   That's off the record. So Macalope and fake Steve at the same time.
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:16.480]   And I'm already an extra man. But I guess all I'm trying to say is that it's, it's, you know, I,
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:20.160]   I think that when you're one of those kind of loud mouth internet bloggers, you can really make
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:24.320]   it too much of a case about, oh, good services and bad service that and you just lost a customer
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:30.320]   and blah, blah, blah. But you know, there's a lot of, a lot of feelings that store up over time.
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:34.320]   And it doesn't take that much to make somebody go, you know, why, if I've got to spend, what is,
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:38.560]   so let me ask you this, what's it going to cost the average person to be able to really run
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:43.920]   Vista in the way that it's meant to be run, right? You're talking about a pretty significant
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:47.360]   upgrade for a lot of people. I mean, it's going to, yeah. Well, it's a new machine. It's a new machine.
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:51.600]   Basically, I don't think a super fast new machine, but I mean, they also spend a modern video card,
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:56.080]   you know, I get a $500 dollar deal. It'll probably run. If you're really, if you're really sick of
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:00.320]   that feeling of being in that world and you go, you know what, I got to spend 600 bucks to get out of
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:04.080]   this. Yeah, I mean, it's the same token. I'm going to go and I'm going to drop a lot of cash on this,
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:08.080]   you know, and at a certain point, that $150 or whatever it is that hems you into your sprint
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:11.520]   contract starts to seem like, you know, this is going to buy your way out. I'm spending that every
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:14.960]   more, you know, spending that every month. So, you know, to me, it's not that's a lot of money,
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:19.040]   but it's not that much money to like be in this malignant relationship with a company.
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:23.040]   Who are you with? You're with sprint and you're with sprints. Well, we got me over barrel.
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:28.080]   I'm with nobody because I'm here. No, no, no, I just made no sense. He may take two drinks.
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:32.880]   I made really this is a thing. This is John went when you mentioned that you don't have a phone.
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:35.680]   People take two drinks. No, everyone take two drinks. All right. Where's my beer?
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:41.760]   Except you and me. You and me don't drink anymore. That's right. We're done. So, I made the conscious
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:46.640]   decision that I was not going to pay $800 a year for 11 digits to be able to have,
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:52.080]   to be able to offer people the privilege of bugging me when I really can't be really.
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:55.360]   Now I have one, but I'm a little rough about my message.
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:30:03.520]   Sure. But at the same time, it's like $800. I can buy a whole lot of stuff for $800.
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:08.720]   I think I travel too much. I think if I need it to. But also, John, you're a geek.
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:11.680]   And I mean that in a good way. But you're somebody who's willing to take a little bit of time to
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:15.120]   tinker with your life and say to people, well, there's certain limitations and boundaries that
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:19.040]   I've set here for how I want to deal with the world. But, you know, increasingly, that's not
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:24.080]   an option that a lot of people have. Like for instance, as I said, we were talking about this
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:29.920]   before. One thing you can say for all of us is I think we all, I mean, I don't know Dan very
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:35.520]   super well, but I think we all in our own way are trying to hammer our communications world into
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:39.280]   some kind of submission. And to be able, you know what, I don't mind paying a little bit more,
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:42.800]   but I want to understand what I'm getting and I want it to work the way that I want it to.
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:45.680]   And I got to tell you, there's a part of me, I guess the thread that I'm trying to pull out of
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:48.960]   all this is I think that kind of empowerment is trying to really bubble to the surface.
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:52.640]   Well, when you see people who they don't just want to switch over to a new phone, when they get
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:56.080]   excited about it for whatever reason, they want to kill their old phone. You know, I mean,
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:01.680]   I mean, you know, because I mean, literally, I go home dreaming about putting C4 into my trio and
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:05.440]   blowing it up, you know, because I'm just so tired of it. You know, I get so frustrated with.
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:09.040]   And to carry to, but to carry the analogy over, if sprint suddenly went, hey, you know what,
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:13.120]   we're going to charge you an extra $50 a month because of the new Vista network we've installed.
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:16.240]   It's going to run. It's going to run a little bit slower and you need to buy a new.
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:20.560]   No, you go, you know what, I want the analogy I guess I'm trying to make is that if you have a
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:27.040]   strong compelling consumer reason to go, okay, well, in my case, if I go out and I buy the leopard,
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:31.680]   it's going to enable me to do ABC and D, you know, and the value is there for me. I guess there's
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.640]   probably a lot of people out there who feel that way about Vista. The analogy I want to make with
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:41.040]   the phone is, you know, there's a lot of compelling reasons as imperfect as the iPhone is,
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:45.680]   it's going to really turn people's heads and make them say, screw the $150 that I'm going to pay
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:49.120]   down to sprint. And I think that my contrast thing is that I think that a lot of people are,
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:53.520]   there's a lot of people, and this will, what I'll be interested to see is if your prediction is
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:32:00.160]   true or not about Sunday, which one submarine, the submarine, whether the Merlin submarine is going
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:03.280]   to be that is going to be, I don't know if I mentioned this, I was going to mention that it will
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:07.840]   include a, a Friday. You did not mention it. Yeah, sure, you can make Benes and.
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:13.120]   So, but so the interesting thing is, is that if they don't release, if this is the only way
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:17.200]   you get widescreen, I do have to say one thing is that there's a lot of people that don't really
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:21.440]   care about the phone phone at all. They'll buy just because, just because they want a widescreen
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:25.600]   iPod. And I think that I think that what people are not calculating on this, I know we're
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:29.600]   laboring this, we're going to move on here in a second, is that is that there's a lot of people
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:32.800]   who are going to buy this just because they want their iPod be merged with their phone.
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:35.440]   And they don't really don't care about, I mean, it's not that it's this great phone.
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:38.720]   It's just that with the music merged with their phone. Well, yeah, merge well,
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:42.000]   because right now there's there's there's phone players out there, but they're a joke.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.680]   Well, they're not and they don't and once again, they don't get to the killer app, which is,
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:52.880]   you know, iTunes, which by the way is now illegal in Norway. Apple DRM is illegal in Norway.
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:58.240]   So Apple digital rights management lock on its iPod and its iTunes software. This is according to
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:05.040]   outlaw.com actually, is illegal. The consumer, um, Budsman. What's an on?
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:10.160]   Not Budsman is someone who works inside of an organization corporation, but represents
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:14.560]   the viewers and readers and so forth. Okay. To present issues inside the company.
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:17.840]   We don't really have any of those here, but they have them in Norway. And it has
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:25.680]   and they've ruled that this that Apple is, you know, I guess iTunes is illegal in Norway.
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:30.240]   So they also ruled that the Xbox is illegal because the games you buy for the Xbox don't work
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:35.200]   on the PlayStation. No, they didn't. Is Windows, is that illegal? Because the applications don't
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:38.240]   just automatically run on Linux. Yeah. Play these CDs on my track.
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:42.560]   You know, the question is, what is Apple really going to do? I mean, it's,
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:48.320]   okay. For the listeners in Norway, I'm sorry, but it's not a significant market for iTunes.
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:51.520]   You know, where are they saying it's illegal? It's this thing. It's anti-competitive.
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:56.000]   Yeah. I mean, and this is this is and it's not just Norway. Norway's starting to say this.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.240]   Germany's starting to say this. France is France has been saying, but France says this about every
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:08.160]   whole Europe. So, yeah, old Europe is up in arms. They're saying that basically that Apple is,
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:14.720]   you know, they're and it's true. I mean, when the longer DRM, the more songs you buy from iTunes,
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:18.720]   the less likely you are to use anything else because it's just I don't want to deal with
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:23.280]   the, you know, I don't want to deal with moving them over. I don't want to deal with converting
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:27.120]   them because there's a lot of songs. I mean, you can rip the DRM out if you want, but there's
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:31.040]   all it's pain in the ass. You mean, it's, you know, it's one of those things that it's I don't bother.
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:37.280]   I mean, I just I just use my songs the way I use them. Someday, J.M. will rise. Someday.
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:42.320]   So we just want to know what the number two player in Norway is like, who's making the noise about
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:47.120]   this song that they can't put on that player? Yeah. And I think that it's just that this one
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:51.600]   only works with one player. And now the question is, is the zoom really the zoom is the only one
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:57.680]   that uses the format control system numbers on zoom usage in Norway.
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:00.720]   Net net. Did you see that? Did you see the photos that were there were going around
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:05.680]   of the zoons that have been marked down now? They've got with the with the big markdown sticker on
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:12.000]   them. You see that? I didn't. So it's like the 83 bucks. $183. So what did that represent?
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.520]   Is that they like in the in the remainder? 25% discount. Wow. That's like the profit
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:21.440]   before the profit. I don't think there's any profit. Oh, that wasn't much profit.
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:24.480]   That was like, what is this like three months ago? How long ago? November.
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:30.160]   Yeah, it's they're they're having a little trouble getting market penetration. I think that's
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:35.120]   the problem. Speaking of iTunes, multiple iTunes libraries. Have you guys seen that? Did you look
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:38.800]   much into that? No, I didn't see that. Hold down the option key. Yeah. When you start up,
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:42.720]   you hold down the option keys. All right. And this is an iTunes 7. So this is an update this week.
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:45.200]   Just something iPhone has had for a while. It's I think it's really cool.
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:50.000]   Well, the way that you had to do it before there was this utility that you had to run and
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.400]   you could point it to the thing and it might work. Well, that was that was the hackiest of hacks.
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:57.760]   I know. That would do is rename if I remember it would rename your file. Yeah.
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:02.800]   And back it up. And then yeah, I began to pay the guy $25 to the privilege of doing this and like,
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:05.600]   or maybe that was the other one. But anyway, it doesn't matter because now.
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:09.680]   Like basically run MV. Yeah. But that's important. I mean, especially this is really useful when you
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:14.080]   have when you have like, for instance, my laptop, I'm very touchy about how much data is on my
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:19.440]   laptop because it's because I'm always running out of space. And now I can have an external
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:23.360]   library with my big library when I'm in the office. I can say, look at that library when I
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:26.480]   when I'm you know, when I'm traveling, I can say, well, look at the internal library,
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:31.200]   I can move that stuff around seamlessly. And it doesn't confuse iTunes about your DRM
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:39.520]   acceptability. And right. So the coolest thing was I got rid of 50 gig off my MacBook. Yeah.
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:45.040]   By being able to do this 50 gig. So you keep a friendly little child sized amount of music for
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:48.000]   traveling around and then you put everything on an external drive. And then when you go home.
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:50.800]   I have to admit, I have almost no songs on my
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:54.640]   ears. We're talking about those. I have almost no songs on my eye too. I'm like,
[00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:59.680]   in iTunes, how many how many drinks does that? Yeah. What do you put on your shuffle? You just
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:04.640]   listen to your presentations. When you're running my iPods, I have them. I have slide. I have the data.
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:09.920]   I have a jute box. So I have like a I have one old laptop that has that has tons has everything.
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:15.440]   And then when I I sync my shuffles. See, okay. You know, the next I am weird. I got it. I got it.
[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:20.400]   I got it. This should be the next this should be the next self reflexive Mac break is inside the
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:25.680]   incredibly squirrely lives of people like you and john and this and this weird like like palace
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:29.920]   of mad technology that you've been created. It works though. It works. It's just it's an old
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:35.040]   lap. It's an old laptop. It's a it's a wall street. It's like a little black wall street.
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:39.520]   An old old G3? Yeah. So it's a lumbard. Yeah. So it I had one of those two.
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:44.960]   I've had one of all of them in the so but they they just slowly you can see I got two laptops
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:48.320]   here right now. One's recording the show and the other one I'm actually surfing through and and
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:53.840]   the Wall Street is usually hooked up to this this big M station. How do you like your M station?
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:58.640]   By the way. Oh my gosh. So for the for you listening along at home, Alex was kind enough to to
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:03.040]   send me home one day with an M station. The little ball the little or it looks like what is that
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:08.080]   what's that Woody Allen movie where you're sleeping where you pass like the pleasure orb or whatever.
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:12.240]   It kind of looks like that. It's like a pleasure orb but for iPods. It's like an iPod bowling ball
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:16.800]   and I gave it to my to my lady wife and she loves it. It's great and I'll tell you what's great about
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:20.800]   it. This is this is going to seem really stupid but I love the fact that it charges. It sounds so
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:23.600]   dumb but you just put it out there. You know it sinks too. I haven't done that. You got up
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:28.160]   through USB so that you can actually sync to your IT. This is truly a great time to be alive.
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:33.840]   We're doing things today. We got penicillin. Okay. We got the M audio. You penicillin for now.
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:37.440]   Really? He's saying it's losing its effectiveness. There's only one left. There's only one. There's only
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:42.000]   one. There's only one. No, there's only one. So I'm left. This is bro. Running on one cylinder.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:48.080]   And a man. Hey, good steal of John's. And eat bananas while you can. All right. That's another
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:55.360]   this week. I love it. I love it and it's very easy. I have no dog in this fight. I apart from
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:59.280]   getting a freebie of this from Alex but I think it's really fun and it's very compact. Now the one
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:02.240]   that you have Alex to describe it to people. You have the top. You have a very large one.
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:08.720]   I do. That's much more Logan's run. It's in the future. Music will come from tubes.
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:15.520]   It's a big tube. It's like a series of big tubes. Well, the big truck. It's this big
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:21.520]   M station tower and it's got this big tube in the center is largely empty but it's what gives
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:26.960]   it the base. And then it's got these little ones. The top ones are kind of mid-range and high and
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:31.680]   it's probably some of the cleanest sounds. It's about three and a half feet tall. Yeah. And it's
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:36.160]   about it's it's a tower. It's eight inches. And it's probably the cleanest sound I've heard of
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:40.080]   anything outside of a really like if I'm going to spend a couple thousand dollars on a stereo
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:43.760]   system, I'll get something nice and clean. I like this thing comes with a remote too and the remote
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:47.920]   actually has a basin treble on it that you get a little with. Yeah, it's it's good. I like it.
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:50.880]   It's the best one I've had. Thank you very much for the both. You can see I have the hi-fi here
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:55.520]   and I have that one. Is that a Sonos? No, I have that's Apple's hi-fi. Oh, and then I have this and
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:59.920]   then I have the L7 at the house. And so I have like a little bit of all of them. And this this
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:03.040]   tower is definitely by far the best one that I have, except it's the biggest one. Well, it's kind of
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:08.800]   built in sub. This whole black thing is a resonating chamber. Yeah, yeah. And so it's it's it's cool.
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:14.160]   Anyway, have you seen the new ads? Did you see the UK ads? The technical thing was it got a Mac ad.
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:17.920]   It's very funny. Yeah, I think I actually think they're funnier than the American ads. That's a
[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:22.400]   minor thing. English. Why the English always funnier and smarter than we are. They're better
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:28.000]   educated and they're very dry. It's always that way. Also, the food's not as good there, so.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.800]   They have to do something. They need the amusement. Yeah. Well, people didn't like the Mac guy and
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:37.360]   in the American ads. And you know, I can take him or leave him. But the English guy almost
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:42.400]   seemed a little bit snipier. He does. Like arrogant and kind of. I still think that
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:46.880]   just like a footing. But those guys are an actual comedy team, right? In the in Britain. Yeah.
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:51.360]   And I think that the the I don't know. That's just the personality. Maybe it's a different taste.
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:55.520]   Sorry. But I mean, you know, Mac users. I mean, a lot of Mac users are a little like that with
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:41:00.400]   these users. I mean, it's I get that it's a little snitty, but that's the way we are.
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:05.840]   I thought they were really enjoyable. The English Mac guy looks a lot like the impersonator Mac
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:11.120]   guy that PC used as the imposter. Oh, really? Yeah, it's very similar. I only ever heard that
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:16.080]   ad when Leo plated. I never actually saw that. He looks a bit like him. So it's it's good. Now,
[00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:23.520]   also in the news, IBM and Intel are pushing most importantly to us, I Intel has released a new
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:30.960]   special transistors that have high K materials that are better insulators.
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:38.080]   Is that the silicon? Silicon chip silicon dioxide does the old chips is the insulator for the old
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:43.360]   chips. And the thing is is pretty good insulator, but it's not a great insulator, especially when
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:47.680]   you get down. That's what I thought. When you get down in the 65 when you get in the small 65
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:51.760]   data range, I just want to say like I was reading I was reading through this information.
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:55.040]   And I got down to somewhere and I don't only gets in the article that I have in front of me,
[00:41:55.040 --> 00:42:01.120]   but it said that the current chips, the insulator is five atoms thick.
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:07.440]   And so I just just want to say that first. I don't imagine that there's an insulator in these
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:12.240]   chips. It's fine. You can make something five atoms thick. That's what I thought. I was like,
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:16.320]   that's really quality control on that must be pretty intense. Well, a lot of times, you know,
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:20.720]   that's what the whole, you know, when you go buy speeds of chips, you know, a lot of the chips,
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:24.080]   you know, they build this wafer and they do the best they can to make it right. You know,
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:27.280]   the big one that has all the chips in it because they're all mass produced. And then
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:31.680]   they rate them. And so the faster chips are the one when you buy a faster chip, it's the one that
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:35.680]   was rated that oh, yeah, it's stable that fast. It's less broken than the other ones.
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:41.280]   That's what that's why you can that's why they're built to go a lot faster. But that's why you can
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:46.240]   overclock them is because they back it up to whatever they think is going to be safe without
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:51.600]   what they call a rat, which is the which was the big problem with the six or four. So all the G
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:55.760]   four stuff, you know, the reason that the the six or four had all this problem is because the
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:43:00.160]   alt of that had all kinds of a rat. I want you to sped it up. So while it was really fast at math
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:06.400]   operations, it when it got into when you started clocking at higher, it would start to break down.
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:10.560]   And a lot of that is what a lot of that's caused by the in someone's going to probably
[00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:14.400]   email and correct me. I'm not an engineer, but this is my understanding of it. I used to have
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:19.600]   these guys that I be happy to clarify any of this for you. Yeah. So anyway, so the these guys
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:24.000]   that I had some friends that newer, so they would get into these chip conversations with me. And so
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.480]   but evidently, you know, the big problem is, is it is only five items thick and it's been getting
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:32.160]   smaller and smaller and smaller as we had more and more transmitters. And the problem is, is that
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:37.440]   transistors transistors, sorry, not transmitters. Yeah, so transmitters like, you know, it's like
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:43.360]   transmitting between the tip. It's a bunch of transistors. So the, but the thing is, is that the
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:47.600]   voltage literally is jumping over top, it'll jump through the tramp, you know, through the
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:51.360]   insulator. And that causes, there's a couple things that cause obviously it causes a
[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:55.520]   rat. A certain amount of it can be handled. The other thing it does is it drains it can like,
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:44:01.120]   if it's shorting a lot in a chip, it'll drain your battery to did nothing as it keeps on moving
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:06.080]   through stuff. So among a lot of other things. Anyway, so what this means is that we'll get
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:10.400]   faster chips than means of Moore's law can continue for years to come.
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:15.520]   Where was law? So in effect. When the G, when the, I can't remember what generation of
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:22.000]   power PC it was, but the SOI architecture, that was what IBM was holding up as like the next
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:27.040]   huge wave. And it was a big deal in the 90s. And that now what they're just released is kind of
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:32.320]   replacing that. So it's like a whole nother set of great stuff for the future. Yeah. So it's,
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:35.760]   Moore's law will continue for at least a little while longer until we figure out that we need to
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:39.200]   build chips out of something else. Diamonds. We find lasers. We find lasers.
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:44.880]   Adams. Diamonds. They're actually working on that. Those guys that are making all the
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:50.320]   the guys that are making diamonds right now, the artificial diamonds, a lot of that is to fund
[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:56.720]   their research so that they can make diamond chips. Because the thing is, is that you can
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:45:00.400]   buy it now by, I mean, I don't know why anyone would buy a regular natural diamond now,
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:05.120]   to be honest with you. I mean, it's the only way to buy a diamond is a synthetic one, because
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:08.160]   you don't have to worry about whether it's a blood diamond. You don't have to worry about,
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:11.440]   you know, funding all kinds of things you don't want to fund. And it's just as it's
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:17.920]   chemically identical as the thing and it's cheaper. So, and the really the cost like you can buy
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:23.440]   it, the cost to them to bank the diamond is about $100 for a two carat yellow diamond, you know.
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:28.560]   And so they're making bank with their little machines. And it wasn't when they were first
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:32.000]   starting it and getting it off the ground, there was a wired article about it years ago. And
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.840]   they wired, I think, kind of updates it every once in a while. And tell you, oh, by the way,
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:40.640]   now they have 3900, you know, centrifuges or whatever they call them, the things that add all the
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:45.520]   pressure and make all the stuff. And so anyway, but a lot of when they in the original article,
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:48.400]   what they were talking about is what they really want to do is get the chip get to a point where
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:52.960]   you can make diamond chips, you know, and use that as the, as the piece, which would allow it to
[00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:58.320]   handle an enormous amount of heat, you know, because it's diamond, it'd be very hard.
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:01.840]   You could not only, you could give it to your, give it to your fiance.
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:06.320]   If she could put a new chip for your computer. You're like, why did you get this? I wanted to
[00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:12.560]   sparkly moron. So we have any other good news? Oh, by the way, just anyone use Lightroom? Do you
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:18.000]   guys use Lightroom? I don't. I mean, this is really a question. That's a new one. That's that new
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.440]   movie Scott on the show before we really talk about it. But Lightroom is going to be out in mid
[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:26.560]   February is going to ship off for the Mac. It's going to be 199 if you buy it before April 30th.
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:31.360]   Is that universal universal app? It's not a universal app. It's an Intel only app, I believe.
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:37.120]   Oh, that maybe it is a universal app. I'm pretty sure it's Intel. All, all Adobe's new stuff is
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:41.280]   for the Mac is all Intel only. They're not trying. That includes stuff like Dreamweaver?
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:45.680]   No, the stuff that they already have out there, but now they're starting to roll out new applications
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:50.080]   and they're starting to port. So, so we saw a premiere, you know, a premiere pro has been
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:54.640]   ported to the Mac again, you know, for a long, it took a hiatus after Final Cut Pro, you know, came out.
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:47:00.160]   And so we couldn't get Premiere Pro. And now it's coming out, but it's only, it's Intel only.
[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:07.040]   Lightroom is Intel only. The new sound booth. Is it sound booth? Sound booth? Yeah, sound booth is
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:11.440]   Intel only. So they're just saying, you know, we're not going to try to keep track of the old stuff.
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:14.880]   We're just going to. I think the reason for that is, you know, Apple's strategy for development
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:19.600]   has to do with the universal apps where if you build it in an Apple's manner, you can
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:24.080]   just push a button and basically have the Power PC version and the Intel version.
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:29.280]   Whereas other companies like especially companies that are putting half their stuff into the windows
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:33.200]   and half of stuff with Mac, they don't use Apple's tools at all. They use their own custom platform.
[00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:39.120]   And so before they were doing that was the reason why the plans for Rhapsody and old OS X were all
[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:44.720]   delayed was because their custom system didn't have any way to create Mac OS X apps. They were
[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:50.240]   creating, they had their own system to create Windows apps and old Mac apps. So now what they've
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:54.960]   done is basically done the same thing where they have a same custom system that builds Windows apps
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:48:01.120]   and they port those to Intel. So they're they don't benefit from Apple's architecture and they can't
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:04.960]   support the power PC, but that has nothing to do with Apple's power PC.
[00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:11.360]   They don't have this book. Alex is holding up a copy of O'Reilly's learning cocoa with the
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:14.880]   objectives. This is this is my new book. I just got it over the looks pretty cool. I'm actually
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:17.520]   pretty excited about it. Purple. What are you going to do with that? I'm going to I'm going to
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:22.480]   learn how to code. Is anybody else going to learn? I'm going to do a reading. I'm doing a softball
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:26.720]   here. Alex, I'm doing a reading. The kids. Now you understand. I don't know Alex. You're a busy
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:32.560]   man. You're running businesses all over America. You're you're you're not having a TV. You you're
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:37.120]   you've got a lot of balls in the air, but I'm going to learn. Are you aware how excited the kids are
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:44.480]   about the prospect of Mac Break Dev? Well, that's actually got me into it. So what happened was is
[00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:48.240]   the people were listening and John said, maybe we should do a Mac Break Dev and then we asked
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:53.200]   people if they want to do Mac Break Dev and people were overwhelming response. Yeah, it was it was
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:57.360]   like a lot of people not only were they put posting to the twit.tv thing, but I was getting emails,
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:01.360]   John's getting emails. We're all like, yeah, we want to play. And it's something we want to do
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:04.640]   anyway. And so I'll different levels to some people. A lot of people are saying, you know, I want an
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:08.400]   introduction. People are saying I want a video podcast. I want some way to like walk me through
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:12.320]   this code. And we're looking at making two different podcasts around it. One that's really more for
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:16.000]   the beginner like, okay, we're going to show you how to start. And that's why I started like
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:23.680]   figuring out what I want to play to. And so, but the then the discussion for coders to talk to talk
[00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:27.680]   about. Well, then I started drilling into it. I found an amazing wealth of resources right here
[00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:32.720]   in the Bay Area that we can either go to them and basically take our podcast on the road and
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:39.040]   talk to people that really matter that have actually written this stuff, or we can have them come here
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:44.640]   and they get a boondoggle trip to San Francisco. Yeah. So the so we're going to but but so as we
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:47.920]   started to prepare for that, you know, and get ready for it, I don't know exactly when it's
[00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:52.880]   going to come out, but it'll be sometime soon. And I got really excited. You know, I now I used
[00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:59.360]   to be a real coder. You used to you used to do some crazy old language Pascal. I did I started
[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:05.600]   with a similar I started with basic on a trash 80 or TRS 80 or Radio Shack little so fresh.
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:11.040]   And and then did basic for the Apple II E and then Pascal assembly language and machine
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:14.880]   language. Those were the, you know, because I was doing grat mostly graphic stuff. And this is like
[00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:18.080]   when I was like 13 or 14 years old and then the mat came out and I you know what happened was I
[00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:22.160]   just when the mat came out that it was a new programming language and I didn't quite get it.
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:24.640]   Like it was like, you know, it just was one of the things and then my life had become
[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:28.400]   busier. I was in high school now and there were other things that I was worried about and
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:33.760]   everything else. And I stopped coding and I literally haven't written any significant code
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:38.880]   and we all know how how I feel about HTML, you know, all two clearly.
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:44.800]   So so so I so as we started getting to this, I got really excited about it. And so I'm I got,
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:49.440]   I went through a lot of the books and I really felt like this was the the easiest one to, you know,
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:53.680]   kind of start playing with. And so I'm gonna I'm we're gonna do a reading in the pixel core where,
[00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:58.240]   you know, I where we all read it together and go through the kind of an Oprah for geeks kind of
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:02.080]   thing. Yeah, and I'm gonna open it up and I'm gonna go we should put a link to this in show notes.
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:05.920]   Today I'd like to read about Objective C the brainchild of Brad Cox Objective C is a very
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:10.320]   simple language. It is a super set. That's that's what it'll sound like. No, we won't actually
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:14.080]   sound like that at all. No, it's it's an interesting thing. When the Mac came out, it was a very big
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:19.280]   paradigm shift for all of us because we were used to writing our own UI. We were used we used to
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:25.360]   have to go and write to the parallel port or the serial port to make our own to make a driver so
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:30.800]   that we could print. And there weren't these services like the graph port where you could draw
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:35.040]   to and then say, okay, I need this printed and then there was a manager to handle that or if you
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:41.440]   wanted to open a file you called sf put file or sf get file and it gave you the dialogue and then
[00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:46.320]   all you did was got the path back. You didn't have to write any of that code. It was a it was an
[00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:50.880]   incredible moment and it took everybody really about two years to really get their head around.
[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:58.640]   Yeah, make it to make it work. I should plug my basic interpreter because you brought it. Yes.
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:05.440]   So I wrote a basic interpreter called 3b. If you go to 3am.com, you can go and play with this thing.
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:10.480]   It gives you a blinking cursor. Looks like an Apple to E. You type in help, it'll give you all
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:15.600]   the commands. If you click on the little help button, it gives you takes you to a Wiki that gives you
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:21.600]   all the stuff that I did. I wrote it in 30 days in March, 2002. Never written an interpreter before.
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:26.400]   So I decided that that would be a good thing to do. That's what I'm looking forward to. I just
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:30.400]   feel like writing something because I want to. But it's kind of weird. I mean, here's a basic
[00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:37.440]   interpreter inside of a web page. It is pretty cool. What are you going to write? Me? Yeah.
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:44.960]   I don't know. So it's going to be Objective C that we learn. Yeah, I'm not interested. I have
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:50.400]   to admit, for those of you, I don't know why PC people listen to this show, but I'm not interested
[00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:55.440]   in learning how to code for anything other than the Mac. I'm not really going to sit down. I've
[00:52:55.440 --> 00:53:01.520]   been toying with, I've never really learned. So I was mostly like a, we used to call them web
[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:05.840]   designers, but now they make $40,000 more a year and they're called interaction designers.
[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:10.400]   But I used to be a just a didn't do a lot of developing, but I think some of the interesting
[00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:14.000]   stuff is happening with the web development stuff. So I would be inclined to want to learn
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:18.880]   something like like Rails, but right. But having said that, it would be pretty neat to be able to
[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:23.600]   put stuff together on your own for the. I'm all about that. Oh, they're so you all about that.
[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:29.200]   Yeah. I'm not a net app. Net app. Net application is not done yet. Like to learn how to do dot
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:32.960]   net apps for really, it's a very mature framework. Do you write, do you write any code name?
[00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:37.040]   Well, the last little bunch of work that I did was working with web objects,
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:43.280]   which kind of appealed to me because of a combination of doing kind of graphic design of how something's
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:49.040]   going to look and then separately doing the code, which is not my stronger point. And just seeing
[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:53.280]   how things work together and making not only something that that looked a certain way, but also had
[00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:56.800]   interactivity to it. I kind of like that about the dashboard as well. The dash. Have you played
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:03.440]   with dash code? I think dash code is cool. Dash code in combination with just a bit of PHP or just a
[00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:09.360]   bit of Rails or just a bit of something on the server side makes a really scary and compelling.
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:13.280]   I'm just amazed. It's probably one of the funnest like developer tools I've seen.
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:17.760]   It's like it's like in the 60s when people made their own stereos, there's like this little fun
[00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:22.320]   like homegrown movement where people who have never done anything never made anything more than
[00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:26.000]   saying HTML page are going out and playing with dash code. I get emails all the time from people
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:30.720]   who are making these really cool little widgets for 43 folders. People are making stuff for Mac break.
[00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:34.640]   Yeah. And I think that's kind of cool. Actually, the coolest thing that's in
[00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:42.560]   Xcode is Quartz Composer. Yeah. So here's a programming language that has no code. It's a
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:48.960]   bunch of noodles and Alex is we're always teasing Alex about the noodles. But here's the thing.
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:54.720]   Basically, you're just hooking this to that and I'm using error pointers. You're hooking this to
[00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:59.680]   that and then eventually you write it to the graph port and it does cool stuff. And so you can hook
[00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:06.240]   up an RSS feed for example and use that as the input and then it'll display. And how do you do
[00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:12.960]   you then compile that or do you do a command S and then drop it into something? Wow.
[00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:17.520]   Like you can make it into a dashboard for example, or you can make it into a screensaver for example,
[00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:22.800]   or if you do just an 80 bit of Xcode, you can just drag that into there and then you have an
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:27.920]   application that does that stuff. Nifty. Would we be in our in our in our notional project here?
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:31.760]   Would we be using Xcode to learn? No, no, that's that's all we're using. That's all we're using.
[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:34.720]   That's all we're using. That's all we're going to use. The kids have access to it. It's free.
[00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:39.360]   It doesn't it comes with every single Mac. It's free. It works with PowerPC works.
[00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:43.920]   A powerful coder. Remember the development tools for next step were something in the order of
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:49.600]   $800 a copy? Yeah, you want me to generate otherwise or or be like code warriors, whatever, three or
[00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:55.200]   four hundred bucks. Well, MPW one point required a subscription to the ADC. Yeah. And I think it
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:56:00.480]   was 2,500 bucks a year. 5,000. I don't know. Whatever it was. We paid it and because it was
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:06.320]   cheap. It was the tool. Applications. What are you going to recommend today?
[00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:14.000]   I'm going to recommend a thing called. You have to go to the next person because I have to remember
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:19.840]   it. Merlin. I'm not sure exactly how I happened back upon this, but an application that I really
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:26.080]   liked a few years ago, Gus Mueller from Flying Meat has a wonderful application called Voodoo Pad.
[00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:29.920]   I know this is going to be old news to a lot of people, but you know, there's we have such an
[00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:34.880]   embarrassment of riches in terms of apps that do fascinating things on OS 10. And I have to admit
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:38.880]   that I've wanted to get to a point in the maturity of my own little system where I wasn't constantly
[00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:48.960]   fiddling, but I have had a need for a new tool. And I went back to Voodoo Pad to find that in 3.1
[00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:54.320]   or wherever it is now, there is a lot of really cool crap in this application. Now, Voodoo or
[00:56:54.320 --> 00:57:00.800]   so Voodoo Pad, if you don't know what it is, excuse me, is basically it's a Mac wiki as a desktop
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:04.400]   app. So it's a desktop app that's a wiki. You start typing in camel case and it makes links.
[00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:07.600]   You click those links, they turn into new pages. They all live inside of this application. You can
[00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:11.760]   have multiple different ones of these. Can you have lots of people accessing the same one?
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:16.560]   No, I don't think it's a personal way to do it. I haven't drilled down on this, but there was talk
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:22.320]   at one point of how you could make this interact with, I forget the name of one of the very like
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:26.560]   total like ghetto wikis and it wasn't like media wiki or anything, but there was something that
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:30.800]   you could sync with. He's talked about having some sync functionality for that. So that's the
[00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:34.240]   downside. But here's what's great about it. So even if you're just a dude out there typing
[00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:39.200]   inside your your little local wiki, you can very easily do things like push it out to your iPod.
[00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:43.520]   You can quickly export it using any of a variety of skins into a web page. I think us actually
[00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:48.400]   maintains the basic online documentation inside of wiki and then just pushes it out. But some of the
[00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:52.480]   new features that are mind blowing and now has this sketch functionality where you can pop up a
[00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:56.480]   page and start writing and do a little drawing right inside of the page. Something that's really
[00:57:56.480 --> 00:58:00.480]   cool. I dropped in, I made a Mac break page, was typing in everybody's names and noticed that the
[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:07.200]   names not camel case returning into links. And I'm like, boo. And I mouse over, it's picking
[00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:12.240]   those up out of the address book. So I can click to open the address book entry or click to send
[00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:17.760]   email right from inside this app. And then finally, if you're somebody like Alex, who doesn't want to
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:22.560]   do HTML, but has a certain amount of, oh, anal retainiveness for any page that you've got,
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:28.960]   you can create aliases for it. So typically you would have a page in old school, like PHP,
[00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:33.520]   you know, wiki kind of talk, you would say something like, Alex Lindsey in camel case,
[00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:39.920]   as one word, but you can also say capital A, Alex space capital L Lindsey also equals that.
[00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:45.680]   And just the word Alex equals that. And pixel core guy equals that. So anytime you type any of
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:49.440]   those words, pixel core guy, it automatically generates that, you know, and this sounds kind of
[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:53.520]   goofy, but that's that's actually pretty powerful. Anyway, it's a terrific app. And of course,
[00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:57.520]   it works with Quicksilver. Very easy to interact with Quicksilver. There's some very cool little
[00:58:57.520 --> 00:59:01.440]   Apple scripts that will let you even append the pages inside of your wiki. If you're a huge
[00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:06.480]   Quicksilver nerd like me, I think it's around, I want to say around 30 bucks flying meat.com,
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:11.520]   I believe we'll double check that for the show notes. But voodoo pad is just a terrific application.
[00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:14.800]   I met Gus and he's a great guy. And I highly recommend it.
[00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:19.920]   And well, I have to admit that I don't have an application in mind. But
[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:27.840]   just to be, I don't know, a problem, I'll call mine leopard because I think it's coming out soon.
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:31.200]   I think people like it. Do we think it's going to come out next week?
[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:35.200]   I don't have any special information. No, but that'd be great.
[00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:40.880]   Apparently, apparently the launch of leopard, Apple will be doing like a Microsoft sort of thing
[00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:43.920]   where we're leopard is going to be branded. You know, it'd be late.
[00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:48.160]   Well, well, well, well, are we still on my guy?
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:52.000]   If you remember, like every time Microsoft comes out with Windows, they also come off
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:57.040]   office and they're branded similarly. They did 2000 and later. And that looks like what Apple's
[00:59:57.040 --> 01:00:03.440]   doing now with leopard and iWork and iLife is kind of putting them all in the same UI and the
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:09.200]   same marketing deal and pasty. Can I ask a related question? Sure. Can anybody, so I think,
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:15.760]   was it you was talking to this about Alex? The Apple TV and the ability to possibly use leopard?
[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:26.080]   The rumors that you're able to push leopard, push your desktop to your TV through Apple TV.
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:31.600]   The rumor is that there is a that in the development leopard that people have seen,
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:37.680]   this is a rumor that is widely circulated. So I'm not breaking any NDAs that you will be able to do
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:43.040]   that, which I think sounds interesting. It would be trivial to do. Apple has the since tiger they
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:48.960]   built in the VNC. And when it's more trivial than Apple, right? And to so if you check your email
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:53.040]   where you're watching the book, would that be faster than remote desktop? It would be kind of
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:01:00.720]   identical to what easier to use. Apple's remote desktop uses a special, actually, I think since
[01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:06.080]   two, they use VNC and they do some special things on top of it. Basically, what VNC was designed for,
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:10.960]   it was AT&T Labs came out with the thing for the little, they had this idea that you'd have a
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:15.840]   wireless pad and be walking around and be basically a terminal. So that's what VNC was designed for.
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:22.240]   It was virtual network computing. It was like the NC on this virtual page. And so that didn't really
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:26.160]   go anywhere. So they've turned that into a way to do remote sharing from one computer.
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:28.160]   Now they're just awesome by the way. I think Ross.
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:29.680]   So you're talking that's from amazing way.
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:31.920]   I'll be sitting in India.
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:37.120]   I'll sit. I'll be sitting in my hotel in Mumbai. I was sitting in my hotel in Mumbai,
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:42.080]   uploading stuff to myself from this laptop sitting here connected to all the computers here. So I
[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:46.720]   would control this laptop, go over here, grab some files from the server, move them over, and from
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:52.960]   there, FTP, so that I could download them in Mumbai. But there's this weird thing about being
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:55.200]   literally halfway around the world controlling my computer.
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:02:00.240]   What are you excited about that? What's your leopard grabby thing? What are you most looking
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:05.040]   forward to? Well, one of the things that I was on my wish list for leopard last year was I was
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:09.600]   calling it Remote Desktop Express because the Remote Desktop product is so expensive. It's
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:13.680]   like a $300 product that was designed for school administrators or whatever to look at 10,000
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:18.960]   kids, laptops, whatever. And I wanted them to make a product that was similar to what Microsoft
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:24.960]   has with bundled in and when does the what is it called that Remote Desktop? Right. Anyway,
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:33.440]   that anyone would use and how that is being exposed is through iChat. So you can put your
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:37.120]   whole I can't think what they're actually calling it, but you'll be able to control someone else's
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:40.400]   computer while you're on iChat with them. So you're talking to a mic and chat video. Share my
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:45.280]   video. Share my video. Show my video. 50. Yeah, no, me. Like for instance, if you don't have the
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:51.280]   money, by the way, like all Mac, all Mac and Tush is all modern Macs with OS 10 can be controlled by
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:55.920]   Apple Remote Desktop. It's built in. You just turn it on as a radio box, you know, in your sharing
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:03:00.640]   and they can be controlled, but it's the controller that costs, I think is it $399 to be on? Well,
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:04.720]   it's only if you buy the real expensive version and that's kind of like a system of an initiator
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:09.360]   type version that allows you to look at a whole bunch of Macs across network and pull information
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:12.720]   from them and do all this kind of database stuff. But I don't think you can look at another
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:17.360]   computer and control it with just your regular OS 10. You can get a free if you turn that on,
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:22.000]   if you turn on Remote Desktop sharing on the Mac that you want to see, you can get a free client,
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:26.240]   a VNC viewer. Okay. And there's several of those that's standard. We use chicken and the VNC
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:31.200]   here. So you can use that to freely look at it. And we use that. That's what I was going to say.
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:37.040]   There's also Devin. Devin has one of those. Devin, why am I forgetting the name of that company?
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:42.240]   The people who make Devin think have a John did you come up with a with a I did and so I'm going
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:47.440]   to describe the issue that I have and that is that Google is an interesting search engine,
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:52.000]   but it doesn't always give me the answers that I'm looking for. I'm really addicted to using the
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:58.800]   search box over in the upper right hand corner of Safari. Isn't that Google? Yeah, it's Google,
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:03.600]   but it bugs me that it's only Google. And so it turns out there's a tool and I can't remember
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:10.480]   the name of it, but this is why we have delicious tag and VW ideas because I put it there. And
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:15.040]   this is also why we have show notes. So there's a random tool somewhere.
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:17.520]   Yeah, it's this thing and I can't remember the name of it because I wasn't.
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:23.280]   Not to have our laptop to write it down on my on my it's a better show. It's a much better show.
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:30.080]   You're right on my what's it called? My Merlin man hipster PDA shuffle. See, I'm using the hipster
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:35.040]   shuffle. Yeah, that's the problem. You guys watch that video. The hipster shuffle is really cool,
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:39.760]   but the problem is is that the way that you figure out if you're in random access mode or
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:44.000]   or sequential mode is you flip a coin. Hey, don't do that. Everybody might like little things.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000]   And then it tells you which way to go, but then because it's a shuffle, there's no displays.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.800]   You have to remember everything. So the.
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:51.920]   Jotted on a card.
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:58.960]   No, no, no, no. This is the hipster shuffle. So anyway, the idea is that you can change to
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:03.200]   your search engine. You can change it to a nine. You can change it to Google images. You can change
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:09.760]   it to Google blog. You can change it to ask Jeeves or ask.com, whatever that is. And you can change it.
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:14.320]   So I want to go look at this thing over here. And so the cool thing is when you're doing research
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:18.720]   is that you're not taking out of the paradigm of what you're always used to doing, which is
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:25.040]   command L tab to get to that to get to that space. Right. So anyway, phallics would look that up
[01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:28.320]   and tell us what that's something Firefox said for a while, right? Yeah, we're going to put it
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:34.080]   into the show notes. Yeah. But the idea is this. It's free tool. It works for PowerPCs or for
[01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:42.320]   Intel Macs. And you drag it into it's a basically it's been nine. Although people in the forums have
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:49.360]   complained that it will crash in some cases. But I've used it for like almost a year and a half now
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:53.760]   and I've never had a problem with it. Is it near the top? Yep, it should be near the top. I don't see
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:59.200]   it. I think you're I think you're on drugs. I am not much Magnolia. Yeah. Yeah. Alex. I'm not
[01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:03.200]   drinking Alex. Yes. Alex, do you have a pick for the week? I do.
[01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:14.240]   And okay, so I start with the price. Does I have noodles? Seven hundred dollars.
[01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:17.760]   It's the worst part is I did five hundred dollars. I didn't know what it was. I didn't know how much
[01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:21.120]   it was. You started you started out. So you found a great app you like. And then I looked at it. It
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:26.480]   was six hundred ninety nine dollars and ninety nine cents. Oh, come on. You've got to be kidding.
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:30.480]   No, it isn't. It's it's really well one version of it is literally a penny shy of seven hundred
[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:34.960]   dollars. So I'm still under under the seven hundred dollars because I've decided that I can't
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:39.200]   actually recommend anything over seven hundred dollars because Merlin gives me our time. But I'm
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:43.280]   one penny under you call the developer. If I was changed the price, I actually I actually
[01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:46.640]   like that. It used to be seven forty nine. And I said, I called him. I said, I'm gonna talk about
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:50.320]   this on Mac break and you don't understand. I can't deal with Merlin and you're gonna have to make
[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:55.120]   it six ninety nine down anyway. So so here's what it is. I think I hope I didn't already recommend
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:58.320]   this one because I was baited. Oh, no, I was beta testing it. So I couldn't talk about it. So
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:04.000]   we have this little thing that I've been testing for a while. And now it's been released in
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:09.680]   it's called scope box. Now this is a geeky little thing. So this is not kind of general Mac usage.
[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:14.800]   But if you're into if you're into this, it's very, very useful. So what scope box does is when we
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:17.840]   when we're doing video production and we're doing record, you know, we're recording,
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:21.760]   what you want to be able to see is lots of information about your video input. So you have
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:25.680]   your feeding lots of data into your feeding your video data and what you want to see are
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:29.440]   things like what they call a vector scope. It shows you where the colors are hitting in there.
[01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:34.960]   You know, whether the colors are kind of where they are or something. Somewhat out of gamut,
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:40.080]   largely just if they're in the right color space, then you also have a histogram showing you the
[01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:44.240]   dark light. Most importantly for a lot of what we do, which is green screen, we need to see what's
[01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:50.240]   called the RGB parade. And so the RGB parade is the it's basically these little things that show you
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:54.320]   the image that's represented in the red, green, and blue, because if you have a green screen,
[01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:57.200]   you want the green screen to be really high and the red and the blue to be really low
[01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:03.120]   for the screen. And so what scope box does is this this opens up and there's this gray thing and
[01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:08.080]   you can see your image and you can literally just like right click and drop new little different
[01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:12.240]   ways of measuring it. You just in this open area, you can move it around the way you want it to.
[01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:15.680]   So it's not like a specific, this is the way you're going to look at it. You can move it and make
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:20.480]   it look any way you want. So you can set this all up so you so that you can really get all that
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:24.800]   information and to give you an idea, a lot of these scopes, like if you bought these and they're
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:28.640]   more powerful when you buy the physical ones, but the physical ones are going to cost you like
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:32.800]   five or 10 grand to have all these scopes and for HD for the kind of HD that we do.
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:37.600]   With the with the 950, we're talking about a little closer to 30 grand, you know,
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:44.080]   saving money, Alex. I'm saving money. This is not $700 spent. This is maybe what? $25,000
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:47.440]   by car worth the money I saved theoretically you could spend actually not going to buy a car,
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:50.640]   but but but but you know, you save a lot of money. But the point is, is that you're really
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:54.400]   getting flexible. It's very, very flexible. It's really, really easy to use. And
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:59.120]   it's just one of those things we literally were talking about developing an in-house because we
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:03.760]   needed it so badly. And so that's why I'm recommending it. I was so excited to see that like it was
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:07.120]   one of those things that I hadn't heard of and suddenly it just popped out. It was, you know,
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:10.480]   it's on beta and so I emailed the guys and they sent me. They have any kind of like a demo or
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:13.200]   anything you can try? I think that there's a demo on the site. It's actually cool. Yeah,
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:18.080]   there's a trial that you can download on their site. It's just scopebox.com divergentmedia.com.
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:21.920]   But if you do scopebox.com, it'll send it to you. You have to fill in some like little
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:26.400]   thing things, but it will, and tell everyone if you download it, make sure to say it says,
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:30.480]   "Where did you hear about it?" And make sure to say, "Branch." And I don't get anything out of that,
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:36.800]   by the way. So why would I want to spend half of what Final Cut Pro costs? Because Final Cut Pro
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:41.120]   already has scopes in it. Yeah, but here's what it doesn't have. So Final Cut Pro has,
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:45.760]   when you open scopes in Final Cut Pro, what you get is the vector scope and you can get the
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:54.080]   and then you can get the general luminance, like the light. Yeah, but the problem is,
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:59.440]   is that what you don't get specifically are, there's a lot of other ways that you could measure it.
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:04.800]   Number one, number two, is that there are the RGB parade, if you're doing green screen stuff,
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:09.440]   it's absolutely necessary. So what we end up having to do in Final Cut Pro is capture
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:14.320]   and then look at the RGB parade. Because it has it in there, but we can't look at it live.
[01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:18.640]   The big thing is, is that what I'm looking at with this with this scope box, is I'm looking at a live
[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:24.560]   feed straight into my camera, into my computer. And I'm able to make a lot of decisions about all
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:29.680]   of this stuff in real time, while, and what happens is, is just to give you an idea from a visual effects
[01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:34.960]   perspective, if I have a set of kinos, these big fluorescent lights that I'm lighting up my green
[01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:40.880]   screen with, I can literally, when I'm looking at scope box, I can look at the little things,
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:44.080]   I turn the monitor around, so I'm looking at it, and I can literally move the lights and just
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:49.440]   even out my screen in minutes, like two or three minutes. And the thing is for the thing, having
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:54.160]   that just right saves a lot of time. And when you're in the production environment, it's very,
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:58.480]   well, here's the thing, I've done production on green screen, blue screen, and the way that I did
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:05.680]   this before I had scope box, and if I didn't have scopes, I took a light meter, I went like this,
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:10.640]   and I looked at it, because I couldn't move it, and I went like this, I'm basically moving my
[01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:15.840]   hand up and down, and I would go and I'd try to balance it out to get it to be a quarter of a stop.
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:20.560]   And it took like two hours to do this. And I can do it, I can do it as a one man job.
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:25.360]   I can even, I can even, I can get an even screen with two kinos, I can get an even screen in less
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:30.080]   than three minutes. So the other, with this, with this, but this was 15 years ago before they
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:33.520]   even had this kind of stuff. And final cut pros great, but if you're just capturing,
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:37.440]   that's way overkill. I mean, the other thing you have to look at is, you know, if you're on your
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:40.720]   machine and you have final cut on some other machine, you're capturing to this machine,
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:44.960]   final cut is a lot of editor to open up just because you want to capture off of a live feed,
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:50.320]   you know, that's not only this is Mac only. So I can put this on, I can put this on an old power
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:54.160]   book and just dedicate the power book for viewing if you're not recording. The other thing that
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:58.160]   scope box will do is it'll actually write to drive. So you can actually use it as your capture
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:02.240]   thing as well. So you can actually need that. Well, we capture it through Final Cut Pro and
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:08.480]   in right now you're you're tying up a camera and a Mac whenever you guys are capturing off
[01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:12.080]   TV. We still have to do that. We still have to do that. I mean, that doesn't change, but the point
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:19.040]   is that isn't it? Especially during Mac world. Exactly. Oh, man. Literally, we we are moving
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:23.280]   towards we're not quite there, but we've made the commitment that by the middle of this year,
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:27.360]   there's two things. One is that for the Mac for the pixel core stuff, not necessarily
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:31.840]   Twitch stuff, but for the pixel core stuff. We are going to be HD only and we're going to be
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:37.120]   tapeless. We're not going to be there will be no more tapes in the office. You know, we're done.
[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:41.840]   So how do you hold how do you hold the cords down onto the floor? Yeah, I see that's a clue.
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:50.240]   There you go. All right. Dan Dilder, thanks so much for coming. Thanks for having me.
[01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:53.840]   What's what's your latest article right now on roughly drafted? I've been writing all kinds of
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:58.800]   stuff about the iPhone and comparing it to other phones. I don't care about third party applications.
[01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:04.160]   I know that's was everybody wanted about that. And other development platforms from
[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:13.840]   I've been doing a history of Windows C, Windows Mobile and and the Palm. Oh, that's how that all
[01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:18.160]   played out. So it's kind of interesting little learning experience for me to research all that.
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:24.800]   That's awesome. So and that's it's roughly drafted.com. Right. It's probably the most complex.
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:30.880]   It's it's I web, right? Yeah. It's the most complex I web website I've ever seen in my entire
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:35.920]   life. It is a crazy extension of I web. It's directions that Apple would not recommend.
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:40.480]   It's it's incredible. You just have to go to roughly drafted.com to see what you can do with
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:43.680]   I web because when I look at it, I'm just like, or maybe what you shouldn't do with I web.
[01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:48.720]   Yeah, but I'm looking at it. I'm just like, holy smokes. Merlin, man.
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:54.160]   40, 40 floors. 40 folders. Yep. I've been spending most of my days sitting around here.
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:58.240]   Merlin. Merlin is in the office. We let him come in. We let him come in for a couple days.
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:01.520]   And next thing you know, he's putting tape on the floor. So he's got his own little op. It's
[01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:05.680]   like less nest men's. This is all still skunk works. This is this is this is all off the record. So
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:09.360]   yeah, yeah, exactly. So if the five or six people is in this, don't tell anybody. Yeah.
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:13.920]   I was spending a lot of time here. And so that's yeah, hang out. 40 folders.com. But spending a lot
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:18.320]   of time here and with my friend Ben, now does Ben have a copy of this of this board thing that
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:22.080]   you were talking about this scope box. Scope box. Does he have that? He does. Well, I don't know if
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:25.680]   he does or not, but I can get him. You know, he just asked her. We're lighting with like Coleman
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:30.480]   lanterns right now. That's the nature of a skunk works project. We've got like my Sony camera and
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:35.600]   some Coleman lanterns. There you go. Copy a quick slower. John Foster. You want to talk to me? You
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:42.240]   have to go to twit.tv/forms pay your two bucks and then you can type questions and I'll be able to
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:49.440]   answer them for you or you can go to twit.tv/mbw soon. Soon we're going to have a new new web page.
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:53.440]   What is that? New web page Alex soon. There's nothing to go to right now, but.
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:15:00.240]   So it goes within two weeks. So it goes to 404 not found right now. I think it goes to 404 not found.
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:09.760]   But if you go to two weeks from now, if you go to pixel core.tv, you'll see some stuff. So we have
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:14.080]   a new home coming up. Yeah, we're going to move some stuff. We're going to be we've grown a little
[01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:17.680]   big for the for the house that we're in. You know, the only thing we need is a feature that keeps
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:23.040]   track of all our purposes. Someone there's someone who actually has a little behind it. He has enough
[01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:29.440]   data that since 2020. We'll have we'll get our producers on it. We'll get them a jamming away. Give
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:34.080]   them something. You're unholy ninja army of the night. All these producers like you kind of
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:40.560]   out. We're like going to be awesome. 60 producers. You know, so anyway, that's it. I'm Alex Lindsey.
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:46.960]   This mess that you've been listening to is Mac break weekly and break time is over. There you go.
[01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:49.600]   That's it. It's all we are so overtime.
[01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:56.640]   Whose fault is that? It's it's my fault. Don't use that free timer thing that shows you.
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:59.840]   No, I can see what time it is. I could see that it was that we've been talking for an hour and
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:02.240]   15 minutes. I just didn't know how to get out of it. There were things to talk about.
[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:08.080]   15 reasons to switch to a Vista. Oh, and then these are 15 reasons to switch to OS 10.
[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:12.000]   Well, there was a PC world article on 15 reasons. Right. So this was this was on Mac
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:17.840]   user. So they said it's the interface stupid. Flip over windows, flip 3d. See live thumbnails.
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:25.120]   Boost performance with ready boost. Kenchi was talking earlier about I saw I've been trying to
[01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:28.320]   ask people have you guys interacted with Vista on like a normal human computer?
[01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:32.000]   Because I'm hearing some pretty crazy stories and I don't know if these are accurate.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:37.520]   Kenchi's telling me he's seeing Vista on a pretty tricked out machine with two gigs of RAM.
[01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:43.200]   And it can flip. Nothing's happened. Oh, really? Well, no, I mean, it's it's apparently and I can
[01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:48.160]   get this is don't don't go with this anywhere. But I mean, I don't have I haven't seen this myself.
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:51.120]   What? I'm gonna put it. No, but don't go.
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:53.920]   And the man predicts it because I don't know. Really man.
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:17:00.480]   Just repeating what I've heard. But but everybody's saying like even when you got a really tricked
[01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:09.200]   out PC with a lot of RAM and an updated video and whatnot. It's sake slower. People are saying
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:16.080]   it is slower, but it's 1.0. Actually, it's 6.0 then 2 6.0. But but but that doesn't that doesn't
[01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:21.840]   it all have you? I haven't used Vista on a trick to machine. No, in the old machine,
[01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:27.600]   does it work? Okay. I had low expectations. There you go. I just think that I still think this
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:32.160]   is their last OS. They were talking about this one. We can help. They're talking about this on
[01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:37.360]   forum this morning on KQED. I was just kind of half listening. But a lot of people were calling
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:42.960]   in and they're like the persistent question seems to be why, why should I upgrade? Why or when? Yes,
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:47.840]   exactly. So it's so funny because you can call us fanboys if you want, but we're all like hell,
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:52.880]   yeah, man, run my card now. If I could have it five hours earlier, give me I want the
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:56.640]   functionality that I have seen demonstrated to me and I'm very excited to put this into use.
[01:17:56.640 --> 01:18:02.720]   And I'm seeing a lot of people from as what is what are they called from bottom feeders all the
[01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:07.280]   way up to the top of the enterprise going, you know what, we're going to hold off a couple years.
[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:10.800]   You're going to make sure all those holes are closed. And and we want to understand
[01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:15.360]   what it is we can expect to get in terms of productivity for spending this much on hardware
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:20.000]   and software it up. Well, I know that I have to look at I have to look at this upgrade for 30
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:25.120]   machines coming up in the next year. I'm like, why would you why would you want to be the beta
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:29.520]   tester for the first year? Well, the thing is the there's five things that hold me back. One of
[01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:34.480]   them is that the client has a VPN and we have to connect to that. And if their IT people say no
[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:38.640]   Vista, then it's not happening. Just in this case into something that you and I have talked
[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:42.720]   about before Merlin. I mean, you know, the there's just a very different cross section of the
[01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:47.600]   type of person that buys a Mac and the type of person that buys a PC. Historically, historically,
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:50.960]   there's been a lot of reason to choose one platform over the other. And a lot of it comes down to
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:55.200]   dough. Yeah, I mean, you have you have a business that wants to, you know, business administrators
[01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:59.920]   like it because it gives them a lot of control and it's the devil they know. It's what they know,
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:03.200]   you know, and it made them more important. I mean, this is the big thing when I was working
[01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:06.400]   when I was working at Lucasfilm, there were 200 computers, half of them were Mac, half of them
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:11.120]   are PC and there were six people administrating the PC side and one guy who spent half his day on
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:15.680]   the Mac and half his day on the PC. And the thing is that when you I used to start, I started thinking
[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:20.960]   that the reason that IT guys add PCs is so that they're more necessary, you know, because if you're
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:25.600]   as a Mac, other guys are kind of self contained, you know, and so the but the thing is is that
[01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:30.960]   so when you have business users, obviously, there are a lot of those are PC, but why would they
[01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:36.800]   upgrade? I mean, that's to move your system to Vista in the first year. Well, the training reason
[01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:41.840]   alone, I have to retrain everybody. I have to have all my apps work. I have to, you know, I lose
[01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:48.800]   probably six weeks of productivity in the switch. Thing is, is when 10.5 comes out, we lose like
[01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:53.600]   six minutes. Yeah. Yeah. And and the and the and the other. And if you're going to spend
[01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:58.880]   that dough on hardware, this is the part that kind of like I just find a little bit mind boggling.
[01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:03.280]   If you're going to spend like, if I go out and I buy a new video card or for a big machine,
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:07.360]   or I go out and whatever, if I go out and add more RAM, my expectation is that when I buy new
[01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:12.400]   hardware, all of the things being equal, I'm going to get a bump in performance, right? I mean,
[01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:16.800]   I guess maybe that's really incredibly obvious, but it just seems funny to me that like I would
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:20.880]   rather I would go take the dough and go go buy like a more tricked out machine and keep running
[01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:24.640]   XP people. I don't hear a lot of people going XP is not cutting it for me. Yeah. And if you like
[01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:28.160]   Windows, most people seem happy with XP. But I think the other issue is that a lot of people
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:32.800]   who buy PCs in the general, you know, the consumer that buys PCs is a lot of times they're making
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:36.400]   a they're making a price choice. You know, they're they're really looking at, I don't want to spend a
[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:40.880]   lot of my parents, my parents are very excited because they moved from their Windows 98 machine
[01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:46.320]   to XP with their $400 Dell and they're very, you know, my mom was like, it's just so fast, you know,
[01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:51.680]   and and and you know, and I was like, okay, you know, you know, but it works, you know, it works for them,
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:55.840]   but they're not interested in anything other than like surfing the web and printing, you know,
[01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:59.760]   you know, you know, and that's the that's the difference is that but those people aren't likely
[01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:07.120]   to upgrade my parents will upgrade to Vista sometime I'm figuring 2011 2012 is when they'll move to Vista
[01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:11.120]   and that's the issue is that it's I don't think I think that that's what's going to be interesting
[01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:16.080]   at sea as we look at market growth over the next because I think it'll actually impede purchasing
[01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:19.040]   for a little while people are not sure if they want to move all their stuff when they buy a new
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:24.160]   machine and I got to move to a foreign land. Well, here's the grand experiment. Brenda mine said
[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:31.600]   fix my PC. So Mike, okay, well, I'll fix your PC turns out there were 7,000 pieces of things running
[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:37.920]   on it viruses, Trojans, zombie, zombified, it even had had it been zombified. Yeah, and it had been
[01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:45.120]   zombified. It even had the boot blocks, not the boot blocks, the the bios had been flashed. So that
[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:50.160]   basically, if you got all this stuff off, they gave it a new brain. If you got all this stuff off
[01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:55.920]   and five minutes after you rebooted, it was zombified again. Oh my gosh. It was incredible. So what I did
[01:21:55.920 --> 01:22:00.240]   is that I just blasted it, I put a bunch of on it, I gave it back to the guy and go, here we go.
[01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:08.000]   Really? And he's like, whoa, this is really cool. And he's and so there was a bit of a learning
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:14.400]   curve. I would say that probably no more than if he would had got Vista, but he's excited now
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:18.320]   because nothing's going to own his machine ever again. Well, and that's one of the things
[01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:22.000]   that's interesting is that you look at the people who are very price conscious and you wonder why,
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:25.600]   as we start going down the path, why they don't just get Linux machines, if they really want to
[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:29.680]   get something cheap and something that's not so they get Ubuntu or something like that. And then
[01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:34.400]   if they really want the the whiz bang thing that really works, then you end up with them buying
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:39.520]   Macs and then you end up with Windows and kind of weird like buying Xbox. I mean, you know,
[01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:44.000]   and that's what I think and that's why I think that Windows that Microsoft's model is really more
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:49.920]   about the Xbox is about the the OS because I just don't think that there's a model that the Xbox
[01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:54.880]   mentality becomes really good because you have a closed closed system. And if you provide that,
[01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:58.400]   they get they're doing what happened there. They'll be successful doing what they said Apple made
[01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:02.720]   the mistake. Well, the problem with with looking at that way, I mean, that makes a lot of sense.
[01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:06.720]   If you look at where where Microsoft actually makes its money, all of its money is going from
[01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:11.760]   Windows and Office. All of its money is losing its it's losing it's making like like someone in the
[01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:17.760]   area of $10 billion from each monopoly. Everything else almost everything else is losing huge amounts
[01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:23.200]   of money. So the Xbox, all the handheld, Windows mobile, Windows, E, Windows embedded, all that
[01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:29.040]   stuff lost a billion dollars last year. That's more than Apple lost in worst time of Apple's
[01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:34.960]   experience. So I mean, the part of Microsoft that's acting like Apple is acting like Apple from 1986.
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:39.840]   Right. 1996. I think they have to. I don't think they have a choice. I think they have to go
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:43.520]   and bet on the. Oh, they're trying. Yeah. They have to go and bet on these technologies and learn
[01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:47.760]   about them because it's a it's a the freedom to do that they got $40 billion in the bank. They can
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:52.800]   they can think about it for a while and they got a burn rate for Microsoft's got a good burn rate.
[01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:55.360]   They can they can figure it out for a while. A lot of people are saying they're much more
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:59.760]   excited about the changes in Office than they are in terms of the actual VISTA stuff.
[01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:02.640]   I've not been excited about an upgrade in Office since 5.1.
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:07.120]   Well, that's the other thing. It's a pretty it's nothing that I needed past five points.
[01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:10.240]   It's pretty controversial upgrade to that, right? It's going to substantially change the way you
[01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:13.280]   use stuff like Office and Excel with the ribbons and what they'll they'll they change the whole
[01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:17.280]   menu bar. So instead of being like a conventional menu bar with the buttons that are people
[01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:22.080]   finally memorized and now I was like the start button. Basically, as a start button menu bar,
[01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:24.720]   that you have the office and it's just like, why did they do that? And it's like, no, I just
[01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:27.200]   just I don't want them to change anything. Perfect branding. You know, I have to admit,
[01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:29.760]   but this is coming from someone who generally writes everything in text edit.
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:34.160]   So I don't need anything. I just need to write my text down. I don't really need it to format.
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:37.600]   I don't need to do anything. I'm not trying to present from my from my thing. That's what
[01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:41.840]   a page layup wrote. I mean, you know, that's what when I think that's what they were saying.
[01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:45.120]   Again, this is on form this one, but they're saying that that's that's I haven't really I don't
[01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:48.880]   I don't really follow windows, but they were saying that that's the thing. This is for people
[01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:54.080]   who are really interested in like making something in Microsoft Word over which they have a lot of
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:57.360]   control over layout and things like that. This will be an interesting upgrade. Yeah,
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:25:03.840]   but I mean, gosh, for something like Excel, it's like, what does Excel not have? I saw I saw this
[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:07.680]   most scary Excel thing I'd ever seen in my life. Someone sent me an Excel where it's literally
[01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:14.160]   like a PowerPoint presentation with animations and everything. Built it in Excel. Like the guy
[01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:18.080]   knows Excel so well, he built the whole like that's what he knows how to do. So he just built it in
[01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:23.120]   that and I was like, I saw it. I kept on playing it looking at like, it's not possible. You know,
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:29.360]   like that's not yeah, you can't do that. You know, and it's what's the comment on during Fireball
[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:33.840]   that he posted about Steve Balmer. He keeps the calendar in Excel. Did you see that photo?
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:39.600]   Steve Balmer's office? Steve, I think Balmer's office is smaller than this.
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:45.840]   Wow. It's really, really small and he keeps like, like I said, he keeps he so he doesn't use
[01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:50.960]   Outlook, huh? Apparently Outlook's not very good. Really? Actually, if you ask a magic
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:58.240]   eight ball, it'll tell you Outlook. Okay, I'm gonna cut it off.
[01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:08.240]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
