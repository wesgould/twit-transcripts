[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. Renee Richie has the week off Andy and Alex are here.
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:12.080]   We've got rumors about a new Mac mini coming maybe even before WWDC and the Mac world is a
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:21.120]   GOG with news about a new Apple charger. Hard to believe. Apple says Mr. Gurman says no
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:27.360]   blood watch pressure tool for this year, maybe not even for next year and a new privacy browser
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.520]   for Mac just out. It's all coming up next and a lot more on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.840]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the latest Apple news. Renee Ritchie has the day
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.680]   off, which usually means there's new Apple news. I don't know exactly why. I think maybe he's getting
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.600]   briefed on the new Final Cut Pro. He tweeted a little bit about that. So maybe that's what's
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:19.440]   going on. But we do have our usual stalwarts here from 090.media and officehowers.global.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.920]   Mr. Alex Lindsay. Hello, Alex. Hello, hello. Very good to see you. Good to be here. Yes.
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:34.960]   And Andy Enoco, WGBH in Boston. Good to see you. Is there a other other? As always. 15 minutes ago,
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:43.520]   we got this tweet, this cryptic tweet from Renee Ritchie. Final Cut Pro 10.6.2,
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.680]   duped detector, ML background noise reduction, optimized for M-1 to Max Ultra, which kind of
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.280]   would explain the benchmarks we were talking about yesterday, from DP Review, which said,
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.520]   was it on Mac Break Weekly? No, I think it was Sunday. DP Review, which said that even in Final
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:07.360]   Cut, the Ultra wasn't much faster than the M-1 Max. All the 8K, all of it says Renee. Also
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.280]   compressor, also motion. I presume he means releases, new releases of compressor in motion.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:21.440]   Do you know anything about this, Alex? I know nothing. I know nothing. I really don't.
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:28.320]   I don't have any insight information here. I have. Yeah. I think that when I'm talking so freely on
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.880]   another show, like you, I, until I can talk about it, I don't want to know anything because I'll
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.680]   accidentally say it. I never say it in DAs. Same thing. Yeah. Because I'm afraid.
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.400]   Well, and I, we're all we're talking about is stuff like Final Cut, two hours a day, at least,
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.680]   and I can get myself into something. Yeah, it's not just here. That's right. Yeah, you got to have an
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.800]   office. Yeah. Well, one thing you can tell the world off, Apple has announced a new version of iMovie
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:04:01.040]   with some, I think significant features. That's why they call it iMovie 3.0. Storyboards and magic
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:08.720]   movie are the things they are so excited about. This is not going to excite anybody like Alex,
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.160]   because he's trained professional. Well, I mean, what I will say is that the big thing about story
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.880]   board, I haven't seen the iMovie 1. But the big thing is, is that for a lot of filmmakers,
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.360]   having something that they don't know how to use Final Cut and they don't know how to use
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:26.160]   something else and being able to just throw storyboards together is a big thing because they're trying
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.720]   to think about a scene and keeping it simple and easy to work with would be huge. And of course,
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.240]   because it's Apple, you're going to choose from 20 different storyboard types about me,
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:43.440]   celebration, cooking, day in the life DIY, gaming, makeover, how it works. That's something some of
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:50.400]   our ilk might want to do, Q&A. There's a film storyboard and this is what a storyboard looks
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:57.360]   like. You get to choose a style and then I guess I presume, let's see this animation maybe is all
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:04.080]   about storyboard. Let's do this one. Once you choose a style, then we're just watching the video on
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:10.080]   the Apple newsroom site where they publish this stuff. And I guess so really, it's a backbone for
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.760]   people who, the problem with backbones is they tend to be cookie cutter, right? So you'll know
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.000]   immediately when you see something done in iMovie. On the other hand, but that's fun for family.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Right. Well, and also for schools. I mean, like the other thing is that when you think about a lot
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.400]   of these, being able to have a teacher not have to think about how I'm going to do the design
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.520]   and the kids don't care. Like if you're doing something good, then they just want the content.
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:37.600]   Absolutely. It really does point out to how different iMovie is as far as who's going to be
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.600]   using it and what they're using it for. It's not getting templates for here is how to do a
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:47.040]   birthday party. Here's how to do a graduation celebration. It really is all about it's a
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.600]   component for the kids who are using iPads and education, who are giving their reports,
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.680]   giving their presentations in form of video. And also people who are trying to get started,
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:02.400]   they're influenced by all the videos they're watching on Twitch and on YouTube and on TikTok.
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:09.120]   And they want to start doing that themselves. So yeah, it's interesting to think that now all
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.920]   of the home videos, I'm sorry, I know I'm starting a little bit, all the home videos that we're doing
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.240]   are now basically just shot and edited directly on the phone. And iMovie has almost become an
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:23.200]   afterthought for what it was originally used for. And the other thing is we do use templates a lot,
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:29.040]   except we call them recipes. So it's not like if we had to come up with everything we were going
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.040]   to eat, it would take a long time. And that's the problem for a lot of people making media is they
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:38.240]   don't have any recipes. It's like here's some raw flour and salt and you've got to figure out
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.560]   what to do with it. It'll be interesting. Apple doesn't say whether this capability is there,
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:48.880]   but it'd be interesting if third parties could provide storyboards. There are 20 different
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.720]   new ones, as I mentioned. Each storyboard I'm reading from the press release has a shot list
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:58.640]   that organizes clips to tell a specific narrative. Each placeholder also includes an illustrative
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.600]   thumbnail along with a tip that asks a question or makes a suggestion for how to shoot that clip
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:08.560]   to make it more interesting. So it's just prompts, really. And again, it's like a recipe.
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:13.280]   This is just to add the sugar and add this and so on and so forth. You end up with a reasonably
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:20.400]   good con... Is it going to get you a job at a Michelin restaurant? No. But is it going to be a
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:25.600]   good meal that you can have every day? Yeah, absolutely. And I think that my kids just were,
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.120]   they were just in for spring break, they were down with their grandmother and what they do
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.560]   three times a week when they're there. They're just go to the Apple store and learn something and
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:37.360]   they made a trailer in the Apple store. Oh, fun. And they have a trailer template and they just
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.360]   follow the trailer template. It's really funny and it's really good. And you don't need it to be
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:46.240]   any more than that. Yeah, I mean, it's the fifth time or sixth time you've seen it, you might go,
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:53.520]   okay, but it's a start. But again, train wheels and then you learn that and then you go as soon as
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:58.960]   you feel limited, you have an iMovie, you can just go do it yourself and then all the tools are there
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.840]   for you to just keep on building, but it's great to give people. It's all about this story.
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:09.120]   We're just talking about that. There's a second feature magic movie. Apple says,
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:13.920]   "Help's create beautiful custom videos complete with titles, transitions, and music and a few
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:18.720]   taps." So what you'll do is you'll select an album or group of photos or images from your
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:24.400]   photo library. Magic movie instantly, Apple says, identifies the best parts of the footage and
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:29.440]   creates the project. So it's kind of like if photos already has that kind of memories
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:35.120]   feature sounds like kind of memories of steroids. I was amazed. I have never used the thing where
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:40.560]   basically if you scroll down every day, there's like a little, I love that you know, and I never
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:44.000]   tapped on it until yesterday and my daughter, I saw one of my daughter and said, "Hey, look,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.200]   I tapped on it." And it played like this great little movie. It found images and videos of her
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:53.760]   that I did not know were on the phone. Like I was like, it was like this random, like I was like,
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:59.360]   that is so cool and so scary all at the same time. But that's really the next big thing.
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:04.240]   One of the great advances of Google Photos and Apple Photos was we're always taking all these
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.400]   photos, photos, photos, photos, and they kind of we're backing them up diligently, but we're not
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:15.200]   doing anything with them. And so Google Photos and Apple Photos occasionally resurfaces old photos,
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:20.960]   not only just saying, "Oh, here's what you're doing five years ago today," but also here's images
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:26.800]   around the theme of your family during springtime. And you suddenly realize these things. So imagine
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.400]   when it becomes less expensive to do this kind of processing on every single video that hits the
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:37.200]   server. Imagine how cool it's going to be when all those things not only get resurfaced, but also
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:42.320]   get repackaged into an automatically edited video with a share button that's already preloaded
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:47.280]   underneath it for you. That's going to be amazing. And I can say just using the albums inside of
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:53.200]   my photos library, I have pictures of the family, tons of them that I just throw into that folder.
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.480]   And then anytime my TV goes to sleep, they're all there, my wife loved that.
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.760]   No, that's the future. And I have another one of production that I have here on one of my screen.
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:03.200]   So anytime my computer goes to sleep, I look over and there's all these memories of all the,
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.640]   you know, sometimes...
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.640]   It's gotta be careful. It's gotta be careful with that, of course.
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:12.960]   You use albums and put things in the albums that you want.
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:21.840]   Looks like you can rearrange your delete. It's very similar. It looks like to the 4U tab in iPhoto.
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:27.040]   You can styles can be added to change the look and feel of a video like storyboard,
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:33.040]   videos, magic movies can be shared from iMovie via messages, mail, and on social media.
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:38.880]   So this is one of those things, this Final Cut and iMovie, probably coincidental,
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.240]   they're both released at the same time or no. You think they're related?
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:47.680]   I doubt it's the same team.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:53.360]   Yeah. Well, they're refreshing a lot of things. They also refreshed pages
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:57.280]   I think the first pretty big change they've made on pages in the mail.
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:01.040]   Mostly adding, mostly by adding scripting, but some other things too.
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:05.680]   I mean, it's easy. I really do think that every time you see updates to apples free apps like that,
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:10.480]   it really is all about education and rather than about actual consumers.
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.400]   So I think that that really shows how serious they are still about education.
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:23.120]   Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, there's a couple of news items today on Mac Break Weekly. How exciting is that?
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:28.880]   So we'll keep an eye on, I'm sure when Renee is back, probably next week,
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:37.040]   he can tell us more about Final Cut Pro. 10.6.2. I'm guessing that's where he is right now.
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:41.920]   I'm just guessing. He's just playing with it. It could be. Yeah. Not sure.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:57.360]   There are rumors afloat, including today, something about a new Mac Mini, our favorite digger,
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:02.400]   Steve Troughton Smith tweeted today. The rumor is a little unclear as to what new
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:06.160]   Macs are imminent. For what it's worth, there is one concrete clue.
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:12.800]   The shipping studio display firmware. Holy cow. The firmware on the new studio display
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:21.040]   references an unaccounted for mystery machine. Yeah. Mac Mini 10, one.
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:28.800]   And Troughton guess is probably accurately, I would guess, an M2. There have been rumors too
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:38.400]   about an M1 Pro or even an M2 Pro. So maybe it's really good. Maybe he says,
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:45.440]   I'm going to revise the guess before it gets baked in. A Mac Mini 10, X with both M1 Pro and M1 Max.
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:50.480]   I know it's true. You know how I know it's true? I just bought a Mac Mini M1.
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:57.120]   There you go. You are the Schr- you are the Schrödinger of the Mac, of the Apple industry.
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:00.880]   I swear to God. As soon as, as soon as, as soon as Leo's
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:05.920]   MasterCard observes something that causes that all the reality is to resolve. To resolve.
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:11.600]   I did it. It's my fault. But yeah, I, I, I'm really kind of had a loss to figure out how they're
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:17.280]   going to position the Mac Mini in a world in which the Mac Studio exists. Because as, as I said at the
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:21.600]   time when the Mac Studio was first released, this is pretty much everything I want. I was looking
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:28.320]   forward to and wanting in an updated Mac Mini. Meaning I want more ports. I want more power. I
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:33.760]   want the ability to even as a bill to order to get more storage and all that other cool stuff.
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:41.200]   I'm not sure what would happen if a Mac Mini that had the, the same sort of thing about the
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:46.320]   changes they made between the MacBook Pro, the first M1. Again, the basic proof of concept all
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:52.080]   we did was put the same same, same chipset in both the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and the,
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:57.760]   in the Mac Mini the first time M1 came upon the scene. Now, now imagine the, the, the leap they
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:03.040]   made between that MacBook Pro and the current MacBook Pro, which was like into a hot, much,
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:09.120]   much higher orbit, lower orbit to higher orbit. Now, I, I would imagine that the next step up,
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:13.760]   the natural step up for the Mac Mini would be to make the same sort of transition. Meaning again,
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:19.520]   more, more, more built to order options, more connectivity, more screens, all the kind of cool
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:25.520]   stuff. But that seemed to be everything that they gave us with the Mac Studio. So I don't know,
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:30.080]   I don't know if they're going to start saying that the Mac Mini is sort of the nerdier version
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:36.560]   of a more powerful desktop Mac or if they're going to basically keep it as this is the one that you
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.600]   can absolutely afford. We're going to keep the, we're going to keep the price line really,
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:44.800]   really low. So it's a little barrier to entry. It's, it's, it is not, isn't it? Because they don't,
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:50.480]   there's not, because the mini and the studio looks so much alike, there's not that much distinction.
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:55.200]   Maybe price will be the ultimate. Well, it used so much cool. Yeah. Yeah. The cooling and,
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.920]   and I think that there's a lot of, I mean, I, I don't know if they'd put,
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:03.040]   they'd be interested to see that. I think they can't put the one, either the ultra or the max
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:07.200]   in there, maybe, maybe the, maybe the max, but not because it's already being used in the, in the,
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:12.640]   laptop. So, but the ultra probably can't go into that package. And so I think that,
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:15.760]   it's going to be really interesting. I think that, I don't think that they're going to
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:20.480]   try to hold back too much in the Mac Mini, try to differentiate products. I think they just want
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:25.280]   to put out the products there as fast as they can put out in that package, you know, in that form
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:29.840]   factor, because I think that they're in kind of a competitive area where they have a lot of advantages.
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:35.200]   And the Mac Mini still has, you know, a ton of utility. I mean, now the M1s are just amazing.
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:39.920]   And being able to rack them is, is distinct from the, from the, the studio really is something
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:44.640]   you're going to put on your desk. The Mac Mini is being able to do, put two of them into every one
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:49.600]   you that you have somewhere. I mean, we've, in the past, with even the older ones had as many as 10
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:54.720]   or 12 of them all in just racks, you know, that we could use for processing. So it's really powerful.
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:16:01.440]   I bought the Mini because I wanted to replace my 2014 iMac in my, my other studio. And
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:08.640]   I realized having already bought the Mac studio, I didn't need all that the M1 single core was the
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:17.360]   same across the board. So I didn't need to spend $3,000 on a studio or even 2,500 on a studio. So I
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:21.840]   bought a, I think I upgraded the RAM. So it ended up being 700 or 800 bucks. But I end up buying a
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:26.960]   Mac Mini and pairing it with my own monitor. And it's been great. I spent really good. The only issue
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:33.760]   I had was getting the dual display working because it has HDMI and then the trick, which everybody
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:39.200]   knows, I think, but you got to get something that'll take that Thunderbolt port to display port. And
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.640]   we were using adapters, which I think were just Thunderbolt two adapters. I don't know what was
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:49.120]   going on, but it just wouldn't work. So finally, I just went and bought a Type C Thunderbolt, I guess
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:55.760]   it's Thunderbolt three to full size display port. And that works fine. It also gives me the fresh
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:01.920]   rate that I wanted. So that's a little caveat with the new with the old M1 Mac Mini. But a very
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:10.640]   nice machine. And I, you know, using the studio at home, the M1 MacBook Pro at home, the the
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:19.360]   Pro, I guess it's M1 Pro, and the M1, nothing at work. They're all the same. I don't notice a
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:24.800]   huge difference in speed for the things that I do. So I think that's probably a good, good thing to
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:34.240]   know. M2, as Renee has told us, would probably be an A15 based processor, the same processor
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:39.680]   using the iPhone 13 these days. I'm not sure what that would get you though, in terms of speed.
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:46.960]   We have to find out. Yeah. More pro, you know, it depends on how many cores and so on, so forth
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:50.080]   that are there. I mean, that's that's going to be the big thing. They're not going to modify
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:56.960]   too much the A15. I mean, they didn't modify the 14 all that much. Yeah. Right. I mean, it's not
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:00.720]   just the process of deciding really is all the stuff that you put around you. Yeah, this is like
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:05.760]   a chip. Yeah. Right. So I mean, like the, I have to admit, I finally started doing some Apple Pro
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:11.120]   rest stuff on my studio. I got the little studio, the studio max. And it rendered the first thing so
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:16.080]   fast that I thought something was wrong with the phone. That's a nice feeling. It was like this
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:20.640]   4K render and I looked, I put it out of motion and I looked over, I looked back and I was doing
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:24.560]   something, I look back and I was like, what? And it was, and I opened the file expecting to be broken.
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:28.960]   And it was fine. And I was just like, wow. Okay. So I've stopped doing like, I was doing some
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:32.560]   production. It was nice to have some other machine doing the production while I was working on other
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:37.680]   things. And I'm like, the ultra was just like, okay, that's doing all the work. From now on, I'm not
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:41.760]   gonna hand it off to the other computers. When the A15 came out, there were a number
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:46.560]   sites that did benchmarks and stuff. And again, like these synthetic benchmarks, I really hate to
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:53.600]   use them. But there's definitely a difference. It's not so much in single core performance,
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:19:01.680]   but in GPU performance, battery life, not so much. So, you know, there are some differences,
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:06.960]   maybe not massive differences. So it may really well be the system on a chip and how that's
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:14.560]   conformed that makes the big difference between M1 and M2. We just have to wait and see.
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:19.280]   I wonder though, with all this noise and all this stuff going on, if it may not, and the fact
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:24.720]   that Renee is not here, it may not, they may not wait. You think to WWDC, they may, they may slipstream
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:29.520]   this one out, you think? They've heard about, well, they've done that in the past with, with
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:33.120]   computers. I mean, although they're getting close enough to WWDC, it kind of feels like.
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:39.040]   That's a long time. I think it would tell us what they, if they had a big announcement for WWDC,
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:44.800]   let's say that they're close enough with some kind of AR thing, they may put things out early
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:49.200]   to get them out of the way, because they just want to focus on the one. Like this is, if whenever
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:56.080]   they end up doing some kind of AR, real AR execution, I think they're going to clear the deck.
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:59.040]   Like they're not going to want to have a bunch of other things they're announcing during that,
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:01.920]   because this is going to be the biggest thing that they've done since the iPhone.
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:11.360]   Right. It's no fun being a tea leaf watcher, which is, and yet it's also no fun waiting on
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:18.720]   Tenterhooks to see. You mentioned an update for what I used to call iWork, Pages, Keynote, and Numbers.
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:29.360]   That came out a few days ago as well, version 12.0 for Numbers, copy a snapshot of table
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:35.600]   sales without font size more precise. Create formulas quickly. You can use voice over.
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:40.160]   It looks like automation was the thing that they had.
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:45.920]   Automation, Pages, improvements for publishing books with larger file sizes. You can now go up
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:52.640]   to 2 gigabytes, insert page numbers anywhere, edit font size more. It's a lot of small things,
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:21:00.560]   but you mentioned, Annie, that they're more scriptable. Yeah, now you can create documents.
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:08.640]   It works with workflows a lot better. It's nothing magical. I was reading through what it's
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:13.040]   capable of doing now that it wasn't able to do before. We're talking about some pretty basic stuff,
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:22.160]   but in terms of using Pages as a way of a classroom being able to create different versions of templates
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:26.880]   for individual students that's now very, very doable in terms of being able to collect data
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:32.080]   from other sensors from outside the Mac and basically build reports automatically that's very,
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:38.640]   very doable. Again, I'm kind of prejudiced in that if we were talking about something closer to a
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:44.480]   Microsoft Office, I would be thinking about, well, there are a lot of jobs in tail creating
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:51.360]   standardized reports from basically data that can be simply slurped in from sensors and from
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:56.000]   other servers. That's what a lot of automation is used for. Here, I keep thinking about
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:03.040]   how will this assist people in education. It seems like a simple bit of change is not revolutionary,
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:07.760]   but just the ability to do things you couldn't do before with automation is a pretty big deal.
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:12.480]   I'm surprised that this stuff wasn't in there from two years ago when they first acquired
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:19.120]   workflows. Yeah, nice. That'll be very nice. I do notice, by the way, a lot of sale prices
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:23.760]   right now in the Mac Mini. Of course, maybe that's maybe I'm noticing that because I just bought one
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:29.920]   again. Yeah. But but I do notice there are discounts up to $300 if you shop around. So maybe maybe
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:34.480]   there is maybe that is an indication that a new Mac Mini is on its way. I don't know, maybe they're
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:40.560]   clearing the decks. Yeah, it's especially notable when Apple does it because they don't. This isn't
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:45.760]   a this isn't a case where people can wind up with lots, lots more stock than they that they
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:50.960]   anticipated. This is really is like a made to order, sold to order thing. So the fact that if
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:58.800]   retailers are offering really good discounts on Apple hardware, it's because Apple has offered
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:05.280]   those retailers a huge discount on acquiring them, which means that which leads one to suspect
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:09.280]   that Apple really is trying to clear the decks or they just saw that I bought one and they want
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:16.240]   to really stick it. Trying to zip you hold up one laptop that one keynote for the rest of your
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:21.200]   life. Hounded. Hounded. This says this has more about you, Apple, and it says about Leo at this point.
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:26.480]   Incidentally, if you're having trouble updating your studio display firmware,
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:32.880]   I think I think I read the note from Renee said, I can't join the show today. I'm trying to update my
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:41.200]   iOS and my studio display. That actually was a problem, but they have fixed it, but they did not
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:47.440]   fix the camera. Don't get your hopes up, but there is an update to firmware 15.4. It's almost as if
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:55.200]   they updated iOS and they forgot that the studio is playing. They said, oh, oh, oh, here. And then a
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:24:00.480]   lot of people and I saw this all over the place said, I can't update can't be completed. There's a
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:06.240]   problem for some reason. It does now work. It does not fix the webcam. Apple says they're still
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:14.400]   working on that fix. We don't know what the new firmware does except that maybe it's just trying
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:23.040]   to keep it on the parity with everything else, I guess, right? I would say it's not coming out as
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:29.040]   smoothly as they it's a very much a version one. Like that's like with any hardware, it's really hard
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:34.480]   until people start banging on it. But I think that this is oftentimes Apple gets a little rough
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:39.680]   time with the very first versions. Kind of glad I didn't buy it, to be honest. I canceled that order.
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:45.360]   I'm kind of glad. I only this week, I start thinking that we all know that
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:53.280]   whenever Apple or any other company is preparing to ship out a product, they're always as the day
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:59.360]   in date looms. There's the list of when they find problems, some are on the deal breaker list.
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:04.080]   I mean, we absolutely cannot ship with this fault intact. And then they're the ones that are like,
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:09.680]   okay, if this is bad, but it but it doesn't turf the product, we can ship it and then apply a patch
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:15.920]   like later on and fix this little problem. Now that now that you have a monitor, a screen that
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:22.640]   runs iOS, how many basic features are being fed by iOS and now how many times are they going to
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:26.480]   be shipping a piece of hardware that says that you know what, the camera stinks, but you know what,
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:32.480]   we can fix that in a month. Let's let's mean our target ship date. I wonder if that's going to be
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:38.480]   the vector for this product moving forward. Scooter X is saying, what happened is they
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:45.200]   accidentally stopped signing 15-4 when 15-4-1 came out. That's the version on the display. So that's
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:48.880]   why they had to quickly update it. And then that's why they updated work, but it is working now.
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:53.840]   So there you go. Hoisted by your own guitar. They're also noting in the
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:58.000]   Charum, and this is really interesting. If you customize your Mac studio at this point,
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:05.680]   if you don't buy, if you do any BTO options, 10 to 12 weeks for delivery, 10 to 12 weeks,
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:09.520]   they're not even giving you a date really. Well, actually, here's a date. If I pick it up in the
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:20.400]   store, July 21st. Holy cow. I'm not sure that I have had so many friends by the same computer
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:27.520]   at the same time ever before. Maybe when the new Mac pros came out, like that weren't all messed up.
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:32.480]   I think that that might have been where a lot of us were kind of hanging on for a while and jumped
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:37.760]   over. But I think that there's a lot of pent up demand for this. And I think it's a good in between.
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:43.600]   I think that the interesting thing is it's so powerful. I think only a handful of people are
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:50.080]   really going to need the pro. If you get this. The max, I mean, the ultra. Well, what I'm saying
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:56.960]   is the pro in the fall, I think people went down the path with an ultra. I think there's going to be
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:01.440]   a little bit of a well, they'll be happy for a while. I mean, we always run out of room. We always
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:05.520]   want something faster eventually. But I think this is going to be a very serviceable computer
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:12.880]   for a very long time. It's really powerful. Yeah. Well, kind of confirming that while overall
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:22.480]   PC sales dropped in the first quarter of the year, Apple max sales grew exactly the opposite
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:28.400]   direction. And there's two different analysts reporting this on Sunday, IDC said the global PC
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:34.640]   market shrank in Q1. But Apple continued to see growth. Gartner said Apple shipped 7 million
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:40.320]   max again, always an estimate. Apple doesn't say max and Mac books in the first quarter,
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:49.200]   which is a year on year rise from 6.4 million a year ago of 8.6%. IDC said 7.2 million. That's a
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:55.920]   4.3% year on year. A cruise of their number. So Apple market share. Can I have a drumroll for
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:28:03.520]   this? We're going to look at the tote board. Apple market share is now 9%. Hey, 9% in the PC
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:08.720]   market. High single digits. Very nice. Well, I remember the day when I was 4%
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:18.320]   last year was 7.7%. So but that confirms exactly what your anecdotal report is, Alex,
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:24.960]   which is when I think people are not buying PCs, Lenovo down 12.6%, HP down 17.7%.
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:29.760]   But I'd love to see someone to heal. I'd love to see someone try. I don't know how you get
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:35.920]   this data, but I would love to see someone peel out personal purchases versus corporate purchases.
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:41.040]   Because I think that that skews everything towards the PC. The corporate is kind of leaning
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:46.640]   that direction, although in a lot of companies, when you work in some companies, all you see are
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:52.800]   max. Especially when the users get to choose. So when the employees get to choose what they're
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:56.080]   going to buy or what they're going to get from the whatever the company store,
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:59.920]   you see a lot of Macs. A lot of Mac prefers.
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:05.280]   Yeah, that's why I think it's easy to read too much into a stat like this. It is significant,
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:10.400]   but the Mac, I think the Mac market is the Mac market and the PC market is the PC market.
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:15.920]   That there are way, way more forces that apply to the purchasing decision
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:21.760]   inside the window space than it does an Apple. You Apple could release a brand new Mac that is
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:26.080]   radically different from the previous ones, and that will absolutely explode sales.
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:30.000]   It doesn't necessarily mean, but it's more interesting to look at numbers about how many
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.680]   people are, how many Windows shops are turning into Mac shops, how many Windows consumers are
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:43.360]   turning into Mac consumers. Yeah. It also, I mean, let's be fair, it shows how well Apple is marketing
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:52.320]   it and has created product people want. I think people are excited about Apple Silicon.
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:56.160]   That's for sure. I think they like the form factor, which is maybe a little surprising. Apple
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:02.880]   probably thought, let's wait and see how they like this fat boy, but the fat boy is nice.
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:07.760]   Fat boy is a good choice. Works well. I think just a lot of people like things that just work.
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:13.360]   They don't have to be, they don't have to be, they just, I know that
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:18.720]   I always get people arguing with me, but I have PCs and Macs and there's something that
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:23.200]   turns on the Mac just turns on at works and the PCs, there's literally always something with the
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:27.200]   PC. I think some of it is people not liking Windows.
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:32.480]   No, but I mean, it's like a mutation in the world. I'm going to force an art, like, how I stopped
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:36.880]   using Oculus was that, you know, I kept on getting updates from Microsoft and then it would break
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:40.960]   Oculus and then I couldn't use it and then I put it down and come back to it and I was just like,
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:44.160]   okay, enough. And I just took it apart and took it out of my office because I was like,
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:47.680]   I don't want to do this anymore. Yeah. And I waited for the quest to show up so I didn't have to have
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:53.600]   a PC. Right. So just just just to play devil's advocate, that's been true for a long, long time.
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:59.120]   And if Apple were gaining on, if Mac were gaining on Windows because the thing just works,
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:03.520]   we'd be in the 20% margin. That's true. That's a good point. Yeah.
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:06.800]   Windows just works less though than ever before. So,
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:11.520]   no, no, no, I think, but I think the thing is, is that we all kind of knew that,
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:15.040]   you know, our computers aren't as fast and they're not quite as, you know, they're not as sporty.
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:20.960]   You know, they don't do zero to 60 and 2.6 or whatever, but they're comfortable and they work
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:25.680]   and they, you want to turn the, it's always there. And so I think that one of the big changes is
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:29.680]   Apple really got the performance working. You end up with people. I don't think this is the only
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:33.280]   reason, but, you know, there was a lot of things that were kind of holding Apple back because of
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:37.840]   the performance, you know, where we would put up with it not being as fast for ease of use,
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:41.440]   but now you don't really have to do that. And I think that that is going to keep on expanding,
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:46.880]   you know, what they're, what they're using. And I think that also just continuing fragmentation
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:51.040]   of the market across Android and Windows, just makes everything hard for everybody, you know,
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:55.520]   and so that, that, that fragmented market is just a really hard thing to develop for. It's a hard
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:59.120]   thing to use. It's a hard thing to have things work. And that's something that you don't see as
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:03.360]   much on the platform and people finally just get tired of it. Reporting over from the other
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:09.600]   side, because I do it show cold windows weekly, there is a definite move of foot,
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:14.000]   Microsoft desperately trying to get some parody with Apple's continuity features,
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.760]   with they have something called your phone, which they've now renamed my phone, which
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:24.560]   make a decision. Make a decision. Whose phone is it is confusing? Whose phone is it anyway?
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:30.720]   But if Microsoft is calling your phone, my phone, aren't they saying that my phone is there?
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:37.760]   Oh, what their phone's my phone is it. So, but what it will do is show your Android phone,
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:43.360]   and it only unfortunately works well with Samsung. But anyway, I have a Samsung, so I can see it,
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:48.240]   shows your Samsung screen on the window. Notifications messages come in and has continuity style
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:53.360]   clipboard, you know, parody. You can run with this is kind of cool. You can run Android apps
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:33:00.560]   from the Samsung phone on in a VRT, in a VM, but you don't know it's a VM, but that's, I think,
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:04.720]   what is happening on your Windows machine. So you can actually get your Android apps running.
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:09.520]   Microsoft has said we're going to add the Android stores, Amazon's Android store to our place to
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:15.200]   our Microsoft store. So they definitely it's hard because they don't own Android, but they
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:19.200]   definitely want to have that kind of compatibility between phone and desktop.
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:24.080]   And the problem is that both platforms are fragmented. So right, who's using what?
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:28.480]   Right. And then the best way to use this is right. And this is where Apple is really forcing
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:32.480]   everybody to play a game that they can only like it's like, I am the only one with the bat,
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:35.360]   and I'm the only one with the glove, but let's all play together and see how this turns out.
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:38.560]   Well, they're doing it. And that's something Microsoft saying, yeah, that's something people
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:42.960]   want. And I guess we're going to try to figure out how to make it work. But since they don't make
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:48.960]   a phone, well, they kind of do. It's not as big as big a deal as that though, because if you look at
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:54.640]   the if you look at the markets, market ownership, Samsung essentially is Android. I mean, when
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:58.960]   when an Android fan talks about, Oh, but at least on Android, we have choice. Right. Yeah.
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:04.240]   But it's like, but it really is like almost every phone sold in the United States and across the
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:08.560]   world is a Samsung totally dominant. And when you get when you get down to number two, now you
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:12.480]   have Google's phone, the one that they make themselves. And then there's a big drop off for
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:17.200]   number three. Right. So if you do, if you do just target Samsung, you're certainly targeting all
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:22.320]   the phones in a business person's pocket. And so if you're talking about a company that's running
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:26.320]   enterprise apps, and you want to be able to be able to run that on the desktop as well,
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:31.120]   that will serve that that will do for Microsoft. So long as it makes their business users happy,
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:33.760]   so long as it keeps them buying Microsoft services, that's good for them.
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:38.000]   The hard part is there's just so many companies that are not creating. They're not upgrading their,
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.640]   you know, their their devices, they're not upgrading their computers. And so so you just get into this,
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:47.440]   this situation where there's a huge number of computers out there that just that won't work
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:53.680]   with and no one's doing anything about it. Let's take a little break. And when we come back,
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:35:01.200]   Apple is coming back to work. That is. But first, or else, or else, or else.
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:06.640]   It's really interesting to watch companies struggle with this. Come back, please come back,
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:13.840]   you must look at this. This is such a cute little soft rounded little box. These are my
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:22.880]   ultimate ears, my UE fits, which are my favorite new earbuds. Now, I got to tell you, I for years
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:30.080]   in television and here on the podcast have worn custom fitted in ear monitors. A lot of TV people
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:34.640]   do too. But the problem with this is expensive. You have to go to an audiologist who pours
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:41.120]   some weird silicone stuff into your ear. You have to sit there. I actually had to hold the
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:46.880]   popsicle sticks in my mouth. So I would either open or close my mouth fully,
[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:52.320]   over here, and you hit there for like three or four minutes while at Hardens. And then they have a
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:58.000]   string on it and they pull it out with the most appalling suction sound in your ear.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.720]   And all that to make a mold for any ear monitors. Wouldn't it be cool though? I mean,
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:07.120]   the nice thing about any ear monitors that are molded is they're custom. They fit your ear.
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:11.360]   They're perfect. Wouldn't it be nice if you could do the same thing without all that trouble and
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:20.160]   expense? You can. These are my new ultimate ear, UE fits, which this is show the video. This is
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:25.760]   the wildest thing. It you take them out. Now they're sealed when you get them in the box.
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:32.960]   So no light can be exposed to them. Once you open them up now, you put them in your ear.
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:40.960]   And you have to use the app to do this. You press a button. It's called Light Form Technology.
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:46.320]   They warm up a little bit. Not a lot. They don't get hot and they will mold themselves
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:52.720]   to your ear. I've never had, except for these, you know, audiologists molded earbuds. See,
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:59.520]   there it is. It's molding it to my ear and it fits perfectly. It gives you now, I'll tell you,
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:04.560]   there are a couple of reasons you want this with earbuds. The better the seal, the better the base,
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:11.040]   the better the sound. And these seal beautifully. They also seal out all the ugly noise around you.
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:18.800]   So they have, that's kind of called passive background noise, you know, reduction.
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:28.400]   Although this will also do, they have EQ presets. They have all sorts of tricks to give you very
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:37.520]   and really good sound. Of course, many, many musicians use ultimate ears with the molded earbuds.
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:42.400]   Now you can do it yourself. And what do you see the price on these? They're really quite
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:47.760]   remarkable earbuds that fit you. The second reason you want them to fit you is because no one else
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:54.560]   can steal them, which is always a good thing. And they stay put. You can shake your head like crazy.
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:59.520]   Plus, they're super comfortable. So I guess that's four reasons why you want these.
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:05.520]   Using the groundbreaking light form technology, ultimate ears fits mold to the unique, unique
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:10.800]   contours of your ears. You put them in, you connect to the app, you watch the purple LEDs form the
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:16.560]   earbuds to your unique shape. Just some other specs, eight hours of continuous playback on a
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:25.680]   charge. The charging case gives you up to 20 hours total. You've got play, pause, answer calls. Yes,
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:31.760]   it has a mic. That's that kind of tip there. It has a free app to set custom actions. You
[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:38.080]   could choose your voice assistant, your volume adjustments, and more. And they're fantastic.
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:43.120]   Now, I have to say, when you get my custom molded ears that I'm wearing right now,
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:51.440]   you cannot return them because they're your ears. With ultimate ears, they know people want. So,
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:55.360]   they got a 30 day money back guarantee, even though they have been molded to your ears,
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:39:00.800]   a 30 day money back guarantee, free shipping, free returns, and a one year warranty.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:07.840]   These work with everything you've got. They're they're the my favorite now in ear earbuds, much
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:16.640]   more comfortable than the other guys. And actually, they cost less. Ue.com/fits to find out more.
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:23.200]   These are my new favorite earbuds. I think this is brilliant. What amazing innovation.
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:28.400]   And I'll tell you what, I'm wearing in money or the ultimate ears that were custom molded in my
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:32.880]   right ear and the left ear. I'm wearing my Ue fits. These are more comfortable. I actually prefer
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:36.480]   these. If I could figure out a way to work, get these to work with a studio. I'd probably be wearing
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:48.600]   these. Ue. Ultimate ears fits. Get them at ue.com/fits. Highly recommended. Use the promo code Mac

[00:39:54.880 --> 00:40:03.920]   Ue.com/fits. You got I'm telling you, you're going to love these. Everybody I know who has them now,
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:12.560]   loves them. Uh, Apple's coming back to work today's the day. Whoo hoo. In-person work began actually
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:21.040]   Monday. Uh, Apple, uh, set the date, changed the date, set the date, changed the date, but officially
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:28.560]   April 11th was set last month for return in person. Corporate employees are now required to work at
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:37.200]   least in person one day a week. May 2nd, they'll have to go two days a week. They're gradually easing
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:44.320]   you in May 23, three days a week. However, I'm not sure if they're ever going to get to four and five
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:51.840]   days a week. This is their new hybrid work plan. Uh, Tim Cook says it's a pilot. So they may change
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:57.200]   it. We don't know. So everyone will be there from Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. Yeah, you want to
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:02.640]   have long weekends, right? Um, we do, we do a, we changed to a four day work week, but we're still
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:08.400]   hybrid. People can, if they feel uncomfortable coming in, can stay home. So it's, but it's nice
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:14.320]   when everybody, I have to say it's nice when everybody is in the studio together. I like that.
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:20.000]   Yeah. That this, it's got to be tough. Uh, also because you're one of the problems of getting,
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.760]   uh, getting employees back in is that do they now have, do they have their health, do they have
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:28.640]   their childcare lined up again after two years of, uh, right of basically having to kids at home?
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:32.160]   And there are people who once, gosh, how are you going to, how are you going to keep them down in
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:37.440]   the office after they've tasted the joys of, you know what? I'm getting so much more done and I'm
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:43.280]   no longer stressing out. And I mean, the ability to that, like having to have a dental appointment,
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:49.760]   not screwing up my entire week is such a boon, et cetera, et cetera. So it's, it's, it's, it's
[00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:54.560]   amazing how every single company's facing this kind of pushback and they're basically having to
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:59.040]   threaten and, and, and treat their employees to come back to the actual office.
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:03.680]   And the hard part is a lot of employees are just, they're prepping to leave if they're getting
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:06.560]   forced to come back, you know, like they're just, you know, they're looking for the right
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:10.400]   opportunity at that point. And, you know, and I think that that's the hard part of forcing them
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:15.120]   to come back is going to be, you know, probably it's just going to be more expensive to hold on
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:19.120]   to the talent. So you can see them throwing, you know, you'll be throwing more stock at people,
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:22.400]   they'll be throwing higher salaries at people they're going to have to because people,
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:27.120]   there's a lot of people that don't want to, um, to be there, you know, and they, and then there's
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:31.920]   tons that will want to come in. They don't have the other side of this is that in Silicon Valley,
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:38.080]   a lot of people bought apartments or not bought, but lease departments, least houses that were
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:41.760]   designed around the idea that they're going to be at the office all the time. They're going to be
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:45.760]   workaholics. And so for them, they're, they're ready to come back because at home, they're really
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:49.200]   stuck in a small little box. You know, and so I think that that's, that there are people that
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:53.360]   want to come back. It's not that nobody wants to come back, but there's a solid probably 20 or 30
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:59.200]   percent that don't. Yeah, that conversion fan isn't quite so, isn't quite so enticing when you
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:03.680]   actually have to spend 18 hours a day and like get all your work done in that same place with your
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:09.840]   spouse. I had a friend that, you know, halfway through COVID, just moved back to, move back to
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:13.280]   where they had a house because they, because it was just like they were in this little box because
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:17.120]   they were always working or always traveling and suddenly that wasn't the case and it was no longer
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:25.280]   sufficient. Well, you're, you're never going ever going back into an office, right?
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:30.320]   Probably not. No. I can see myself going to an office, you know, if I was doing the right thing,
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:33.920]   I, you know, I might go with the office for a couple days a week or something like that or,
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:37.200]   you know, if, if it needed to be, you know, there are things that you need to do in an office.
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:40.880]   Yeah. You know, there's, there's things that I work on that you need to see it,
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:44.880]   with what you're working on. You need to look at what's actually happening on, on, on,
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:48.960]   use hardware that I don't have at the house or at, at our studio. But I go, and I go into our studio
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:54.160]   now. We're doing a lot of work there right now. And so I'm, I'm there three or four days a week. So I,
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:58.000]   when I say that, but I'm not there the whole day, I come in, in the afternoon and kind of work with
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.280]   everybody on what we're doing. And then there's just some days that I'm near the whole time. Yeah.
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:10.800]   I, I, here's from Bloomberg. A week before it's tribute to remote work, Apple gave its own
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:16.400]   workers a timeline by which they'd have to return to the offices, to some, including the 7500 of
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:22.800]   Apple's 165,000 employees who belong to a slackroom dedicated to advocating for remote work. It was
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:29.840]   bruising. They are trolling us. Right? One wrote others call the ad distasteful and insulting.
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:34.800]   The underlying message Apple knows corporate employees using its product as tools can
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:42.640]   capably work from home. So why can't its own staff? People, some people, some people will not
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:47.200]   come in. I really think that that's, well, I don't know. Again, what I've heard mostly is,
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:51.680]   is not just not an Apple, but, but at other companies is that they're, they're not saying
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:55.360]   I'm not going to come in. What they're looking for is an opportunity place to go. You know, and so,
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:59.520]   and again, they're not quitting or, or holding, you know, a lot of them are, they're just looking
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:03.600]   for somewhere to go next, you know, and they're kind of much more open. And it's just a, it's a
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:07.680]   really hard, that's almost worse in some ways because, you know, having employees that are
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:12.720]   one foot in, one foot out is, you know, it's not, it's not as very productive,
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:17.280]   because, you know, and they're constantly looking at every person they meet, they're looking at,
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:20.880]   well, maybe that would go with Trump at that company and maybe I jump over to the problem.
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:26.720]   Of course, though, is some employees who are productivity focused, hate all the meetings,
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:32.320]   and then the nut jobs who come over and bother you, you're cubicle and suck you, suck all your attention
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:36.880]   away. And there's things about off, and there are there plenty of people who say, oh, I,
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:41.280]   I miss that, I love that. But there is some percentage, and I don't know what it is with people
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:46.400]   who say, I am much more productive at home. And then to add on top of this, the cost of gas these
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:50.240]   days, the commute is getting to be something nobody wants to do. So,
[00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:55.440]   one, and the thing is, is that, is that I think 90% of the managers love to be able to yell over
[00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:58.880]   and ask questions to the engineers and 90% of the engineers would like to lift one.
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:02.640]   You know, like, there's water, right? Yeah, exactly. There's also this issue.
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:07.280]   We built this giant donut. We kind of have some people in it. I think that though,
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:12.240]   the big thing with the donut is, is that there's all that open, a big reason, I think that employees
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:16.160]   don't want to go back is the open office, the open office concept was, oh, yeah, I agree.
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:21.360]   It was just the dumbest. It was, it was done to save money, and it was done, it was justified by
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:24.880]   saying everyone's going to collaborate more, but what it was done to save, pack more people into
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:32.960]   a smaller space. And the thing is, is that it is, it people just hate it. Like they hate it, you know,
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:36.800]   and they hate and, you know, just ever always feeling like there's someone right over your shoulder
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:40.720]   and always feeling like, you know, it's just, it's not something that they enjoy. You constantly
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:44.080]   will get out, they pick up the phone and they go walk somewhere else and they go talk because
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:47.360]   it might be security, it might be personal, it might be whatever, but they're constantly walking
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:51.760]   away from their desk because they just don't want to, you know, deal with that. And so it's just not a,
[00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:56.400]   it was never very great and good. And I think that you could take a lot of these buildings that,
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:47:02.320]   that no less people want to come back to and make them into either cubicles or offices,
[00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:05.680]   that, you know, all the altogether, and more people would want to come back if they had their
[00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:09.760]   own office and they had, you know, they, that's a, that's a compelling thing to do because now it's
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:16.320]   a quiet time instead of being at home with the kids. I, and I will say, I'm saying that for a
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:20.960]   lot of people, I actually, I mean, during COVID, I was, I was in my happy space. My wife was working
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:24.560]   at home. I guess most of the people. Yeah, I'm having lunch with everybody.
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:29.840]   Everybody who works on Twitch, I mean, all the broadcast ones, we're all working.
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:35.760]   I'm the only one who comes in to the studio because I like, I guess I'm, I'm that weirdo,
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:39.760]   of course, I only like it because there was no one here. So in a way, this was my home. It just had
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:47.680]   better equipment. But, but every, all of our you and Andy and Paul and Mary Jo and, I mean, all of
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:52.560]   our hosts or work from home have been for years. So this was just business as usual.
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:57.600]   And I think that, well, the problem that I have now is that I've scheduled my life so tightly that,
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:02.240]   you know, driving somewhere is a thing. Like it's like, suddenly it's just like, Oh my gosh, I,
[00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:07.040]   I don't know what, like, how am I going to deal with all this time that I'm losing by being in a car,
[00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:14.000]   you know? Well, yeah, not to mention, like $6 a gallon or something.
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:20.720]   And I mean, I do, I do lose all of the practice time of singing to some temple pilots.
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:24.000]   But yeah, but I know that's a good point. Yeah. I get it down.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:29.680]   My development of interstate love song now is, is, is installed. It was stalled.
[00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:32.800]   You're getting so good to it. I know exactly.
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:45.920]   Apple is, according to Mark Gurman gonna bail on blood pressure for the Apple Watch this year.
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:53.920]   Next year, maybe, or even maybe 2025, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:59.920]   This is what Gurman writes a company has been, has teams working on an updated sensor and
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:04.160]   software for the Apple Watch that would determine if a user has high blood pressure,
[00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:09.360]   but accuracy has been a challenge during testing. I think they probably watch the dropout and
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:12.880]   they realize that there's some risk in telling people they have high blood pressure. If they don't,
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:19.040]   I don't know. Well, anytime you see Apple having trouble, you realize this is a hard problem.
[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:20.240]   Yeah, this is not this.
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:26.160]   Now blood pressure and blood sugar are the two are two of the police rises and wearable, right?
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:31.920]   And there's, in terms of blood pressure, as far as the technologies that the last time I was
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:37.600]   taking a look at this a couple months ago, the only one that has a lot of research behind it,
[00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:43.840]   a lot of faith behind it, is this idea of your imaging pulse, your imaging, not pulse, but
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:50.000]   wavelets inside the bloodstream and look at the period, at this periodic nature of it.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:56.400]   And that can give you a very, very good sense of changes in blood pressure. But even that sensor,
[00:49:56.400 --> 00:50:02.080]   right now there's more faith in not being able to give an accurate reading, but to simply have
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:07.360]   a dashboard light that says, "Hey, your blood pressure has changed quite dramatically during
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:11.520]   this time period." And even in the discussion in papers that I've been reading about this,
[00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:15.520]   even that would be very, very useful to not just not simply say, "Hey, warning, your blood
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:20.320]   pressure is way, way high." But simply while you sleep during the day, over the course of weeks
[00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:24.400]   and weeks and weeks saying, "Here is our period, your blood pressure appears to be inconsistent."
[00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:29.440]   We noted eight different events in which your blood pressure dropped way, way lower, went way, way
[00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:36.640]   high. But its certification and reliability is really, really the big deal. Fitbit only recently
[00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:44.560]   got certification for ECG, for arrhythmia detection on their own devices, even though they've had
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:47.680]   sensors that are pretty much capable of it for the past few years now.
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:55.040]   Yeah, the way the Apple Watch and all these devices measures, they kind of shine a light into your
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:51:01.520]   blood vessels, right? That's what that green light is. I'm guessing more and more as we do these
[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:07.760]   quantified self-measurements, they're going to rely on machine learning. They're going to say,
[00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:15.920]   "Okay, here's all the readings we got from these 5,000 people. Here's their actual blood pressure
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:23.440]   cuff measurements using a Sviggmo-Molometer doing it right. See if you can correlate. If you can't,
[00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:28.240]   then you're screwed because they're not measuring real blood pressure. They're trying to correlate
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:32.720]   these wavelets with actual blood pressure. If there isn't a correlation, if machine learning
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:38.240]   can't do it, you're exactly right. For instance, heart rate variability is easy because they can
[00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:43.440]   measure the pulse. They see the pulse. They know the pulse is working. So a lot of things are,
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:48.880]   I just got to alert them, my heart rate variability has gone way down over the last eight days.
[00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:53.200]   Whether that means anything, I don't know. ECG, I guess, again, you're measuring
[00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:58.000]   the various electrical signals from the heart that they can measure, right?
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:02.880]   So I think some things are hard. And blood sugar, of course, hardest of all,
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:09.440]   without actually dipping into the blood and getting some. Yeah, that's why if you have diabetes,
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:13.440]   there are wonderful sensors, but they involve like once a month, like sort of shooting this
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:18.800]   filament into your arm that makes the that makes the radio connection. Does the actual blood blood
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:26.400]   sensor blood reading and actually sends it to the device? I don't. The last time I did a really
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:31.520]   in-depth look into seeing whether or not this was actually feasible was last year. And this is
[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:36.960]   still kind of a moonshot sort of thing. There are some studies that say that, hey, there seems to
[00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:43.760]   be something in there in terms of being able to photo image a blood vessel and get some idea of
[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:50.160]   blood sugar from that. But it's basically a roadmap towards research as opposed to a roadmap
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:55.280]   towards a working sensor. According to German, the feature has been planned for at least four years,
[00:52:55.280 --> 00:53:00.320]   but it's probably two years away from hitting the market. It may even slip until 2025,
[00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:07.600]   which means they don't know. I mean, I watched the Theranos show. I know they don't know.
[00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:13.600]   You know, she's saying Walgreens December. Can we do a December? I don't know.
[00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:17.440]   It's complicated when you have something that could kill someone or have them make a
[00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:22.400]   about. You don't want to make a mistake, exactly. I mean, even now, even now, I'll be watching the,
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:25.200]   I get these warnings from my watch. I'll be watching a stealer game and I'll say,
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:27.280]   your heart rate's really high, but you're seated. Are you okay?
[00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:34.240]   So it's like, I'm fine. That's a useful one. Just I'm just a little excited. Sorry.
[00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:36.960]   Yeah, exactly. I just wish the defense. I wish they could stay safe.
[00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:46.000]   Did you watch anybody watch Apple's first Friday night baseball last Friday?
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.680]   Did we know? Yeah, we did. What'd you think?
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:55.520]   The announcing was really bad. Awful. You know, it was just awful. And I thought we talked about
[00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:59.440]   this. Was that two weeks ago? Or was it we talked about? No, it was last. It was late. It was the first
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:04.240]   one on our show. Maybe. Yeah. So, yeah. So the thing I think that the announcing was, it was just
[00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:07.200]   like people weren't, it was like talk, listening to someone who didn't really care about the game.
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:10.800]   I think that was the issue. There was just lots of chatter. It was like going with your friends
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:14.480]   that aren't really into the game and having them talk amongst themselves and sometimes interact
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:18.640]   with the game and sometimes not. And so I think that I only watched about 20 minutes of it.
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:23.360]   That's about all I could take. And so I think that it was, I mean, you know, you get started and
[00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:27.600]   you're experimenting. And, you know, I think that they're trying to match certain targets and so
[00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:31.120]   on and so forth. And so they're trying to figure that out. But it was not a good thing. And I did
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:34.240]   like that. I thought there's a lot of complaints about the graphics. I thought the graphics were.
[00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:38.480]   I like it. So they're doing a very simple. And by the way, if you have Apple TV+,
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:43.200]   you can watch, you can still watch the games. And they also have a lot of extra highlights and
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:47.520]   features during the week. But you could still watch, at least when I, because I missed the game live,
[00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:54.240]   but I watched it later, Apple's very much changing the style of presentation. They've got, I think,
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:55:01.120]   very simple, clean graphics. What I didn't like, Alex, was they kept playing cheesy stock
[00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:06.640]   background music every time they pulled a graphic up. Like, you know, that's not me. That what the
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:14.240]   hell is that all about? I see that a lot with millennials and younger where I maybe we used to
[00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:19.440]   call the MTV generation. Obviously it's not that anymore. But it's like, we don't trust your attention
[00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:24.640]   span. So if we're if we're showing a graphic, we're just going to play some music so you feel good,
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:28.000]   because we just don't trust that you're going to be, you know, you're going to change the
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:32.560]   channelers. I don't understand it. And everything it's YouTube, maybe it's a YouTube generation.
[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:37.200]   Everything does it now. There's lots of background music behind stuff. And I'm not a big fan of that.
[00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:43.040]   And really the baseball, the background music is the roar of the crowd, the guy saying, be here.
[00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:47.760]   You know, the crack of the bat, the smell of the pine tar, that's what.
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:53.200]   And I think that there's I think there's such an opportunity for multiple streams of audio.
[00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:56.960]   We were talking about this on office hours. We did talk about that. We were talking last
[00:55:56.960 --> 00:56:00.000]   week about what they're talking about. The possibility. Yeah. So I'd love to see them, but
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:03.920]   the I'd love to see them get aggressive about making it customizable, at least through the audio.
[00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:10.480]   You know, and I will tell you, I've gotten I've had the opportunity to watch some games where I'm
[00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:16.400]   listening to the comms and watching the multi view of the, you know, that the trucks using.
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:20.800]   And I could watch that all like it's entirely different. Yeah, really.
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:25.440]   Really. I pay money for that because you just listen to it. You just listen to them talk.
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:30.480]   Apple's idea of a big experiment was having a woman do the play by play, which to my knowledge
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:36.240]   is not yet been done in Major League Baseball. It's definitely a, you know, sexist man's
[00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:42.560]   sport. So they had a color was done by a former player who was, it wasn't really not nobody was
[00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:46.640]   very confident. Yeah. And that's okay. You kind of expect that. Although you also expect them to do
[00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:52.960]   a lot of rehearsals. They should have been doing all summer doing play by play. I mean, when a pro
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:58.640]   goes for most like major networks, my understanding is when a pro goes from being a football player
[00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:04.720]   to being an announcer, there's six to 18 months of them getting trained. Right. It's, it's, it's a hard,
[00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:08.800]   it's not like they just come out of it and start talking about it. And it's even harder for the
[00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:14.240]   play by play folk. I'm going to say folk, even though they're guys. I know, you know, I have good
[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:17.440]   friends who do play by play and I have good friends who are coming up and play by play.
[00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:23.520]   Most of them end up going to Syracuse because they have a very good school where you can learn
[00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:29.120]   play by play. And then you do the same thing the ball players do. You go to single a ball,
[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:34.240]   you go to double a ball. My friend who's the son of Hank Greenwall. Hank Greenwall was the
[00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:39.680]   Giants announcer for decades. His son wanted to get into this, went to Syracuse just like Hank did
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:44.560]   and has been working his way up. And the same time he's doing play by play in the single a ball.
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:51.040]   He's selling the ads. He's sweeping out the, I mean, it is a grueling years process. And he
[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:54.880]   still hasn't made it to the majors. It's been more than 10 years. So it takes time.
[00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:58.560]   We see this all the time when we're doing live streams with corporations and they want their,
[00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:03.600]   their seat level people to do the show or a marketing person to the show. And I'm like,
[00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:07.760]   why don't we get an announcer? I think that we can, let's call Solidado Brian.
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:13.440]   Let's call legal. Let's call somebody that we can have that has done a thousand of these because
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:17.520]   it takes a thousand of these to get good at it. And it's just a, because you have to move
[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:22.720]   the understanding of what you're doing from your frontal lobe to your lower brain. And that
[00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:25.760]   just takes time so that your things are just coming out of your mouth while you're watching.
[00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:30.560]   And just is the proper thing. And it's really hard. You know, I think they underestimated it.
[00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:35.600]   I think the big disappointment here is that why, gosh, if you're doing this through an app where
[00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:40.800]   you can do anything you want as a, as a content creator, why are you just simply trying to replicate
[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:45.600]   the TV experience? Are you saying that the way that sports is being broadcast on television is
[00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:50.320]   the opinion it can possibly be improved upon? And I think we talked about this before a couple
[00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:54.080]   weeks ago where I would love it if they simply said, we're going to get four, we're going to have
[00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:58.640]   four different commentary tracks depending on what you want. If you will, we will, we will get
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:05.200]   the a long time, whoever has the right, whoever has the radio has radio experience
[00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:09.440]   in that local market will get the home team, whoever has radio experience in the opposing
[00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:15.440]   team's market will get another feed. We will have, we will, we will have a minimal talk
[00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:19.440]   sort of thing where someone just says, and that's two balls, two two balls, two strikes.
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:25.760]   And, and I was Ferguson coming in to replace the, place the left hander because it's, it's like
[00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:33.200]   the, the number of times where I have, I'm watching a lot of women's college softball on YouTube
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:38.000]   because I came, you know, give the algorithm recommended like a random, like a broadcast.
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:42.160]   And I just love it. Not only because the level of athleticism and the level of play is so high,
[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:46.480]   but also because it's not these, they're not trying to razzle dazzle. This is like a college,
[00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:52.480]   like a TV station. And they just like give you the information you need. They give it to you
[00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:56.880]   in a way that's pleasant, but it's not like there's, there's no like, and now let's have some,
[00:59:56.880 --> 01:00:02.960]   some wanging guitars wanging, it has a picture change. It's like, no, we can, you can hear
[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:06.640]   people shouting the background. That's fine. Give me silence. Let me have my experience.
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:12.480]   We did a test with golf where it was, it was for VR and you could just watch the clean aperture,
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:17.280]   you know, nothing on the screen. And you could turn the announcer on and off where you just listen
[01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:20.880]   to the crowd and everything else. And then it put the scoreboard on the other side. So you
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:24.400]   just look over and see the scoreboard, you know, see what the leaderboard looked like.
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:28.640]   That's apparently what they did at the Masters. It wasn't so great. In our chat room,
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:34.160]   user 8827 said the Masters live stream was great this year. You could turn off the commentary.
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:38.640]   It was just the sounds of the golf course, the birds, the winds, the crowds, and the sound of the
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:43.680]   swing. They, their app was actually pretty interesting. So the Masters had an app out that was running
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:49.680]   during it, during it yesterday, two days ago. And they let you look at groups of holes as well.
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:53.520]   So you didn't, you could just go, I just want to watch where this is. Now I didn't see any place
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:01:00.400]   where you know, you could also go back and look at the last time a Tiger Woods or whatever was
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:04.640]   swinging. You could just follow along and look at all of their, all of their hits. So it was
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:08.320]   really interesting, you know, to put that together. They had a little bit of a, you know, they were
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:12.880]   playing it safe. So they, they did this thing where they had 10 second segments, which means
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:18.400]   there's some big delay every time you change feeds. But, but outside of that, it was a pretty
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:23.840]   interesting approach to, to a sport. And I think golf in general has been doing, because it's so,
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:29.200]   there's so much time to do other things. It is, I think it's, it's innovated a lot, RNA that does
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:35.680]   the open and in the UK has been doing like live streams to everyone at the location for over a
[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:42.640]   decade. Now I will say the video is great to watch it in 4K. And I mean, that was
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:48.080]   really nice. So maybe the, you know, the announcers are new. I don't know where they came from.
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:54.160]   Just maybe it's going to just take a little time for them to settle in. I also have to say I'm
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:02:00.320]   often just very dissatisfied with play by play announcers in, in major league baseball and NFL.
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:05.040]   Some of these people are terrible. It's there. I guess it's like getting a good quarterback or a
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:09.440]   great pitcher. There are few and four between. And when you're the VIN scholars of the word
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:13.920]   world does don't come along all the time. Yeah. I mean, I think that you really have silence.
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:17.600]   Yes. There's a rhythm to pay play by play.
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:22.880]   Well, I think that, I think that there's a lot of, I mean, I, I know that for me,
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:26.800]   when I watch a football game, I, there are certain people that I'll watch just because they're
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:30.960]   calling the show. Like I, I watch a stealer game, obviously, and I'll put up with whatever,
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:35.360]   you know, shows up as an announcer. But if I see, I just, on a Sunday, if I feel like watching a
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:39.760]   game, I just look where Tony Ramos, Ramos, great. Or Chris Collins, ladies,
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:44.640]   look, I'm not a fan of Collins. Where's, oh, I like him. It took me a while. Yeah, I didn't like
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:50.080]   him at first. No, Michael's. It's a problem is that they're these greats. And maybe we're just
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:53.840]   used to them, you know, so maybe that's all it is is what we're going to get to his role. I think
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:56.880]   there's a two different roles because now Michael is really calling it play by Chris Collins worth
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:02.080]   his, his color. So he's, so he, you know, it's a different, different approach to it. But I love,
[01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:06.800]   I love the Tony Romo gets so excited. And he's, and then, he knows what he's talking about too,
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:11.200]   which he does helps. Yeah, you're fresh out of the, out of the system. And that's what John Madden,
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:17.840]   kind of, that's right. Pioneer. It was, he was great too. Although, I know people, my wife,
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:23.760]   who hated him. So again, it's a very personal, very personal thing. The reaction as one would
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:31.040]   expect from fans and from sports talk was pretty negative. But that, you know, some of it's because
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:34.240]   one of the games had a female play by play announcer and that's very uncommon.
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:40.800]   You know, I think that I think I was watching, I don't know if you've seen the new Adam McKay
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:46.640]   showing HBO winning time about the LA Lakers of the, of the 80s, but Chick Hearns in there. Of course,
[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:53.840]   the great LA Laker play by play guy. And he's kind of a jerk. And when,
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:04:01.200]   you know, he gets a partner who went, who's going to, well, I won't, it's no spoilers. I want to
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:06.160]   tell you what happens to the partner eventually. But he says, okay, see this hand? When it's a fist,
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:12.000]   you stop talking partners during the color. You stop talking and he goes all the time right in
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:17.920]   the middle of you stop talking. But Chick Hearn was a legend. There's a legend, but he doesn't
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:23.760]   come off very well on that show. I think I liked Madden a lot. I really liked Madden a lot.
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:28.080]   Anyway, Apple, you know, I don't know where they would go to get somebody better. I mean,
[01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:32.640]   all the everybody, you know, is taken. I don't know if there aren't any free agents.
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:36.720]   Again, I think that they just have to work out, you know, and look at what their value proposition
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:41.040]   is. We did, we did some parallel streams. We've done like second year experiences where we bring
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:44.960]   people in. It's just different format. Like we don't even try to call the show. We just let you,
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:48.480]   it's like sitting around with a bunch of pros that are people who used to play the game,
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:52.320]   all sitting around talking to each other about the game is really fun. And that's just one of the
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:56.880]   audio tracks, you know, it can just be like you could literally take the two, the two teams and
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:02.080]   just put the players on both sides sitting in there just talking about the game. And there's a lot
[01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:07.600]   of people I would listen to that because these are people who actually were on the ground at that
[01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:12.320]   level talking about like what they're noticing or that guy was always this way or look at what
[01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:15.840]   he's doing with his leg. You know, I would never do that. You know, he can't pick up your leg
[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:18.880]   when you're swinging, you know, like, you know, and there, and they're just, you know, going back
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:23.520]   and forth and you get true, like real, no, I don't know true, but you get the feeling of inside baseball.
[01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:30.320]   Yeah, I'm going to really, yeah. Yeah. It's a hard thing to do. I'm not, you know, I would never
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:35.680]   attempt it. Yeah. I was just gonna say just the commentators who know the relationship between
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:43.360]   the catcher and the umpire who says, who know what the catcher is doing to that specific umpire
[01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:47.360]   to make the strike zone a little bit bigger. That's the sort of stuff that gets, makes you
[01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:50.800]   to a huge fan of a commentator as opposed to just the game. Yeah.
[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:56.960]   I felt like these guys were reading you always one of the things, you know, I've watched, I've
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:01.200]   spent a lot of time and play by play booths. You have statisticians, you have helpers,
[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:05.920]   especially in broadcast television, you have lots of people who are giving you cards and
[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:10.560]   with stats on them. And you could tell the announcers that was they were just getting fed the lines.
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:15.600]   They were just reading the lines the whole time. That's fine. But yeah, I think again,
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:20.560]   this is the first time they're going to do it every week for a while. I'll judge the more,
[01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:24.720]   like I might come back in 12 weeks and see like, okay, now where are they? They do anything. Yeah.
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:29.040]   And even the first season may be hard. I mean, the whole first season, it's really hard to change
[01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:32.320]   gears in the middle. So it may be one of those things like they're going to learn a lot.
[01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:34.080]   And then next year, it will look a lot different. Yeah.
[01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:42.880]   And is it 4K? I think it is. It sure looks like I think that it's actually sourced in 1080 and
[01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:48.960]   it's getting scaled up. I don't think that it's actual 4K. I would be excited if it was.
[01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:55.680]   And I think that that's where Apple, what this provides is a weekly platform for Apple to go to
[01:06:55.680 --> 01:07:01.840]   4K, for Apple to go to high frame rate, for Apple to go to 8K high frame rate. So you could,
[01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:08.320]   Apple can play with all these things because all the TVs are all 120, right? And so it's just a
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:12.640]   matter of releasing a new Apple TV that can do it. And then Apple could put out so that we may be
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:15.680]   seeing them just experiment. And then, oh, by the way, here's a because that would be
[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:23.120]   really hard for. I mean, I've seen a lot of sports at 8K 120 and I've seen baseball at 8K 120.
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:28.720]   And I can tell you that once you see it, it's really hard to go back. Because it just looks like a
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:36.400]   window, right in front of you. And it's amazing. And so I'm not proposing that films should be
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:43.120]   20. They should be to stay at 24. But live live events at 8K 120s. And now they have a platform
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:47.440]   to do it with. And all they got to do is put the cameras out there. Yeah, it did crash too, by the
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:53.040]   way. I didn't see that. I didn't see it either. I didn't see it either. Yeah. Because I was
[01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:57.840]   watching the replay where it did not crash. So maybe a lot of people were watching. I jumped on it live.
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:01.920]   And I as a person who does live, anytime someone does something for the first time,
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:06.160]   I kind of expected to crash. I expected like a long way. And so when it popped right up and it was
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:09.280]   playing well, I was like, yeah, pretty good job. Those guys must know what they're doing.
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:18.320]   Yeah, what a surprise. I think on balance, you're exactly right. This is a great opportunity for
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:24.240]   Apple and to do something interesting. So it's worth it. And I'll be watching it again every
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:28.240]   week. Because I think the picture quality, the graphics do make it fun. And you can always turn
[01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:34.160]   this out if you want or pull up the radio. If you want the play-by-play from the homers.
[01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:39.360]   Promise, I think that with streaming, you put so much buffer into it, you would be hearing what
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:44.080]   happened like 30 seconds before. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. In fact, I had that question on the radio show,
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:49.840]   how do I synchronize? And what I would used to do is I would pause my T-vote on the back crack
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:53.360]   and then wait until tune in caught up and then press play.
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:59.120]   You got them all. Because tune in was really delayed as well. So it was actually,
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:03.920]   audio was actually behind the video and tune in. That probably would, I don't know, I'll have to
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:13.120]   try it. Oh, I'll let you know. Funny. I'll let you know. Let's see, what else is going on?
[01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:21.840]   Zero-day exploits, which were found and fixed in Monterey,
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:27.120]   were have still yet to be fixed. We reported this last week and then it's still the case,
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:35.760]   yet to be fixed in Big Sur and Catalina. I wonder if we're going to see updates for those two or
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:40.320]   if Apple's just going to really say you need to be using the latest version. And if you can't,
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:46.000]   as I couldn't on my 2014 iMacs, guess what? We've got these fine Mac minis and Mac studios.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:53.200]   I think you're going to love them. You're going to love them. A $679 security update.
[01:09:55.680 --> 01:10:00.480]   It is the case that because Apple hasn't announced new hardware in God weeks,
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:08.560]   that the Apple press is going crazy over these leaked images of a 35 watt dual USB-C power
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:18.000]   adapter. Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. Okay. Wow. Again, allow me to give you a couple of
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:24.880]   Amazon links to several chargers of that capacity with that. But these are from Apple.
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:33.440]   There's from Apple. Unlike Apple's current 20 watt charger, foldable prongs, it's just amazing.
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:40.960]   This is to me a testimony of how much Apple has captured people's attention.
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:45.520]   They just is a possibility they're going to release a new charger.
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:50.560]   Well, I think the issue is crazy. A lot of us try to buy other things.
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:54.800]   And I have third party stuff, but a lot of us buy third party accessories and they're all
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:58.560]   well, I mean, almost a little wonky. So what these are probably is using this.
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:04.880]   They're using the gallium nitride technology that anger and others are using, which means you can get
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:13.440]   PD high wattage power delivery on USB-C in a small, small package. And that to me looks like
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:18.080]   kind of what this might be. Yeah. But I think people get excited though, because it's kind of
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:22.400]   like there's lots of iPhone adapters that do HDMI and power and everything else. But we've all
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:25.280]   decided just to use the Apple ones because the other ones are all wonky.
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:30.400]   There's some wonky problem with them all the time. And so I think that a lot of times people get
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:33.520]   excited about it because they're like, oh, finally, we'll just get what we'll get one that just,
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:36.320]   again, that just works and it just ties into the ecosystem.
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:41.280]   I just think that this is what this is what we get when we're looking at like the Apple fan base,
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:43.760]   which is, oh my god, new Apple product. Oh my god, new charger.
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:50.240]   There was chargers here. I saw the excitement like about the headlines.
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:56.800]   But breakthrough change to upcoming iPhones. You really went with that headline for a new charger.
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:00.560]   And of course, no one's going to get it free with the iPhone. It's going to be a product.
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:06.720]   But it seems like an odd thing for Apple to be making a product that's so well covered
[01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:13.040]   by third parties, probably just as well with, but for like 20 bucks less. But at the same point,
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:17.280]   this is one of my complaints about when Apple decided to stop including chargers with phones.
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:22.480]   It's really, really important to know that the consumer has at least one charger that is
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:27.280]   absolutely safety rated, that is not like a knockoff charger. They bought at a drug store that as
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:33.280]   soon as you throw it into a situation that is not completely nominal for US line current,
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:37.760]   you could have a fire hazard for a device that will often be plugged in and then left with its
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:43.760]   own devices, so to speak, for hours at a time, unobserved. There are, it's not as though people
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:47.520]   are buying, need it by 50 or 60 of these chargers over the course of the iPhone.
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:52.640]   So if they walk out of there, spending an extra 50 bucks for one charger that they know is going
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:57.680]   to work, as Alex says, is going to be able to fast charge the device safely. But also, they
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:02.240]   is least likely to start a fire. I think that's a, that's, that's peace of mind worth paying for.
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:06.960]   Apple's very careful activation lock, of course, keeps people from stealing iPhones.
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:12.240]   They're very careful about making sure that an iPhone or an iPad, when it transfers to a new owner,
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:16.560]   you know, has been released by the previous owner. And I understand why they do that.
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:22.320]   Apparently though it's causing problems for some retailers who take back AirPods,
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:27.920]   they are not, they remain linked to the previous owner's iCloud account,
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:33.840]   even after a factory reset. It's kind of like the activation lock for an iPhone or an AirPod.
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:44.240]   Apparently, one refurbisher of AirPods, GoTRG has a stockpile of 30,000 AirPods over the,
[01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:50.960]   just the course of the past few weeks. The, the Chief Sales Officer says the, told the
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:56.960]   business insider the issue affects about eight in 10 AirPods that come in through the company's
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:01.680]   facilities. If you get one of these AirPods and you try to open it up, you know, you bought one
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:08.000]   and you try to open it up on your iPhone, you'll get a pop-up message that says AirPods mismatch,
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:13.200]   the earbuds of your AirPods are linked to a different Apple IDs, possibly because one of the
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:20.080]   earbuds is mixed up with someone else's AirPods. And there isn't really any good solution. So there's,
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:28.480]   they've actually been unable to resell these, these AirPods often returned through retailers
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:35.040]   like Walmart. I guess it's going to be up to Apple to figure this, figure this out.
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:41.280]   Patrick Wardle, who does the, you know, Objective-C very useful tools says he thinks it might have
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:50.480]   been set up on purpose by Apple as, as kind of a activation lock. The main way, of course, is to
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:54.240]   have the, to avoid this to have the original owner, just like with your AirPods, your iPhone
[01:14:54.240 --> 01:15:00.160]   and your iPad on link it from your iCloud account before you recycle this, but most people do not
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:06.960]   do this. I think Apple might well say this is a feature. This is what intended.
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:12.080]   Certainly, it's also certainly makes it more difficult, makes people more wary of buying things
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:19.120]   on the secondary market. Remember, remember, remember time where it used to be, used to be able to buy
[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:24.480]   a second hand iPhone without really worrying that much about it. Even if you, even if you knew that
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:28.880]   you're not buying a stolen product, now what are the chances to know that, look, this person has
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:33.840]   definitely deactivated the phone. This is definitely going, I can definitely attach it to a new iCloud
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:37.920]   account without getting a screen saying, Hey, I'm sorry, this is return this to so and so.
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:43.200]   I'm not, I'm not necessarily thinking that Apple is doing this deliberately, but I think that
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:47.840]   that's a factor in how much they think that, Oh my God, we absolutely have to, let's, we need,
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:52.400]   we need to cancel the Mac Pro project. We need everybody on this, on this re relinking,
[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:57.200]   old, old AirPods problem solving. Do they, Apple doesn't have any,
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:16:02.640]   intentionally doesn't have any way that you can solve this with an iPhone or an iPad. There's no
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:06.400]   website you can go to saying, Hey, I bought this iPad and I can't get in because it's linked to
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:14.480]   somebody's account. Can you release it? I have been told by various Apple employees at retail
[01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:21.200]   that you can bring it into the Apple store. And if you can prove ownership, that they can unlock it,
[01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:26.080]   but they do it through a website now. But that website is not open to the public, obviously,
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:30.560]   it's only Apple genius. It's a fair can do that. Yeah. Yeah. It still voids theft. And it certainly
[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:35.840]   was effective. Remember before activation lock, there was a very brisk market install on iPhones.
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:39.840]   They've taken all the fun out of it. All the fun that is doing your Apple Pro.
[01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:45.200]   I'm not good anymore. Exactly. But but an AirPods maybe there should be a way to kind of release
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:52.400]   them. I don't know. Yeah, particularly if if I if you hard dock it to a device that is known to
[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:57.920]   Apple so that you can say, well, okay, we will let you read, reassign this to this new iCloud
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:02.800]   account. But of course, there's going to be a record that the AirPods with this serial number
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:08.400]   has been found and is now being used by this Apple user. Maybe that's a compromise.
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:13.840]   The hard part is is that even at the level of a laptop, if it's stolen, you're never getting
[01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:17.120]   impact. Like, you know, the thing is you just can't get the police to even act on it. So something
[01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:20.720]   like an AirPod, no one's going to go after them. So that's the only way you can the only way you
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:24.400]   can do it is stop it because it's just not it's not going to rise to the level of we're going to do
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:28.160]   anything about this. You know, and I think that's the that's the challenge. You have to make it hard.
[01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:33.120]   It could be enough to know that, yes, someone who's living on your floor, the dorm took it or
[01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:37.840]   some one of your roommates or one of your kids took it. Hence not owning up to it.
[01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:44.080]   In my case, it's actually my kid because for some reason, Henry, when I gave him my AirPods,
[01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:48.400]   renamed it to some other person's name and I saw it on my fine mind. I said, Henry,
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:51.120]   who's did you lose your AirPods? He said, no, no, that's me.
[01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:56.160]   I just want to use a funny name.
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:18:02.880]   No secret Instagram. Yeah, it was secret tiktok. Yeah, she calls himself Chicago Dave.
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:12.320]   So so I'm looking, I'm seeing is it poker? I don't know what it is. I'm looking. I see Chicago
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:17.520]   Dave's AirPods and I'm thinking I called Henry. I said, well, who's Chicago? Did you lose your
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:23.120]   AirPods? He said, no, no, that's me. Chicago Dave. He called me Chicago Dave. Either a gambling
[01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:30.560]   hustler or he's coming up with his own line of like barbecue sauce. Well, the funny thing,
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:34.960]   the funny thing there is that my, you know, I look at my amplifier or whatever, that I have my
[01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:39.440]   house and I just saw a name that I didn't recognize. I just took it off the internet. Like I just took
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:43.120]   it off the, I just just, this is the vice and my daughter came in like five minutes later,
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:46.640]   she can you put me back on the internet? I'm like, she's do this. I was like, I was like,
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:52.080]   when did I turn you off? And she goes, you just did. And I was like, oh, that's your name. That is.
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:57.360]   Okay. Yeah. I don't know if you remember, but way back when Henry was on Mac Break Weekly,
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:01.040]   he was back in the scott, we were a scott porn studio. And I interviewed him. He was like,
[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:08.000]   I don't know, 12 or 13. And we were talking to a message. You have a, a Twitter account. He says,
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.880]   yeah, he says, is it Henry LePore? He says, no, it's Ray Danger.
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:22.480]   Ray Danger has been on Twitter since 2008. And that's, and that's, that's my son right there.
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:34.080]   He follows me. Henry's a strange fellow, strange, strange. Anyway, oh, there is,
[01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:38.480]   there is a Chicago Dave, apparently. He's an old college friend of stands.
[01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:46.000]   I don't know. That's from American dad. That's how far? American dad. Yeah.
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.920]   I don't, I don't know if Henry watches American dad off to ask him.
[01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:55.600]   Maybe that's where Chicago Dave now explain where Ray Danger came from. Apple has restored
[01:19:55.600 --> 01:20:03.920]   the Navalny app to the app store. Google did it. So, so both Google and Apple had apps that were
[01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:09.920]   created by supporters of opposition critic Alexei Navalny, who was first poisoned,
[01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:17.440]   recovered and now is jailed by the Putin government. When the elections were coming, Russia said to
[01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:24.560]   both Google and Apple, take down that app they did. They did. Google put it back shortly after
[01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:32.640]   the elections. Apple has now just now reinstated the app into a store. And to make sure we all
[01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:36.720]   mentioned that the government was actually threatening Apple and Google employees who are
[01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:42.960]   inside Russia, basically saying that they, there was, the story was detailed last month about how
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:48.400]   soon as Google, as soon as Google's employees found out about pressure to remove this app,
[01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:53.680]   they moved, they moved that Google employee to a hotel outside of her, outside of her home,
[01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:58.400]   outside of her office. And then the next day, a knock on the door of the hotel was a police officer
[01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:03.280]   saying, Hi, we're wondering how your work on removing that app is. So they were, they were,
[01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:07.680]   they were threatening employees on the ground. That's one of the reasons why
[01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:10.880]   Russian other countries have these laws. Let's say that if you're going to be operating,
[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:13.440]   you have to have a local office and local employees. Somebody we can arrest.
[01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:19.520]   Right. But it is, it is interesting that Google reinstated. It looks like pretty much as soon as
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:23.840]   soon as the elections were over, where as Apple only did it recently. I don't know if that means
[01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:27.600]   anything, but that is interesting. I think, I think it was after Apple got their employees up.
[01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:31.200]   The last one, I would guess that the Apple employees are gone now. Yeah. I would.
[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:34.400]   I think it was they were once they were extracted, I think that they were.
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:36.800]   We should point out everything. You do have an option.
[01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:42.960]   Not just say, no, we're not going to have employees in country. And then if Russia says,
[01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:46.560]   okay, then you can't, Apple stop selling iPhones in Russia right after the Ukraine.
[01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:52.000]   Well, I think that I think that Apple and I in, or many corporations in Russia is probably a long
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.440]   way away. Like it's, this is becoming untenable. Yeah.
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:22:02.640]   I'll say a little break our show today brought to you by Express VPN. Express VPN is the VPN I
[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:08.240]   use and recommend. And it is really important for three different reasons. Security, of course,
[01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:15.520]   privacy, absolutely, and the ability to watch, you know, programming that is regionally blocked,
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:21.840]   like say Netflix, UK, if you want your doctor who episodes. If you've ever thought, Oh, I'm private,
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:26.640]   I'm using the browsers in cognito mode, the private browsing mode. Here's a little eye
[01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:31.520]   opener for you. Read the fine print when you go into the private mode browsing. That's not private.
[01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:37.120]   In fact, really, it's only private from other people in your house. That's the real point of it.
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:43.680]   When you search on Google, Google knows it's you. When you use their incognito mode to browse to
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:50.240]   other sites, Google knows where you're going. And so does your ISP. The real way to stay private is
[01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:58.000]   to use Express VPN. Incognito does not mean invisible Express VPN does when you're using Express VPN.
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:04.640]   You are automatically using one of their IP addresses, not yours to browse the net, which that IP address
[01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:11.040]   shared by other Express VPN users cannot be tracked back to you because Express VPN does something many
[01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:17.680]   VPN services do not do it does not log it does not keep track. It does not know that you're using
[01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:22.400]   it right now. In fact, I know this because Express VPN uses something they call trusted
[01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:28.560]   server. I read a write up on on bleeping computer a couple of months ago that I was very impressed
[01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:36.880]   with trust. The trusted server is wiped, cannot write to the hard drive. And the entire system,
[01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:43.520]   it's running on a custom Debian installation is wiped regularly, like every day, so that any
[01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:49.520]   record of your visit is completely gone, never never was made. And even if it was, it does not
[01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:55.600]   survive. It's really that's their commitment to true privacy vetted by independent third parties,
[01:23:55.600 --> 01:24:01.040]   press, waterhouse, Cooper, so you know, it works. They've vetted both the trusted VPN, trusted
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:08.560]   server technology and the privacy policy, they say, yep, it works as advertised. Express VPN is
[01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:13.760]   easy to use. They've got apps for everything, including many routers, you can put Express VPN
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:19.760]   on your router. And by the way, Express VPN is so fast, they have 160 locations in 94 countries
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:25.040]   all over the world, and they invest in their infrastructure. So it's fast enough to watch HD
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:29.440]   video. No one will complain if you're running your entire household through Express VPN, they
[01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:33.360]   won't even know, but you will you'll know they're safe, they're secure, they're protected, you can
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:40.800]   even put it on your smart TV. So Express VPN, bottom line, best way to protect your privacy,
[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:47.200]   your security online right now. If you really want to go in cognito, protect your privacy,

[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:34.720]   with Israeli spyware now. Oh, but wait, we don't sell this to anyone besides good good people,
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:40.160]   good people, Reuters reporting that senior officials at the European Commission were targeted
[01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:48.640]   last year, including two EU officials, Didier renders who is a senior Belgian statesman,
[01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:55.200]   European Justice Commissioner since 2019 for the Commission staffers also targeted
[01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:59.360]   the Commission became aware of the targeting following messages issued by Apple to thousands
[01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:03.840]   of iPhone owners in November telling them they were targeted by state sponsored attackers.
[01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:10.000]   If you get that message, take it seriously. This was we reported this when it happened as a first
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:19.200]   time Apple had ever sent a mass alert like this. Good on Apple for catching it and reporting it.
[01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:27.200]   I guess there's not much else to say about that except these guys are supposedly gone,
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:33.760]   but maybe not. Maybe I just remember coming across an article, I think in the financial times,
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:37.840]   saying that the private they're being sued by a bunch of people, which means that there's a
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:42.000]   lot of different discovery happening in the United States Supreme Court and in the London
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:46.800]   court system. And one of them was that the private equity valuation of the company is essentially zero
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:54.240]   or essentially valueless. So you got you got to wonder this is this must this must be like when
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:59.440]   like the German rocket research team broke up after World War II that there's.
[01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:04.640]   Oh yeah, that's right. Who got burner von Braun? Our German scientists are Nazi scientists are
[01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:09.680]   better than your Nazi scientists. Yeah, paper clip to clippy. Yeah, operation clippy. Yeah.
[01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:15.280]   What was what was that from the right stuff? I think it was our our Nazis are better than your
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:20.480]   Nazis as from the right stuff is the right our Germans are I think our Germans are better.
[01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:26.160]   We knew they were Nazis. Yeah. Apple business essentials are now available for small businesses.
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:34.240]   This is something that wasn't beta is now public. According to Apple's newsroom, thousands of small
[01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:39.600]   businesses in the Apple business essentials beta reported significant time savings and renewed
[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:47.200]   ability to focus on their mission. Hmm. Device management 24 seven Apple support and iCloud
[01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:52.480]   storage. I think I think it's a good it's a good step that's like halfway between what we had before
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:57.120]   and champ. Yeah. So it's like it's like it's like hey, well, you know, we're thrilled that they're
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:28:01.680]   doing this. This is a adjunct to what we already do because they do a lot of management stuff. Yeah.
[01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:06.320]   It doesn't seem to see device management that people are going to win from that. Right. Right.
[01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:13.840]   The Apple support app has been updated with support for business essentials customers with Apple
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:21.280]   Care Plus. So check that. And there is we had mentioned before a tap to pay on iPhone,
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:31.600]   which is coming later this year. And Apple has some new partners in that. Light speed commerce
[01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:41.040]   and new store. Okay. So you can this is so you can as an iPhone owner accept payments.
[01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:47.200]   Right. You're not like you're so square. Right. Exactly. Yeah. Square without only without external
[01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:51.760]   device. Any other external device. Tap to pay an iPhone will work with contactless credit and
[01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:59.200]   debit cards from leading payment networks. I think we're a while ad ad ad. And yeah.
[01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:06.240]   I'm probably saying that wrong. Ad yin is going to offer a tap to pay. I'm not sure what ad yin is.
[01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:11.680]   I think we're just going to get to watch this over the next couple of years. Apple just, you know,
[01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:16.880]   you wanted them to be a bank like just I got to fight. I'm not saying that I wanted to. I just
[01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:20.320]   think that they will. Yeah. I mean, I think that they but they the way to do it is to do it exactly
[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:24.400]   what you're doing here, which is just keep on adding some before and then when you step over to
[01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:30.640]   being the bank, it was like a little step. It wasn't a jump or a jog or a flight. It was just like,
[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:34.880]   Oh, and now we're going to, you know, you're almost there. I mean, you're just so close.
[01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:43.040]   Duck Duck go has shipped the their new browser. You know them as a search tool, but there is now
[01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:51.520]   Duck Duck go for Windows, Mac and Linux based on Google's chromium. But it is de googled, of course,
[01:29:51.520 --> 01:29:56.000]   and has built in privacy protections, private search tracker blocking website encryption,
[01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:04.000]   HTTPS everywhere and email protection. So I don't I haven't tried it, but it's based on chromium. So
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.760]   it would be probably a good alternative for people who want to use Chrome but don't want to give up
[01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:14.480]   their privacy. It's nice to have a one step recommendation for people because the plugins
[01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:20.400]   that you need to have in any chromium or Safari browser in order to get those kind of protections.
[01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:24.320]   It's a lot more than a lot of people willing to deal with if you're just even if they know that
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:28.320]   privacy is something they need to protect. It's like how much trouble are they willing to go through
[01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:31.520]   and also how much trouble are they going willing to go through on a day to day basis
[01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:35.760]   accessing websites. So that's why it's great to have this one that this one company that we kind of
[01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:40.960]   trust doing this one thing we can say, well, look, if you try it at least have two different browsers
[01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:44.960]   on your desktop, one that you use by default, which is privacy oriented. And then if there's
[01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:50.960]   anything that doesn't work with that, find Rup back into Safari. Yeah. Oh, wait a minute.
[01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:56.240]   I'm sorry. I apologize on the Mac. It is not chromium based. It uses WebKit.
[01:30:56.240 --> 01:31:01.920]   Yeah. So this actually might be a really good alternative. If you want to use WebKit,
[01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:07.600]   you want to use Safari, but you want to use a more private version of it. Oh, that's oh, really
[01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:17.280]   interesting. Okay. Okay. So good. And I actually I'm very nervous about chromium completely dominating
[01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:22.960]   the world through Google Chrome and its and its adjuncts. And so it's not I use Firefox,
[01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:27.680]   just because I want a little more diversity. This is another way to get some diversity into the
[01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:34.880]   ecosystem. You're not using Chrome. Dr. Go for Windows is coming soon. I'm sorry, it's not out
[01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:44.320]   quite yet. Mac first came out today. Apple TV is made a deal with Tom Hanks play tone.
[01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:49.920]   Did you see Greyhound? It was a really, really good dramatic movie. I liked it.
[01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:56.960]   The story of a World War II anti submarine boat, captain by Tom Hanks. Apparently they're
[01:31:56.960 --> 01:32:04.000]   going to make a sequel to Greyhound. It's in development. Finch was the other movie they got
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:08.240]   from a play tone. And I think I thought I thought Finch was I thought I think it was better.
[01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:14.960]   Oh, really? I love Greyhound. Finch, I thought was all right. You like fish. But you have kids.
[01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:20.000]   I think kids probably love Finch. Yeah, no, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:26.560]   I mean, this is going to be this is going to be a great buy for their for like a documentary style,
[01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:33.360]   like non documentary style content, because they play tones buying a lot of books, a lot of like
[01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:38.160]   biographies, a lot of historical books. So that's it's a pretty good deal. It's a pretty good face.
[01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:44.160]   And so Tom Hanks is not going to get into trouble for content. Right. He's a safe, he's a safe bet.
[01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:48.400]   Actually, this might be kind of the fallout we were talking about with Apple winning an Oscar for
[01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:55.760]   Coda. Hanks had written done Greyhound for Sony Pictures and Finch for Universal. Apple bought
[01:32:55.760 --> 01:33:00.720]   them. This time, play tone is going to make it as an Apple original film and will be available
[01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:08.400]   only on Apple streaming. Apple is also Hanks. Tap Tanks is executive producer. Actually,
[01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:15.680]   a show he'd been working on called Masters of the Air. You remember, he was a fan of, was it
[01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:20.480]   brothers in arms? What was band of brothers? Really great. He was one of the, I think he came out
[01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:24.560]   of doing yeah, saving prior Ryan and just wanted to really dig into that. And yeah,
[01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:29.840]   so this is a terrible series by the way. Yeah, must see band of brothers. He's not in it, but he
[01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:34.240]   produced it. I don't think he'll be in this either. He's executive producer, Masters of the Air,
[01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:41.440]   a World War II epic 10 part series about the eighth Air Force. He did the Pacific after band
[01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:46.080]   of brothers, which was not as good as band of brothers, but Masters of the Air wrapped filming
[01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:53.760]   late last year, budget in excess of $200 million for the 10 part series, premiere date yet to be
[01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:56.480]   announced. But Apple TV also will have the exclusive on that one.
[01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:05.600]   And I wonder if he knew if that was a, I guess my question is whether that was something he knew
[01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:08.960]   is going to be Apple TV or they sold it to them later. And the reason for that is that
[01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:11.520]   the approach to shooting will be much bigger if you know you have a big budget.
[01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:16.880]   There's different ways you'll approach it. And you can start to see some of that with some of the
[01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:24.800]   Apple content is that they are, when they know they're shooting with Apple and Apple, put the
[01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:30.640]   money into it, the fit and finish is higher. Do any of you watch a severance?
[01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:36.240]   Ben Stiller's series on Apple TV? I haven't watched it yet. Oh my God. Well, just finished,
[01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:43.840]   just wrapped. And it was a, at first it was, it's so claustrophobic. I wasn't really getting into it.
[01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:46.080]   But by the end, and the way they ended,
[01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:53.840]   and by the way, it's very frustrating because they ended kind of in the, you know, it's one of
[01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:57.520]   these things they do now in the middle, you got to wait for season two.
[01:34:57.520 --> 01:35:03.600]   And I'm just, I bite my teeth, my nails until season two comes out. So that's worth watching,
[01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:06.960]   I think. I think that's a good show. Different. But good. Interesting.
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:14.400]   This is becoming kind of a factor. Just the other day was announced that there was a really,
[01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:19.360]   from the graphic novel, "Nomona." It's a really, really, really cool graphic novel.
[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:25.520]   It came out like five or six years ago. An animation studio associated with Fox
[01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:30.560]   picked it up for something to make it into an animated feature. Then Disney bought Fox,
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:33.920]   and suddenly Disney was like having problems with a lot of the content,
[01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:40.560]   because there is like a, there is like a same-sex romance inside it is, is for like kids and teens.
[01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:44.640]   But it's just, you know, it's a fairy tale. And two of the characters happened to be men who were
[01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:48.080]   in love with each other. And they kiss, and Disney was saying, "Ooh, we want to tone that now."
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:53.040]   Oh, geez. And for this and another much of reasons, like it was clear that Disney was kind of putting
[01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:57.200]   it into like the bin. And then Netflix, of course, picked it up and they're probably going to have
[01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:01.680]   a big success with it because it is like a, it's in the past five or six years, it's become a classic.
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:06.480]   So, FAPL and other streamers can take advantage of mistakes that other streamers are making.
[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:09.360]   That's probably a pretty good deal. That's probably, it's probably something that would
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:13.440]   attract someone like a Tom Hanks saying that we are not going to, we're not going to have problems
[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:20.560]   with super, super conservatives being upset that we're putting the Apple TV name to,
[01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:22.880]   again, people who are in love being in love with each other.
[01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:28.960]   And I'm sure though, Tim Cook, being the best-known out CEO in the world,
[01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:35.040]   is also reluctant to make Apple TV be kind of the place for gay dramas either, right? You don't want
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:41.840]   to kind of get that label. But, well, they have a lot of, I mean, they have a lot of content in
[01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:46.400]   there already that's leaning that direction. So, I don't think they're that afraid of it.
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:48.320]   Okay. I'd be surprised if that was a concern.
[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:53.120]   Okay, good. There's definitely some, a fair bit of content actually that's there.
[01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:54.560]   So, I don't think that they're afraid of that.
[01:36:54.560 --> 01:37:02.880]   Ten episode workplace comedy starring Maya Rudolph will debut Friday, June 4th on Apple TV. It's called
[01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:09.920]   Loot. Loot. You know, we've been, over the last few weeks, there's been a lot of Apple TV stories.
[01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:15.520]   They're cranking out stuff like crazy all of a sudden. Good for them.
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:21.360]   I'm glad they're working with Maya Rudolph. She's, she's incredible. And in a more enlightened world,
[01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:27.360]   that in a more meritocritous world, she would have like already been too expensive for Apple TV
[01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:34.400]   like five years ago. Apple TV also has a podcast, a true crime podcast because that's really what
[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:39.040]   podcasting is all about is true crime. Run Bambi, run an Apple original.
[01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:47.280]   Laurie Bembinek was a Milwaukee police officer and Playboy Club Bunny before being arrested for
[01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:52.480]   the murder of her husband's ex wife. Now, that's a show you can't miss.
[01:37:52.480 --> 01:38:00.240]   I do think that, I do think that there's, there's Apple, none of the streamers have really taken
[01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:06.320]   advantage of the potential convergence in, you know, between podcasts and different social networks
[01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:11.120]   and just extras, you know, that there's so much there. And you know, Disney kind of did it with
[01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:14.960]   Mandalorian where we gave, they gave us kind of an overproduced, under informed
[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:20.720]   behind the scenes. But I think that there's a, there's no reason, there's, you're not trying to
[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:24.880]   vie for time. And it's not in the grand scheme of things. The behind the scenes is not that
[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:28.240]   expensive. And I just feel like they absolutely really miss the boat because if you're trying to
[01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:31.600]   have people think, Oh, this is worth it. And they put out between all the mandol, I mean,
[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:35.920]   you could literally do Mandalorian. And every week between Mandalorian breakup, how
[01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:40.640]   meant the last season got done, you know, just to fill time because people would stick around,
[01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:44.320]   you know, that like it, you know, and so I think that there's just tons of extra content there that
[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:52.320]   is a 1000 cost per hour than, than the actual content that is just extra content that people
[01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:57.600]   are watching. Yeah. They've done behind the scenes for for all mankind and foundation.
[01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:02.320]   Uh, they have a podcast for the problem with John Stewart. I don't know if it's the same show or a
[01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:07.760]   different show. Uh, the big thing is that wild things and hooked. So they have, it's not their
[01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:12.000]   first podcast. Yeah. I think that there's just so much that can be done there, you know,
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:16.000]   and especially when the sets are up, like for instance, I would be building extra content from
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:19.760]   those sets and those actors while I was, you know, while you have the whole production crew,
[01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:24.000]   we're going to cut, we're going to do two or three minutes of something or take this stuff we cut
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:29.280]   out. But, but also two or three minutes that is designed only for the online. And if you watch
[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:34.080]   the regular show, you'll completely get a great experience, but you get all these little extra
[01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:36.640]   little bits that they decided, Oh, we're not going to put that. We're going to have, you know,
[01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:40.720]   because you always have to cut the pod race was like 22 minutes long when it first, when it was
[01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:44.880]   the first edit, you know, and by the time it got to the film was seven minutes and
[01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:49.920]   yeah, I think that, you know, I think there are those extra 15 minutes or, you know,
[01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:56.640]   I'll say 22. What happened? 22 is really long, but 11 was great. Like seven was too short, in my
[01:39:56.640 --> 01:40:01.920]   opinion. So 11 was there was an 11 minute version that was fantastic. Yeah, that's that's that's
[01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:06.560]   that's just what I'm sure there's a way to do that well. But oh my god, that's kind of one of my
[01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:11.440]   buttons saying that don't don't if it's if it's important, film it. And if it's important to this,
[01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:15.920]   we find out if six months later, it still seems important, put it in the actual thing,
[01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:20.560]   don't film something and then say that don't don't put me in a situation where like a movie
[01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:25.920]   later, two movies later or like five episodes later, like who is that person and why did they
[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:33.600]   seem so familiar? It's like, I think it should be a complete movie. Like there shouldn't be things
[01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:36.720]   that you had to go out and get. It's just that there's all kinds, there's always all these
[01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:42.640]   extra things like again, the pod race is what it is. But if you if you it would be great, like,
[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:49.280]   well, one that's the biggest one that I've seen so recently has been the last the first
[01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:55.200]   Hellboy with the new actor and I can't think of the the last Hellboy. There's an extra in the DVD
[01:40:55.200 --> 01:41:00.800]   or in the Apple TV, you know, thing there's an extra that's a different open that changes the
[01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:08.560]   meaning of a higher film. Like it is like watch it. Whoa, like your brain just kind of opens up
[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:12.480]   like open, you know, like it's it's a and they you know, obviously they decided for whatever reason
[01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:17.200]   for business reasons or for whatever we're not going to do it that way. And so they had done
[01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:21.040]   everything and they got cut out of the movie, but they put it put it back in and it is the it is
[01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:25.440]   the biggest doozy except for maybe like the end of Ronin, like a multiple there's a different
[01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:29.360]   ending. But those are like the two biggest ones like it just completely changes the whole movie.
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:31.920]   You don't like that Andy when they do that? I love that.
[01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:37.760]   Well, so okay, so long as this song is presented as here is a waste here is a dumpster full of stuff
[01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:43.840]   that we threw out for very, very good reasons. We made choices every time that we we put cut one
[01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:48.560]   of these things. If you would like to see what back to the future might have looked like how
[01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:54.560]   Derek Stoltz retained the retain the role of as Martin McFly. Great. Here it is. It's it's fun.
[01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:59.920]   We enjoy it. We're thirsty for more sometimes, but don't don't I think it's a mistake when you're
[01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:07.120]   saying that our original idea was to make to make Marty actually be always be from 100 years in the
[01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:13.120]   future. And he's the person who's always been like showing the showing doc like what to do and kind
[01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:16.080]   of manipulating him towards this thing because there's something that's going to happen in the
[01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:22.240]   year 3000. And we need time travel the 19 1980s and 1950s to make it happen. Now at that point,
[01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:28.240]   I'm like, okay, but now you're basically complicating the main story. You're basically trying to create
[01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:32.400]   almost trying to create a divided timeline. Maybe part of it is because I've been burned by this
[01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:37.280]   like so many times on like Disney and Marvel properties. But I'm saying that at some point,
[01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:41.520]   you have to commit to this is what the story is. We're not going to we're not going to show you
[01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:49.600]   in apocalypse now. It's it's cool to find out that that that Martin Sheen and his crew like stole
[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:55.360]   the surfboard from from from the Ranger Ranger Colonel. And now that there's a big thing with
[01:42:55.360 --> 01:43:00.960]   a trying to find it again. But I kind of kind of I kind of could done without knowing about that.
[01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:05.120]   It's it's a fun piece of footage. Always good to see more footage of Martin Sheen. But it's like
[01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:10.800]   don't contaminate me with knowledge of Oh, actually between these two scenes in this perfectly structured
[01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:16.080]   and paced movie. There is this like eight minute scene of garbage that is fun to look at but doesn't
[01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:20.560]   act that actually kind of takes away from the building drama and tension. Yeah, I think that
[01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:26.160]   like again in the help boy one it was a perfectly good movie and I enjoyed it by itself like it
[01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:32.800]   didn't need you know the new open but the new open was like oh I won't even spoil it but if
[01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:36.560]   you have the Apple TV one or you have the TV or Blu-ray you need to if you haven't looked at the
[01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:42.240]   the alternate open you need to see it because it's the thing. I think that what it's really
[01:43:42.240 --> 01:43:48.240]   speaking to is the is like the super fan. Normal normal people want to see the movie as edited as
[01:43:48.240 --> 01:43:53.840]   in the theaters or the TV show but the super fans are like give me all the extra stuff behind the
[01:43:53.840 --> 01:43:58.720]   scenes. I can and you're I can handle it. When you're doing a production you're just generating
[01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:03.200]   enormous amounts of data you know and you a lot of times for a lot of these big films now they
[01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:06.960]   have a behind the scenes shooting all the time. Sure. And they you know and I think that Peter
[01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:12.400]   Jackson did a really good job before the Lord of the Rings of you know giving us little tidbits
[01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:16.480]   of what's going on to get people excited about it. And I think that I just think there's such an
[01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:21.680]   opportunity to do is again there is so many things that we cut out of movies that I've worked on
[01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:25.360]   that we just you know we just decided for time like there's only so much you can do into two
[01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:30.960]   hours and ten minutes or whatever you've decided is the number. And you know in that number by the way
[01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:34.320]   has to do with how much money you're going to make because how many times can you turn the theater
[01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:39.760]   over right. So so the you know you start going longer and you start you can get away with it for
[01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:46.320]   some films but it can be you can really cut a third of your revenue out of the opening weekend. And so
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:52.400]   so the so the that number is important and so then you start making you first you cut all the fat out
[01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:55.680]   but then you start cutting muscle and it would just be great if the muscle showed up somewhere
[01:44:55.680 --> 01:44:59.840]   and that's all. Yeah. You spend a lot of money on it and it's all it was all done. Yeah. You know a
[01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:05.040]   lot of times. Yeah. Sometimes not sometimes it's still just like the animatic version of it which is
[01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:09.440]   still cool. Well there's different kinds I mean so if you shot a different opening and it didn't
[01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:16.080]   test well I think that's of interest. If you if you shot eight minutes and Francis says
[01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:22.080]   yeah that really slows us down doesn't get us anywhere throw it out. I still would want to see
[01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:26.480]   sometimes I want to see it after I saw the original. Oh no absolutely. I don't think you should put
[01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:29.840]   it out ahead of time. I think you put it out two weeks later a month later or what it would be
[01:45:29.840 --> 01:45:34.160]   time to watch it. But then there's just you could be trickling out all this extra little you know
[01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:39.200]   these extra little bits. And again even just the behind the scenes I mean there was so many
[01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:45.840]   hundreds and hundreds and thousands of hours shot of SW one Star Wars you know the episode one.
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:52.320]   And the I had to go through some of it because I had to figure out where to put the pod racers in
[01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:59.120]   the in the in the where you know in my anyway I had to put the pod racers in a place and I had
[01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:02.400]   to figure out where they put them in. And so I was looking at all the behind the scenes to kind
[01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:06.800]   of triangulate where all the pods went. It was just the most fascinating thing. It's George
[01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:12.240]   Lucas and John Noel walking around talking about shots. Oh yeah you've seen stuff that none of us
[01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:18.480]   have seen. Yeah I saw hours of that. I can like like hours and hours and hours looking for certain
[01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:22.640]   things and I would just watch it. And real fans want all and then tick-noots right. I would like it
[01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:28.240]   is it is the best like it is better than like that those hours that I spent watching to try to get
[01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:32.800]   the data that I needed with some of the the most interesting like it's a master's course in filmmaking
[01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:36.640]   because you just get this these kind of raw raw takes on what we're going to do this and this is
[01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:41.520]   how this is going to work and you know George you know just asking questions and John matter
[01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:44.560]   factually just how come they have that on the film because they had a behind the scenes crew.
[01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:51.200]   They had a crew follow George for SW1 for every moment that he interacted with someone like it was
[01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:54.880]   they have all that footage sitting there and it was did they ever release it of any
[01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:58.080]   there's little bits and pieces like little bits and pieces of it but they could have been
[01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:03.120]   they could document it like somebody needs to do that documentary probably George is stopping him
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:07.360]   or Disney or somebody. I don't know I don't know I just George still on episode one I can't remember
[01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:12.480]   no Disney has it no Disney hasn't yeah but it's it was just it was uh and they and you know you
[01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:15.920]   could do that with every film and it's it's one person walking around it was John Shank walking
[01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:20.960]   around behind him with a camera and shooting what's going on it was almost never more than one person
[01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:27.360]   and so you just you have all this all this data you know um to to to work with hardcore fans love
[01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:32.640]   you that stuff oh yeah that's that's different I absolutely agree with you on that point it's my
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:38.000]   my usual my my the only problem where I really wish that the director hadn't done that or the
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:42.640]   producers of the owners hadn't done that is when like my favorite example is probably Amadeus
[01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:50.080]   where one of the things that makes that movie so brilliant is that you think that this is a battle
[01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:56.320]   between Salieri and Mozart but it isn't it's a battle between Salieri and God Salieri is not
[01:47:56.880 --> 01:48:03.600]   angry with Mozart as far as Salieri's concerned he made a deal with God when he was a little boy
[01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:09.520]   to give me this amazing gift and in turn not only he gave him just enough talent to be able to see
[01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:16.080]   genius in others and he and also put put Mozart like right next to God also made sure that Mozart
[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:23.040]   would be inside Salieri's orbit so you can see what a vulgar uncouth rude monster that he put
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:27.920]   this talent and instead of himself so he's angry with God but when you look at there was a restored
[01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:32.400]   version that's usually the one that you buy you get when if you buy a brand new DVD or Blu-ray
[01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:38.400]   that also adds a few scenes where Salieri is attacking Mozart directly one which he basically
[01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:46.560]   tries to basically tries to blackmail Constanza Mozart's wife and oh look I'll help your all help Mozart
[01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:52.080]   get this job teaching this kid but you got to sleep with me and that changes everything because
[01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:58.720]   now again now he's why is he trying to hurt Mozart why is he trying to hurt his wife?
[01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:05.360]   doesn't he kill Mozart at the end effectively by no he's killing God's creation he's not like
[01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:11.840]   he's not he's not anti Mozart just right exactly that's and that's why so so when you
[01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:16.480]   that's what I'm talking about when you talk about they they filmed all these scenes at some point
[01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:20.720]   when they're looking at the entire movie they decided it doesn't just make the movie longer but
[01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:24.720]   it also removes the focus well that one's complicated because it's based on a play
[01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:30.000]   so there is in fact a canonical script for which they deviated from yeah so but that's that's
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:33.920]   that's what I'm talking about as a viewer I don't like it when later on I'm saying oh well
[01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:38.080]   actually we didn't tell you the entire story here's some stuff that was also happening between
[01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:42.240]   these two characters and you suddenly I've taken this away from you in my mind it changes
[01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:45.840]   the meaning of every has gone down to three stars because okay that's very cheap and that's very
[01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:49.680]   taudrey I don't I don't know what's salieri was up to you right now and that's that's that is
[01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:54.720]   so often what happens with the star wars movies with the marvell movies it's like okay I don't
[01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:59.360]   not only did it was I not informed during when I was watching the actual movie itself did I not
[01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:03.520]   know what was going on because I didn't see this other thing that I'm expected to spend an extra
[01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:10.240]   eight dollars a month or whatever to see but also it changed I walked away with a diminished
[01:50:10.240 --> 01:50:15.120]   excuse me the stuff of this this movie that I thought was very good actually now I don't think
[01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:19.680]   was very good because you've made this really really confusing you've you've added this
[01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:24.960]   anyway I just think that buying the scene stuff is always great when you're adding more content
[01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:28.960]   just because you're saying oh let's have extra scenes with these characters they'll eat it up
[01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:34.560]   maybe people will enjoy that but you're basically now watering down this what could have been a
[01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:40.480]   beautiful two hour 10 minute movie and turning into like a four hour experience and I don't want
[01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:47.200]   to see an experience I want to see a movie yeah we were talking earlier about 10 to 12
[01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:52.960]   week delays if you want to get a Mac studio maybe we now know why this just came in Shanghai and
[01:50:52.960 --> 01:51:00.960]   Kunshan both locked down due to COVID-19 brand new as you know COVID-19 restrictions in China
[01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:09.120]   which means pegatron, Quata and Compel have all suspended factory activities that could have a lot
[01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:15.120]   to do pegatron makes 23% of all iPhones and the new iPhone plant in India has not yet begun
[01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:22.560]   operation I think that this is the the long effect of this is going to be diversification from China
[01:51:22.560 --> 01:51:26.560]   for a whole bunch of years you know like this is like there's like there's the you know the fact
[01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:29.520]   that and this is a really hard thing for China to be shutting it down I mean I know they're really
[01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:35.280]   committed to the zero COVID thing but it's the the issue that they're going to have is that that
[01:51:35.280 --> 01:51:42.000]   everyone's realizing between the shutdowns as well as this you know the concern that they're going to
[01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:47.200]   try to do the same thing that Russia's doing Ukraine in Taiwan it just doesn't you know because what
[01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:51.120]   happens if you're to get at leave China like that's a real problem for a lot of these countries
[01:51:51.120 --> 01:51:55.360]   and so this is just a preview to that problem and I think that it's going to have all the companies
[01:51:55.360 --> 01:52:00.880]   looking at how they they reallocate their resources Quanta makes Mac books and Nelson makes Dell and
[01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:06.880]   HP laptops and others 20% of its total notebook capacities in Shanghai and has been shut down
[01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:16.080]   Compaul is also a halted activities in Kunshan they make iPads so yeah this could be this is this
[01:52:16.080 --> 01:52:22.800]   is not yet built into those lead times so yeah the shutdown in Shanghai is pretty severe there's
[01:52:22.800 --> 01:52:26.720]   a lot of people who are really going through very very bad situations I mean we're not we're not
[01:52:26.720 --> 01:52:30.960]   talking about oh businesses are shut down people are being encouraged to like stay indoors oh no
[01:52:30.960 --> 01:52:36.720]   it's no people are being trapped inside they're being well being shut yeah yeah they're only getting
[01:52:36.720 --> 01:52:40.960]   supplies are being provided to them by the government and sometimes it's inadequate sometimes it's
[01:52:40.960 --> 01:52:46.000]   just very very hard living inside Shanghai yeah so much sympathy yeah all right let's take a little
[01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:54.240]   break picks of the week gentlemen coming up next first a word from zok dok you know there's some
[01:52:54.240 --> 01:52:58.160]   really amazing doctors out there but the only ones that matter are the ones who take your insurance
[01:52:58.160 --> 01:53:02.800]   right I mean if you if you can't afford to go to that doctor what could are they with zok
[01:53:02.800 --> 01:53:09.200]   doc you can focus on doctors who are in network find a doctor who can who can both take your
[01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:16.160]   insurance and is right for you no more wasting time hunting down aunt Shirley's cash only chiropractor
[01:53:16.160 --> 01:53:21.600]   or the dentist your coworker recommended who's not taking new patients no one knows what you're
[01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:25.680]   looking for in a doctor better than you and no one's better at giving you the tools to find the
[01:53:25.680 --> 01:53:32.880]   perfect doctor than zok doc zosy dosy the people who created zok doc realized there were some major
[01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:37.120]   pain points in health care and a lot of things weren't working they said we can do it better
[01:53:37.120 --> 01:53:43.840]   they made booking a great doctor surprisingly pain-free now this is a free app get it right now on
[01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:50.400]   your iPhone it shows doctors who are patient reviewed which I think is fantastic I think that's so
[01:53:50.400 --> 01:53:56.160]   valuable that you can also limit you know narrow down doctors to take your insurance and who are
[01:53:56.160 --> 01:54:01.120]   available when you need them you can read up on local doctors get verified reviews see what other
[01:54:01.120 --> 01:54:05.680]   humans had to say about their visit so when you go into that doctor's office you are going to see

[01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:35.760]   you we appreciate it Alex Lindsay let's get a pick of the week all right i got a i got a free one
[01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:41.760]   for you but everyone may not be able to get it this is from this is reality scan and this is from
[01:55:41.760 --> 01:55:47.200]   this is from actually they're owned by epic now so epic bot them as part of epic is not only
[01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:51.200]   you know doing you know games of course and they've unreal engine but they're building all the feeder
[01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:55.680]   systems that go into unreal engine and so one of the things that they've purchased is this company
[01:55:55.680 --> 01:55:59.840]   called reality scan which a lot of us knew about in the past we've used it you know for photogrammetry
[01:55:59.840 --> 01:56:04.000]   and so on so forth and now they're releasing an iPhone app if you're listening to this they said
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:08.640]   that the first 10,000 people that want to go to test flight and get it can be part of it it's
[01:56:08.640 --> 01:56:14.400]   been it came out last week so i don't know how many are left but what it does is let's you start
[01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:21.280]   to take photos here let me show you um let's see here so if i cut to this this is the app and
[01:56:21.280 --> 01:56:26.080]   what i can do is you can see my little my little dude there and i can start taking pictures and
[01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:31.200]   you'll see it it kind of it's kind of cool it it shows you in ar you're you're seeing the photos
[01:56:31.200 --> 01:56:35.520]   oh that's neat that i'm taking pictures so you get and if you pull back you can see where the
[01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:41.120]   photo looks like a bunch of polaroids yeah it's like shooting little polaroids of of of our subject
[01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:46.880]   here and um you know we can keep on and at some point it's going to start giving us a preview of
[01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:54.400]   what what happens when i get to a certain level here is that um we want a 3d rumsleg
[01:56:54.400 --> 01:56:59.280]   yeah exactly this one will not produce it because i'm trying to show i'm trying to just get it to
[01:56:59.280 --> 01:57:03.920]   roem is unfortunately surrounded by switchers but uh other than yeah exactly the value of his
[01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:10.560]   switchers he has control of the switchers he's taking the switcher room so uh he will soon find
[01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:16.000]   his his his quarry could be the trash gun vector though anyway so what happens normally and i don't
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:20.640]   know why i'm what i'm something about me doing the way i'm doing it there we go there we go that's
[01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:24.720]   what i was trying to get oh so here's what's cool about this is it's like i know where that i
[01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:29.760]   know where all this stuff is and this is all like ar stuck to you know stuck you can see that it's
[01:57:29.760 --> 01:57:35.440]   like it's stuck to the the scene right yeah now what what it is is that the red areas say i don't
[01:57:35.440 --> 01:57:40.160]   have enough data yet for that the green areas say i've got plenty of coverage so you want to take
[01:57:40.160 --> 01:57:45.520]   pictures of the red and yellows yeah you keep on wanting to cover it you know and and so
[01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:50.880]   turn them and then as you add more it adds more detail it says okay well and you get it's a really
[01:57:50.880 --> 01:57:55.520]   cool little app and then what happens is is that in there there's there's like a box there then i
[01:57:55.520 --> 01:58:01.120]   can do go to inspect and this is my this is the and this just shows you kind of a rough area so you
[01:58:01.120 --> 01:58:05.680]   can go you know there's a lot of this i don't need or you know i'm not interested in so i can kind of
[01:58:05.680 --> 01:58:10.720]   pull this in so i only want to build a model of of that yeah like a little garbage mat now i'll show
[01:58:10.720 --> 01:58:17.120]   you another um so that was that then what what that does is you export that to sketchfab so those
[01:58:17.120 --> 01:58:22.320]   boxes are just there to give you a guide of the of the area that you're working with and then if
[01:58:22.320 --> 01:58:28.960]   you look at this this is something i shot in my living room um so this is the actual 3d model
[01:58:28.960 --> 01:58:34.800]   wow that's really amazing wow yeah so it took like an hour for it to do this but it is um
[01:58:34.800 --> 01:58:42.000]   it's really detailed you know like it's it's uh so this is and this is the advantage of using
[01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:46.800]   photogrammetry as well as LiDAR and the LiDAR helps with all of that AR that we were just doing but
[01:58:46.800 --> 01:58:52.160]   then the photogrammetry really takes over for the detail you know and but that guide is just super
[01:58:52.160 --> 01:58:56.560]   valuable of it showing you where what's working and not working i just kept on looking at areas
[01:58:56.560 --> 01:59:01.440]   that were red or yellow and just kept on giving it information um that i needed to do it but it's
[01:59:01.440 --> 01:59:06.160]   if you look at these especially if you start to look at the the part the parts you want to look at are
[01:59:06.160 --> 01:59:12.000]   like the silhouette right here is that is that means that there's real geometry there you know that's
[01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:17.120]   not like just a ball you know with some stuff that's actual you know and that's that's a really
[01:59:17.120 --> 01:59:20.720]   and then of course you can tell us can tell us straight airplay as well as everything else
[01:59:20.720 --> 01:59:31.600]   yeah you are just wow wow anyway so um yeah so let's slip that one in then yeah yeah anyway yeah nice
[01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:37.200]   so anyway um uh so so that that is that it's a really cool little app and if it's still available
[01:59:37.200 --> 01:59:41.600]   i mean if it'll be available i'll probably pick one it's out because it's a specialised
[01:59:41.600 --> 01:59:45.120]   this is a fairly specialised thing not everybody's going so there may be some some spaces left and
[01:59:45.120 --> 01:59:48.560]   maybe there i don't know maybe they're making up the 10 000 i don't know but but i would highly
[01:59:48.560 --> 01:59:52.080]   recommend playing with it it's a really fun app and you just get a little you get an account on
[01:59:52.080 --> 01:59:56.640]   sketchfab and you get this and then it'll just upload them don't take it i don't know where the
[01:59:56.640 --> 02:00:00.240]   the i'm not taking geometry of things that matter like or things that are important to be secret
[02:00:00.240 --> 02:00:05.280]   because i'm putting it on sketchfab but but i am but as a test i mean this is going to be a big part
[02:00:05.280 --> 02:00:09.680]   of the future is being able to generate these this geometry from just a photo and you know apple
[02:00:09.680 --> 02:00:14.000]   has its own stuff reality this reality scan is coming out and what typically happens with epic
[02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:17.520]   is they don't charge them for any of it because they're you know their model is making people
[02:00:17.520 --> 02:00:23.360]   successful in the metaverse right so they're turning real objects into what you want to wear
[02:00:23.360 --> 02:00:29.440]   or not wear but put in your um scenes is is important to them so so i think that they're just going to
[02:00:29.440 --> 02:00:34.080]   i don't expect this to ever suddenly turn into something you have to pay for so it's uh it's pretty
[02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:39.440]   it's pretty slick little app reality scan uh there's a test flight so you need to go to i guess
[02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:46.880]   capturing reality dot com yeah the beta is now as beautiful oh well i think we mentioned this
[02:00:46.880 --> 02:00:52.880]   before didn't we i i don't think we i know i've seen this i know i've seen this armchair before so yeah
[02:00:52.880 --> 02:00:58.720]   right uh maybe we talked about it last i don't know we might have filled it up last week yeah yeah
[02:00:58.720 --> 02:01:03.520]   yeah i'm glad you showed off the the detail because when i look at photogrammetry apps and they
[02:01:03.520 --> 02:01:08.640]   the wonderful demo object that they put on the website they they put for manipulation
[02:01:08.640 --> 02:01:15.840]   sometimes the question is okay how much of that is actual 3d vertices based yeah polygon detail
[02:01:15.840 --> 02:01:20.400]   and how much is just simply that you caught the shadow uh when you took the when you took the the
[02:01:20.400 --> 02:01:25.120]   image the color uh the the light balance of that because then you look at the 3d object itself and
[02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:29.600]   it's like okay there is actually no puckering in that seat okay you didn't actually get that crack
[02:01:29.600 --> 02:01:36.400]   in that surface there uh so yeah that's that's very encouraging it is i gotta say i gotta say
[02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:41.600]   you're influencing me because i have yesterday i was working at uh one of my two with three favorite
[02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:46.880]   libraries uh that are not the boss public library and and i find the great thing about like old
[02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:51.760]   libraries in new england is that there's always a back room that doesn't look like it's it's part
[02:01:51.760 --> 02:01:56.160]   of the public area but it actually is if you just ask the librarian hey where's the correct page and
[02:01:56.160 --> 02:02:03.360]   you find yourself in this oak infused like boardroom environment where they have like marble busts
[02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:08.720]   that like we're donated by some dowager in 1917 and so as i'm working i'm looking at this
[02:02:08.720 --> 02:02:13.200]   bust of Athena i'm thinking you know what the the boss of public library would probably not
[02:02:13.200 --> 02:02:17.680]   allow me to have direct exit to like pull something down and put it on a table but i bet these librarians
[02:02:17.680 --> 02:02:22.400]   would say no absolutely no sure let me get a letter and like that would probably be a good thing for
[02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:27.200]   photogrammetry and yeah absolutely we have a there's a millennium falcon sitting in our office
[02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:32.080]   in the hallway in our office and um that someone built to really high res and uh we're gonna take it
[02:02:32.080 --> 02:02:35.520]   off i'm talking to the person who made it and we're gonna take it off and take do a test with this
[02:02:35.520 --> 02:02:41.360]   to see how far we can push it the um to this uh we'll talk about that and when i do it but this is
[02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:46.960]   the geometry so this is yeah you can really those are all the boxes yeah yeah this is well this is
[02:02:46.960 --> 02:02:52.400]   just polygons i mean it's just an incredible amount of data you know it's um yeah so and that's
[02:02:52.400 --> 02:02:56.320]   obviously when you look at it this way you can see it's been decimated a little bit so it's even
[02:02:56.320 --> 02:03:00.880]   doing it relatively efficiently because otherwise it would all be you know this would all be the
[02:03:00.880 --> 02:03:06.560]   same if it wasn't decimated so it's decimated it down to um what it thinks it needs for the for the
[02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:19.440]   detail anyway very cool Andy and Ako is apparently an RSS queen go ahead i've just i'm i've i've been
[02:03:19.440 --> 02:03:25.680]   re looking at some workflows i've been doing obviously a lot of my work is keeping on top of like so
[02:03:25.680 --> 02:03:31.280]   many like feeds and sources to just in the morning find out that what how is my how is my afternoon
[02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:35.760]   going to be disrupted by the fact that oh something new happened that's totally throughout
[02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:40.240]   three weeks worth of research and work and i have to talk about it in five hours and so i've been
[02:03:40.240 --> 02:03:48.160]   re-evaluating my RSS feed readers and so i have two picks one is sort of a re-validation of one of
[02:03:48.160 --> 02:03:55.200]   my favorite iOS apps one of my favorite ipad apps reader reader reed er it is it's one of those
[02:03:55.200 --> 02:04:01.200]   apps that justifies having a really nice ipad because it will just paste in the url or whatever
[02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:06.080]   website you want to you want to get the feed from if there are syndication feeds from it it will
[02:04:06.080 --> 02:04:10.880]   find them make it very easy to say here there we found five feeds which ones do you want to subscribe
[02:04:10.880 --> 02:04:15.520]   to and what folders do you want to put them in to organize them inside inside the reader makes it
[02:04:15.520 --> 02:04:23.680]   so easy to quickly go through like every morning i'm my eyeballs are on about 500 at least stories
[02:04:23.680 --> 02:04:29.040]   every morning it makes it really really quickly to go between level one meaning here's a headline
[02:04:29.040 --> 02:04:33.840]   about some sort of a business deal that i don't care about scroll scroll scroll oh here's a headline
[02:04:33.840 --> 02:04:40.080]   about some sort of technology about uh uh in non-invasive blood pressure reading like i actually want
[02:04:40.080 --> 02:04:44.000]   to see what that's about and seeing like the first paragraph and then realize that yeah actually
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:49.280]   that is something interesting then going to the actual article itself to read the entire article
[02:04:49.280 --> 02:04:53.520]   and then level five which is oh this is so valuable that i want to like highlight this as
[02:04:53.520 --> 02:04:58.160]   something in the afternoon i really want to dig down to and take notes on and so then putting it into
[02:04:58.160 --> 02:05:04.080]   whatever my bookmarks manager is whatever my pocket reader is even exporting it as a pdf
[02:05:04.080 --> 02:05:10.000]   integrates with a whole bunch of other services but on top of everything else the it the iOS the ipad
[02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:15.840]   version works in such great harmony with the mac version uh always sinking through i cloud so it
[02:05:15.840 --> 02:05:20.560]   really is almost exactly the same experience but it is such a comfortable experience for
[02:05:20.560 --> 02:05:24.000]   again in the morning i'm sitting in i'm sitting on the sofa i'm just tapping and scrolling tapping
[02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:28.560]   and scrolling tapping and scrolling i'm not yet at my sitting upright using my spine and my back
[02:05:28.560 --> 02:05:33.360]   muscles and actually typing and working mode um the other recommendation was i was also i also
[02:05:33.360 --> 02:05:39.280]   took the event the opportunity to look at other like web total total web based readers uh and i
[02:05:39.280 --> 02:05:47.360]   kind of i found out about i know reader i-n-o-r-e-a-d-e-r uh which is an improvement on on feedley
[02:05:47.360 --> 02:05:54.240]   which was my my current service because um it has a free tier so you can test it out very very
[02:05:54.240 --> 02:05:58.800]   easily makes it very very easy to ingest whatever your subscriptions are from feedley or wherever
[02:05:58.800 --> 02:06:05.280]   else but i like the fact that it has a lot more powerful features for taking those 600 uh 600
[02:06:05.280 --> 02:06:11.200]   news articles in the morning and automatically like bubbling some up to the top based on search
[02:06:11.200 --> 02:06:15.920]   criteria based on conditions based on authors uh sending you alerts that hey something just came
[02:06:15.920 --> 02:06:19.600]   across you we actually want to take a take a look at right now haven't really played that much
[02:06:19.600 --> 02:06:25.440]   with them that far i've tried a couple of different things i i imagine that if i were using this for
[02:06:25.440 --> 02:06:30.880]   another couple of months by the time we get into like jr. july a lot of the time that i spend
[02:06:30.880 --> 02:06:36.880]   glancing at stuff that i'm not interested in will be replaced uh by always having my attention
[02:06:36.880 --> 02:06:40.720]   focused on the really really cool stuff uh they have a lot of different membership levels uh the
[02:06:40.720 --> 02:06:47.200]   free tiers like a hundred feeds and not all the features for something like twenty dollars a year
[02:06:47.200 --> 02:06:53.520]   you get the remove the ads they give you a couple extra features the the premium version is the
[02:06:53.520 --> 02:06:58.480]   pro which is like eight bucks a month uh that that's where you get like all these like
[02:06:58.480 --> 02:07:03.920]   roll your own like alerts roll your own like uh uh priorities your own stuff that gets pinned to the
[02:07:03.920 --> 02:07:09.360]   top uh i i don't like it enough the the where the only place where it kind of falls apart for me is
[02:07:09.360 --> 02:07:15.600]   the desktop reader excuse me and the device reader aren't nearly as good as reader our ador
[02:07:15.600 --> 02:07:22.560]   and that is reader is such a beautiful targeted to ios targeted to touch uh it's not designed to
[02:07:22.560 --> 02:07:26.320]   be well we have to have an interface that will work well on a website has to work well on all
[02:07:26.320 --> 02:07:31.360]   these other different targets i just i just really enjoy using readers that's always going to be the
[02:07:31.360 --> 02:07:36.960]   the focus of my reading but uh it is it is a great tool i think a lot of people forget that RSS
[02:07:36.960 --> 02:07:41.680]   like site situation is an actual thing and the reason why they don't like wind up spending a
[02:07:41.680 --> 02:07:45.680]   lot of time just covering a lot of different sources and getting a lot of different sources
[02:07:45.680 --> 02:07:50.480]   from different information is because it's just so hard to manage all that sort of stuff but
[02:07:50.480 --> 02:07:54.000]   it'll take you a while to get into it but eventually with a good app like reader
[02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:58.160]   you will find yourself not getting overblown by information but just casting a wider net and
[02:07:58.160 --> 02:08:04.080]   getting more treasure yeah i'm in actually a paid subscriber to in our reader ever since
[02:08:04.080 --> 02:08:09.360]   google reader kind of went away because it's it's very handy for me i as like you i'm always
[02:08:09.360 --> 02:08:16.160]   scanning through uh stories this is my tech news feed and um all i have to do is a star a story
[02:08:16.160 --> 02:08:20.880]   and automatically goes to our pin board so this is a very fast way to do story triage
[02:08:20.880 --> 02:08:24.880]   for me this is one of many modes this is kind of the magazine
[02:08:24.880 --> 02:08:30.640]   of you but they have a lot of different views yeah i think this is a i agree reader is much more mac
[02:08:30.640 --> 02:08:37.600]   you know more appily but uh sometimes just the web i need the web because i use a variety of tools
[02:08:37.600 --> 02:08:43.440]   that's that's what disappoints me it reader does interface with feedley so what i've been using
[02:08:43.440 --> 02:08:47.440]   i've been i've been trying to figure out a better way to integrate those two because
[02:08:47.440 --> 02:08:51.280]   i still i still have a chrome book i still use it for a lot of stuff there's still and there are
[02:08:51.280 --> 02:08:57.520]   times where i'm just not in front of a mac or or an iowice device so i i'm trying to make that a little
[02:08:57.520 --> 02:09:03.120]   bit a little bit less friction between going between those two surfaces but like i said the
[02:09:03.120 --> 02:09:08.880]   experience of of reading on an ipad with reader is so i really i really want to keep that as the
[02:09:08.880 --> 02:09:14.720]   the center my experience i think you're right absolutely two very good choices thank you Andrew
[02:09:14.720 --> 02:09:22.880]   andi and akko is on wgph in boston every week friday this week friday 1230 go to wwgph news.org i
[02:09:22.880 --> 02:09:28.880]   will not be in the library but uh you go to that site to either stream it live or listen to it later
[02:09:28.880 --> 02:09:38.800]   or any of these past shows i've done every week i hnatko.com soon to be revitalized looking looking
[02:09:38.800 --> 02:09:43.760]   to install the pipeline between people's wallets and my bank account that's a long pipeline
[02:09:43.760 --> 02:09:51.200]   that's a good pipeline keep that pipeline flowing uh that's what we have club twit for
[02:09:51.200 --> 02:09:59.520]   also mr. allix lindsay office hours dot global is the place to go every morning and really all day
[02:09:59.520 --> 02:10:04.720]   long for information about well it's almost impossible to categorize it started about
[02:10:04.720 --> 02:10:08.880]   being about streaming stuff and production but now it's every so much yeah we're just
[02:10:08.880 --> 02:10:15.760]   wandering around we spent an hour on friday last friday talking about gaff tape you're kidding
[02:10:15.760 --> 02:10:20.080]   no no we like if you don't think we can spend an hour talking about gaff to someone ask you do
[02:10:20.080 --> 02:10:23.600]   you think you can spend an hour about cable management i'm like we just spent an hour talking about gaff
[02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:29.200]   tape we can take and the title we spent an hour talking about crafty on sticky issues yes so
[02:10:29.840 --> 02:10:36.480]   it's uh and and the um uh today we talked about iphone actually phone well phone but it really
[02:10:36.480 --> 02:10:40.400]   became an iphone discussion about phones in production like how we use phones in production
[02:10:40.400 --> 02:10:45.520]   and how you can build content and rigs that we use and that type of thing and then um tomorrow
[02:10:45.520 --> 02:10:48.800]   we're actually talking about the app that i just showed and so the photogrammetry stuff is
[02:10:48.800 --> 02:10:52.960]   stuff we're going to cover um this and many other apps this is just one of the things that we're
[02:10:52.960 --> 02:10:57.440]   going to talk about but how photogrammetry really works and so on so forth and we'll have a discussion
