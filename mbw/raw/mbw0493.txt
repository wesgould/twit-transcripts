[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   I got a frog in my throat. I'm not sure why.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Andy Enocho is here from the Chicago set times.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Hello, Ann.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Hello, Leo. Is that the frog that makes you say bad words, Leo?
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   It might be.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Do we need to tell that frog that we are going to a large audience today and that we're going to use our inside, not angry words?
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Bad little frog.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   You keep quiet inside Leo's mouth in the next hour and a half.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Yes, no. The frog is gone now. We've exercised it.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   There you go.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Also here with us from where? Where are you in Pittsburgh? Where are you in Washington, DC?
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Coming to you all the way from San Rafael.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   You're home.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   No, we're doing a final cut user group two o'clock and I didn't think I could do the show and then get back here in time to do the final cut user group.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Because we used to do it next to you in the brick house.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   I figured I better just do it.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   And then I thought I'd have this all set up and I ran out of runway.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   That's good. We're good. We're good.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   We're kind of a green screen.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   We're good. It'll be great next week.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   You look great. It doesn't matter. Nobody watches this show anyway. It's audio.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   What do I sound good then?
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   You sound fantastic.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Why are they?
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Thank you.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Also joining us from Montreal, Mr. Renee Ritchie, that I'm more.com.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Hello, Leo.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Hello, Leo.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   I enjoy seeing Alex's green screen quite frankly.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   I know.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   I like to see the behind the curtain.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Let me tell you, there was a lot of drama around the green screen.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   It took a like it didn't come out quite the way we wanted it.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   The guys worked on it and then we brought a painter in to do it.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   And you have to use, we plastered it to make sure it was nice and smooth.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   And then we added two coats of white and then we added the thing and it still got little bits of, you know, it was, it turned out to be more drama than I expected.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Alex, do you ever go for the double bluff?
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Where you be sitting in front of a green screen and what you insert is video of another green screen?
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   I love doing that.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   It looks like you're sitting in front of a green screen, but you're actually sitting into a composite of a photo of a green screen.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   I like to take it and I like to key myself out of the green screen and put myself into in front of a blue screen.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   That really throws me off.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Well, then I think if you wear a blue shirt like this and I have a green screen when I'm actually doing the keen, I can actually change the color of my shirt.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Nice.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   You nearly talked me into buying like that 70 inch monitor as my background, but I did decide that if I ever do get that for like the first six shows, it will just be a photo of this slightly wrinkled background.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Oh, yeah, that's absolutely what you have to do.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   And you and I would be the only people who know that.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Right.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Until there's like a glitch in the matrix during the middle of a show that I engineer.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Do you flip somebody flip the switch? Your screen is now keyed out, Alex.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   You're sitting in a black background.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Oh, somebody flip the switch things.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Oh, well, somebody on the Charlie Rose set all of a sudden.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   You know, I didn't realize that I should have just pulled this out of the new guys could do the key, you know, on your side.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Oh, yeah, I don't have to think about it.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Yeah, we could do it. We could put anything behind you.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Maybe one of the commercial breaks, I'll pull it out.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   You pull out the TV and let's get a picture of the Taj Mahal.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Hold on.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   We can say Alex Lindsey reporting from.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   From.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Should I pull it out right now? Yeah, go ahead.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Well, we're doing that. I will.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   I will mention that we had our own.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   We here in the United States, we have our own gray cup.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Well, please.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   It's a little football game.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   You need four downs, right? Is that true?
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Yes.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   You four downs together.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   You don't play it quite right, but we manage somehow to survive.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   The NFL has its little game called the Super Bowl and they had it on Sunday.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Tim Cook was there. He had good seats.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   He didn't have a great camera though.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   He's kind of getting ribbed because he posted a fairly blurry picture.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   That wasn't well thought out.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Using this iPhone 6s plus.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   So here's a good tweet from Andy Coe. So did you boy tell him shot on iPhone 6?
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   It's the new campaign with a blurry picture.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Optical image stabilization does not get up to a CEO jumping up and down rapidly in his seat yelling.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   I think you know what? I think a linebacker nudged him because he then posted another one that was crystal clear.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   And pulled this one down, by the way. So don't go looking for it on his feed.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   Somebody's like this mission control somewhere.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   Someone in the Apple tower is going. Oh no, that a blurry picture alert alert.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Alert alert alert.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   It's kind of silly.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   It also shows that Google social media game is not on point because they should have had, well of course if you had one of the Nexus 6 P phones with its larger pixels, that doesn't even need optical image stabilization because it's super fast lens can Google for a much shorter shutter speed.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   I think everyone's all over everybody else.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   I think it was probably wise not to do the Schadenfreude thing because you don't want to invite you.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   And then Larry Page posts a picture and it's all over.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   So, you know, these things happen.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Every camera can take a crappy picture.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Even the iPhone.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   It's not the camera.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   It's the photographer.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Yeah, you take 13 carefully lit selfies and then you hate all of them.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   You take another 30 and then you try to find one with a lot of image manipulation.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Looks like it's a normal person.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   And then you post that one.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   That's why I love photography.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   It's like baking cookies.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   They see the perfect 12 chocolate chip round cookies that you put in the basket.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.720]   They don't see the 40 that were half brown and half black and half lumpy and you have
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.000]   fat for the basket.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.240]   And I often thought when I really got into photography that one of the big things, one
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:31.000]   of the big differences between someone who's a professional and someone who was an amateur
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   for a while was just that they took a lot more photos.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   I mean, you know, there's definitely, you know, the, you get the response.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   You get to figure out what you're doing right and wrong.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   So, but, but taking a lot of photos turns out to be a big piece of moving.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   And in fact, when we started doing it, it was all film.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   So it was really expensive.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   I interviewed a couple of weeks ago on triangulation Vincent LaFoure.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   And I know you know, wow, great photographer.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   I love him.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   And he said really as a professional photographer and he's world famous takes amazing images.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   He's also now a director.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   It does a lot of video commercials and stuff.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   He said the downside to everybody having great cameras and even in their smartphone and taking
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   lots of pictures and amateurs becoming so good is in order to, you know, rise above the noise,
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   you have to take not, not exceptionally good pictures.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   The technology doesn't have, it's, it's, you have to take, you have to find amazing, unusual.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   You have to go the extra mile to get a weird shot basically.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   And his latest book is of aerial shots.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   He actually, I think he won't say because I think he's not allowed to.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   But I'm pretty sure he collaborated with, if not shot, Apple's beautiful screensaver for
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   the Apple TV, the new Apple TV, the very slow motion aerial shots.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   And he has a book of beautiful aerial shots.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   And he said, you know, now you have to rent a helicopter and go in the air because there's
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   so, you know, and I feel the kind of the same way.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Like, where do you take another picture of the Eiffel Tower?
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   Can you say something that hasn't been said yet?
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   That's going to be an interesting challenge.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Anyway, Tim.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   It's why the selfie Leo, yeah, selfie is so popular because it's unique.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   It's actually why I like to take, um, do people picture street photography and stuff because
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   those are always unique and people are always interesting.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   But this is Tim's second picture from the Super Bowl and a lot crisper.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   And I think it's interesting.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   Both were a square aspect ratio.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   Now the phone will do that.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   But I wonder why he chose that or is that a Twitter thing?
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   Maybe Twitter was cropping it.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   I don't know.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   Did he take?
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   I would be surprised if he didn't take the opportunity to post any motion photos.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   Oh, that wonderful picture.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   Oh, he did on China on the Chinese side.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   Weibo.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Oh, it does.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   It will support the live photo feature.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   They shipped it before Twitter.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   Wow.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   Not really a surprise.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   Twitter's developers are just sitting in their corner shaking.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   Wow.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   Does Facebook support live photo?
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   They do, but it's sort of like a lot of the stuff that they're supporting in, like Instagram
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   now, they roll it out to a percentage of small percentage on an ongoing basis.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   So you should have it.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.960]   And they also, they made it maddening because when you go to add a photo, there's a tiny
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:26.960]   icon in the bottom right that has, that shows live photo turned off and you have to tap it
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.560]   to turn it on before you post.
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.960]   Otherwise, regardless if it's a live photo, now it's going to put off the static image.
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:35.240]   So you got to like go through this process and first you got to find the live photo,
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.400]   which Apple doesn't make easy.
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.920]   And then you've got to turn it on before you post it to Facebook.
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:40.920]   So it's a double Emmy.
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:41.920]   Yeah.
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:48.440]   It's too bad that they haven't, I'm using a similar feature on the new Nexus phones,
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:52.960]   which all it does is it will capture, it captures a burst.
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.600]   Not only does it say, okay, of this burst here, the eight that we think are the best.
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:00.040]   And here, you can now choose to write them or not write them, but we'll also just simply
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.040]   write them also as an animated GIF.
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:09.000]   And it's like, that would have been nice given that animated GIF or GIFs are pretty
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   much everywhere.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.680]   It's a standard understood format.
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.640]   You can get a third party app that'll do that.
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:14.640]   I'll file that right.
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:15.640]   Yeah, but nice.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.080]   But it's not as nice as just.
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.080]   I agree.
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.080]   Like post done.
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.080]   Yep.
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.360]   Well, Samsung vivid photos will fix everything.
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.360]   We'll get that in a couple of weeks.
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.360]   And then we'll all be happy.
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.360]   Yeah.
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:29.600]   Cause Samsung and they're having their event on the 21st, which is a, oh, look, Alex Lindsey's
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.600]   relocated himself the touch.
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.600]   You know, it's, it's important.
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.520]   You know, I felt like the bandwidth here in the Toss, Mahal is actually much better than
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:38.520]   I expected.
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:39.520]   It's looks like a very sunny day.
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:40.520]   Beautiful day.
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:41.520]   Yeah.
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.800]   I'm afraid I'm gonna get burned, but, but I'm taking one.
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:47.360]   You know, it's you can see the lot of, a lot of sunlight here, but.
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:47.880]   Wow.
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:55.600]   Tim did have a town hall right before the Super Bowl and Mark Gurman at nine to five
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.280]   Mac got the story.
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:01.480]   And it was kind of after their earnings announcement.
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.320]   I wish we they would broadcast this stuff.
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:06.240]   It's an all Wednesday at nine a.m. right after the earnings call.
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.240]   I happen to be at the hotel across the street.
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.240]   Oh, did you see people filing in?
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.160]   There was a lot of activity.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.160]   It was a lot of fun.
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:14.160]   I don't think everybody went there live.
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.160]   They could, they could log in remotely to watch it.
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.160]   Right.
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:21.960]   And it actually looks like a keynote, you know, like he's got big screen behind him and he's
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:22.960]   presenting.
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:23.960]   He's got a.
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.440]   I think that's not, I think that's a picture from a keynote.
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.440]   Oh, that is a keynote.
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:27.440]   Oh, okay.
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:28.440]   Oh, okay.
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.440]   That's too bad.
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:30.440]   I guess they probably didn't sneak pictures out of the town hall.
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:31.440]   Town Hall's pretty cool.
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.440]   Yeah.
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.440]   One town.
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.440]   One town.
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.240]   Most of these companies do town halls after their quarterlies.
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.240]   Right.
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.240]   It's just something this one.
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:42.040]   You wouldn't do an app in all hands and get everybody and say, here's what's going on.
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:47.120]   They introduce the new chief operating officer, Jeff Williams.
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:50.760]   I answered questions from the audience.
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:55.320]   According to Mark, attempting to reduce concerns related to the company's iPhone dependence,
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:59.320]   discussing porting more Apple services to Android.
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.640]   Growth in India.
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.080]   That's why Alex is there, I believe.
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.880]   And releasing cheaper iPhones.
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.120]   Oh, he's moved.
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.120]   Where is he now?
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.120]   He's in the library.
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.600]   With the fossil soon.
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.600]   Come.
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.880]   And the candlestick.
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:22.240]   But soon I will be in the kitchen with that Miss Scarlett.
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.440]   Oh, I swear.
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:28.000]   Your dad's made their tongues.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.640]   Wagon all about you too.
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:36.440]   You got no secrets from the staff, Mr. He said that Apple sold enough iPhones in their
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:42.840]   holiday quarter, 78 point, 74.8 million units to cover the population.
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:47.800]   They're not sure if he means cover, like to put one in everybody's hand or actually
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.080]   like bury them.
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.800]   Like a blanker, of course.
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:52.800]   It's a lot.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:53.800]   It's a lot.
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:54.800]   I prefer Apple.
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:58.000]   We could just bury you in iPhone vests for everybody.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   Yes.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.120]   Yes, the scot-born iPhone vest.
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:07.000]   He did say that the Apple Watch was one of the hottest holiday gifts, his hottest hot
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   selling.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.840]   And he claimed the sales of the device exceeded those of the original iPhone on its first
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.720]   holiday quarter.
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:15.920]   That's not really saying much.
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:19.120]   First iPhone took I think a year to get to a million sales, right?
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.120]   It took a while.
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.080]   Also, it was only available on AT&T.
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.080]   Right.
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:24.080]   Yeah.
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.080]   Mm.
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:28.600]   He says he expects iPad revenue growth to return by the end of 2016.
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:35.240]   That must mean they're bullish both on the iPad Pro and the features of this new iPad that
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.960]   might and might or might not come out in March.
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:41.960]   I have to admit, I was kind of surprised that, you know, they're talking about the iPad
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.880]   air possibly being released.
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:48.280]   And I feel like I would want either the mini or the Pro.
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.800]   I don't know if I'm not excited about the air anymore.
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.480]   I think if the air, we talked about this last week, you weren't here.
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.560]   I think if the air had a pencil.
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:56.560]   Yeah.
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.400]   Well, I think if the mini had a pencil, I'd be happy.
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:03.880]   You know, I would actually prefer the mini with a pencil.
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:06.880]   I was all excited about the Pro because it had a pencil.
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:07.880]   Right.
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.600]   You know, the size of it is still a little bit much for me, you know, to carry around
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:15.320]   as I would much rather have a mini with the fingerprint and the pencil.
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:17.520]   I'd be, I think I'd be done.
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:20.120]   How is pencil availability these days?
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.040]   Do we know better?
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:23.040]   Very good.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.720]   You can go to a store and get one.
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:28.800]   Yeah, I went into a couple stores last week and I was asking around and both of them had
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:29.800]   had stock.
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:30.800]   I've also been here.
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:33.840]   I haven't checked the Apple store in a while, but people are telling me that they've been
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:35.080]   able to get immediate delivery.
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.080]   Hey, good.
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.080]   I'm freeze framing on.
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.080]   Actually, I think you do.
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:43.160]   Is this a is this related to your Trek bicycle?
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.160]   Is wound on your hand?
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.840]   Oh, were you hanging out with Jimmy Fallon?
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.800]   I had a I had a small shot.
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.120]   No, no, I was sober.
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:56.720]   There was I had my first biking related injury to make me feel like a badass, even though
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:57.720]   it was like the silliest thing.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:00.440]   I love this shot because you could be talking.
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:01.440]   Exactly.
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:06.400]   As a matter of fact, you could like translate me into German right now and no one would be
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.920]   any the wiser and people who are not watching the video.
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.880]   I said the I said the wrong thing to be in the show because I said you don't need video
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:16.440]   and then we're talking about Alex being in Abu Dhabi and then yeah, so he's so for those
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:21.320]   who are listening and he's frozen with his hand over his mouth and it's really great because
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:24.400]   you could actually just continue to talk and we wouldn't know.
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.040]   Oh, good heavens.
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:31.040]   Well before before we hang up and fall back, I'll just put a crowbar to say the oh the
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:35.480]   the one thing that I didn't anticipate needing on the bike was a kickstand.
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:40.600]   Oh, yeah, and so basically I was I was taking it out of the rack and I was it was like
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:45.000]   started to tip over and I just reached out to grab it to keep it from tipping over and
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.560]   then the bike like pulled me over and I went and on my on my knuckles.
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:48.560]   Oh, wow.
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.280]   So it was like nothing nothing broken.
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.040]   It's just have this like scab on the.
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.040]   Yeah, I've been.
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.600]   Yeah, I've done that.
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:59.080]   I've done that before, but I'm telling people that I had to some bikers were saying on
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:03.360]   gentlemanly things towards towards a lady and I had to step in and much better.
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.360]   Correct.
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:05.860]   Much better story.
[00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:06.860]   You know, it's funny.
[00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:10.400]   Lisa mocks me because I didn't get a kickstand on my bicycle either.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:13.640]   Yeah, I get when I got when I got home, I washed off the blood.
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:18.080]   I applied some back to you and then I want to when on Amazon and I ordered a kickstand.
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:20.880]   They are easily easily self-installed.
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.720]   Let's take a break while we get Andy because he we've just lost him now.
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:26.840]   Well, we get Andy back click in the middle of it.
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.880]   We're talking Mac and we have lots of Apple news.
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:33.200]   I just I had to start with that blurry photo just because I thought, you know, it's timely,
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:37.000]   but Alex Lindsay's here from could be anywhere.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   We'll find out where he is now.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.680]   He's in the kitchen.
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.640]   It's a nice kitchen.
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.760]   I actually would like to keep this kitchen.
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.880]   It's a very sunny day.
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.680]   This is my kind of kitchen.
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:53.960]   Yeah, call Pixel core your home improvement pros call for free estimate.
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:58.480]   I've been thinking that maybe we should we're, you know, we're moving.
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:59.960]   We're going to have to move to a new studio.
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:01.560]   We've been looking at spaces.
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:10.160]   I posted the latest the one that we were hoping to get fell through after an 80 page lease
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.560]   that we couldn't really come to any agreement on.
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:19.040]   So we're looking at a new place, which actually I prefer because it's a completely wide open.
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:22.240]   It doesn't have any anything in it.
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:28.440]   It's just an empty place that we could put our anything into and a barn.
[00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:33.600]   No, it's just a tilt up, you know, industrial thing.
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:34.600]   But we'd like to write John.
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:37.720]   I mean, because it's a blanks, a blank canvas.
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:42.880]   But what I was thinking is now that I look at this, we should probably just put green
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:43.880]   screen.
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:44.880]   Yes.
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:48.560]   In and we could be in the kitchen or it's pretty cool.
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.880]   There are there are many sets that you know, that do that.
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:55.400]   So the challenge is really, if you're not going to move the cameras, you can actually
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:56.400]   get away with it pretty easily.
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.400]   We don't.
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:58.600]   I know you don't move the cameras.
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.720]   You know, we could even do is film video.
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:05.080]   We did this when we did the first TV show for Ziff Davis back in the day.
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:08.800]   We'd shot it at Apple, Apple, the old Apple TV in Cupertino.
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:14.400]   And they went to a spree to Suzy Tomkins office and they just made a high quality video for
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.080]   about half an hour.
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.400]   You said the leaves are blowing.
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.800]   It's an empty office.
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:23.120]   And then Gina Smith and I were sitting and Jim Latterbeck were sitting on chairs in front
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:27.080]   of a green screen and they put that back and it looked like we were in a real place because
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.800]   it wasn't it was moving.
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:33.960]   Well, and if you match the focal lengths and everything else fairly well, you can get
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:34.960]   away with it.
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:39.640]   The big challenge is that is that you every angle, you have to think about all the angles
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:43.480]   you might use and then you shoot things that are for that angle.
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:47.680]   You know, because, you know, you don't want this to happen.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:48.680]   Exactly.
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:49.680]   Exactly.
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.680]   That is.
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:52.920]   There's a camera moves.
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:56.320]   That's really weird because you move in perspective.
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.320]   The background is not.
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.320]   But we've done a lot of stuff.
[00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:03.840]   We do a fair bit of work where we put, you know, an executive at a conference when they're
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:04.840]   not.
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:08.120]   But you want to look like it's from their office, but they don't want us to sit up there.
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:09.120]   Right.
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:14.320]   So we go in and shoot some video from there from there from there at their corporation,
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:15.760]   you know, with people walking by and everything else.
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.280]   But you shoot it with the exact same camera, same height, same focal length.
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.480]   And then you put it behind them and no one knows.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:23.480]   I mean, everyone thinks that they're just sitting in a little bit of a cafeteria.
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:28.320]   But I think the TriCaster has built in a lot of automated features like having a different
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:31.480]   background for each camera angle and things like that.
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:32.480]   It does.
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:35.480]   It's doing the king and it does a very good job for real time.
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:38.200]   King, certainly I could do a weather forecast.
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.400]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.920]   I think it's reasonably good.
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:45.120]   I always wanted to do an internet weather forecast on this network.
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:49.400]   Like ever, you know, I wanted to do it on tech TV originally, like we'd break in the
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:50.400]   internet traffic report.
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:56.800]   When it's a little bit slow on May West, but may East is at full, full speed, full capacity.
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:57.800]   There's a record.
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:03.280]   It should be for the point of view of excuses that will definitely play.
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:06.840]   You should be able to say that Gmail is still getting through just fine.
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:14.240]   However, there is a Verizon partial router failure in the upper Washington state area.
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:19.040]   So if you're a file is your provider, I would so just to have people say that you do have
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:21.120]   a two hour to three hour delay for mail.
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:27.720]   We're going to Captain Andy up in the Twitter helicopter looking down over the interconnect
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:28.720]   in Michigan.
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:29.720]   What is it like?
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:30.720]   It's like a turkey.
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:31.720]   It's on fire.
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.520]   It's on fire.
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:36.800]   All right, let's take a break.
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:39.880]   We'll come back with more more silliness.
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.480]   I showed today brought to you by texture.
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:46.200]   I've flown with Alex Lindsey and I was I was actually really impressed because Alex before
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:51.120]   we got on the plane, he would go to the airport magazine store and he'd buy the economist
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:56.120]   just stock up have a like a stack of magazines because that was your reading time and all
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:56.960]   of that's well and good.
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:01.440]   But then when you leave the pile on the plane, what do you do?
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.440]   I just love them.
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:06.800]   I was like, that was from my travels and then I get one or two magazines with three magazines,
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:08.240]   read them and then I get to the other end.
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.240]   I'll be looking at them with that.
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:11.520]   I love it.
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:16.080]   But now we've got a better way, which is all the magazines on your iPad or here.
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:22.120]   iPhone, all the best magazines and you just it's like Netflix for magazines.
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.720]   You pay one monthly fee and you get everything.
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:29.200]   And the truth is there is usually in many magazines, one or two articles every month
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.040]   I want to read.
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:35.880]   So there's you know, there's always almost always a wired article I want to read.
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:38.880]   There's almost always a article in Vanity Fair.
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:43.640]   I want to read Rolling Stone, but I want to subscribe and it's really ridiculously expensive
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:46.040]   if you just buy that issue in the newsstand.
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:51.160]   Not to mention the clutter on your coffee table or in the airplane seat when you leave.
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.520]   This is such a good solution.
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:53.800]   You can download them.
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:57.440]   It will actually keep your you say, I want to get the latest edition of this and this
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.440]   and this and this every week.
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.440]   And it'll automatically have that on there.
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:04.840]   It has past issues as well as the one on the newsstands today.
[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:08.680]   And because you can download it, you could do it offline.
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:13.320]   Basically you've got all the magazines on your iPad from Melon's health, to Men's Fitness,
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:18.800]   the EQ, the Esquire Forbes or Fortune, National Geographic.
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:21.720]   I love photography, so popular photography, Shutterbug.
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:27.520]   If you're interested in high-fi audio, sound and vision, PC Magazine and Mac world are there
[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:28.520]   too.
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:29.720]   It's really kind of remarkable.
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:30.720]   And you know what?
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:36.560]   Every once in a while I have a handker in to find out what's going on in the world of entertainment
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:41.520]   and entertainment weeklies in there too, as well as people and us.
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.800]   I like to read the gossip magazines too.
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:47.440]   Texture.com/MacBreak, you can try it for free right now.
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:48.880]   And it's just like the magazine.
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:51.880]   You click the headlines on the cover page, it takes you right to the article.
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.680]   Actually, it's not just like is it?
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:54.920]   But all the pages are there.
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:55.920]   You don't miss anything.
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.160]   You can page through it if you want.
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:02.320]   There's also bonus features you can't get in a magazine like video.
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:07.800]   They have a curated collection feature that lets you dive deeper into particular topics.
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:10.400]   They have an editorial team that recommends daily stories.
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.680]   You never will run out of great stuff to read.
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:17.680]   And for a fraction of the price, that would cost you the grocery store.
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:21.720]   Buy three magazines once a month at the grocery store you're spending more than a subscription
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:22.720]   to Texture.
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.200]   Go to Tech, they have two plans.

[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:34.640]   Go to texture.com/MacBreak right now though and you get the premium plan.

[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.200]   It's really a great idea.
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:48.240]   And it makes you feel like you also don't wind up stinking like perfume.
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.280]   Like eight different kinds of perfume.
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:53.240]   Do they still blow in perfume into women's magazines?
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.240]   That's just terrible.
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.240]   I hate that.
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:58.120]   Oh, so some weeks, that's the only reason why I don't smell like three days of writer
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:59.120]   fun.
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:00.120]   Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:01.120]   You're glad.
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:02.120]   Thank God.
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:03.760]   Glamour Magazine came just in the nick of time.
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:08.040]   Yeah, you know, little GQ Magazine just take that little piece of paper and you scrape it
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:09.040]   up.
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.080]   Ah, you're moving down the peninsula now.
[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:14.400]   He's you know, I figured I was in Cupertino at one infinite loop.
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.360]   Well, then I did this teleportation engine works.
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:17.360]   I can.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.760]   Yeah, I can jump to Apple.
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:20.880]   He's on the space station.
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:21.880]   Oh my gosh.
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.360]   Say hi to Commander Kelly.
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.160]   Oh, well.
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:34.760]   Okay, now you have to download the video.
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.400]   He's floating in space.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:39.000]   You do wait list very well, Alex.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.640]   Actually, no, that's that's that's not quite what I see.
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:48.120]   I usually see them like you see a shot like this more like Alex and he's yeah.
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:49.120]   Yeah.
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:52.560]   Well, Commander Kelly has been there for almost a year now.
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:54.880]   333 days, something like that.
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.600]   And he looks very buff.
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.640]   Yeah, he'll be coming back.
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:01.120]   But I feel like, oh man, you've been lifting.
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:04.120]   And then I realize, you know, that's probably a demo from the lack of gravity.
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:05.120]   Yeah.
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:08.120]   He's just a Michelin man up there.
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:11.400]   The one thing I can't do is every time we've done a couple of events with the space station
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:14.760]   and every time someone asks, are you really in the space station that they just do the
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:15.760]   slow flip?
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:18.080]   Yeah, they always kind of hard to do that on a wire.
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:19.080]   Yeah, I can't.
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:20.080]   I can't quite.
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:21.080]   Yeah, they're like, they're like, do this.
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:26.440]   Sitting there, we were doing one with the crew of Star Trek and they, and he's just like
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:28.320]   talking to them and he's just spinning the mic.
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:31.200]   You know, like when he's not talking, when he's listening for them, there we go.
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.960]   You kind of get used to it, don't you?
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:33.960]   They're showing off.
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:34.960]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:35.960]   Yeah.
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:38.400]   You know, like spinning the mic, but like letting it go and then just like rolling in
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:41.600]   front of you barf your, you barf your guts out for the first two weeks and then it's
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:45.160]   like, yeah, it seems like it'd be kind of fun.
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:46.840]   You just kind of go everywhere.
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:47.840]   Yeah.
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:48.840]   Yeah.
[00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:53.280]   And did you see the Colbert show right after the Super Bowl where he actually goes to says
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:54.600]   a lot of command and Kelly?
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:55.600]   Oh, yep.
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:56.600]   Yep.
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:57.600]   That's pretty cool.
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.520]   Yeah, that's pretty cool.
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:03.480]   They had him at Kelly as a guest like two weeks earlier or something that must have been when
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:04.720]   they pre-caped it.
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:09.280]   But yeah, that's that's like Kelly, particularly it's like every single, every single time.
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:13.040]   So it's bad as I made it sound, but it's so it's, he's always like got his arms crossed
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:18.120]   and he's just like his shoulders are a little bit up and say, well, well, Steven, I'm just
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:24.160]   glad for this opportunity to share some of the involvement here at on crew 68 of the
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.600]   International Space Station.
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:26.600]   Yeah.
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:30.600]   The, what I noticed he did does is he sticks his feet.
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:34.920]   There's a, there are bars under, you know, all the way down and he could stick his feet
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:37.480]   out of there and hold and hold on.
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:41.560]   And that's how he keeps just kind of drifting away during the interview.
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:46.640]   We should mention Edgar Mitchell, one of the men who walked on the moon passed away this
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.000]   past week.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   And then as long as we're talking Super Bowl, did you see the Audi commercial?
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.360]   That was to me, I think that was my partly because it had David Bowie.
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:59.320]   There were a number of commercials with David Bowie music in it.
[00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:05.840]   In fact, the music of my generation was very much celebrated during the Super Bowl commercial.
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:09.440]   But let me see if I can find the Star Man commercial.
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:15.800]   I don't, this wasn't a real, was that a real astronaut or just someone playing one in the
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:16.800]   commercial?
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:21.720]   It's kind of a, kind of a cool tribute to the astronaut core.
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:25.320]   The premise is he's an older fella.
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:29.680]   Young, as a young man, he, he, he traveled to the moon.
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:32.840]   But now, you know, he just sits listlessly in his, in his apartment.
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:36.680]   He won't eat his meals because, well, you've been to the moon.
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:38.320]   What are you going to do?
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:41.840]   And his, and his son comes along and says, dad, come here.
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:44.240]   I got, I got something for you.
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:47.920]   And he shows him an Audi R8 and gives him the key.
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:54.240]   And suddenly, memories of his days in an astronaut come back while David Bowie appeared, the
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:56.240]   David Bowie music swelling.
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:59.840]   You know, that, that's not too arrogant, is it?
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:04.640]   I mean, one of the, one of the people who walked on the moon, but a buying a luxury
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:06.680]   school sedan is probably just as good.
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:07.680]   And then I'm an R8.
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:10.800]   He'll, dad'll feel much better.
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:11.800]   And I love them.
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:13.440]   I got to say, I love them.
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:14.880]   I thought that was a great ad.
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:15.880]   I really do.
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:17.320]   That was, that was cool.
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:18.320]   Yeah.
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:21.880]   Though the, the career of acting, being an actor must have its ups and downs.
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:27.800]   I know, but if you get one role, even if it's in a commercial where you get to wear an
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:34.040]   authentically recreated Apollo space suit and sit inside an authentically recreated command
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:39.080]   and service module or lunar module and just close your eyes and pretend for a good eight
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:40.080]   seconds.
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:44.720]   That will all the 20 years of no callbacks and having to work children's birthday parties
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:45.720]   are all worth it.
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:46.720]   Yeah.
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:47.720]   Just for, just for that.
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:50.200]   Just all I want is one photo in a space suit.
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:54.120]   That would actually be a really good attraction, you know, like to build, to build the, the
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:58.400]   module and to, and to build some suits that are different sizes, let people get into them
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:01.440]   and then give them like the radio stuff and give them, it's so fun for NASA.
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:02.840]   Wouldn't that, well, don't they have space camp?
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:03.840]   You can do that.
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:04.840]   Can't you?
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:05.840]   Yeah, but you can make it a portable thing.
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:07.840]   I want, I want fantasy camp.
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:10.040]   I want, I want, I want, especially if.
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:14.400]   If they, if they got the, they use the same plans they use to build the sets for Apollo
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:19.280]   13 and they have a special version of that, of the, that they have the commercial version
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:20.640]   of the vomit comment.
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:24.480]   How much money, I'm not sure, I'm not sure I'd spend $20 million to go to the ISS.
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:30.360]   I would definitely spend $250,000 to again, wear Apollo accurate spaces.
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:33.560]   Be in a, be in a mockup and be in zero gravity.
[00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:38.000]   Again, if it's just, I know it's a big lie, but oh boy, what a wonderful, beautiful lie.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   You just have to figure out how you're going to clean off all those crevices all the time
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.040]   for all the, you know, class cabinet.
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:47.800]   Yeah, you have three of them, you swap them out, you make sure that, remember that like,
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:49.200]   these are all mil spec switches.
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:50.880]   So you could probably hose them down.
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:55.840]   It's not like, and they don't have the operation was not like you're going to hurt the electronics.
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:32:00.000]   Lice, lice, you simply have to come on like the barber pole has to turn on when you dog.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   That's what it's stuff.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.920]   The ball needs to turn.
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:03.920]   That's all you need.
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:09.080]   Well, if Kevin, our chair says, please don't make NASA a larp event.
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:10.240]   Live action role playing.
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.840]   Hey, maybe some good news.
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:16.640]   I got a lot of people tweeted me this after my complaints about the black beautiful black
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:22.920]   trash can Mac, not really, really, you know, seeming to be very reliable.
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:23.920]   It's an AHR.
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:24.920]   It's beautiful.
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:29.520]   And by the way, it's, it's held up quite well as a Minecraft server.
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:34.120]   But I don't have a, I don't really use it with a monitor hooked up.
[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:40.120]   And apparently Apple is quietly launching a repair program for late 2013 Mac Pros.
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:45.200]   Mine would qualify for graphics card and video issues.
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:53.240]   This is Mac Pros manufactured between February 18th, February 8th, 2015.
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:54.960]   I think they have the dates wrong there.
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:55.960]   That's not right.
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:56.960]   Yeah.
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:58.720]   If it says late 2013, what does this mean?
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:32:59.720]   That's the new MacBook.
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:03.040]   It's just they call it by the model of the period of time that it was introduced.
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:07.800]   So it's the Mac, sorry, the Mac Pro that was introduced in late 2013 and on.
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:09.320]   Ah, okay.
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:13.720]   So that's the model is the late 2013, but in fact, it's only one's manufacturer.
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:16.320]   So mine's left out of the, this is not, I don't think mine.
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:17.320]   I can't remember when it was.
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:18.320]   It's not going to help us.
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:19.320]   I'd have to look.
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:23.720]   But apparently if you have one manufacturer between February 8th and April 11th of last
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:29.320]   year, you're eligible for repairs due to issues with machines, graphics cards that may cause
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:34.960]   distorted video, no video system instability, freezing, restarts, shutdowns, or may prevent
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:39.480]   system startup.
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:40.480]   So how do you get it?
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:46.600]   Well, you go to an authorized service provider with your Mac Pro and say, here look.
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:49.800]   And, and there you go.
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:54.960]   They will fix it free of charge, even though you may be out of warranty.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:59.280]   Some of you are one day out of warranty as we record this.
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:01.040]   It's not, it hasn't been publicly announced.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:06.440]   So this, I guess this bulletin, which was sent to employees and service providers was
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.440]   leaked out.
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:08.440]   And it's a small amount of people.
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:10.880]   They tend to do it directly because it stops a lot of people from worrying and suddenly
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:11.880]   pushing to apples.
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:13.080]   So I shouldn't have mentioned this.
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:15.320]   No, I mean, that's what we're here for.
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:16.320]   Right.
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:17.320]   Well, you know who you are.
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:19.080]   Just look and see when yours was manufactured.
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:21.760]   I wish they'd have had like a range of serial numbers.
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:24.520]   That would have made it a lot easier to figure out because you don't know when yours was
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:27.040]   manufactured only when you got it.
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:31.240]   Anyway, I don't, so this doesn't apply to my, but it's okay.
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:34.320]   You know what makes an excellent Minecraft server.
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:35.320]   It's just very quiet.
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:36.320]   It sits there.
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:43.920]   The cat's knocked it off the, the desk and it, I put it back and it worked.
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:44.920]   So that's good.
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:46.560]   It worked as well as it did work.
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:47.560]   It worked as well.
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:48.560]   Now, where is, where is Alex?
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:51.160]   Oh, you're in the fifth Avenue Mac Apple store.
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:52.760]   Yeah, you know, I didn't need to do a little shopping.
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:54.920]   I got a buy set at headphones.
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:58.760]   I was at the Apple store and at Cupertino and they didn't have what I needed.
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:01.320]   So you just transported up to fifth Avenue.
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.320]   Yeah.
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:03.320]   Yeah.
[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:04.320]   This machine's pretty working.
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:05.320]   Hopefully I don't lose any bits.
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:06.320]   You know, it's the only thing I'm working on.
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:07.800]   The only drawback, we haven't routed it properly.
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:13.240]   So we can't do the wide shot because it's pretty, it's apparent the, the flim flamory
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:16.440]   that we are doing doesn't work with the wide shot.
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:17.680]   But we could have made it that way.
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:19.600]   We just have to route it better.
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:22.720]   As you can see, the ISS is currently over Greenland.
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:27.800]   I'm here in the cupola.
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:30.280]   It is true.
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:33.720]   Virgil's pointing out that if you saw the right stuff, the movie, the right stuff that
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:41.560]   those early mercury astronauts all like to drive their corvettes very fast.
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:42.560]   Yeah.
[00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:44.400]   They had, they had a speech.
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:47.600]   Well, especially on like the Apollo crews, they actually had a sweetheart deal with like
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:51.360]   local dealers that would like give them kind of like a free, actually a free like one-year
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:52.360]   lease on corvettes.
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:53.360]   Sure.
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.360]   And then they get solid twice as much, right?
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:55.360]   Yeah.
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:36:03.400]   The Apollo 12 crew actually had matching corvettes with like LMP, CMP, CDR, like for commander
[00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:07.400]   painted in black and gold like the lunar lander.
[00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:09.120]   It was, it was pretty awesome.
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:13.840]   And then, but they could sell that when they get it back for premium because it was driven
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:18.280]   by an astronaut.
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:20.920]   Business Insider says the evidence is clear.
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:27.280]   I think we said this last week as well that Apple is very interested in virtual reality.
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.280]   They're staffing up.
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:31.520]   According to, you know, that's, that's pretty clear.
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:37.840]   In fact, they have created a team for augmented and virtual reality headsets.
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:42.400]   They've been building prototypes for months, according to the financial times.
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:47.720]   We've all loved the idea of augmented reality almost as much as virtual reality and Lincoln
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:53.480]   profiles and publicly available job listings show things like Doug Bowman, the Virginia
[00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:55.760]   Tech researcher, going to Apple.
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:37:00.240]   Nick Thompson who worked on the HoloLens for Microsoft and Apple's bought at least four
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:04.560]   startups that specialized in related technology.
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:05.560]   This is a good rundown.
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:09.600]   We've talked about all this stuff individually, but when you put it all together, wow, Matteo,
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:13.120]   which is a German company that made an app that visualizes what digital furniture might
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:19.480]   look like in your home, face shift, which transforms a user's face into 3D digital cartoons
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:20.480]   in real time.
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:25.800]   And if you think about face shift, you know, this is, I think that, that one could be kind
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:30.200]   of interesting because one of the problems with, you know, people talking to each other
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.600]   in VR is that they're wearing goggles.
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:35.600]   You can't really, you know, have them in the, in the shot, you know, and they're in the
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:36.600]   middle of it.
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:37.600]   Right.
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:41.960]   And that's something that could theoretically look at your face and, you know, drive an
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:45.320]   avatar's face so that you're talking to, I could talk to the cartoon version of you
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:49.120]   and you talk to the cartoon version of me, you know, inside of virtual reality.
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:53.240]   I think that might be some, and I don't know anything, but I, but I think that when I was
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:55.600]   trying to, I was trying to figure out what they'd be doing with that.
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:59.200]   And it seems like that might be a valid reason to have that kind of technology is so that
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:03.480]   you could build a virtual world where you're able to talk to a lot of other people face
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:07.040]   to face, possibly generating a face from theirs.
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:10.920]   I mean, there's a lot of technology out there right now that you can take a single photo
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:15.400]   straight on of somebody and it'll build a 3D model of their face, you know, like it'll,
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.920]   you know, and that's been around for a decade.
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:23.040]   And so being able to, you know, you could theoretically take a picture of yourself and
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:27.040]   end up with an avatar that looked very much like you that was driven by your, by your
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.120]   actual facial.
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:29.120]   You can do that right now.
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:35.480]   In fact, I've seen videos of people from, was it an E3 or maybe it was CES was CES getting
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:38.800]   3D captured into Fallout 4.
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:39.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:43.120]   Because it fall out for you can design, you know, at the beginning of the game, you and
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:46.600]   your wife go into the bathroom and look in the mirror and you design your character.
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.160]   Well, it's easy enough to apply.
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:51.920]   Of course, a texture map that you get from some sort of motion capture.
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:57.080]   And now, I mean, there's scanners now that you can literally walk in and it will, you
[00:38:57.080 --> 00:39:02.480]   walk into a trailer and it will build a very high resolution 3D model of you in, you know,
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:03.480]   minutes.
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:04.480]   You do that.
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.360]   You can't restore when you were over here, right?
[00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:07.360]   Yeah, we do.
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:11.360]   We have motion capture and we've definitely done what's called photogrammetry to produce
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:12.360]   those.
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:14.760]   It's been a little, our version of it was a little bit more manual.
[00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:18.400]   But there are, if you throw a lot of money at it, there are definitely people who can
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:23.400]   now capture, you know, and actors are now doing that.
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:27.120]   There's a lot of actors that get themselves scanned now, especially if they're younger,
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:32.560]   to make sure that, you know, when you think about flashbacks, they go back to an actor,
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:36.760]   you know, when they were younger or if an actor, you know, passes away and you want
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:40.640]   to put them back into a film, you know, being able to get scanned when they're younger at
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:45.640]   their prime means that they possibly could lease their likeness.
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:52.160]   Even so they could be 60 years old and leasing the likeness of their 24 year old version.
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:57.160]   You know, and so those are all things that are, you know, already being used to some degree,
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:01.600]   you know, so those and, and I mean, right now what they do is they do a process called,
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:05.320]   you know, they're called markers, markerless motion capture.
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:07.400]   I remember you drawing dots on my head.
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:08.400]   Yeah.
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:11.000]   Yeah, that was the first, the early version of the photograph.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   Oh my God.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.360]   He actually, yeah, I was like, couldn't watch those off for days.
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:19.760]   Yeah, you know, I thought that a permanent marker would be kind of fun.
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:22.800]   So yeah, that was a, why do the dots happen to spell out jerk?
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:23.800]   I don't know.
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:26.080]   That's just, that's just, that's just a pattern just happened.
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:28.040]   No, no, no, don't worry about it.
[00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:31.560]   Yeah, that is how we triangulate the surface.
[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:33.240]   That's, you know, that's, that's necessary.
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:34.240]   Exactly.
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:39.120]   Here from the Chevy pressroom commemorating 50 years of Corvette and astronauts.
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:41.080]   Chevy must have been pissed when they saw that out.
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:48.320]   He had pictures of Alan Shepard with his white 1962 Corvette coupe with a customized space
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:52.840]   age interior.
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:53.840]   Charles Pete Conrad.
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:57.800]   This is the Apollo 12 astronauts who were talking about Richard Francis Gordon and Alan
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:07.800]   Bean with their identical 1969 Corvette Stingray coups, 390 horsepower, 427 V8 engine, black
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:13.840]   accident, Riverside, gold color scheme designed by Alan Bean.
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:14.840]   Nice.
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:18.360]   Now, was this just, this, this press release just come out?
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:19.360]   No.
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:21.320]   Somebody in the chat room, Virgil found it.
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:23.720]   No, I was wondering if they were like, they saw the Audi commercial.
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:24.720]   Yeah, really.
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:25.720]   You were there.
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:26.720]   Yeah.
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:27.720]   They don't drive our aids.
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:29.360]   They drive vets.
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:30.360]   Yeah.
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:33.000]   I'm, you're kind of surprised they don't.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.640]   If I was, if I was a Chevy, I would definitely give a Corvette to every astronaut that's ever
[00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:39.640]   been.
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:40.640]   Why not?
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:41.640]   You know, like it's, it's not.
[00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:43.640]   They're, they're, they're, they're might be over.
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:45.800]   Like, every, every surviving astronaut.
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:46.800]   Yeah.
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:49.880]   There, there were so many, like Apollo, I don't know whether it was Apollo 50, I think
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:51.280]   it was Apollo 15.
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:57.040]   There were enough semi scandals happening on a regular basis regarding like Mercury
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:02.920]   astronauts accepting like free furniture and free like minus, minus 8% mortgages on a,
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:05.000]   on a new home in Houston.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.960]   And then there was the, the stamp cover scandal.
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:13.240]   I think that was Apollo 15 where they had, they basically took a pre, they took a commemorative
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:18.720]   stamp covers and as they're part of their personal kits, canceled them in space and then
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:22.800]   like they were, the person they did the deal with kind of screwed them over and started
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:25.400]   selling them immediately instead of five years from then.
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:29.560]   And so now there's a whole bunch of rules on what you can and cannot accept and do.
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:34.880]   But I always, I always thought the nicest thing that it's, it's too bad that NASA didn't,
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:38.840]   the space shuttle didn't pay off the way that it was intended to pay off because if there
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:44.880]   was always, if every third or fourth mission, there was one seat available for a X astronaut
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:50.840]   in their 60s, Apollo astronauts given priority that we will, will fly you up one more time
[00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:55.400]   in a much more comfortable seat with a lot more space and we'll have, we'll give you
[00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:56.400]   a lot less to do.
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:00.680]   So for the first, thank you for risking your life and increasing your risk of cancer and
[00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:04.360]   other kinds of death by doing all the stuff in the 60s and 70s.
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:09.520]   Please allow a tourist pass to the International Space Station or to like a two weeks in orbit.
[00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:14.400]   I loved it when John Glenn got that seat and they had to say that, oh, well, we're doing
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:21.180]   research into the effects of space on the elderly, which is something we were totally
[00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:23.240]   planning on doing one way or another.
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:27.920]   But I don't think anybody could complain about that again, like John Glenn via Spaceman again.
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:31.120]   Phase shift that we were talking about did the, did the, um, uh, face stuff, I guess,
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:32.120]   for Star Wars.
[00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:33.640]   So that's a good company.
[00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:37.360]   Fly by media, another company, they worked with Google and Apple on computer vision,
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:38.360]   prime sense.
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:41.960]   We mentioned that we've talked about all this before, but when you see it all together,
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:47.320]   uh, businesses, I have points out, Apple is selling the view master, which is a augmented
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:52.400]   reality toy, uh, that's based based on Google, uh, Google cardboard.
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:53.760]   Yeah, but that's okay.
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:54.760]   That's okay.
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:55.760]   That's fine too.
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:44:00.480]   I think it's interesting to wonder if they're not, I'm not sure that they're the company
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:03.840]   that's really set up to spike the ball with an actual VR product.
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:07.680]   I keep every time I see, I read this, these lists of acquisitions and see if you're new
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:08.680]   one.
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:11.680]   I wonder if their thoughts aren't, aren't so much we're going to build our own VR platform.
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:18.840]   So much as we are want to position ourselves so that when one of these standards, uh, sets
[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:23.240]   themselves up as this, as the standard, if a, uh, if Oculus is a standard, if whatever
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:27.520]   Google's setting up is going to be the standard, we are set up so that we can create services
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:31.160]   and software that we're really going to take advantage of it because they've, they've,
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:36.680]   I don't think that Apple Watch, I think, was an indication of what happens when Apple
[00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:42.560]   tries to do consumer hardware where there is absolutely no existing template or indication
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:45.160]   of what that market wants yet.
[00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:47.560]   They're not really good at setting that standard.
[00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:48.560]   They're better.
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:49.560]   They're good at improving it.
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:57.120]   But there is a rumor that the new iPhone in the fall, the iPhone 7 will have a dual camera.
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:01.080]   This is coming out of the component makers in Asia.
[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:03.680]   That would be very useful for augmented reality, right?
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:06.280]   Renaming is that is how credible is that rumor?
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:11.000]   It's so funny to me because like, I just imagine if we were all doing this show in 2005 and
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.160]   we heard, oh, you know, Apple's bought finger works or something.
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:15.680]   They must be working on touchscreen Macs.
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:16.680]   Right.
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:17.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:20.160]   Apple is, Apple is looking at, uh, at 2G technology.
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:23.080]   We're going to soon be able to have wireless connection right from our Mac books.
[00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:27.240]   Uh, and just like, what you're talking about now is always friend on what we think now,
[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:29.640]   but Apple's thinking three or five years ahead.
[00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:30.640]   It's hard.
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:31.640]   And they got it right now.
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:34.640]   They make displays and all sorts of sizes, but like they were never a display company.
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:38.680]   Yeah, they make the Thunderbolt display, but it's really a technology that enables a product
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:42.560]   and VR sounds like, uh, at least to me, like, you know, I think Andy made this point last
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:47.440]   week that an Apple VR headset is sort of interesting maybe, but how Apple approaches
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:52.080]   VR for the next five or 10 years and they start making environments or interfaces.
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:55.800]   Uh, could I believe Doug Bowman is also really skilled in 3D interfaces.
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:46:00.800]   Uh, there could be a wide range from cars to all sorts of things to living room entertainment
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:04.880]   systems that are based more on AR and VR than they, than any sort of thing that you strap
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:08.040]   on your head and then try to look like one of them.
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:14.200]   One of the things that I, when I think about the, the view master specifically, uh, you
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:17.040]   know, it's one thing to have those two little lenses and a lot of the mockups have had those
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:18.760]   lenses right next to each other.
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:24.720]   But if they figured out a way to design those lenses, um, you know, to your, um, your, your
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:31.440]   sensors were the same distance as our eyes apart, um, on the back of the iPhone or close, you'd
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:36.800]   be able to take view master photos and, and video, um, you know, on your iPhone.
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:40.400]   So you'd be able to basically take these and when you put it, when you put it up, it would
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:44.640]   s, you know, you'd put it on a little viewer for a view master and you'd actually get
[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:49.040]   a 3D photo, you know, design, I don't know if that makes sense, but I mean, I started
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:50.480]   doing live photos already.
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:53.440]   HTC did this some years ago.
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:54.440]   Remember the end of three.
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:55.440]   Yeah.
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:47:02.000]   Yeah, there were mobile world Congress had, uh, for some reason, like in 2009, I think,
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:07.400]   like three different manufacturers were eager to show off cameras that take 3D pictures.
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:08.600]   And they're kind of weird.
[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:10.440]   You could actually, you could see it happen.
[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:14.200]   You can see the picture on the screen without special glasses, but it really came down to
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:18.800]   how much does the user want the novelty of looking at a 3D photo.
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:24.360]   Uh, whereas everything that's happening in VR now is more like, how do we create not necessarily
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:29.280]   a final product, but a platform that so that so the developers and content creators can
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:33.120]   then look at, wow, if I have this platform, here's the stories I could tell or here's
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:34.760]   the software, I could create with it.
[00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:41.560]   That's why like magic leap is, uh, friends, they got another $750 million in third round
[00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:46.880]   funding, uh, last week, uh, Google, uh, Google CEOs on the board, uh, Google made it, this
[00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:51.800]   was part of the lead, one lead investors for the second round of 500 million of financing.
[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:54.440]   Uh, everybody's invested in this.
[00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:58.880]   And the technology is really cool because it's not about having a screen that you're
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:03.920]   looking at, which is what the, that the Google cardboard, uh, and Oculus are based on.
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:09.600]   It really is a piece of hardware that will squirt light into your eye alongside whatever
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:11.880]   other light is coming at you from the room.
[00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:16.160]   So it's not as though you're looking at a video of the world around you with other video
[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:20.360]   added to it, it's, you're looking at the world around you and they've basically squirted
[00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:25.260]   extra fake, fake bounced around, like, uh, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,
[00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:26.260]   a light in the middle attack.
[00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:27.260]   Exactly.
[00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:28.260]   Exactly.
[00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:31.600]   And so when you think about what could you do with this, when you can now, you're not
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:35.400]   limited by someone has to wear a screen on their head and there's going to be a certain
[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:36.760]   amount of lag.
[00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:38.940]   That's the stuff that's truly interesting.
[00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:43.000]   And there's so much movement right now that, like I said, I find it easier to believe
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:46.840]   that Apple wants to make sure that whatever happens in the next five or 10 years, they
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:50.960]   are well equipped to make sure that their software and their interfaces and their services
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:52.560]   take advantage of it.
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:56.800]   Because again, they, they just don't have the kind of focus right now to work on something.
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:57.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:03.400]   I think that's a, that's a, that's a, I've not just me to say, I don't imagine them being
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:07.320]   as committed to creating a brand new platform like that.
[00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:12.200]   Given that it would, I can't imagine how it would interact directly with an existing iOS
[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:14.200]   or Mac OS operating system.
[00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:19.360]   Well, we do know that they're going to, that they're looking for somebody to design watch
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:20.360]   faces.
[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:24.640]   There's a, there's an, a listing for a software engineer to join Apple Watch's dedicated clock
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:25.640]   phase team.
[00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:29.080]   You know, I don't want them to, you heard the thing is I don't want them to design watch
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:30.080]   faces.
[00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:31.080]   I want them to open that up.
[00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:32.080]   Yeah.
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:36.400]   It's like, oh, but you know, I was just going back for one second though, like there's something
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:39.560]   super interesting what Apple does is for example, we had the home button for a long
[00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:42.720]   time, but then touch ID made it smart, like not Terminator smart, but it knows who we
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:43.720]   are now.
[00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:46.720]   And we had microphones for a long time, but then Siri came along and it was smart.
[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:51.280]   It could start distinguishing a sort of commands and using things like primes and solace technology,
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:53.520]   there's an argument to be made, you know, cameras are getting smart.
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:55.120]   They can do face detection already.
[00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:58.560]   They can do auto focus, but when you add two cameras and they can do a sort of all sorts
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:01.440]   of other math that lets them become smarter cameras.
[00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:04.400]   And it's all about, you know, and there's like three microphones on a iPhone now, but
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:05.760]   it's not to record you in stereo.
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:10.000]   It's to do beam forming and other things to enable other technologies.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:13.320]   And I think when we see those cameras, 3D is sort of like the obvious thing, but like
[00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:15.720]   Andy said, you know, everyone was doing that three years ago.
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:18.640]   But what else could they do with all the data they're pulling in from that?
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:19.640]   Yeah.
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:24.400]   I really think just to directly talk about the two cameras, I really think it's more
[00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:29.040]   of a computational photography solution than anything 3D because the things that you can
[00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:34.240]   do by simply taking two pictures with two different lenses, two different sensors from
[00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:38.360]   two different points of view, you just get a whole bunch of data upon which to build
[00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:39.360]   a great picture.
[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:44.520]   And one of the masterpieces of the iPhone camera design is that you don't, you're not
[00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:48.680]   what you see on the screen later is not the picture that it took.
[00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:54.680]   It was a calculation, an estimation, and an enhancement of several, several captures
[00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:57.280]   that it took to combine into the best picture possible.
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:59.440]   And we're not even talking about HDR.
[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:04.280]   So I'm super excited about what they will do to simply make a better 12 megapixel image
[00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:09.000]   rather than what they could do with 3D, although 3D would be what you can do with two cameras
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.160]   just as a 3D capture device is pretty amazing.
[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:16.160]   I mean, if you think about putting those lenses at the two corners of the, you know, of a
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:20.080]   want, if you hold the, when you hold the phone like this and you put them here and here,
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:25.200]   you know, like on either corner, you know, I just think that the possibilities of what
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:27.000]   you can do with that is pretty profound.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.720]   We do a lot with parallax.
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:35.440]   And once you get that much parallax between viewability, 3D generation of the content,
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:37.880]   I don't know if you like, like, roestyle refocusing.
[00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:38.880]   Exactly.
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:39.880]   All of that.
[00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:43.040]   And to get in the further those get apart, more you can do because the more information
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:44.040]   you have.
[00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:47.680]   And, and if you look at, we're just about to get a camera that spins in a room and just
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:50.560]   basically builds a 3D model, you know, you know, and it, because it's got two lenses
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:51.560]   that are, they're here.
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:55.080]   And as it moves around, it looks at the parallax and it just figures out, you know, like
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:58.560]   optical zoom might also be possible with a dual lens.
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:51:59.560]   So you can see that.
[00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:00.560]   And then you can see that.
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:01.560]   And then you can see that there's a dual lens.
[00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:02.560]   And you can see that there's a dual lens.
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:03.560]   So you can see that there's a dual lens.
[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:04.560]   And you can see that there's a dual lens.
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:05.560]   And then you can see that there's a dual lens.

[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:35.560]   And you can see that there's a dual lens.
[01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:42.560]   And it's not always the case.
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:43.560]   Sometimes it's just an error.
[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:46.560]   Like a cable gets compromised while they're doing the screen repair.
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:49.560]   But as a result, now it worked fine.
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:55.560]   But then when he put iOS 9 on it, and this would even happen if you updated it,
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:58.560]   it bricked and it stopped working and it gave him the error 53.
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:00.560]   And he had to buy a new phone.
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:02.560]   And that's where it sounds like the big problem is.
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:04.560]   Because again, it was working fine.
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:05.560]   And it was reasonable.
[01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:06.560]   Yeah.
[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:07.560]   Or Apple Pay.
[01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:08.560]   And Apple Pay could stop working.
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:09.560]   That's the first reason.
[01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:11.560]   Anything that requires the hardware, the authentication system in the secure enclave.
[01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:12.560]   It just absolutely stopped working.
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:14.560]   And then you put in your passcode.
[01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:16.560]   Yeah, it's a little bit of pain in the butt.
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:18.560]   But it can't be trusted.
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:22.560]   But the error 50, again, it doesn't sound like something human because it's not,
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:23.560]   please take this to an Apple store.
[01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:26.560]   It's this binary code that's being generated off the device.
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:28.560]   Well, it's, yeah.
[01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:32.560]   I mean, I don't know if there was ever a walk through when they decided that if this happens,
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:34.560]   then this is what we're going to do to lock people out.
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:35.560]   It's also possible.
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:36.560]   It's possible that it's a bug.
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:41.560]   It's also possible that it's just simply they can't, they couldn't figure out how at the,
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:46.280]   at the OS level at the, excuse me, at that extremely low level, they can't figure out
[01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:52.680]   how to create an exception for the overall system security integrity check has failed.
[01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:58.400]   Do we then decide we have a no slash no go for certain features, but, but other features
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:11:59.560]   are okay.
[01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:03.240]   And they just simply decided that it wasn't a big enough problem to solve it right away,
[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:06.360]   given the other things that were certainly on their plate.
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:11.800]   But I think it's, it's, it's the reaction, I think is a good, good illustration of the
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:13.720]   perception that people have of these companies.
[01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:18.400]   If, if honestly, if HTC or Samsung had this problem, everybody would, it would not be
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:21.600]   a controversy because everyone would say, oh, yeah, see, they just did this in a half
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:22.600]   ass way.
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:24.560]   And they didn't really think it's a false a bug.
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:26.040]   It's just not made right.
[01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:30.320]   With Apple, you believe that their engineering is, is always excellent.
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:34.200]   And you also believe that at some point, if someone asked the question, are we going
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:39.480]   to be helpful to people who got their phones fixed by someone that doesn't work for Apple
[01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:43.720]   that maybe it's, there was discussion that the answer was, no, well, we're going to make
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:45.480]   people always have their phones fixed at Apple.
[01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:48.840]   If they don't get them fixed at Apple, well, we'll give them reasons to want to figure
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:49.840]   out how to fix it.
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:51.760]   I don't think that I don't think that I don't think that happened, but that's, that's
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:52.760]   perception.
[01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:55.200]   And I don't think this necessarily happened either, but I, I wonder if there was an
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:59.160]   exploit that they saw happening that they decided to close a loop, you know, like there
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:02.720]   was something that they saw that they saw instances of.
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:05.960]   And their choice was we're going to close it and then, and then talk about it, but we
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:11.200]   want to close it first so so that the folks hoping to take advantage of it don't get to.
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:14.560]   But the, but yeah, I don't know that that's the case at all.
[01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:17.360]   The key thing for me is that it's happening at Apple repair stores too.
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:19.880]   Like when Apple stores are fixing it, they're getting that air and they're just swapping
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:22.840]   out a phone and that's not something that Apple wants to do if they don't have to.
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:26.200]   You know, that's a huge increase in cost for them.
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:27.880]   And then Ted insults it.
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:30.200]   Well, we'll see what we'll cover this by the way.
[01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:35.480]   And if Apple does announce a fix or whatever, I think that's actually credible, Renee, that
[01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:40.720]   this isn't what they intended because I think the lawsuits are going to fly fast.
[01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:44.000]   Well, I mean, like the external and internal consequences of doing this intentionally
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.640]   are super huge and Apple's not a dumb.
[01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:51.240]   Not to mention the governmental issues about, you know, kind of anti competitive behavior.
[01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:52.640]   It's our terrible press.
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:54.840]   I mean, there's no upside in doing this intentionally.
[01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:55.840]   Yeah, okay.
[01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:59.080]   And it could also be, and I wouldn't, you know, I see this now a lot.
[01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:04.280]   And I think that this is probably more common than not.
[01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:07.640]   Companies that are engineering driven and Google and Apple are engine, well, Apple may
[01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:11.440]   be more marketing driven, but there's still a lot of engineers and engineers may think
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:12.440]   a little differently.
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:15.680]   They may say, no, no, the logic is that this shouldn't work because it's not secure.
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:20.480]   You don't want it to work and not realize that the PR hit that they're going to take
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:21.480]   in the legally.
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:28.240]   I mean, and some of these companies are very paranoid about hardware being compromised.
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:34.000]   You know, I know some companies that have a policy that if TSA takes your computer to
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.640]   look at it, leave it.
[01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:36.640]   Right.
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:39.320]   Like literally you can't you can't take it back to the company.
[01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:43.720]   Like you just leave just give it to them and you're not you're not you don't want it back.
[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:46.160]   And they have computers.
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:52.760]   We receive no compensation from Budweiser for Alex Lindsay's appearance.
[01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:54.880]   Red Bull though, paying us big bucks.
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:55.880]   Yeah.
[01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:57.640]   You know, it's it's funny.
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:15:01.760]   I can't I agree not to identify the source, but I can use the story.
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:09.200]   There's a there's a company that issues Chromebooks to a lot of other companies, other employees
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:11.440]   who are traveling to certain parts of the world.
[01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:16.880]   And the understanding is that we're going to give you a brand new one when you leave when
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:18.360]   you are at the site.
[01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:23.120]   We want before you leave the site though, we want you to a stop on it.
[01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:24.560]   So it's all broke up to pieces.
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:28.200]   Take a photo of the pieces and then leave them throughout the pieces and we will get
[01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:30.640]   you a new laptop when you get home.
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:34.480]   It's that it's that serious about let's not trust it.
[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:35.880]   It's not just a TSA.
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:41.080]   It's at some point you probably left this locked in a hotel safe and a hotel safe can
[01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:44.480]   be opened with a high energy magnet and a sock.
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:47.800]   And so we're not going to trust that no one has had access to that data or had access
[01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:49.640]   to those to those codes.
[01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:51.440]   So it's interesting.
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:55.600]   And a little more trouble in paradise.
[01:15:55.600 --> 01:16:00.140]   Walt Mossberg, who in the past has been a big Apple fan, although, you know, I think
[01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:03.040]   Walt sometimes gets a bad rap as being uncritical of Apple.
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:04.600]   He's been critical from time to time.
[01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:05.600]   Oh, hell yeah.
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:06.600]   Yeah.
[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:10.840]   The famous story about when the remember the famous story about Steve Jobs, huge huge
[01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:14.560]   tantrum saying that Walt Mossberg was what we used to think of.
[01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:18.720]   He's one of our friends and even he says our products suck.
[01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:22.640]   What's wrong with you people?
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:25.360]   This is writing in the Verge Mossberg's column.
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:30.200]   Apple's apps need work, complexity, feature gaps and bugs have crept in.
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:34.240]   And he started a conversation, which frankly is a continuation of a conversation we've
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:37.200]   had perhaps less publicly on the show.
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:42.480]   We often say that iTunes, please stop the insanity.
[01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:45.640]   Walt says I dread launching iTunes.
[01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:49.960]   He says over the last couple of years, I've noticed a gradual degradation in the quality
[01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:54.560]   and reliability of Apple's core apps on both the mobile iOS operating system and its Mac
[01:16:54.560 --> 01:17:00.360]   OS tenants, almost as if the tech giant has taken its eye off the ball when it comes to
[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:07.160]   these core software products while it pursues new big dreams and it's like smart watches.
[01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:11.720]   And cars and he particularly singles out iTunes for the desktop.
[01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:15.120]   He says now I dread opening the thing.
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:16.120]   Apple mail.
[01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:20.360]   I think part of Apple Mail's problems don't come from Apple but from difficulty working
[01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:24.840]   with Gmail and since so many people use Gmail and by the way he points this out.
[01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:31.840]   I don't quite understand the delay with why Apple Mail is so delayed with Gmail.
[01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:34.880]   So if you're on a web, especially if you have the web browser open, you'll realize that
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:38.760]   you're getting your mail on the web browser about often times 15 minutes before you get
[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:41.280]   it on your Google's iMac implementation is eccentric.
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:43.080]   It's not standard.
[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:48.600]   Although it's not so non standard that Apple can't figure it out.
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:57.240]   I actually like Apple Mail but I do agree with him that photos is one big ball at junk.
[01:17:57.240 --> 01:18:02.560]   I have had so much trouble with photos importing libraries, maintaining libraries, my libraries
[01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:03.840]   get corrupted.
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:09.280]   I hear from people a lot on the radio show who can't, you know, one woman called me last
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:10.280]   week.
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:14.040]   She said I press the edit button and photos and I get a black picture.
[01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:16.040]   That's it.
[01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:23.000]   And she's called Apple and talked to the geniuses and has had no satisfaction.
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:27.880]   He also mentions as we all know that Apple and services don't seem to go together.
[01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:35.600]   iCloud has not been despite huge attempts by Apple to make it work has not been very
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:37.720]   successful.
[01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:42.640]   But this is, I guess my first observation was is this something new?
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:44.320]   I mean, no, no.
[01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:48.000]   Like I was the first time this happened when Marco Arman was talking about it last year,
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.080]   you know, kudos to Marco for a really good article on it, the functional high ground.
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:53.800]   I went back, you know, I'm worse got forums going back five years.
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:58.240]   People discussion boards go back, you know, 10, 15 years.
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:00.840]   And it's sort of like the human condition and Georgia can explain this better than me.
[01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:03.360]   But any pain you had in the past sort of goes away.
[01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:04.360]   You forget about it.
[01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:05.360]   It becomes abstract.
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:08.000]   Any annoyance or pain you have now is super, super bad.
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.760]   So we'll complain about Apple design now and we'll forget about green felt and brush metal
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:15.480]   and we'll complain about Apple software bugs now and we'll forget about things like mobile
[01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:20.200]   me and a core audio, which has always been, you know, sort of problematic.
[01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:21.680]   So that's one of the things.
[01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:25.440]   The other thing is that Apple software from the outside, it looks like one thing, but Apple's
[01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:27.120]   got many different software teams.
[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:30.280]   There's the engineering team under Craig Federiki and they chip a lot of apps that a
[01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:31.960]   lot of people really love.
[01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:35.040]   And there's a software teams that make iTunes completely different organization that makes
[01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:39.240]   a music app completely different organization that makes I work and I life completely different
[01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:40.240]   organization.
[01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:44.160]   And you might like those teams may not always be doing sort of the same kind of work.
[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:48.320]   So if you're saying Apple's doing project A, like the watch or something, totally different
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:52.200]   team doing this, they can be doing bad work regardless of Apple, whether Apple's making
[01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:55.520]   watches or cars or anything.
[01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:58.840]   And then the bigger issue is sort of they've given these apps impossible jobs like iTunes
[01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:00.520]   job right now is ridiculous.
[01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:03.000]   It's got to be absolutely portable to Windows.
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:08.560]   Sink legacy iPods manage Apple music, manage iTunes DRM for video and all these other things.
[01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:11.240]   And you just can't put all that in one app.
[01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:14.960]   But when Apple does what they usually do, which is to be super opinionated, burn things
[01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:16.920]   down and make a new app.
[01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:18.040]   You've got to make tough choices.
[01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:20.120]   Do you abandon Windows and just put that in the cloud?
[01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:23.120]   Do you abandon iPods, which they're still selling by the way?
[01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:25.120]   Do you move Apple music somewhere else?
[01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:28.160]   And then people like Jim who have massive libraries complain that they have to use two
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:31.080]   apps now to do basically one job.
[01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:33.000]   And you have the same problem on Apple music.
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.000]   Like rumor has it.
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.120]   It was a super simple app.
[01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:36.520]   And then people are like, well, I want this feature.
[01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:40.160]   I want playlists plus I want stations plus I want the up next queue.
[01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:44.200]   I want to be able to download music, have it in the cloud, have it streaming, have it,
[01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:46.760]   you know, you know, remember it's state.
[01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:48.080]   These apps are sort of set up to fail.
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:49.760]   There's no right answer for this.
[01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:51.440]   And in the end, they're going to have to choose.
[01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:53.160]   And a lot of people are going to be super upset.
[01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:56.680]   But that's sort of Apple's slot in throw away the floppy disk life.
[01:20:56.680 --> 01:20:58.240]   Yeah, but it's not a cool one.
[01:20:58.240 --> 01:20:59.240]   But it's not a cool one.
[01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:00.240]   Apologists for Apple either.
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:03.080]   I mean, they're the company that says it just works and all of that.
[01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:05.320]   They had a hard choice and they punched the choice.
[01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:07.320]   They just kept adding more and more stuff to it.
[01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:08.320]   Yeah.
[01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:11.920]   Also, when the tidbits had been coming out of that town hall meeting is that Tim Cook was
[01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:16.680]   hinting at bringing more Apple services to other platforms.
[01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:20.400]   And implied that one of those platforms would be would be Android.
[01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:25.040]   Did he actually call out Apple music on Android as one example?
[01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:27.560]   I think that was a I believe I read that.
[01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:29.400]   Yeah, that he got that specifically.
[01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:31.960]   But yeah, I mean, so they got a lot on their plate.
[01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:33.640]   But I mean, you have Renee is absolutely right.
[01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:37.360]   I mean, we've been it's it's nothing.
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:38.360]   It's nothing new.
[01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:42.520]   They've got a lot of their things that I feel as though there are things that Apple is
[01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:47.400]   seriously passionately fascinated with and other things they do because it's part of
[01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:52.200]   their job as being Apple and creating support for all of their products.
[01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:56.360]   Just like in all of our jobs, I love I love writing.
[01:21:56.360 --> 01:21:59.400]   I like I like the video stuff.
[01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:00.600]   I love podcasting.
[01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:01.960]   I hate filing invoices.
[01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:04.400]   I hate having to keep up with my inbox.
[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:07.680]   But I have to do that because that's part of the business that I'm in.
[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:12.800]   And I feel as though software apps and services are part of the job that Apple is in that
[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:17.440]   they have to do because they let's them to make and design cool things like iPods and
[01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:20.720]   iPads and hang out with you too.
[01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:26.720]   And so it's going to take a while for them to really have that come to Jesus moment.
[01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:33.520]   If you modern if you if you if I can apologize for a phrase in the name of the deity, but
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:36.680]   it's there's going to have to be a time where they're going to have to back off from iTunes.
[01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:40.240]   You're going to have to say we've got we are we own the trademark for icing.
[01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:41.240]   Let's bring it back.
[01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:45.240]   Let's have a tool that is just challenging hope for sinking though because you can't throw
[01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:48.960]   money at a computer programming problem.
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:50.520]   You can't just hire more programmers.
[01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:51.520]   That's the windows problem.
[01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:54.520]   Well, you have to bring millions of users.
[01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:59.560]   You're also going to have to you kind of have to bring people in that are going to be
[01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:01.800]   passionate about fixing iTunes.
[01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:05.560]   I mean, it's it's clear that the, for instance, let's let's talk about something less controversial
[01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:06.560]   like mail.
[01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:09.280]   It has never been something that people like.
[01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:14.240]   It's been something that people use because it's it's pre-installed on everything.
[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:16.360]   It's the only one that's hardwired in iOS.
[01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:18.920]   So it's basically has favorite nation status.
[01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:21.840]   No one has ever said that this is a really great male client.
[01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:26.400]   If they've had this male client for 10 years and it's still at the state that it is right
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:31.480]   now, it's never going to get any better until they hire someone in who who absolutely loves
[01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:32.720]   male clients.
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:37.880]   And you give them enough power to simply say, we are going to keep, we're going to keep
[01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:43.240]   this block of code and this library and we're going to keep the name male dot app and maybe
[01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:44.240]   the icon.
[01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:45.240]   But that's it.
[01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:46.680]   We're going to retool this from scratch.
[01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:49.440]   But then, but then, you know, when, when Apple retools something from scratch, like Final
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:54.880]   Cut, you know, they, you know, people, people like lose, just lose their minds over being
[01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:58.560]   upset where, you know, Final Cut seven, if you compare it to Final Cut 10 is crap.
[01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:03.280]   I mean, Final Cut seven was like just painful to use on so many levels.
[01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:07.040]   And we dealt with it because it was better than the other options, but it wasn't a great,
[01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:08.520]   you know, editing app.
[01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:11.880]   And, and, you know, Final Cut, Final Cut 10 was a, we're going to rethink this.
[01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:13.040]   We're going to completely rethink it.
[01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:15.800]   We're going to experiment first with iMovie with this new idea.
[01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:18.880]   And if it works, then we're going to move it to Final Cut 10.
[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:23.200]   And you know, and so then they rethought it and reorganized it and really thought outside
[01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:28.400]   the box and produced, in my opinion, you know, a great editing package.
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:30.320]   And, you know, and everyone's up in arms.
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:32.960]   So I, you know, I think that in some ways they're going to be in, you know, a lot of
[01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:37.800]   us complain about iTunes, you know, and, or don't use it at all.
[01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:39.880]   And, you know, because I don't interact with iTunes that often.
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:42.960]   I mean, I just, you know, I have to admit that, you know, my number one interaction
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:47.400]   now is I just tell Siri what I want, want to hear.
[01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:50.440]   You know, like, like, that's the most magical part of Apple music is just that you're just
[01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:52.560]   walking around and just, I feel like, listen to the song.
[01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:55.560]   Hey, Siri, you know, I just turn on my mouth.
[01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:59.320]   The only thing I do too is exactly why you're very different than Jim's.
[01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:00.320]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:01.320]   Yeah.
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:07.640]   But it just, it's just like this incredible, you know, incredible experience there.
[01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:10.720]   And I don't, you know, so iTunes, I think also is, I don't know how many people interact
[01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:13.120]   with it that often because I don't interact with it at all.
[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:15.200]   And so, you know, I don't think about it that much.
[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:18.200]   I also don't, I don't care about pages because I don't interact with it at all.
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:24.960]   But you know what's telling us how many of us don't use Apple's core applications on
[01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:25.960]   our iPhones.
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:28.680]   Like, we've moved them into a folder.
[01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:29.680]   Some call it junk.
[01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:31.760]   I have, I still use all the Apple apps.
[01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:35.080]   So if you use Apple's mail, iOS mail app as your chief mail app.
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:36.760]   I like the, so it's, again, it's use cases.
[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:39.880]   I like the unified inbox because I have a personal account and a work account and I only want
[01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:42.080]   to check when it gets that on third party apps.
[01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:45.600]   I mean, they were never as good and I just, I didn't like, some of them always wanted
[01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:49.080]   my credentials and they've gotten over that now, but I just, none of them have been compelling
[01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:52.040]   enough to make me switch for a while Google Maps was, but I went back.
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:53.040]   Right.
[01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:54.040]   Yeah.
[01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:55.960]   And often it's the Google app, Google photos.
[01:25:55.960 --> 01:25:59.400]   I prefer over Apple's photos, Google's calendar even.
[01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:02.360]   I prefer, although I wish I could get it.
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:08.280]   So the watch, as far as I can tell, doesn't have a complication for third party or Google's
[01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:09.280]   calendar anyway.
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:10.280]   That's Google's problem though.
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:11.280]   They can make it.
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:12.280]   They could write a complication.
[01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:13.280]   Okay.
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:15.560]   Because I need a calendar complication that goes with that calendar.
[01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:16.560]   Fantastic.
[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:17.560]   Calender is a really good company.
[01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:19.320]   I'll maybe I use Fantastic Cal instead.
[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:20.320]   Yeah.
[01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:21.320]   I really like Google calendar.
[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:24.600]   It's just kind of standardized and all of my stuff.
[01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:32.120]   But Renee may be an outlier because I'm pretty sure most people end up replacing a lot of
[01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:36.680]   the Apple apps on their iPhone with my understanding is that that's not, it's not the case, but
[01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:37.960]   not for an apparent reason.
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:40.760]   It's just that most like the vast majority of people are just mainstream users and they
[01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:44.720]   buy something and they use the deep super hard to get anyone to change settings or to
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:45.720]   get them to change apps.
[01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:49.200]   It requires a significant sort of action to get them to do that.
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:53.240]   So in the text for your absolutely, I think most technology people use Apple hardware
[01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:54.640]   with Google services.
[01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:56.640]   Sometimes Microsoft services too.
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:26:59.000]   But an average person just goes and buy the iPhone.
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:02.440]   I believe the numbers are still the majority just never change anything.
[01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:03.440]   Right.
[01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:09.160]   My dad, I think he's got four extra apps beyond what shipped with the iPhone and those four
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:10.160]   I downloaded for.
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:13.640]   I was like, I really want to have Netflix on here and you really want to have this.
[01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:15.720]   But I didn't go crazy with it.
[01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:18.840]   But he likes the apps that he has.
[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:21.840]   He doesn't really think about downloading more.
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:22.840]   Okay.
[01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:23.840]   I stand corrected.
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:26.520]   You're in our sphere and our bubble.
[01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:27.840]   Absolutely people changed that.
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:29.960]   No, I have a folder that's just called legacy.
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:32.560]   I just don't have to use some point.
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:34.280]   I can't get rid of them.
[01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:35.280]   No, it's true.
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:37.300]   Most users, it's the tyranny of the default.
[01:27:37.300 --> 01:27:39.320]   They don't, they're not going to change anything.
[01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:40.320]   Yeah.
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:43.400]   And I just want to use Safari because it's integrated in.
[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:44.400]   You can't, you know.
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:47.640]   And I also think that's going to be, that's going to be Apple's secret with Apple music
[01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:51.520]   is that it is so seamlessly tied into the ecosystem.
[01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:53.400]   And it's so, you know, it's just there.
[01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:57.360]   And again, as soon as you realize that it just, it is so seamless just to ask for a song
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:02.280]   and it just, it just starts playing and, you know, other than trying to persuade Siri
[01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:06.920]   to play Pearl Jam's alive is, you have to be very specific and talking a very specific
[01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:07.920]   way because there's like a lot of.
[01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:08.920]   Oh, yeah.
[01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:09.920]   There's no longer alive.
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:10.920]   No, yeah.
[01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:13.960]   It's just like, that's kind of like, that's kind of no way to go through life.
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:18.640]   I mean, I was, when I was, when I was thinking about this after the, this became another
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:24.800]   news story last week and thinking, let me think of all the different apps and services
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:27.120]   that Apple makes.
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:31.480]   How many of them do I really love that if there were a million apps like this, I would
[01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:32.480]   still use this.
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:38.680]   It comes down to keynote and notes, although I don't use notes because it's not platform
[01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:39.920]   independent.
[01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:42.080]   And that's kind of it.
[01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:43.360]   For me, I would say not.
[01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:46.800]   I mean, for me, vinyl cut in numbers, I would add to that.
[01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:48.000]   You know, I would, I would.
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.720]   Numbers numbers for charting, but I'd, yeah.
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:51.720]   Numbers what?
[01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:52.720]   I'm sorry.
[01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:58.600]   Numbers, I use numbers for charting, but I actually, it's personal preference.
[01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:00.920]   I like ubiquity of Google Docs.
[01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:04.520]   No, I like the ubiquity of Google Docs, but man, so what I, a lot of times what I do
[01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:07.920]   is I actually build the thing in numbers because I just don't have the patience to
[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:09.160]   deal with Google Docs.
[01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:12.400]   You know, so I build it all out and then I export it as XLS and then I import it into
[01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:14.920]   Google Docs because, and then I can, then I can add stuff to it.
[01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:18.680]   I like that everybody can add something to my Google Doc or whatever, but when I actually,
[01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:22.400]   you know, want to do something quickly and actually get something put together, you know,
[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:26.600]   it doesn't do, you know, numbers is not, doesn't do heavy calculations.
[01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:30.800]   You know, it's, you know, I wouldn't try to run, you know, a fortune 500 company doing
[01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:34.760]   that, but for most of the stuff that I need to do budgets and everything else, it's just
[01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:36.120]   so fast.
[01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:40.600]   And I don't have to deal with, I'm not, I'm not contained in the sheet structure.
[01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:44.520]   I can just make, you know, charts and, you know, make, make a little sections that are what
[01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:45.960]   I want and have white space.
[01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:51.640]   And, you know, it's such a great, you know, for 90% of the people that need to do that.
[01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:53.280]   It's, it's a much better solution.
[01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:55.560]   Go back to the problem with the software though.
[01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:58.040]   I mean, and this again, this is not our apologies.
[01:29:58.040 --> 01:29:59.800]   It's sort of explaining why it's like this.
[01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:02.520]   And when you understand why it's like that, you can start to decide what would, what
[01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:06.280]   would I do in this situation is that Apple's culture is as great as strength and as great
[01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:07.280]   as weakness.
[01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:09.800]   And this culture is now scaling at an unbelievable rate.
[01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:13.880]   And it's really hard to maintain these small teams and to give them huge workloads.
[01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:17.640]   Like some people will say, take all the apps, give them all to Craig Federicki's team, let
[01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:18.640]   him add it.
[01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:19.640]   But you know, that team has already got impossible jobs.
[01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:22.000]   It's got to ship iOS and OS 10 every year.
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:26.920]   And it's unclear how, how big you could scale that organization without them having problems.
[01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:30.680]   And then you have the culture where like there's radar and there's a lot of program managers,
[01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:33.560]   but is there enough QA for all these resources?
[01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:37.160]   And you look at any one of these and you say, well, it's, it's moving really fast.
[01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:40.240]   It's super big using a lot of devices.
[01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:41.560]   What part of this do you fix?
[01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:44.840]   And I think it has to come to a point where, and there's rumors it's already happening
[01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:48.720]   that famously Apple was trying, was tracking crashes and they believe that they were doing
[01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:51.600]   better software than ever because it was crashing less often.
[01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:54.800]   And people were saying, well, no, crashing is sort of a pain, but there's all these other
[01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:58.640]   things that is doing that makes my life miserable every day that is short of a crash.
[01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:01.040]   And they were, I too, it just sucks.
[01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:02.040]   Yeah.
[01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:03.040]   Yeah.
[01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:04.040]   So a lot of the apps are perfectly stable.
[01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:05.040]   They're more stable than they've ever been.
[01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:06.040]   Apple's super proud about that.
[01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:09.160]   And it's like, it's re-springing or it's doing this.
[01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:13.000]   And that just probably probably was in the way that because that wasn't measured, Apple
[01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.360]   has a system of ranking for bugs.
[01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:16.560]   And it's like P1, P2, P3.
[01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:19.880]   And when you want to ship it's like the P1 is the game changers, the game stoppers, the
[01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:22.840]   crashers that you fix and you don't have enough time.
[01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:25.240]   Even if you're, because these engineers are all great, they're craft people.
[01:31:25.240 --> 01:31:28.820]   They want to make terrific software, but they don't have the time to go and fix these
[01:31:28.820 --> 01:31:31.240]   little annoyances that really, really add up.
[01:31:31.240 --> 01:31:34.840]   And rumor has that Apple is sort of giving them that time now that they're understanding
[01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:39.120]   that if you have sufficient quantities of these sorts of bugs, you ruin the experience
[01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:43.680]   as much or if more maybe than if the app crashes and sort of giving them what they want to
[01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:45.360]   do anyway, these engineers want to fix these things.
[01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:47.000]   They just need the time to do it.
[01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:51.120]   And that hopefully will be part of their process in making this stuff better.
[01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:52.120]   Okay.
[01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:56.640]   I mean, if you've watched this show for any length of time, you know, we've, this is
[01:31:56.640 --> 01:31:58.800]   not a new conversation.
[01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:01.320]   Going back even before Marco wrote about it.
[01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:02.320]   Oh, for sure.
[01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:03.320]   Yeah.
[01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:04.320]   We've been talking.
[01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:06.240]   iTunes is definitely at crisis point though.
[01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:09.680]   That's the one, if they, if they're going to make one thing a priority, they got to fix
[01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:15.000]   iTunes because I've, I'm not at the point with iTunes that I have rearranged how I deal
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:19.400]   with music and video so that I can use iTunes as little as possible.
[01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:23.440]   That's not a, that's not an endorsement of iTunes.
[01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:27.760]   Does uninstalling Facebook save battery life on your iPhone?
[01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:29.120]   According to, I did it.
[01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:30.120]   I did it.
[01:32:30.120 --> 01:32:33.360]   I think it saves a lot of time and saves time batteries because you're not on it.
[01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:35.840]   It's going to suck your brain dry anyway.
[01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:40.920]   But this is Samuel Gibbs writing for The Guardian and he says 15% or even more.
[01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:43.680]   He says up to 20% of the iPhone's battery.
[01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:45.360]   Actually, this was on Android.
[01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:48.160]   I think the linking to Android Central because they're Russell.
[01:32:48.160 --> 01:32:49.160]   Yeah.
[01:32:49.160 --> 01:32:50.160]   Russell, Russell Holly removed it.
[01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:51.920]   And in fact, I did the same thing.
[01:32:51.920 --> 01:32:54.720]   I use the mentions app because I'm a verified Facebook user.
[01:32:54.720 --> 01:32:57.480]   I don't think it drains as much battery.
[01:32:57.480 --> 01:33:00.720]   If you pull up the battery usage monitor, like you can anyone can go to.
[01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:01.720]   You can tell.
[01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:02.720]   Right.
[01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:07.000]   And then we'll say Twitter, 10 minutes on screen, two minutes in the background.
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.840]   So far, 10 minutes on screen, two minutes in the background.
[01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:13.240]   Facebook, 10 minutes on screen, four and a half hours on background.
[01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:16.600]   So is that, so that's a sufficient way to figure this out.
[01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:20.160]   Is just go to the battery settings and look at what's using up the battery.
[01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:24.760]   So Leo, if you tap on like the little clock face on the right, yeah, tap on that.
[01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:26.880]   It'll tell you on screen versus background.
[01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:27.880]   Yeah.
[01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:32.440]   So mentions uses 7%, 50 minutes, 7, 4 minutes on screen, 47 in background.
[01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:35.600]   So a lot of background time is one of the things that's bad, right?
[01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:36.600]   Yes.
[01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:37.600]   Well, yeah.
[01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:40.240]   But it doesn't, but Audible spent 3.3 hours in the background.
[01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:42.160]   I guess I listened to a lot of Audible books.
[01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:43.160]   So that's fine.
[01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:44.640]   If you're actually doing so much, you know it.
[01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:45.640]   Right.
[01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:48.760]   If you're listening to audio, that is a legitimate use of background processes.
[01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:50.560]   You're getting something out of that.
[01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:53.480]   Facebook needs to be on screen for you to get anything out of it.
[01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:54.480]   Right.
[01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:56.000]   And four hours is not an acceptable amount.
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:00.680]   Turn off background downloading, maybe things like that.
[01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:04.720]   Sometimes, but then they had that problem where they were enabling their, the rumor has it.
[01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:08.560]   They were misusing the audio API to sort of stay alive if people were turning off the
[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:09.560]   background.
[01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:13.640]   On this iPhone 6, which gets great battery life, the home and the lock screen, 90% of
[01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:17.800]   the battery life, but there's nothing I can, I can't turn that off, obviously.
[01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:18.800]   Yeah.
[01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:23.320]   Like Renee, like that's the stuff that I find super offensive where if you're just being
[01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:25.280]   inefficient, that's one thing.
[01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:31.000]   But you have these things where the Apple and other and Google as well, take certain
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:37.680]   pains to make sure that any any app that's be that's idle gets minimized and doesn't
[01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:39.680]   get to hog CPU resources.
[01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:43.640]   So when you add code to say, we're going to play an audio file of a tone that no human
[01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:49.040]   can hear because the OS will not stop an audio, an audio playing app.
[01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:54.600]   That's you just, you just, this is a, this is a family show, but you're your closet.
[01:34:54.600 --> 01:34:57.200]   You've just, you've just skid it into jerk behavior.
[01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:00.120]   Let's say I am this.
[01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:02.800]   This is why that's, that's just un-jutlmanly conduct.
[01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:07.400]   That this is why I don't have Facebook apps on any of my devices at all.
[01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:08.400]   Yeah.
[01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:11.520]   Because I just, I, I believe Facebook to be exactly the sort of company that would do
[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:13.600]   something like that and darn if they aren't.
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:14.600]   Yeah.
[01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:15.600]   No, it's the same thing.
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:17.680]   We all mentioned earlier, like again, not apologizing for Facebook, but they have a lot
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:22.000]   of incredibly awesome engineers who sometimes get an idea, like maybe like the security
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:23.320]   team did with error 53.
[01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:26.880]   I mean, they, they, they implemented it before thinking about the consequences of implementing
[01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:27.880]   it.
[01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:30.480]   And then like it causes a lot of bad press and you have to roll it back and it's bad
[01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:31.480]   for us.
[01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:35.920]   I feel a little bad because I recommended a program called airmail, which I've used on
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:39.400]   the Apple desktop and really like.
[01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:46.320]   And I recommend it as the most powerful iOS, iPhone, mail app I've ever seen on a yesterday
[01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:50.400]   in iOS today and it really has so many settings and features and I really like it.
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:53.400]   It's a power tool, but yet very easy to use.
[01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:54.880]   However, I got home.
[01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:58.920]   I have 23% left in my battery for the first time ever and I realized, oh, airmail's just
[01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:01.240]   been eat, hogging the battery like crazy.
[01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:05.120]   One of the worst thing is if you ever have a mail account that's got an error, like you
[01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:09.280]   forgot to pay your Google accounts bill or they can't reach the server, it often will
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:13.440]   just chug away and drain battery because the radio is just trying to connect and get your
[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:14.440]   mail over and over again.
[01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:16.360]   But that's a good tip that look at the battery.
[01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:18.120]   That's something new in iOS nine, right?
[01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:19.120]   Yeah.
[01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:22.440]   So it got better in iOS eight is sort of like the battery shaming that they launched and
[01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:26.840]   maxed into the iPhone and what they did now with breaking it down is it makes it easier
[01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:30.360]   to understand because people would see Twitter on top or tweet bot and think, oh, it's a
[01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:33.760]   battery hog not realizing they spent four hours in it today.
[01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:38.320]   So you want to compare on screen to background and unless it is streaming audio streaming
[01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:40.960]   directions or like on a boy's over IP.
[01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:45.400]   Yeah, your background should never exceed your for your foreground, certainly not by a factor
[01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:47.720]   of three, four, five, ten.
[01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:48.720]   That's good.
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:56.080]   And maybe because I had just installed it, maybe it was maybe you're somebody saying,
[01:36:56.080 --> 01:36:58.800]   oh, it's probably just because it downloaded a lot the first time.
[01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:02.360]   Your entire, yeah, your startup and that it will be better from now on.
[01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:03.920]   They had had some problems early on.
[01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:05.800]   I use airmail in the desktop and really like it.
[01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:11.080]   So they had had some problems early on and they said in the update that they had fixed
[01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:12.280]   many of the battery issues.
[01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:14.480]   So that's something a developer can do, right?
[01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:17.440]   They don't don't try to stick around in the background.
[01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:18.960]   Don't try to wake the phone up.
[01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:22.720]   Yeah, they have a lot of control over that kind of stuff.
[01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:26.480]   I don't I don't want to make a moral judgment.
[01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:33.840]   But I have to say that this is the same sort of stuff that that web marketers use to say,
[01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:39.120]   well, let's see, the user has explicitly told us by by turning on this setting that they
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:43.120]   don't want to see pop up ads, we're going to find a way to get around that because that's
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:44.720]   inconvenient for us.
[01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:48.920]   So if you're if you're developing an app for a platform that says we are going to make
[01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:50.840]   sure that you can't stay in the background.
[01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:54.160]   If you have nothing to do, we're going to find a way to get around that.
[01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:55.160]   That is jerk behavior.
[01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:59.320]   And I don't think that a developer that has decided to or excuse me, that's agreed to
[01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:02.200]   implement this is agreeing to be a jerk.
[01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:04.440]   They're not just simply finding an efficient solution to a problem.
[01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:05.440]   Right.
[01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:08.400]   Just simply saying there is a door that is locked, but we're going to break the window
[01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:09.640]   and go through that instead.
[01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:11.400]   That doesn't mean you solve the problem of the door.
[01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:14.360]   You're still breaking into a house of which is still something you shouldn't be doing.
[01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:15.360]   Fair point.
[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:16.440]   All right.
[01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:20.440]   Back of the book coming up, your tips of the week, your picks of the week.
[01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:24.760]   But first a word from dinner.
[01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:25.760]   Hungry.
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:26.760]   I'm sorry.
[01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:31.200]   See, if you took if you took those in assets, but two hours beforehand, you wouldn't be
[01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:34.760]   getting those words from dinner hours later.
[01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:36.920]   For me, blue apron is dinner.
[01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:37.920]   It's what's for dinner.
[01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:38.920]   Blue apron is so cool.
[01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:40.720]   It it doesn't cook your dinner for you.
[01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:42.440]   I don't want prepared meals.
[01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:43.440]   I've tried that.
[01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:45.800]   And a lot of times that's just not the right way to go.
[01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:47.280]   They're often frozen.
[01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:48.280]   I like to cook them.
[01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:49.280]   I like to cook.
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:53.720]   But the problem is, especially if you have a long work day shopping, meal planning, thinking
[01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:56.200]   ahead, all of that I'm very poor at.
[01:38:56.200 --> 01:39:00.160]   So I love it when I get home in the blue apron boxes on my doorstep.
[01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:01.600]   Beautiful.
[01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:04.320]   Every rest every box has three for me, three meals in it.
[01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:05.440]   You could do it differently, I guess.
[01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:08.480]   But three meals, I pick the one I'm going to make.
[01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:10.760]   There's a recipe card with pictures.
[01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:16.160]   And then every ingredient you need, exactly the right amount to make that.
[01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:19.600]   If it's a, you know, four scallions, it's four scallions.
[01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:21.920]   If you see the little bottles, it's the little bottles.
[01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:22.920]   So there's no wastage.
[01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:25.880]   You always have just what you need, no extra shopping involved.
[01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:31.080]   And you get to cook things you might never cook and become adept at it.
[01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:34.240]   And you use ingredients you may never have heard of.
[01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:37.440]   And now next time you shop, you'll know.
[01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:39.720]   And it's for less than $10 a meal.
[01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:42.840]   The ingredients are all fresh, never frozen, not even the meats are fish.
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:45.880]   They're all fresh because it's a refrigerated box.
[01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:48.600]   Everything can be prepared in 40 minutes or less.
[01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:51.120]   No more sad takeout.
[01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:54.120]   And the thing is, is that one of the things I love blue apron.
[01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:56.240]   So I love, love it.
[01:39:56.240 --> 01:39:59.640]   And the best thing about it is, is it really makes it interactive.
[01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:03.240]   When we use blue apron, we're, you know, we're all kind of cooking together.
[01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:05.240]   You know, we're having a, you know, it's great with kids.
[01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:06.240]   Yeah.
[01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:07.240]   We can do some stuff.
[01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:08.240]   We can do some stuff.
[01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:10.920]   There's just the right amount of work still left to do so that you're doing something
[01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:11.920]   with it.
[01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:13.080]   You know, it's not like you're just opening it up and throwing it up.
[01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:14.080]   No, you're cooking actually.
[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:17.600]   And it fills the, and you're learning house with delicious smells.
[01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:18.600]   That's great.
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:20.080]   And the food is so good.
[01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:24.200]   You know, and it's, you know, I'm always surprised that that could come in the mail.
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:26.680]   It's fresh ingredients from local farms.
[01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:30.680]   I mean, in every one, it's, it's just fantastic.
[01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:31.680]   I'm a huge fan.
[01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:32.680]   I know you will be too.
[01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:34.680]   So we've got it set up so you can get two free meals.
[01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:36.800]   Yes, they have a family plan.
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:46.500]   Go to blueapron.com/twitblueapron.com/twit and you can try it free right now.
[01:40:46.500 --> 01:40:47.980]   Two meals are waiting for you.
[01:40:47.980 --> 01:40:54.220]   Meals like seared cod and udon noodles with cabbage and shiitake mushroom broth, vegetable
[01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:56.120]   bebe, bebeam, bebeam, bap.
[01:40:56.120 --> 01:40:57.120]   I don't know what that is.
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:00.520]   And kimchi with the gnocchi mushrooms and roasted kallrabi.
[01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:04.520]   That's now, you may say what, but I'm telling you, by the way, you can also get online and
[01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:05.520]   tell them I don't want that.
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:06.520]   I do want that.
[01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:07.520]   I'm vegan, whatever.
[01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:09.400]   They have plans for everybody.
[01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:13.960]   Cook with just amazing fresh ingredients to make an amazing meal for your family.
[01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:18.480]   It's, I think one of the reasons I love to cook for my family is a way of sharing love
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:19.960]   and blue apron makes it easy.
[01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:26.560]   Blue apron or if you're looking for a special someone in your life, it's a great date night.
[01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:28.560]   You will impress blueapron.com/twit.
[01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:29.560]   Right?
[01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:35.240]   If you date a lot of people, you can impress them every night.
[01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:42.880]   Press them all and then get that Casper mattress in action and you're, you're a golden.
[01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:44.720]   My your mattress is comfortable.
[01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:45.960]   You should see my pillow.
[01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:49.160]   All right, ladies and gentlemen, it's time for a pick of the week.
[01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:51.160]   Let's start with the expensive guy.
[01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:52.560]   Alex, Alex Lindsay.
[01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:53.760]   I am going kind of expensive.
[01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:56.480]   He brings his own lights.
[01:41:56.480 --> 01:41:58.800]   You know, you know, the.
[01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:03.200]   So this is, I don't know if you've seen it.
[01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:05.560]   So DJI, you know, DJI makes drones, right?
[01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:06.560]   Yep.
[01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:09.960]   And they have this really cool technology, these gimbal technologies and they finally
[01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:12.560]   figured out how to take, you know, a lot of people don't want to fly the drone.
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:15.760]   It's, you know, run into their neighbors and people get upset.
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:17.000]   So they put it on a handle.
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.560]   You can see this.
[01:42:18.560 --> 01:42:19.960]   So this is the drone.
[01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:22.080]   Oh, this thing's amazing.
[01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:24.640]   Frederick Van Johnson brought it to the new screen savers.
[01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:25.640]   He introduced it to me.
[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:27.160]   So, you know, and it's.
[01:42:27.160 --> 01:42:32.240]   So, so you unfold this little guy here and this comes out and you put your iPhone in there
[01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:33.240]   as a viewer.
[01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:37.920]   You know, so that's your little iPhone grab here and then you just, you just kind of unlock
[01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:41.480]   each one of these and you unlock this one here.
[01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:42.480]   And so now it's free.
[01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:46.920]   Now it looks kind of, you know, sad, but once you turn it on, it, it jumps right into
[01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:47.920]   place.
[01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:49.480]   You know, and now it's a gimbal.
[01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:51.600]   It's an automated powered gimbal.
[01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:52.600]   Yeah.
[01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:56.400]   And so what basically, you know, you're getting, you know, and you can, you know, with your
[01:42:56.400 --> 01:42:59.440]   little thumb, you can, you can actually point it around.
[01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:03.880]   So you can control it a little bit here, here and there while you're walking around.
[01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:04.880]   And it's pretty great.
[01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:09.160]   It's like having a, you know, it's not the replacement for a steady cam for, you know,
[01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:10.160]   professional steady cam.
[01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:12.320]   My brother is a steady cam operator.
[01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:16.920]   But, but if you want something where you're going to get some great behind the scenes photos
[01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:21.760]   for your, for your YouTube video or, you know, just some things where you're doing a company,
[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:24.960]   you're going to walk through your company or the school and you want to have it like
[01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:30.520]   if you think about all those, shake it up, videos with, for the Taylor Swift, you know,
[01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:34.880]   they, when all these schools were doing it, this is like the perfect thing for that.
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:39.880]   And so anyway, it's about 600 bucks, I think, I think it's about in that, in that, in that
[01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:40.880]   way.
[01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:42.120]   So it's not, it's not free.
[01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:45.520]   We have the larger version for our larger cameras called the Ronin, which is the kind of
[01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:48.480]   the big version of it, which is a little bit more expensive.
[01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:51.280]   And, but this one, it also fits in my backpack.
[01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:54.480]   So I've been carrying it around and shooting a little behind the scenes of stuff that we're
[01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:55.480]   shooting.
[01:43:55.480 --> 01:43:57.120]   And it's, it's a lot of fun.
[01:43:57.120 --> 01:44:03.160]   So anyway, it's called the Osmo and it's O-S-M-O and it's, it's pretty cool.
[01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:06.840]   So I will, I guess the best thing I can say is that I agree with Frederick.
[01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:09.840]   Yeah, really, really cool.
[01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:10.840]   Nice.
[01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:13.480]   How about you, Renee Ritchie?
[01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:14.880]   What do you got for us?
[01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:18.600]   I've got two small picks, but first I just wanted to mention that there's new betas out
[01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:22.880]   for all the stuff, iPhone, Apple TV and the Apple TV one is really cool because it has
[01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:25.080]   a lot of sophistication and I'll use the finally word.
[01:44:25.080 --> 01:44:27.800]   So if you don't want to use that on screen keyboard anymore, hopefully that will be a
[01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:28.800]   thing of the past soon.
[01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:30.000]   You can just talk to it.
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:33.320]   I've been like a person, which is super exciting.
[01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:36.640]   Also live photos, folders, a whole bunch of really cool stuff.
[01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:40.280]   So my picks, the first one I'm going to try to demo this.
[01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:42.080]   This is a T-infuser now.
[01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:47.600]   I first saw this on my visit to Winnipeg and I promptly used it by accident to fill a candle.
[01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:52.080]   So my, my first introduction to this was not very auspicious, but what it is and I have
[01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:54.920]   to credit, et cetera, and he called well for getting me into loose tea because she kept
[01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:58.600]   putting such beautiful pictures up.
[01:44:58.600 --> 01:44:59.600]   It's a, it's not an arrow press.
[01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:02.680]   People think it's an arrow press, but basically you pour your tea into your loose tea, then
[01:45:02.680 --> 01:45:07.240]   you pour water on it, then if you happen to have a handy dandy mug available, you just
[01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:14.000]   put this on top and you let go and the liquid drains out of the infuser and goes right into
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:15.760]   the cup.
[01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:17.400]   And that makes it super convenient.
[01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:21.800]   And when you pull it off, there is no spillage or anything else of that kind.
[01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:27.560]   So it makes it super easy to brew a beautiful cup of tea at any time from really nice tea
[01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:28.560]   leaves that you happen to happen.
[01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:29.560]   Ryan, you need to get away.
[01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:30.560]   Get me one of them.
[01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:31.560]   That's cool.
[01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:32.560]   It's just, it's just cool.
[01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:33.560]   It's geeky cool.
[01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:36.480]   And someone put it on the table in front of me and they put what I thought was two tea
[01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:40.160]   cups down and it turned out it was one tea cup and like I said, the candle.
[01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:43.240]   So I put it on and I didn't pay attention and it was like there was tea everywhere,
[01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:44.560]   but also the candle went out.
[01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:48.640]   So long story short, I learned quickly how to be dexterous with these things, but now
[01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:51.720]   that I've got the hang of it, it is, it is just super awesome.
[01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:56.360]   And the other thing is last week we mentioned the music memos article that Dave Whiskis
[01:45:56.360 --> 01:45:58.560]   wrote for IMOR.
[01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:02.360]   This week he put the album, I don't know how much, he records a lot of stuff in voice
[01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:03.360]   memos.
[01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:06.880]   So this is probably before he got his hands on music memos, but his first EP with his band
[01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:09.600]   airplane mode just went up for pre-release.
[01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:12.920]   So if you want to hear the kind of stuff that people are using this technology produce
[01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:16.400]   because his stuff is all produced, I should say their stuff because there's George Tupinski
[01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:18.000]   and several other people in the band.
[01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:19.560]   It's all produced using Apple stuff.
[01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:22.840]   It's mixed in Apple technologies recorded with all these stuff.
[01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:27.640]   It's broken down on the iPhone and it's just super cool because they get really, really
[01:46:27.640 --> 01:46:28.640]   good results.
[01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:32.240]   And it's one of those examples of things that just would be super hard to do previous to
[01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:37.160]   the internet and technology age, just for an independent band to put all this stuff together.
[01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:38.160]   So.
[01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:39.160]   Nate.
[01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:40.160]   Yeah.
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:42.520]   If you want to hear the end result of what he was talking about, that's it.
[01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:44.080]   Yeah.
[01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:45.080]   Music memos.
[01:46:45.080 --> 01:46:46.080]   So cool.
[01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:47.080]   We talked about it last week in the new garage band.
[01:46:47.080 --> 01:46:48.080]   Did he use GarageBand?
[01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:49.800]   What does he use?
[01:46:49.800 --> 01:46:50.960]   These GarageBand are logic.
[01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:53.120]   I'm not sure if they use both or not.
[01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:54.120]   But it's an example of it.
[01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:56.440]   There's some apps that Apple really does a really good job on.
[01:46:56.440 --> 01:46:58.720]   And again, different teams are producing different results.
[01:46:58.720 --> 01:46:59.720]   Right.
[01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:03.760]   Andy and Akka, what do you got for us?
[01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:05.680]   Mine is just simple storage.
[01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:14.040]   I usually travel, particularly since I switched to MacBooks that have built in SSDs to supplement
[01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:17.440]   that with an SSD in an external case.
[01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:20.040]   And this was the one that I used to travel with.
[01:47:20.040 --> 01:47:27.240]   But then I recently replaced it with this, which is the Samsung portable SSD T1 for reasons
[01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:32.440]   that should be obvious because that's now, whereas this was big enough that, of course,
[01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:37.600]   it's not a big deal to carry it, but it takes up a big pocket in my laptop bag.
[01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:42.840]   Whereas this, I may as well always have this with me because it's just that small and just
[01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:43.840]   that light.
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:47.600]   It is also a USB 3.0 drive.
[01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:51.840]   And it is also super fast and it's also unlike a thumb drive, fast enough that I can actually
[01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:57.480]   use it for like my Lightroom files and my iMovie projects, which is what I generally use these
[01:47:57.480 --> 01:47:58.480]   things for.
[01:47:58.480 --> 01:47:59.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:47:59.480 --> 01:48:04.480]   And this is 512, 500 gigabytes, not that expensive either.
[01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:07.320]   The price just dropped to about $164.
[01:48:07.320 --> 01:48:09.360]   You can get them pretty much anywhere for $164.
[01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:11.360]   156 on Amazon.
[01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:12.360]   Exactly.
[01:48:12.360 --> 01:48:17.120]   You get the 250 gigabyte version for about half of that and they make them in size as
[01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:19.160]   big as a terabyte.
[01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:24.200]   I think that for me, 512 is the right size because, again, I like to be able to have
[01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:29.320]   whatever the huge pile of photos that I'm working on at any given moment, plus whatever
[01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:32.920]   huge video project I might be working on at any given moment.
[01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:39.560]   I want to have that there, plus whatever high-def Blu-ray rips that I might want to load on
[01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:42.720]   and then take off of my iPads.
[01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:45.480]   I don't have to, the great thing about having the extra storage is that I don't have to
[01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:47.720]   think about whether I want to take something with me or not.
[01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:49.120]   I'll just have it with me.
[01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:55.560]   The only caveat is that it has this really dumb thing where I've got this formatted as
[01:48:55.560 --> 01:49:00.200]   a regular Mac OS volume of like most things you buy as a pre-made drive.
[01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:04.120]   It's formatted as FAT for Windows or Mac.
[01:49:04.120 --> 01:49:10.560]   When you first plug it in, it will mount as a 128 megabyte flash drive, which will make
[01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:15.040]   you disappointed and sad until you realize that there is a Mac app that you have to double-click
[01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:20.480]   to install a special added driver that does nothing but does nothing but add, well, excuse
[01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:21.560]   me, does two things.
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:25.240]   It adds a smart ability to it.
[01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:30.920]   If it's about to fail, then it will do nothing to tell disk utility that it's about to fail.
[01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:35.040]   You can still reassure yourself that it says smart status, everything's fine.
[01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:36.040]   It doesn't do anything.
[01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:42.080]   But it also has a driver for SSD, a SCSI-SIT or something like that, which will technically
[01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:44.840]   make it run faster under certain circumstances.
[01:49:44.840 --> 01:49:51.200]   I like the idea of not having to have a special driver installed for any reasons and also
[01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:54.880]   not have to worry about what is this driver going to be doing to future compatibility of
[01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:57.120]   other software I've got on this device.
[01:49:57.120 --> 01:50:02.160]   It will not prepare it as a regular volume until you do that installation.
[01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:05.920]   But as soon as you do that, you can then click over into disk utility, reformat it as
[01:50:05.920 --> 01:50:10.080]   whatever you want, and then run a couple of pseudo commands to remove whatever drivers
[01:50:10.080 --> 01:50:12.280]   and it will mount just fine.
[01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:13.280]   That's interesting.
[01:50:13.280 --> 01:50:14.280]   Okay.
[01:50:14.280 --> 01:50:15.280]   But I like it.
[01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:21.000]   It has that really cool, like it'll identify this as a 2013 to 2015 things as that like-
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.080]   It's a size of a matchbox.
[01:50:23.080 --> 01:50:24.080]   It's so small.
[01:50:24.080 --> 01:50:25.080]   Exactly.
[01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:27.880]   You may as well have it with you.
[01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:32.640]   I'm preparing a talk I'm going to be giving at the Yosemite conference next month.
[01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:38.400]   And always, always, always, I'll have my talk all finished like a week beforehand.
[01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:41.800]   But then the night before I'll be thinking, "You know what should go there?
[01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:47.000]   Remember when I was in Boston Common and I saw that duck that was tapping at a piece
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:48.240]   of wire?
[01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:49.600]   That would be perfect here.
[01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:53.960]   And because I traveled with a- My last two months were the photos with me.
[01:50:53.960 --> 01:50:58.760]   I can now insert at 4 AM, three hours before I'm supposed to give my presentation.
[01:50:58.760 --> 01:51:01.080]   They picture the duck standing on top of a wire.
[01:51:01.080 --> 01:51:08.320]   Does anybody make a- So it uses that funny USB 3 connector on it?
[01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:09.480]   Not a standard.
[01:51:09.480 --> 01:51:11.560]   It's that weird one with a little dimple in it.
[01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:13.360]   Does anybody make that to type C?
[01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:16.760]   Because that would be so great for a MacBook.
[01:51:16.760 --> 01:51:19.960]   That would be super cool, but I haven't seen it yet.
[01:51:19.960 --> 01:51:22.200]   This model just came out last year.
[01:51:22.200 --> 01:51:24.840]   So it's still fairly fresh.
[01:51:24.840 --> 01:51:27.360]   And it's not as though it comes with this.
[01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:30.120]   It's not as though this is all that inconvenient to carry.
[01:51:30.120 --> 01:51:33.880]   But if you don't have the right cable with you, you're pretty much hosed.
[01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:36.280]   That goes into a standard USB port.
[01:51:36.280 --> 01:51:39.440]   So it would work on- You could get it in to put an adapter on it.
[01:51:39.440 --> 01:51:40.440]   You could see the USB?
[01:51:40.440 --> 01:51:41.440]   Yeah.
[01:51:41.440 --> 01:51:42.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:51:42.440 --> 01:51:43.440]   It'll work with anything.
[01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:45.080]   Does it come with a cable?
[01:51:45.080 --> 01:51:46.600]   It comes with a cable, right?
[01:51:46.600 --> 01:51:47.600]   You're all set to go.
[01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:48.600]   Nice little shirt.
[01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:52.160]   And I'm glad to see that an Antex benchmarks.
[01:51:52.160 --> 01:51:53.840]   It seemed to be spot on.
[01:51:53.840 --> 01:51:56.040]   I did some tests with it today.
[01:51:56.040 --> 01:52:00.480]   And in many cases, it's actually faster than my Thunderbolt drives.
[01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:04.400]   It's faster at reading than it is at writing.
[01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:12.560]   But even like when you're using it as, again, if you've got your lightroom library on it,
[01:52:12.560 --> 01:52:17.760]   it's still plenty fast and a lot faster than the one terabyte pocket drive spinning pocket
[01:52:17.760 --> 01:52:20.120]   drive that you might have put inside here.
[01:52:20.120 --> 01:52:24.080]   Like I said, what I like the most about these drives is I'm already getting, I already
[01:52:24.080 --> 01:52:28.560]   get the benefit of being able to like walk around and like not have to wait for the drive
[01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:32.520]   to spin down if I just want to move from the living room back to the bedroom with this
[01:52:32.520 --> 01:52:36.320]   hanging off the side of my MacBook.
[01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:38.960]   It's like I don't even have to, I don't have to wait for that to park as well.
[01:52:38.960 --> 01:52:43.040]   The number of times I've had a spinning drive attached to that and forgotten that I'm not
[01:52:43.040 --> 01:52:48.640]   allowed to simply grab the laptop and like walk downstairs to sign for the UPS guy as
[01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:49.640]   it is.
[01:52:49.640 --> 01:52:52.320]   Okay, I might have just lost 500 gigabytes worth of stuff.
[01:52:52.320 --> 01:52:53.600]   Easy come easy go.
[01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:54.600]   I feel dumb.
[01:52:54.600 --> 01:52:55.600]   I didn't know this.
[01:52:55.600 --> 01:52:58.200]   Actually, I think I knew it and forgot it.
[01:52:58.200 --> 01:53:01.920]   Because we had a Samsung phone that had that weird type C connector, you know, the one
[01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:03.160]   with the dimple.
[01:53:03.160 --> 01:53:07.120]   And John Slonina just pointed out, you know, a micro USB will go in the little part of
[01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:09.120]   the left part of it.
[01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:11.480]   So you wouldn't get USB three speeds, I presume.
[01:53:11.480 --> 01:53:13.040]   This is a step down to USB two.
[01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:16.960]   It'll work, but you want all the advantages of having a super high speed drive.
[01:53:16.960 --> 01:53:23.920]   Yeah, but if you didn't happen to have a table around, you'll get power, you'll get power,
[01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:25.520]   you'll get speed, you'll just get USB.
[01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:26.520]   Oh, that's right.
[01:53:26.520 --> 01:53:27.520]   This is bus powered.
[01:53:27.520 --> 01:53:30.520]   And it's a bus powered terabyte if you go if you go for the most expensive.
[01:53:30.520 --> 01:53:31.520]   That's nice.
[01:53:31.520 --> 01:53:32.520]   Yeah, bus powered terabytes.
[01:53:32.520 --> 01:53:33.520]   Love it.
[01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:38.440]   Yeah, the, you know, some of our guys will velcro those little drives to the back of
[01:53:38.440 --> 01:53:42.360]   the computer, you know, to your, you know, velcro, velcro on the bottom of the drive
[01:53:42.360 --> 01:53:46.400]   and velcro on the, on the, on the, on the back here and they'll just, you know, when
[01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:49.360]   they're working, they just pull it up and, and, you know, on the road and they just stick
[01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:53.080]   it to it, to, you know, just to keep, keep it.
[01:53:53.080 --> 01:53:56.280]   So it's not hanging out, you know, but, but this is so awesome.
[01:53:56.280 --> 01:53:57.280]   But this is awesome for a Mac.
[01:53:57.280 --> 01:53:58.280]   I used to SSD is over.
[01:53:58.280 --> 01:53:59.660]   And what, how awesome for a Mac book?
[01:53:59.660 --> 01:54:01.600]   I mean, it's so little.
[01:54:01.600 --> 01:54:02.600]   Particularly Mac book air.
[01:54:02.600 --> 01:54:03.600]   Yeah, you're there.
[01:54:03.600 --> 01:54:06.480]   And if you're doing, if you're doing editing, it's great to have your whole library.
[01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:10.440]   You know, you can have a drive that is named, you know, that, you know, that, that that's
[01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:15.960]   your final cut or whatever your, your, you know, your library there, all with all your
[01:54:15.960 --> 01:54:16.960]   events and everything else.
[01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:17.960]   And it's super fast.
[01:54:17.960 --> 01:54:18.960]   You're not giving anything up.
[01:54:18.960 --> 01:54:20.520]   It's, you know, the SSDs are made.
[01:54:20.520 --> 01:54:24.240]   The reason you need a special driver for it I'm reading is that it's, it's an encrypted
[01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:25.240]   drive.
[01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:26.960]   It's a, yes, 256 encryption.
[01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:30.320]   It will, you can, if you decide to use that, you can decide not to use that.
[01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:31.320]   That's what the drivers for.
[01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:35.560]   If you didn't use that, you then, then, then you don't drive or I think it'll, well, yeah,
[01:54:35.560 --> 01:54:38.320]   it'll, again, it also gives you smart support.
[01:54:38.320 --> 01:54:41.520]   And I was reading up on the standard because it wasn't the sort of thing that I just remember
[01:54:41.520 --> 01:54:42.520]   about.
[01:54:42.520 --> 01:54:44.200]   And so there are some underserved circumstances.
[01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:48.560]   I believe there are some performance enhancements, but it's not a generalized.
[01:54:48.560 --> 01:54:50.640]   It's not that it makes everything faster all the time.
[01:54:50.640 --> 01:54:54.800]   It's like at certain points of view, because Mac OS does not have a driver for this new
[01:54:54.800 --> 01:54:57.240]   standard, then it can't take advantage of it.
[01:54:57.240 --> 01:55:02.040]   But as I said, I'd much rather, I'd much rather make sure that, and not not have to
[01:55:02.040 --> 01:55:06.000]   even think or worry about being able to move this from one computer to another.
[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:11.680]   But mostly I don't like having any texts or any system extensions on my Mac book that
[01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:13.040]   I don't absolutely need.
[01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:18.360]   It has to be an absolutely killer feature for me to put any sort of a system extension
[01:55:18.360 --> 01:55:19.360]   on this machine.
[01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:22.160]   What the size is amazing.
[01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:24.600]   I know it's, I actually, I'm sorry.
[01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:28.120]   I would, I'd like to say that, well, Samsung's let me play with a prototype three months
[01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:29.760]   before it was introduced.
[01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:33.640]   Actually a neighbor of mine could not get hers started.
[01:55:33.640 --> 01:55:37.520]   And so she had me come over to see if I could fix it, because she assumed it would be just
[01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:39.160]   like any other drive she plugs it in.
[01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:41.600]   And why is it only 128 megabytes?
[01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:44.320]   It's supposed to be like a whole 256 megabytes.
[01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:45.840]   Oh my God, woman.
[01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:46.840]   What is that?
[01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:50.000]   And then I said, oh, actually, this is pretty cool.
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:51.000]   We made that.
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:52.000]   Wow.
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:53.000]   That's nice.
[01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:54.640]   So I made you a blue waper.
[01:55:54.640 --> 01:55:55.640]   I'm sorry.
[01:55:55.640 --> 01:55:58.280]   No, no, I get see.
[01:55:58.280 --> 01:56:03.440]   I'm on a very good barter system with my neighbors that like, oh, I'll fix something
[01:56:03.440 --> 01:56:05.440]   or I'll give them some advice on something.
[01:56:05.440 --> 01:56:10.480]   And then they will say, oh, by the way, we made way too much, much less lasagna last
[01:56:10.480 --> 01:56:11.480]   night.
[01:56:11.480 --> 01:56:13.280]   Would you like to take about three pounds of it home for you?
[01:56:13.280 --> 01:56:14.280]   That's what you want.
[01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:17.200]   Who are the sisters that lived upstairs from the odd couple?
[01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:18.200]   Yes.
[01:56:18.200 --> 01:56:26.480]   I'm just glad that I'm contributing to the neighborhood as the, I'm glad to have to have
[01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:31.680]   been placed in the crackpot inventor role and not here's this creepy guy at the.
[01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:32.880]   No, no, it's perfect.
[01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:36.800]   He doesn't leave the seat doesn't leave the house a whole lot.
[01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:41.000]   He just got a bicycle, but he seems to have trouble holding it up.
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.480]   No, that's nice.
[01:56:43.480 --> 01:56:45.240]   Nothing like leftover lasagna.
[01:56:45.240 --> 01:56:46.240]   Yes.
[01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:47.240]   Made with love.
[01:56:47.240 --> 01:56:50.160]   Andy and I goes to the Chicago Sun times.
[01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:55.640]   That's where you'll find his scribbling, but you also find his blog at cwob.com.
[01:56:55.640 --> 01:56:58.160]   And of course he joins us each and every week.
[01:56:58.160 --> 01:56:59.160]   He does a knock.
[01:56:59.160 --> 01:57:01.920]   He's all my neck and five by five.
[01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:03.640]   And you're elsewhere as well, right?
[01:57:03.640 --> 01:57:04.640]   You do other shows.
[01:57:04.640 --> 01:57:05.640]   What else do you do?
[01:57:05.640 --> 01:57:07.120]   Yeah, I do a bunch of others.
[01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:15.080]   I've also do a weekly show about Google for relay dot FM material with Yasmin and Russell
[01:57:15.080 --> 01:57:18.160]   Lavonak who the creator of pocket cast, by the way.
[01:57:18.160 --> 01:57:22.280]   So I was just doing the show notes.
[01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:25.880]   I had to add stuff about Apple and had to add stuff about it.
[01:57:25.880 --> 01:57:27.320]   It's a, it's, we're having a lot of fun.
[01:57:27.320 --> 01:57:31.200]   All of my love pocket cast, we recommend it all the time, both iOS and Android.
[01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:36.800]   Yeah, that's, it became, it's, it's definitely my standard across all blood.
[01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:40.880]   We also love Mr. Alex Lindsey was so nice to have you in studio today.
[01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:41.880]   Alex.
[01:57:41.880 --> 01:57:44.360]   This works great.
[01:57:44.360 --> 01:57:48.360]   I think we'll move to that camera.
[01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:50.840]   I bet, I bet Leo would love to see that new camera.
[01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:52.680]   Why don't you hand it over?
[01:57:52.680 --> 01:57:54.680]   Yeah, just give it to me there.
[01:57:54.680 --> 01:57:55.680]   Yeah.
[01:57:55.680 --> 01:57:57.000]   He's even got the leather chair.
[01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:58.000]   That's perfect.
[01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:03.320]   Oh, that's very, just here, here, here, here.
[01:58:03.320 --> 01:58:05.360]   Just just, oh yeah, I'll take it.
[01:58:05.360 --> 01:58:06.360]   That's good.
[01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:07.360]   Thank you.
[01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:08.360]   We had, we had planned this out.
[01:58:08.360 --> 01:58:11.880]   This is what we could have, we could have done a really cool thing.
[01:58:11.880 --> 01:58:13.400]   pixelacord.com, best thing to do.
[01:58:13.400 --> 01:58:14.840]   Follow them on Twitter.
[01:58:14.840 --> 01:58:17.120]   The final cut user group is that soon?
[01:58:17.120 --> 01:58:18.120]   Yes.
[01:58:18.120 --> 01:58:22.320]   I just tweeted it out on my Twitter account and we're going to be using our little question
[01:58:22.320 --> 01:58:24.840]   engine and we start in about 45 minutes.
[01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:25.840]   Awesome.
[01:58:25.840 --> 01:58:26.840]   Thank you.
[01:58:26.840 --> 01:58:29.120]   And so if you want to check that out, you know, if you have questions about Final Cut
[01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:33.400]   or you just want to see us go along, it's a great group of guys that are much smarter
[01:58:33.400 --> 01:58:34.600]   than I am when it comes to Final Cut.
[01:58:34.600 --> 01:58:35.720]   It's like the world experts.
[01:58:35.720 --> 01:58:37.640]   So come check it out.
[01:58:37.640 --> 01:58:39.280]   Alex L.I.N.D.
[01:58:39.280 --> 01:58:40.280]   S.A.Y.
[01:58:40.280 --> 01:58:41.560]   on Twitter.
[01:58:41.560 --> 01:58:43.640]   And oh, by the way, and also check out the Metallica show.
[01:58:43.640 --> 01:58:45.200]   It was quite nice.
[01:58:45.200 --> 01:58:48.800]   Did, oh, it was the stream was excellent.
[01:58:48.800 --> 01:58:49.800]   Yes.
[01:58:49.800 --> 01:58:50.800]   Yes, it was.
[01:58:50.800 --> 01:58:51.800]   The stream.
[01:58:51.800 --> 01:58:55.160]   They must have had some really good people behind the scenes.
[01:58:55.160 --> 01:59:01.560]   It would have taken a lot to stream a great stream like that to YouTube and probably
[01:59:01.560 --> 01:59:04.520]   would have hired a very good streaming company.
[01:59:04.520 --> 01:59:07.240]   Must have managed to really know what they were doing.
[01:59:07.240 --> 01:59:08.240]   Is that still up on YouTube?
[01:59:08.240 --> 01:59:09.240]   Could you watch it?
[01:59:09.240 --> 01:59:10.240]   Yes, it is.
[01:59:10.240 --> 01:59:11.240]   I don't know how long they're going to keep it up there.
[01:59:11.240 --> 01:59:16.360]   So you should definitely, if you're interested in seeing a great rock show, definitely check
[01:59:16.360 --> 01:59:17.360]   it out.
[01:59:17.360 --> 01:59:18.360]   You know, so it's great.
[01:59:18.360 --> 01:59:20.840]   I mean, the band was on fire.
[01:59:20.840 --> 01:59:22.480]   The night before Super Bowl.
[01:59:22.480 --> 01:59:23.480]   Yeah.
[01:59:23.480 --> 01:59:24.880]   Did you get to talk to the guys?
[01:59:24.880 --> 01:59:26.560]   No, no, I didn't.
[01:59:26.560 --> 01:59:27.560]   But I did.
[01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:28.560]   I did.
[01:59:28.560 --> 01:59:30.160]   I did walk out on stage with the Theta.
[01:59:30.160 --> 01:59:31.200]   So I was so sorry.
[01:59:31.200 --> 01:59:33.200]   I want to see the Theta.
[01:59:33.200 --> 01:59:34.360]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:59:34.360 --> 01:59:38.160]   So but it was, yeah, pretty amazing.
[01:59:38.160 --> 01:59:39.160]   Pretty amazing.
[01:59:39.160 --> 01:59:42.760]   Now, did you, you did this the stream, not the camera?
[01:59:42.760 --> 01:59:45.360]   They probably had the camera workers.
[01:59:45.360 --> 01:59:46.960]   They have their own crew for that.
[01:59:46.960 --> 01:59:50.360]   And they, it's an amazing crew.
[01:59:50.360 --> 01:59:53.520]   Marcia, who's the, who's the TD for this is just, she's been working with them for a
[01:59:53.520 --> 01:59:54.520]   long time.
[01:59:54.520 --> 01:59:59.080]   That makes sense when, but when fans tour, they actually typically, we, we, I knew some
[01:59:59.080 --> 02:00:00.960]   of the people would go around with the Rolling Stones.
[02:00:00.960 --> 02:00:02.840]   They used to work at Tech TV.
[02:00:02.840 --> 02:00:07.280]   They typically bring their own crew, director, camera guys, everybody, because they know
[02:00:07.280 --> 02:00:08.280]   the show.
[02:00:08.280 --> 02:00:09.280]   Right.
[02:00:09.280 --> 02:00:10.280]   Yeah.
[02:00:10.280 --> 02:00:11.280]   And she knows when she's going to be going to those things and she's worked with them for
[02:00:11.280 --> 02:00:12.280]   a long time.
[02:00:12.280 --> 02:00:14.160]   And she's in any music event.
[02:00:14.160 --> 02:00:18.360]   We try to get her on because, you know, she just really gets music, you know, and, and
[02:00:18.360 --> 02:00:21.160]   so, but it's a, you know, and she's calling, you know, she's telling all these camera
[02:00:21.160 --> 02:00:22.160]   operators what she wants.
[02:00:22.160 --> 02:00:24.680]   And, you know, all those zooms and turns and everything else.
[02:00:24.680 --> 02:00:26.800]   You know, it's, it's actually really fun.
[02:00:26.800 --> 02:00:30.720]   I tried to persuade her to let us record her calling the show and she wasn't interested,
[02:00:30.720 --> 02:00:32.720]   but it was, it's, it's sad.
[02:00:32.720 --> 02:00:34.520]   I'd love to see a show like this.
[02:00:34.520 --> 02:00:35.520]   Yeah.
[02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:40.160]   Directors often don't want any, any recordings in the booth because they can get a little
[02:00:40.160 --> 02:00:41.160]   dusty.
[02:00:41.160 --> 02:00:42.160]   Yeah.
[02:00:42.160 --> 02:00:43.160]   Yeah.
[02:00:43.160 --> 02:00:46.040]   So it's very, it's, it's quite a thing to listen to.
[02:00:46.040 --> 02:00:48.360]   So anyway, it's, it's a great show.
[02:00:48.360 --> 02:00:49.360]   It's up there.
[02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:50.360]   I don't know how long it's going to be up there.
[02:00:50.360 --> 02:00:52.840]   So people, if you want to check it out, check it out.
[02:00:52.840 --> 02:00:53.840]   Wow.
[02:00:53.840 --> 02:00:54.840]   Yeah.
[02:00:54.840 --> 02:00:56.080]   You see, whoever did that streaming did an excellent job.
[02:00:56.080 --> 02:00:58.000]   It was flawless.
[02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:02.240]   And I know there were a lot of people watching because I get to see a live Metallica concert
[02:01:02.240 --> 02:01:04.520]   free is pretty sweet.
[02:01:04.520 --> 02:01:06.000]   Yeah, it's cool.
[02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:07.360]   By the way, they're also on billions.
[02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:10.040]   They're on this week's episode of Billions.
[02:01:10.040 --> 02:01:13.920]   He flies his private jet to Quebec City.
[02:01:13.920 --> 02:01:17.400]   He's a, he's only going to perform one North American concert.
[02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:19.120]   It's tonight in Quebec.
[02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:20.120]   And we're going.
[02:01:20.120 --> 02:01:23.920]   And he's, you should have said tonight in San Francisco.
[02:01:23.920 --> 02:01:24.920]   I know.
[02:01:24.920 --> 02:01:26.520]   And then, and then I'm watching it.
[02:01:26.520 --> 02:01:30.120]   All of a sudden there's James and he's talking to him.
[02:01:30.120 --> 02:01:31.600]   And then the whole band starts playing.
[02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:32.600]   It's pretty hot.
[02:01:32.600 --> 02:01:34.000]   Like a backstage is pretty cool.
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:35.000]   Yeah.
[02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:36.000]   Wow.
[02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:37.000]   Look at this.
[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:38.000]   Man, was that a show?
[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:39.240]   They give, they do a great show.
[02:01:39.240 --> 02:01:40.240]   Yeah.
[02:01:40.240 --> 02:01:41.240]   Really, really great.
[02:01:41.240 --> 02:01:42.240]   I, I, yeah.
[02:01:42.240 --> 02:01:46.200]   And the stream, the screen and the screen that behind them is amazing.
[02:01:46.200 --> 02:01:47.200]   Is it?
[02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:48.200]   It is like 50 feet higher.
[02:01:48.200 --> 02:01:49.200]   Yeah.
[02:01:49.200 --> 02:01:50.200]   Or more.
[02:01:50.200 --> 02:01:53.880]   And in this big LED, and when you get these wide shots, it's just unbelievable what they
[02:01:53.880 --> 02:01:54.880]   have going on in those industry.
[02:01:54.880 --> 02:01:55.880]   That's the new thing.
[02:01:55.880 --> 02:02:01.040]   Every, I mean, the screens have transformed live concerts because you don't need a big
[02:02:01.040 --> 02:02:02.040]   set.
[02:02:02.040 --> 02:02:03.040]   You can make it look like anything.
[02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:04.040]   Yeah.
[02:02:04.040 --> 02:02:06.600]   It would compress a little bit better if they didn't have them right behind them.
[02:02:06.600 --> 02:02:07.600]   Right.
[02:02:07.600 --> 02:02:10.760]   You'll see that things break up a little bit because the one you would buy a video.
[02:02:10.760 --> 02:02:11.760]   Let's not have a.
[02:02:11.760 --> 02:02:12.760]   It doesn't compress well.
[02:02:12.760 --> 02:02:13.760]   Yeah.
[02:02:13.760 --> 02:02:14.760]   Yeah.
[02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:15.760]   Yeah.
[02:02:15.760 --> 02:02:19.480]   But they, I mean, for the, for the crowd, it's just an amazing experience.
[02:02:19.480 --> 02:02:20.480]   Yeah.
[02:02:20.480 --> 02:02:21.480]   It was quite a thing.
[02:02:21.480 --> 02:02:23.800]   And they had fireworks and bought, they had these big football stuff.
[02:02:23.800 --> 02:02:24.800]   People were bouncing around at the end.
[02:02:24.800 --> 02:02:25.800]   It was nice.
[02:02:25.800 --> 02:02:26.800]   It was very nice.
[02:02:26.800 --> 02:02:31.080]   Renee Richie is at imore.com near to Quebec City.
[02:02:31.080 --> 02:02:32.080]   Yeah.
[02:02:32.080 --> 02:02:35.120]   Montreal, a few more south.
[02:02:35.120 --> 02:02:36.800]   And he joins us every week.
[02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:40.600]   And it's always great to have all, you know, all three of you.
[02:02:40.600 --> 02:02:41.720]   It's just makes this show.
[02:02:41.720 --> 02:02:42.720]   So thank you.
[02:02:42.720 --> 02:02:47.840]   It's a real privilege for me to sit here and listen to the real Mac experts, the real
[02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:49.840]   Apple experts.
[02:02:49.840 --> 02:02:51.840]   We do it every Tuesday, 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m.
[02:02:51.840 --> 02:03:01.320]   Eastern time, 21, I'm sorry, 1900 UTC live.tuit.tv or tuit.tv/live both the work.
[02:03:01.320 --> 02:03:05.840]   We use different players on different pages that way because some of our sublime player,
[02:03:05.840 --> 02:03:11.640]   which is on our main site, is blocked apparently by government and military installations.
[02:03:11.640 --> 02:03:17.360]   So if you can't get through on the live.tuit.tv/live, try live.tuit.tv.
[02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:20.920]   But if you can't watch live, of course, you can always watch After the Fact because we
[02:03:20.920 --> 02:03:28.320]   make on-demand audio and video available at tuit.tv/mbw for Mac Break Weekly, but also
[02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:32.400]   wherever you subscribe to Pocketcast to be a good choice or one of the Twitter apps on
[02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:33.400]   every platform.
[02:03:33.400 --> 02:03:34.400]   Thanks for being here.
[02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:36.400]   Back to work though because you know what?
[02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:42.920]   Time is over!
[02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:45.500]   (upbeat music)
[02:03:45.500 --> 02:03:47.560]   you
