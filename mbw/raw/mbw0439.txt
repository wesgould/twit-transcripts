[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.240]   And updates, updates, updates for iOS and OS X.
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.880]   I'll tell you what's new.

[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.880]   Of course, this week, I'm thinking we blew it.
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.280]   We should have just flip-flopped to Steve Gibson, because the Big Mac News, as every quarter,
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.320]   will come out after the market closes.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.400]   Apple's earnings will talk about it in a second.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.080]   At least we can give you some predictions.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.120]   Andy Inako is here from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.220]   Great to have you.
[00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.220]   Andrew?
[00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.220]   Look at that.
[00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.200]   We got some again at the back.
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.200]   Yeah.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.520]   I planned to do this anyway, but I was expecting the original forecast was that because it was
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.560]   going to still be hammering down, hammering down, hammering down until late afternoon.
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.700]   So I thought, "Okay, well, if I'm going to be Jack Nicholson at the end of the Shining,
[00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.800]   at least let's get a podcast out of it."
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:29.400]   But it's actually, it's tamed down so much that as of an hour ago, we actually had neighborhood
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.360]   kids in my backyard sledding.
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.360]   Wow.
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.360]   Looks good.
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.020]   That's pretty.
[00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.060]   It looks like the scene in White Christmas where they haven't had snow in Vermont all
[00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.740]   season and they, at the end of the play in White Christmas, they open the back of the
[00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:45.740]   barn and it's snowing.
[00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.920]   I'm just sorry I don't have the Santa Claus leisure suit that Bing Crosby was wearing
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.420]   to that final scene.
[00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.700]   Exactly right.
[00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.260]   Also with this Mr. Renee Ritchie from Morayal, where snow is just a way of life.
[00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.580]   We left the back door open again.
[00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.580]   I'm so sorry about that.
[00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:03.580]   He's so sorry.
[00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.100]   He's hunkered down as usual.
[00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.820]   That's okay because former hockey player snuck in through the back door while you get
[00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:09.820]   it open.
[00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.340]   Please, close the back door.
[00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.700]   Renee is at iMoor.com and also I'm glad to see joining us from Washington, D.C., where
[00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:26.300]   I understand he just last night flew a DJI phantom drone into the White House grounds.
[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.140]   Alex Lindsey of the Pixel Corps.
[00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.220]   No, I had nothing to do with that.
[00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.180]   I just want to say for the record.
[00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.220]   At least no one can prove it.
[00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:43.500]   That is a strange story because it was apparently a government employee who flew at two in the
[00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.180]   morning was recreationally flying his DJI phantom.
[00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.180]   But the best thing is this snapshot from the Secret Service.
[00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.500]   The Secret Service showed the drone that crashed on the south.
[00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.580]   It's a DJI phantom.
[00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.220]   I recognize that drone.
[00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.340]   And I think the technical term now is former government employee.
[00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.740]   They say that he's facing no charges.
[00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.740]   I don't know if basically no charges and getting fired or treated very differently.
[00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:11.740]   That's true.
[00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.620]   You thought it was difficult getting your Frisbee back from the old man next door.
[00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.780]   You're not getting a lot of crap on those guys.
[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.540]   I have some sympathy because I got my first drone a couple of days ago.
[00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.180]   We're going to have a drone lesson with Father Robert Balsar Wednesday afternoon after this
[00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.860]   weekend Google by the way you're all invited.
[00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.340]   We're going to do it indoors.
[00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.340]   I thought I'd get ready.
[00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.420]   So I got my SEMA and I got it all ready.
[00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.220]   My back, we have some space out there.
[00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.460]   So I went out back, turned it up, dawn goes up and up and up.
[00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.460]   It's like a helium balloon.
[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.020]   I can't get it to move or go down.
[00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.860]   It just goes straight out of the eyesight, straight up.
[00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:52.860]   That was it.
[00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.860]   I'm not going to go down.
[00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:00.060]   I was looking closely to see if this was a SEMA because I thought maybe it ended up
[00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.060]   in the Oohay House lawn.
[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.780]   But no, it's not hysterical.
[00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:09.380]   There's got as these kids become more sophisticated and more expensive, there's got to be someone
[00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.220]   figuring out how to have a second controller somewhere that can override yours and just
[00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.540]   have it land inside the back of your van and then you drive away with it.
[00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.300]   Well, it's too small to be picked up by the radar apparently that's protecting the Oohay
[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.300]   House.
[00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.740]   The reason I thought of this is right behind Alex, you could easily fly a drone over there.
[00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:28.740]   Yes, yes.
[00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.540]   Well, I'm actually surprised it didn't happen sooner.
[00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.740]   When you think about how many people are using drones, that something didn't end up in the
[00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:36.740]   White House lawn.
[00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.700]   It's a good place to shoot.
[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.300]   Of course, everyone's afraid of the guys on top of the roof.
[00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.100]   I think that might be what's slowing them down.
[00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.820]   The Secret Service agent who was posted on the Southgrounds of the White House heard and
[00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.060]   observed the drone, but they were unable to bring it down.
[00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:58.020]   I wonder if there was some shooting before passed over the White House fence and struck
[00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.620]   a tree.
[00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.300]   The drone was too small and flying too low to be detected by a radar and could easily
[00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.420]   have been confused for a large bird.
[00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:13.980]   The agency said the employee, a government employee, not identified by the Secret Service
[00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:19.740]   was flying the object near the White House around 3 AM for recreational purposes.
[00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.820]   When he lost control of it, officials did not explain why the man who does not work
[00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.380]   at the White House and who has not been charged with a crime was flying the drone at that
[00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.380]   hour for the lulls.
[00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:29.860]   For the lulls.
[00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.180]   But it actually is a very serious thing because that drone could have a payload.
[00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.860]   I mean, it's not, yeah, I mean, it is serious.
[00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.620]   We live in a strange age.
[00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:43.460]   I was not losing someone 3D prints a drone and then sends it on an nefarious mission.
[00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:44.460]   Right.
[00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.100]   It could happen.
[00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.100]   Yeah.
[00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.100]   Because that's so much use than just buying one.
[00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.100]   Well, they're going to start monitoring the drones, Andy.
[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.100]   The printer is right.
[00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.860]   If you print it, you can print it safely.
[00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.100]   Well, then they monitor the servos.
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.500]   Here's an article in dig.com.
[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:04.780]   I haven't even read the article, but I like that the headline, "Do not strap Roman candles
[00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:05.780]   to your drone."
[00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:06.780]   Is the headline.
[00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.780]   Oh, is there a lesson learned video?
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:15.140]   Yeah, there is after this commercial in 3, 2, 1.
[00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.340]   Or do it because then, because you're an idiot who shouldn't have a drone and then you
[00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.340]   won't have a drone anymore.
[00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.340]   So I totally underscore.
[00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:26.980]   But don't you, aren't you tempted to strap Roman candles?
[00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.180]   There are the drones.
[00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:29.980]   You're a drone.
[00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:34.940]   Anything that costs more than $13 that I paid for.
[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.180]   Those are Roman candles.
[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.380]   This can only end poorly.
[00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.380]   This is the kind of thing Alex Lindsay would do.
[00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:41.900]   This looks like episode 1 footage.
[00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:42.900]   Lasers.
[00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:44.620]   I'm really into lasers.
[00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.460]   Whoa, shooting at him.
[00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:48.460]   That's too--
[00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:49.860]   I'm going to play it.
[00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:51.420]   And weaponized drone.
[00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:52.900]   Oh my god.
[00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:53.900]   This is true.
[00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:54.900]   No guidance.
[00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:55.900]   No guidance package at all.
[00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:56.900]   Oh, yeah, exactly.
[00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:57.900]   Oh, gets him in the head.
[00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:59.860]   It's good he's wearing a helmet.
[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:00.860]   Oh.
[00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:01.860]   Ah.
[00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:02.860]   Ah.
[00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:03.860]   Bad words.
[00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.340]   Does this end in a Darwin award?
[00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:06.340]   I just--
[00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:09.300]   This is like this really ought to.
[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.380]   How do you get remote controlled Roman candles?
[00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.380]   That's what I'd like to know.
[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.380]   I'm just waiting hard.
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:15.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:23.820]   You did not watch enough Wally Coyote as a shot.
[00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.820]   I'm sorry.
[00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:30.500]   It is great with the little-- what appears to be kind of like a tracer action going on.
[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.500]   Yeah.
[00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.300]   I mean, it looks like a gunship.
[00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:34.300]   It's good video.
[00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:36.980]   I am kind of disappointed that I didn't do that first.
[00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:37.980]   Think of that.
[00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:38.980]   I know.
[00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:41.180]   This is an Alex Lindsey right there.
[00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:44.340]   This pretty much is a flavor of my childhood.
[00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:46.300]   Who are you going to get though?
[00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:47.300]   Your kid brother obviously.
[00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.300]   Oh, it's the younger brother.
[00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.580]   It's the younger brother.
[00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:55.100]   And usually it has something to do with you get to watch your movie first.
[00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.100]   Right.
[00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.260]   OK, but you get to wear the helmet.
[00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:02.380]   While I come at you with the drone, I'm with Roman candles.
[00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.580]   But it has me backed up with something that's something related to.
[00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:05.980]   I don't even think this is going to work.
[00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:06.980]   I'm right.
[00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:07.980]   Don't worry.
[00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:08.980]   You're safe.
[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:09.980]   But just in case we're in this helmet.
[00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:10.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:15.260]   All right, later today, Apple's quarterly earnings will come out.
[00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.620]   These are the big ones, right?
[00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:19.780]   The holiday quarter.
[00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.580]   Q1 2015.
[00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:23.660]   Q1 first earnings of the year.
[00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:27.740]   But because Apple has a fiscal year that does not correspond to the calendar year.
[00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:31.420]   You know, it's almost always a blowout in Q1.
[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:35.820]   Now, you said, Renee, last time we talked that Apple no longer sandbags the analysts
[00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:39.020]   with lower than expectations than they really have.
[00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:42.620]   Well, I guess you can call it sandbag or you can call it being conservative with your estimates.
[00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:44.820]   And they came from a long tradition of not performing well.
[00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.260]   So they had a habit of being super conservative.
[00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:48.260]   So Apple told Wall Street.
[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.260]   They were making money.
[00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:56.260]   Apple told Wall Street to expect total sales growth of 15% from 63.
[00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.620]   And a half to 66.5 billion somewhere in that range.
[00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:03.060]   Which I think is pretty amazing when you think about it.
[00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:08.140]   For them to look out a quarter, I don't even know what I'm going to make in two months
[00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:09.140]   from now or a month from now.
[00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:14.380]   And so I always look at it like for them to be able to accurately say within six or eight
[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:18.820]   percent, it's pretty-- for a consumer product that you're releasing, you don't know how it's
[00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.300]   going to be taken.
[00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:21.820]   You don't know all those things.
[00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:23.820]   For them to make those models actually pretty interesting.
[00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:25.060]   And this is an interesting graph.
[00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:32.780]   This is from Fortune Magazine where they show revenue projected by-- well, Apple's guidance.
[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:33.780]   That's the white dots, the amateurs.
[00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:35.380]   I don't know who those are.
[00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:36.620]   That's the green dots, the pros.
[00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.700]   That's the blue dots and the actual is the yellow bar.
[00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:41.980]   And this is probably really smart people who don't happen to work for a financial institution.
[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:42.980]   Yeah.
[00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:43.980]   Point like the Horace Daddios and the--
[00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:44.980]   Those are the amateurs.
[00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:45.980]   Yeah.
[00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:46.980]   Yeah.
[00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:51.500]   I would call Horace a pro much more frankly reliable than some of the Gardener Group folks.
[00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.380]   But OK.
[00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:56.380]   So it's kind of as you pointed out, Renee.
[00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:58.420]   It's been pretty close.
[00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:02.700]   Apple's guidance has actually been pretty close to the actual results.
[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.860]   And they switched to no longer deferring as much income as they used to, which has made
[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:06.860]   it easier for people to understand.
[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:10.860]   Well, they don't-- they don't defer, but they report the non-gap numbers as well now.
[00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.140]   It's easier to understand.
[00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:14.340]   Last quarter though, they were pretty low.
[00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:15.340]   They low-balled it.
[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:22.900]   So we'll see what-- is there anything to look for in the quarterly results when they
[00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:23.900]   come out?
[00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:25.300]   They'll be out in about an hour and a half.
[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:26.300]   iPad numbers.
[00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:27.300]   I mean, that's--
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:28.700]   If they break those out, right?
[00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:29.700]   They usually do.
[00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:30.900]   They have traditionally do.
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:32.620]   They haven't not broken them out ever before.
[00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:35.020]   And it would be kind of odd if they didn't.
[00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:38.340]   Also how much the iPhone-- one of the big questions with the iPhone is how many can they
[00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:39.340]   make?
[00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:40.340]   It's not how many they can sell anymore.
[00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.540]   But I believe last quarter, they were constrained not by how many people bought, but how many
[00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:47.180]   they could physically produce and that lowered the number from what-- I think it was from
[00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.860]   70 down to 50 based on the projections.
[00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:50.860]   That's--
[00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:51.860]   That makes sense though.
[00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:55.180]   It's still really they sell everyone they can make at this point.
[00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:56.180]   You don't see anywhere with--
[00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:58.900]   Oh, we're blowing them out to the bare walls.
[00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:01.180]   Hundreds of iPhones in the back.
[00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:04.420]   I love Phillips' remark at the bottom there where he says that Apple's quarters are now
[00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:08.380]   as big as-- the only companies that can compete with Apple quarter wise are oligopoly companies
[00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.220]   that control fossil fuel resources.
[00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:11.940]   And even then, only the top two.
[00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:12.940]   Yeah.
[00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:13.940]   Yeah.
[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:14.940]   Yeah.
[00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:15.940]   It's pretty impressive.
[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:18.660]   Well, and we're still looking at-- I don't know whether it'll be this quarter or not,
[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.820]   but we're still looking at a whole new brand-- I mean, a whole new product line coming
[00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:23.660]   out in this quarter.
[00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:27.260]   So I think that they definitely are going to be-- and there's a lot of possibilities
[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.980]   whether it's updates to the Apple TV, updates to the iPad.
[00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:34.380]   You know, there's so many things that are sitting out in front of them that this year
[00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:36.380]   doesn't look like it's going to slow down.
[00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:38.380]   Right.
[00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.260]   Get ready for the big one, says business.
[00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.740]   That was Philip Elmer DeWitt.
[00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.220]   This is J. Arrow.
[00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:46.140]   Get ready for the big one.
[00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:53.380]   He has, interestingly, the same picture of Tim Cook signaling a touchdown, apparently.
[00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:57.700]   There's a couple publications that can go from Doom to Triumph and so quickly back and
[00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:59.900]   forth that you really have to remember what he's doing.
[00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:01.060]   Apple's winning.
[00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:02.060]   Apple's-- yeah.
[00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:03.060]   I hate the iPhone.
[00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:04.060]   I love you.
[00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:05.060]   Yeah.
[00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:07.860]   So before PM Eastern, so we're about an hour and a half.
[00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:11.380]   You know, if we'd really draw this out, we might be able to get to the earnings.
[00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:17.300]   They usually release it on press release beforehand, so we might have--
[00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:18.300]   130 Pacific.
[00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:19.300]   Yeah.
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.860]   Yeah, maybe we won't make it.
[00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:22.820]   Well, it'll happen during security now.
[00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:26.020]   Next quarter, I'll flip-flop.
[00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:29.940]   Clearly, we-- I mean-- so that's the thing to watch.
[00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:34.900]   iPad sales, they've been tailing off to-- will this be yet another slow quarter for iPad sales?
[00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.660]   That'll be important to watch.
[00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:42.660]   By the way, it's about-- in just case you're wondering, about $25,000 a second.
[00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.900]   Is that how much they make?
[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:45.900]   That's what it's about.
[00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:46.900]   Revenue, you just did the math.
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.460]   I didn't do it.
[00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:49.900]   I did not do it in my head, though.
[00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:51.740]   $25,000 a second.
[00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:52.740]   Another $25,000.
[00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:53.740]   Another $25,000.
[00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:55.660]   Oh my god.
[00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:56.660]   Yeah.
[00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:58.620]   That's pretty good.
[00:13:58.620 --> 00:13:59.620]   That's pretty challenging.
[00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:01.300]   It's a good business model.
[00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:02.780]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:06.340]   Do you think we'll look for a Big Mac quarter?
[00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.340]   There weren't really new Macs.
[00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:11.820]   Oh, I forgot the iMac.
[00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:12.820]   In the new Mac Mini.
[00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:13.820]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:16.820]   And I think the laptops are still going to be popular.
[00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:18.180]   So it might be a big quarter for the Mac.
[00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:22.020]   I bet that iMac, the 5K iMac sold well.
[00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:26.940]   But do desktop really-- but do desktop really have the ability to move that kind of profit
[00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:30.820]   now that you're chasing against products that sell in the millions and still make that
[00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:34.500]   40% profit margin?
[00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.060]   It's iPhone, iPhone, iPhone.
[00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:39.460]   I mean, I think that really-- I know that you used to say that the Apple TV was a hobby,
[00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.660]   but I think that the desktops are getting to be pretty close to a hobby.
[00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.540]   No, don't say it, man.
[00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:45.540]   Shut your mouth.
[00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:46.540]   Just saying.
[00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:47.540]   I'm just--
[00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:48.540]   Oh, no, you didn't.
[00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:49.540]   I have a lot of them.
[00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.500]   You know, it's like I have a big investment in that hobby.
[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:52.500]   Don't say that.
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:58.420]   When you look at it, I mean, if they stop making desktops, it would go down little, but not
[00:14:58.420 --> 00:14:59.420]   much.
[00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:02.580]   But it would still be a huge business if someone just made Macs, which is the crazy thing.
[00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:03.580]   Right.
[00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:04.580]   Yeah.
[00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:05.580]   That's a good point.
[00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:08.340]   It's a business if all it was was Macs.
[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:12.500]   It only doesn't seem so important based because of the iPhone's huge success.
[00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.660]   Such a show off overshadowing the poor Mac.
[00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:15.660]   It can't get in the light.
[00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:16.660]   It can't get in the light.
[00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:18.100]   It can't get in the low.
[00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:19.100]   Now I'm bigger.
[00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:20.100]   Look at me.
[00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:22.860]   The Unix in your pocket.
[00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:26.820]   So let's talk about the future.
[00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:32.500]   Stronger rumors now based on a Apple patent filing for it, pressure sensitive pen that
[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:40.020]   Apple might be doing a iPad Pro 12.9 inch iPad with a touch sensitive pen, perhaps as
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:42.860]   an add on or maybe included.
[00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:44.340]   I'd love to see one that really works.
[00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:49.300]   I mean, I think I have half the pens that they make for the iPad trying to get really
[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:51.580]   the right solution that would solve that.
[00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:54.780]   And number one is it'd be great to have it be something that works OS wide.
[00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:59.100]   You know, a lot of these pens are only work with this application or that application.
[00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.740]   And also they're all a little wonky.
[00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:05.900]   You know, none of them really work the way you want to pressure sensitive pen to work
[00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:06.900]   in my opinion.
[00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:12.260]   So having Apple integrate something I think would be great, not great for Wacom.
[00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:17.900]   Well, maybe great for Wacom because, you know, the Galaxy Note uses a Wacom digitizer.
[00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.980]   It might be that Apple, well, is that the kind of thing Apple would do or would they
[00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.340]   just make their own?
[00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:25.780]   I think they're also trying to solve a different problem.
[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:30.060]   I don't think that they need to have 1024 to 2048 levels of sensitivity.
[00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:34.540]   I think that the old fashioned 256 or 128 is probably enough.
[00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:38.220]   I mean, most of the time what I do with my Wacom is actually not much art.
[00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:42.420]   It's actually marking up drawings or marking up plans and so on and so forth.
[00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:45.540]   And I think that there's a lot of utility there that, you know, it doesn't have to be
[00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:48.260]   an art program to be useful.
[00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.860]   It depends on what, on how they try to sell it.
[00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:53.260]   I think there are two different ways to have a pen on a tablet.
[00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:57.420]   One is to do stuff that you're talking about where people just want to be able to mark something
[00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:00.140]   up and annotate things, which is incredibly useful.
[00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:05.420]   I'm doing, I'm working with somebody designing book covers for something I'm working on.
[00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:11.340]   And I'm about to like just put this into my drawing app and do, you know, and just like
[00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:12.740]   use the mouse to add stuff.
[00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:16.740]   But then so, well, actually I have like this, I want to just open this to my iPad, use PDF
[00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:20.940]   pen and just draw and just that's, this is done in like five seconds and intuitively.
[00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:23.860]   So that is an important thing as well as using as a note taker.
[00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:29.300]   And I think that there's so many people who are artists who use them, the Mac on a professional
[00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:34.340]   basis that it'd be interesting to see if Apple really wants to make sure that those people
[00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:35.380]   are really, really happy.
[00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:40.100]   If this is the most profoundly useful and transformative art tablets that's ever put
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:45.260]   in the market, they do like to do things like in superlatives, you know, where they can
[00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.940]   really justify that line of the keynote.
[00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:52.900]   We really think this is the best pen based tablet that's ever been made.
[00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:56.500]   And with all the art programs that are available for the for the Mac right now and even on the
[00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:59.940]   iPad, they could really do that.
[00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:05.900]   I actually was kind of poo pooed this idea of a 12 inch iPad until the stylus rumor.
[00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:11.100]   And then I thought, Oh, this is something, you know, penny arcade, the oatmeal, all these
[00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:15.540]   guys are just going to flip their lids and say, Oh, finally, I could do my cartoons on
[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:16.540]   an iPad.
[00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:18.100]   I think that would be a huge product.
[00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:21.940]   My friend Mark Edwards, who runs Bajango, he's a really well known iOS designer.
[00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:24.260]   He has been petitioning for the largest iPad he could get.
[00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:27.860]   He would like a 120 inch iPad to just use as his easel if he could get it.
[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:30.860]   There's huge demand in artistic and design communities.
[00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:32.860]   He should give us some news.
[00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:36.180]   I think he's trying to fit that on his wall right now.
[00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:39.380]   There is huge demand for large mobile tech services in many industries.
[00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:44.980]   The 55 or 84 inch screen from a company that Microsoft bought called Perceptive Pixel that
[00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:46.020]   runs Windows 10.
[00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:47.940]   So it's and not infrared based anymore.
[00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:49.300]   No, no improvement there.
[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:50.300]   Yeah.
[00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:52.140]   That was a terrible solution.
[00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:57.780]   I'm looking at this mock up from Mac rumors that would give you some idea of the size.
[00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:02.300]   So on the left is an iPad mini, then a slightly bigger iPad air too.
[00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:03.780]   And then a whole lot bigger.
[00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:04.780]   Not bad pro.
[00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:06.340]   I mean, that's a big jump.
[00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:09.140]   Why I think that the bezel would probably get.
[00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:10.380]   I think the bezel would get smaller.
[00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:12.740]   Yeah, that's one way to make it not such a big jump.
[00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:16.660]   Oh, the last thing you'd want to do is have a big tablet with a small bezel unless they
[00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:22.300]   unless they've really improved their their their palm rejection and the algorithms to
[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:23.300]   a higher degree.
[00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:26.940]   The bigger a device gets you don't get you don't have the ability to hold it like this
[00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:27.940]   anymore.
[00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:29.700]   You really do now have to hold it like this.
[00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:44.940]   You need your
[00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:48.940]   when the mini is not that much smaller.
[00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:50.700]   It's not that much more convenient.
[00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.620]   The 9.7 is a lot more expensive.
[00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:55.660]   It runs the exact same software with the exact same user interface.
[00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:56.660]   Oh, wow.
[00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:57.660]   Look at the snow behind you.
[00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:58.660]   We get a little.
[00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:01.380]   Yeah, it's we're getting a little bit chicken up there.
[00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:03.900]   I think that's just snow being tossed around.
[00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:05.740]   ATST Walker behind him.
[00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:08.380]   It looks like it.
[00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:09.380]   You better.
[00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:13.460]   I still I still have that that Empire strikes back like banner that a friend of mine gave
[00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:19.260]   me that's the that was used in like an interview with Lucasfilm and I just couldn't I figure
[00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:22.140]   why this is this is a higher resolution and lot less trouble.
[00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:24.980]   And the not go from the planet off tonight.
[00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:27.700]   If you look at what Apple is doing it like the Apple there's an argument that could be
[00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:31.460]   made that the Apple Watch is going to allow for larger phones like the iPhone 6 plus which
[00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:33.380]   is going to allow for larger tablets.
[00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:34.380]   Why?
[00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:38.260]   So because if you have a watch on you can look at your notifications.
[00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:40.700]   You don't take your phone out of your pocket or your purse as much.
[00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:43.900]   So the ability to quickly move it around doesn't become as much of an issue.
[00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:47.460]   Then if you have a larger screen phone and iPad mini like Andy said doesn't make as much
[00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:49.780]   sense you already have a small large screen.
[00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:54.140]   But maybe an iPad makes more sense at home for video and web and all these things.
[00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:57.740]   And then as you increase so as the size is increased the sizes of the other things can
[00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:01.740]   increase proportionately and you have technologies like handoff where if something is too you
[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:04.700]   get a notification on your watch but it's too finicky so you just handed off to your
[00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:07.980]   phone trying to do it on your phone but the email is taking too long to type you handed
[00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:10.140]   it off to your Mac or to your iPad.
[00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:15.580]   And if you look at the iPad Air 2 which already has 2GB of RAM, 3 cores, 8 graphics cores and
[00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:19.620]   is thinner and lighter than last year if you extrapolate that I think you know Apple is
[00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:22.660]   impossible to predict but really easy to look back at patterns.
[00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:26.980]   I think we're getting these things so that when an iPad Pro comes out it is light enough
[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:29.860]   that it's not going to be a burden and it's powerful enough that it can start running
[00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:31.700]   these side by side apps.
[00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:36.100]   And I don't know about you but ever since I had cards on WebOS the idea of multiple windows
[00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:37.740]   was nice but I couldn't do anything with them.
[00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:41.420]   But if I could start dragging and dropping like a pickup Leo's name in this app, drag
[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:45.100]   it to that app, drag a picture back to the other app then multi-star starts to become
[00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:46.860]   an interesting multi-window environment.
[00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:55.380]   Yeah that's another underscore for the 12 inch iPad that is that the Air 2 is suspiciously
[00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:57.980]   powerful for the apps that it runs.
[00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:03.340]   It runs some nice apps and it runs them more quickly than the original iPad Air did but
[00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:05.780]   it isn't a transformative difference.
[00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:07.620]   And that's why I say suspiciously.
[00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:13.780]   It seems as though again you don't stare into the face of the Sphinx you would be driven
[00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:17.660]   mad but if you try to look at that and think it's not hard to think that oh so I think
[00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:21.780]   they really do have a timetable for running multiple apps side by side simultaneously.
[00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:25.980]   And that would be such an emphatic cool thing for a reason to say you know what not only
[00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:31.580]   do I want the 12 inch do I want a real big size iPad instead of an iPad mini.
[00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:36.140]   I want this instead of the MacBook Air that I thought I was going to get because this
[00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:39.580]   is enough of a workspace that can really lose myself in this window.
[00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:44.660]   I will simply spend all of $80 for a full sized Bluetooth keyboard that frankly will
[00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:47.780]   even be better quality more comfortable to use than what's in the MacBook Pro right
[00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:48.780]   now.
[00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:54.020]   It's it really could shift the center of gravity over across the entire the product line.
[00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:58.020]   Once you look at history the RAM increases and iOS devices have almost always come with
[00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:02.540]   simultaneous improvements in what apps could do and they started bumping from 512 to one
[00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:06.660]   to one gigabyte we started getting not just multitasking but background tasking and all
[00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:07.980]   these other things.
[00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:11.660]   And this this year we've got a RAM increase so what's Apple going to do with all this.
[00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:14.900]   They don't need extra RAM for you know there's no garbage collection they get to write to
[00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:18.020]   their own metal so they don't have to have abstraction layers there's no interpreter
[00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:19.820]   like Java running on top of it.
[00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:23.780]   That's a lot of extra room they could theoretically do something super interesting with.
[00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:26.620]   What's the resolution on this?
[00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:27.620]   On the pro?
[00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:28.620]   Yeah.
[00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:29.620]   They'll probably scale up.
[00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:33.340]   They've gotten resolution independent now thanks to adaptive UI so they can basically
[00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:35.460]   fill any screen bucket you don't care.
[00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:36.460]   So the target is retinue.
[00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:39.660]   You don't have to double the iPhone 6 plus or something like that.
[00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:43.660]   Also if it's true that the that the highlighted this is going to be multi apps running side
[00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:47.740]   by side then we start to even not even worry about well this has to be a 2x scale because
[00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:49.380]   we have to fit into the right box.
[00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:54.260]   Well because that now users I would be very disappointed if their answer to running app
[00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:59.820]   side by side on the iPad was you can have just the iPad view and then just the iPhone
[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:01.980]   view of one other app next to it.
[00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:06.380]   It really would be slide this little separator wherever you want to go and then Microsoft
[00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:11.740]   could say yeah we had we had a tile the multi app user interface with Windows 1.0.
[00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:14.580]   Thanks for catching up Apple finally.
[00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:17.860]   Andy don't look now but there's an ad on your shoulder.
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:20.220]   It's coming from the oh it's shooting at him.
[00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:23.340]   I hope those aren't Roman candles.
[00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:30.540]   Okay I'll stay here until the last transport is away.
[00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:31.540]   Alright.
[00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:32.540]   That's a funny scruffy look.
[00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:33.540]   And when would they release it?
[00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:36.620]   Would they wait till the fall as usual or do you think we might see this one a little
[00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:38.980]   sooner?
[00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:40.860]   I think right now they go when they're ready.
[00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:42.180]   If it's ready in the spring they'll go.
[00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:44.660]   They don't they don't have any calendar anymore.
[00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:48.180]   No I think again like we see so many products in the fall and we see products arrive so
[00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:51.660]   hot like the retina I've had many because they're they're literally sprinting at the
[00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:53.260]   finish line as fast as they can go.
[00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:56.580]   They don't have anything sitting on the shelf burning a hole in their supply chain.
[00:24:56.580 --> 00:25:00.180]   I do think that they want to have a little bit of air around the Apple Watch announcement
[00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:01.940]   but otherwise I agree with you.
[00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:03.980]   So that okay so let's get to the watch.
[00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:06.380]   Now rumors are March.
[00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:07.380]   Yes.
[00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:08.380]   Yep.
[00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:10.260]   I don't discount that.
[00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:14.940]   Earlier late I'm trying to late you know time my savings account.
[00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:18.780]   I would guess for the same reasons that the original iPad launched when it did the original
[00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:21.260]   they had the Apple Watch will launch in a similar timeframe.
[00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:25.620]   I mean there's just certain things that have to be in place for all that to happen.
[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:29.060]   Yeah.
[00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:32.180]   So again we can't predict we just have to we have to wait.
[00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:33.180]   I don't want to.
[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:37.780]   I'm trying to figure out if it'll go international right away because the iPhone nor the iPad
[00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:41.020]   launched internationally at first they both launched in the US at first and then a couple
[00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:45.100]   months later slowly moved out so I might I might have to hit you on a plan back to your
[00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:46.100]   side of the country.
[00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:47.100]   Just a good one.
[00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:51.980]   I remember that both of those had had cellular radios either as an either built in or as
[00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:54.380]   an option because it's so FCC issues.
[00:25:54.380 --> 00:26:00.140]   So and also striking deals with local carrier so this could be a completely different situation.
[00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:05.780]   One I think I think I think at this point if they can't launch in USA and China simultaneously
[00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:09.340]   I think that would not be a deal breaker but that's something that Apple would say oh
[00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:12.820]   boy I really wish we could have at least done those two countries at the same time.
[00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:13.820]   Canada.
[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:14.820]   Right about China.
[00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:15.820]   Yeah exactly.
[00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:16.820]   China.
[00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:17.820]   China.
[00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:20.620]   What about Montreal?
[00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:21.620]   Let's take a break.
[00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:25.460]   We come back new updates across the board from Apple.
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:33.300]   We have more analysts including Horace Dediyu coming up with an interesting statistic and
[00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:39.020]   Missouri State representative who has a crazy idea.
[00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:46.420]   By the way this just in the gentleman who flew the DJI phantom into the White House
[00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:52.220]   grounds at 3 a.m. had been drinking.
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:53.220]   Don't drink and drone.
[00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:54.220]   That's all I can do.
[00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:56.460]   No drinking and droning.
[00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:58.460]   Our show today brought to you by LegalZoom.
[00:26:58.460 --> 00:26:59.620]   You got to love LegalZoom.
[00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:04.660]   These guys have been around for more than a decade making it easy to get things that you
[00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:07.100]   need to get done done easy and affordable.
[00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:08.100]   I think those go together.
[00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:13.340]   A lot of times when you think I got to make a will or I got to do a trademark or patent
[00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:18.260]   or maybe I want to incorporate my business to a living trust.
[00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:20.460]   You think oh you know it's going to cost money.
[00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:21.780]   I got to go to a lawyer's office.
[00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:22.780]   No actually no.
[00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:24.660]   LegalZoom is not a law firm.
[00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:26.740]   They give you the self-help services you need.
[00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:28.620]   So you direct it.
[00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:30.700]   You do it at a very affordable rate.
[00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:32.740]   But here's the thing.
[00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:34.260]   Stuff like this is paperwork.
[00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:35.260]   It isn't.
[00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:39.260]   You don't need a high priced attorney to do this stuff.
[00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:44.700]   I did the LLC for Twit that we still run on 10 years ago at LegalZoom.
[00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:46.980]   Now they've also added a legal plan which is kind of neat.
[00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:51.540]   They have contracted with attorneys in almost every state who can give you legal advice
[00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:53.700]   at a low pre negotiated fixed rate.
[00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:58.820]   You can get the reviews, the profiles of the attorneys and unedited reviews from LegalZoom
[00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:00.700]   users on their website.
[00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:01.700]   That's nice.
[00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:05.060]   That gives you a little extra stuff if you've got a question.
[00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:06.060]   But I had questions.
[00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:12.260]   I want to know why should I do it in Delaware versus California, LLC, chapter S, chapter
[00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:13.340]   C, what's the difference?
[00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:14.340]   Things like that.
[00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:15.340]   You can just ask them.
[00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:16.340]   You can just get on the phone.
[00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:17.340]   You ask them.
[00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:18.340]   And it's very affordable.
[00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:19.340]   But let's see.
[00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:21.180]   Where should you begin to get your life in order?
[00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:22.340]   Maybe protect your family.
[00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:23.780]   Do you have a will?
[00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:26.340]   How about a living trust?
[00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:29.020]   A medical power of attorney, things like that.
[00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:30.020]   LegalZoom can help.
[00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:33.940]   There's no easier way to make sure your family is legally taken care of.
[00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:37.580]   We did the whole power of attorney and all of that stuff.
[00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:38.580]   And it's really cool.
[00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:40.460]   The medical directives.
[00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:41.460]   That's good to have that.
[00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:44.380]   It makes you feel good.
[00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:45.380]   You don't have to worry.
[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:47.060]   Take some worry off your shoulders.
[00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:50.300]   But also, getting your business going can make a big difference.
[00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:54.020]   Not just LLCs, but chapter S, chapter C-corps, trademarks, patents.
[00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:58.660]   If you go to LegalZoom.com, you'll see there a huge variety of legal work they can do
[00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:00.500]   for you.

[00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:10.420]   But they are not a law firm.

[00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:27.700]   I don't think we have a pet will for Aussie.
[00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:29.940]   Do you see the pet protection?
[00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:30.940]   It's only $39.
[00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:31.940]   Take $10.
[00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:34.020]   Well, there you go.
[00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:35.580]   You should probably have a pet protection agreement.
[00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:37.340]   Jason, would you take Aussie?
[00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:39.020]   You should have a dog for your girl.
[00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:40.020]   Actually, yes, I would.
[00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:41.020]   Yeah, perfect.
[00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:42.020]   Because our youngest would go for your girl.
[00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:43.020]   Perfect for your girl.
[00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:44.020]   If you had a dog.
[00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:45.020]   Yeah.
[00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:46.020]   See?
[00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:47.020]   All right.
[00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:48.020]   So there you go.
[00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:49.020]   I'll draw it up.
[00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:50.020]   LegalZoom.com.
[00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:53.180]   And you could bet I'm going to use the offer code MBW to get $10 off a checkout.
[00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:55.900]   We thank LegalZoom so much for their support at MacBreak Weekly.
[00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:58.660]   And for doing all that paperwork.
[00:29:58.660 --> 00:29:59.660]   Nice.
[00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:00.660]   Nice.
[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:04.780]   How does the deal we mentioned him earlier?
[00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:06.140]   Dress rights are greatest blog.
[00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:07.220]   You could call him an amateur.
[00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:11.220]   I find him kind of more knowledgeable than almost anybody, a Simco.
[00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:12.900]   He came up with an interesting statistic.
[00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:19.940]   We had mentioned that Apple said that in 2014 they paid $10 billion to developers.
[00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:24.180]   But just a great stat.
[00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:26.620]   That's more than...
[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:28.780]   What was it?
[00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:30.700]   Nah, I've lost it.
[00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:31.700]   Hollywood.
[00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:32.700]   Right?
[00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:38.980]   The iOS app developers earned more than Hollywood did from box office in 2014.
[00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:42.280]   That is a big economy you got here with the apps.
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:44.300]   That is amazing.
[00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:46.820]   You know how I saw the size of the Avengers?
[00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:48.580]   I mean it's interesting to know it's not an universe.
[00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:50.060]   It probably is, right?
[00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:51.060]   Yeah.
[00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:57.100]   And we talked about the numbers from Monument Valley the other day.
[00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:01.260]   And well I mean proportionately they're not major motion picture numbers.
[00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:03.500]   It costs them a little more than a million dollars to make it.
[00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:06.740]   They raked in five million.
[00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:07.740]   But...
[00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:10.500]   Well and I think that I think one of the things that a lot of people say was well, you know
[00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:11.860]   not all the developers make money.
[00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:13.540]   Well not all everyone in Hollywood makes money either.
[00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:16.460]   There's a lot of people that are serving, you know, serving dinner.
[00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:19.060]   It's very, it's actually very similar.
[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:21.500]   Where it's a hit drive an economy, right?
[00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:22.500]   Investment banking.
[00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:30.820]   Well a lot of the apps don't make it but you know when you get an iron man then you got
[00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:31.980]   a franchise.
[00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:32.980]   Right.
[00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:41.260]   500 million dollars spent on iOS apps in week one in January of 2015.
[00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:42.260]   Half a billion...
[00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:44.500]   Wait a minute let me say that again.
[00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:47.820]   Half a billion spent on iOS apps in the first week of this month.
[00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:51.500]   Yeah and everyone gets their brand new devices on Christmas and opens the month.
[00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:52.900]   It's got to be the biggest week right?
[00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:53.900]   Half cards too.
[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:54.900]   One of two.
[00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:55.900]   And gift cards that's right.
[00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:56.900]   Yeah.
[00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:59.100]   Michael got hundreds of dollars in gift cards.
[00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:00.100]   Yeah.
[00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:04.180]   Apple by the way kudos because I've been entering gift cards from other people.
[00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:05.820]   You just show the gift card to the camera.
[00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:06.820]   Yes.
[00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:09.700]   And it goes oh yeah I got it.
[00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:12.980]   When you have 12 gift cards to enter that is a boon.
[00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:17.340]   And you can actually have Siri order to send a gift card for you to still Siri to send
[00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:19.340]   the night teams gift card to you right there.
[00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:20.340]   No.
[00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:21.340]   Yeah.
[00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:22.340]   That's what you do.
[00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:23.340]   A lady.
[00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:24.340]   Whatever.
[00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:26.340]   Friends on the country.
[00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:33.780]   Cumulata developer revenues 25 billion dollars making 2014 revenues 40% of all app sales since
[00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:36.980]   the store opened in 2008.
[00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:40.180]   Billings for apps increased 50% in 2014.
[00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:42.860]   627,000 jobs created in the US.
[00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:45.140]   We talked about that.
[00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:48.900]   That's kind of an interesting number I don't know but still.
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:49.900]   It is kind of interesting.
[00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:54.420]   I've been spending a lot of time poking through Apple sites and also because Microsoft's keynote
[00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:57.660]   last week their sites and then also looking through Google.
[00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:01.420]   And it's interesting how if you really just want to go through all the nooks and crannies
[00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:04.580]   it's very very easy to find on Apple where they're saying here's how much we're helping
[00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:07.700]   the economy here's how much to have here's how many jobs we're creating.
[00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:09.100]   Here's the good that we're doing.
[00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:12.220]   It's also very very easy to find in Microsoft.
[00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:14.620]   Here is the actual real research that we're doing.
[00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:18.300]   Not in addition to developing products we're developing basic technologies and publishing
[00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:22.380]   the supporting research papers that are going to support all kinds of other work that's
[00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:23.380]   being done.
[00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:27.620]   Google maybe has a combination of both but it's kind of interesting to see that dichotomy
[00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:33.100]   between like if we want to devote some of our users attention towards things that are
[00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:37.300]   not directly involved with selling them a new phone or selling them a new piece of software.
[00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:38.300]   Here's what we want.
[00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:40.700]   Here's how we want to define ourselves to the public and that's clearly what Apple wants
[00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:41.700]   people to know.
[00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:44.660]   Here's a graph Alex Lindsey's not going to like too much.
[00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:51.500]   iTunes group gross revenues by product type that little thin layer at the bottom pro
[00:33:51.500 --> 00:34:00.500]   apps then music then video video is bigger than music is bigger than video.
[00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:05.140]   The red one is apps and that's that you see that's a big portion of revenue that's gross
[00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:06.140]   revenues.
[00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:09.500]   So you take 30% of that goes to Apple 70% to developers.
[00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:12.700]   Music is popular if you look at Twitter I think all the most followed people are music
[00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:15.860]   artists at this point not sports people not Hollywood star really singers.
[00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:18.580]   Yeah I believe that's still the case.
[00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:20.260]   The popularity of music is amazing.
[00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:24.740]   Well I think also a lot of the pop stars and singers have you know that is a huge part
[00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:25.740]   of their business model.
[00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:30.060]   I mean I think a lot of them the ones that are getting that kind of following are really
[00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:32.260]   doing some pretty interesting social outreach.
[00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:33.260]   Yeah.
[00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:38.140]   Did you see the thing where she delivered stuff to yeah to her best fans those kind of things
[00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:42.500]   you know there you know and I have to admit that you know Taylor Swift is a perfect example
[00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:47.780]   of someone who's kind of converting from the traditional you know music model to to something
[00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:48.780]   different.
[00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:51.620]   Now even though she's staying with certain parts of it obviously not putting it on Spotify
[00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:56.780]   not doing a lot of other things but her building up that that social brand she's probably doing
[00:34:56.780 --> 00:35:00.700]   that better than almost anyone else you know in her industry at the moment.
[00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:03.300]   You know she's just doing a lot of things that make that make a lot of sense.
[00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:08.620]   So but I think that whether it's her or Katy Perry or you know a variety of other artists
[00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:12.780]   that they there's nothing that's accidental about what they're doing there.
[00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:16.740]   And so and I think that a lot of the sports guys aren't just not they're not paying attention
[00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:17.740]   to that.
[00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:20.740]   I think there's too many I think they're more faceless.
[00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:27.860]   I mean look at Taylor Swift's built such a community around her and so this is the video
[00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:32.180]   that she made on YouTube of her.
[00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:35.940]   After something that became known as tail lurking whereupon every detail of a fans likes jobs
[00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:41.960]   whereabouts was studied intently a single Santa emoji would appear on their socials from
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:47.540]   Taylor Swift and then large she would send them gifts large FedEx boxes.
[00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:49.780]   She just picked people kind of at random.
[00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:54.340]   I'm obviously she's not doing this her social team is but these are people who got.
[00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:56.820]   That is a lot of the stuff I went shopping and got yesterday.
[00:35:56.820 --> 00:36:01.340]   She went shopping and that's Meredith for her fans.
[00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:08.220]   Kind of this is just I think you can be cynical about this and say that well that's a great
[00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:11.980]   manipulation but you know what she's sitting there rapping them.
[00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:14.220]   Now is she also behind info sec Taylor Swift?
[00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:15.220]   I know.
[00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:16.220]   I don't know.
[00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:18.860]   I don't know if a sec Taylor Swift says I think says she's given it up.
[00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:20.980]   She says I'm tired of this.
[00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:22.580]   It's jokes over.
[00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:24.660]   I still want to meet info sec Taylor Swift.
[00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:27.300]   It's a brilliant Twitter feed.
[00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:30.820]   I've been raised people I remember the tweet that said Android was the malware layer on
[00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:37.860]   top of Linux and I think that almost broke Twitter.
[00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:42.180]   Maybe your team put together the list or something but she's actually seems like she's seriously
[00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:43.620]   doing this.
[00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:47.460]   I mean if this is fake she put more effort into faking it than she would have actually
[00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:48.860]   doing it.
[00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:54.900]   She would also deserve credit if this was her idea for simply not be the person who's
[00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:58.900]   executing someone else's plan but someone who put a team together and said here's what
[00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:00.180]   I want to do with our social media.
[00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:04.300]   Come up with new ideas that come more powerful than simply tweeting out when we've got a
[00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:05.300]   new album up.
[00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:09.220]   I feel like she gets it more than many almost anybody.
[00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:10.220]   It's her age too.
[00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:12.420]   It's not hostile to her fans.
[00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:13.500]   She's embracing it.
[00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:15.660]   It really isn't really is an instinct.
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:19.820]   I've passed I've spent the past six to seven months looking at people who produce content
[00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:24.220]   on YouTube both as I'm just interested in this subject about how people use that to
[00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:28.660]   express themselves and also because maybe I'd like to do some some YouTube publishing.
[00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:32.380]   It really is interesting that people have that instinct for this kind of medium where
[00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:37.780]   they express themselves naturally in the form of a five minute video or as a way of
[00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:41.380]   connection through social media as opposed to I'm going to sit down and write something
[00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:45.420]   that takes 800 words or I'm going to even write out a script that would take 15 minutes
[00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:47.700]   to play out on YouTube.
[00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:52.660]   There are people who are just grown up with an instinctive understanding of how what this
[00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:56.580]   mechanism works that's more than just simply write people write something and then people
[00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:58.180]   read it on their Twitter feeds.
[00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:01.220]   It really is here is a larger here's a larger machine that we're building.
[00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:03.940]   She's hand delivering.
[00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:04.940]   Imagine this fan.
[00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:08.300]   I mean we've seen stuff like this before and you know as a publicity stunt.
[00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:10.340]   I don't get the feeling this is a publicity stunt.
[00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:13.620]   I really I mean obviously it is a publicity stunt.
[00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:14.780]   She's delighted.
[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:15.940]   It seems like she's enjoying it.
[00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:20.140]   You couldn't fake that and I think yeah that's kind of critical to it is that she's actually
[00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:21.140]   she's digging this.
[00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:24.460]   She came up with this and she likes it and she's doing it because she likes it.
[00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:27.820]   I follow her on Instagram and I'm you know the truth is I couldn't identify a Taylor
[00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:32.740]   Swift song to save my life and I haven't bought any of her albums.
[00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:37.420]   One of the things I admire her just for this alone.
[00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:40.460]   And I also think that one of the things that's interesting that she's she's done as well
[00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:46.100]   as a variety of other artists is not trying to block every usage of their of their music
[00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:48.660]   on YouTube and I think that's been extremely successful.
[00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:52.500]   If you look at how many lip dubs there have been to shake it off.
[00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:57.500]   You know it's one of those things that that that also helps build that community.
[00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:03.740]   It builds it builds this kind of sense of of singularity between lots and lots of different
[00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:08.300]   people that they've all used this as a as a context to express themselves.
[00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:12.900]   And I think that that is something that is that that some of the smartest artists the
[00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:17.580]   Katy Perry's and the and the Miley Cyrus's and the Taylor Swift's and a variety of other
[00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:21.220]   ones have have done very well have done have benefited very well from being a little bit
[00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:26.740]   more hands off than than some of the really to be honest with you has been 60 70 80s artists
[00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:32.060]   that that don't want anyone to look at Prince compare contrast this to Prince who just pisses
[00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:34.900]   on his fans basically.
[00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:38.780]   You know almost never doing a performance though Leo not doing a performance.
[00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:41.380]   There are artists who have done that by the way.
[00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:43.340]   But that's an old school that's an old school style.
[00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:49.620]   I'm the artist above my audience and and you know what that's probably there's that's
[00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:52.820]   nothing wrong with that and that's probably going to continue the people who do it.
[00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:57.020]   But I just admire somebody like Taylor Swift who does seem I mean she's what 22 or 23 she
[00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:58.500]   grew up with the Internet.
[00:39:58.500 --> 00:39:59.500]   She grew up with all this.
[00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:05.820]   This is native to her and she takes seems to take some delight in this.
[00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:11.940]   And if if you can do that what but the interesting point to me is it's not it's more than selling
[00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:15.180]   records it's about building a community of fans.
[00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:17.420]   And that is incredibly powerful.
[00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:21.540]   It's also it's also about infrastructure that supports an artist.
[00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:26.460]   YouTube has been doing really well but now they've started to make an unusual new demands
[00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:30.620]   on musicians to basically say that you used we used to give you the ability to say that
[00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:33.660]   if you want to let other people like you know put your music over other things we will
[00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:36.940]   help you monetize it will help you make sure that you can take off things that are not
[00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:41.420]   good but now it's like we will have to sign you're going to have to give us such incredibly
[00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:45.460]   good terms to have that that now they have to choose between either using YouTube or
[00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:49.020]   not using YouTube at all as opposed to finding their own level of water.
[00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:53.740]   So this is the talk about Zoey Keating obviously exactly talked about it on Twitter.
[00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:59.820]   She's a cellist who has done quite well on YouTube and used content ID on YouTube to
[00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:03.740]   identify because apparently many of her songs like thousands of her songs have been used
[00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:09.420]   with her blessing as background music and videos including like the Game of Thrones special
[00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:16.500]   effects reel and she's content ID because if you do that and you can choose to take it
[00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:21.980]   down or but if it's not monetized she can turn on monetization or and more importantly
[00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:26.220]   if it is monetized she takes a portion of monetization and so it's a reasonable revenue
[00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:33.820]   strategy YouTube has now come to her saying you must agree to sign up for our music key
[00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:39.060]   service to provide all your music both free and paid on music key and you can't do it
[00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:44.740]   exclusively anywhere else anything that you offer anywhere else including SoundCloud or
[00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:48.060]   Bandcamp has to be offered on YouTube I mean it's pretty draconian.
[00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:51.940]   It's almost like the terms that got Apple in trouble with the DOJ but it would be interesting
[00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:56.380]   to see if for example I do podcasts that have video ads in it or if PGP Gray or someone
[00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:59.980]   else who does you know some of the sponsored shows could YouTube come and say well if you
[00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:04.020]   do sponsorships on your shows or if your shows are a certain length you have to you can't
[00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:06.740]   disable banner ads or overlay ads.
[00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:13.660]   I mean there's actually a lot of rules in the TOS with YouTube that do include that
[00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:17.060]   kind of stuff so they don't I don't think that necessarily it's being enforced you know
[00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:19.180]   currently but there's a definitely.
[00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:22.940]   That's the time one of the reasons it's one of the reasons that a lot of a lot of folks
[00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:27.260]   you know choose to use you know YouTube's live streaming service which we stream to a
[00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:32.620]   lot is something that's very very powerful and very amazing that it's free but there
[00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:36.260]   are some restrictions on how you use it and you know part of that is that there's a huge
[00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:39.860]   infrastructure that's supporting you being able to do this you know and I think that
[00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:44.580]   that's you know that's the other side of that but it is one of those things that I mean
[00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:47.620]   everybody's going to have to you know eventually you're going to have to pay for what you're
[00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:52.860]   getting and you know you know you know and that's the thing that all these services when
[00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:57.860]   we look at them whether they're Google or or or many many other services and Facebook
[00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:01.100]   you know eventually someone's going to have to make money on it and so when they start
[00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:05.580]   to monetize it is when they when they have a lot of you know when one way or another
[00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:07.260]   is when things get more complicated.
[00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:10.580]   I got to say that I think there's an argument to be made that they have already been paying
[00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:15.100]   for the service in the form of just like Apple doesn't make a whole lot of money off of
[00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:18.740]   hosting apps that don't do very well they make a lot of money off of apps that do do
[00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:23.860]   very well and so you have these people that can just do a whole bunch of cinnamon challenges
[00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:28.700]   and get audiences of seriously tens of millions of people and then get to talk to the president
[00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:33.340]   of the United States of America and this helps out Google in many ways monetarily and also
[00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:35.580]   by increasing their advertising base.
[00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:39.620]   So I think that I've always said that I don't think that Google is a bad company I don't
[00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:43.540]   think that they're turning customers into products I do think that there's always that
[00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:47.980]   transaction that's being done saying I will you will give me free video hosting in exchange
[00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:51.020]   here is what I'm going to give you and I feel so that's a good deal.
[00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:54.860]   I think that there's so many because there's so many musicians who are feeling like this
[00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:58.260]   you're not interfering with my ability to make a profit you are interfering with my
[00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:03.020]   ability to practice my business to express my art if I can't post something very very
[00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:07.100]   quick and simple on SoundCloud or Bandcamp which is where a lot of my users a lot of
[00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:12.340]   my fans go to look for me you ruin my ability to make the music that I want to make that's
[00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:14.940]   the danger that they want to get away from.
[00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:20.540]   Yeah I mean I think that it's one of those things that it's really what the biggest thing
[00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:24.300]   that's difficult in this whole process is when you start changing the rules.
[00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:28.940]   So when you hear the rules were one thing and then you start renegotiating and it's
[00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:33.260]   what every company has to do they are constantly moving these rules around but that is the
[00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:38.740]   tricky part of the entire process you know you know the you know it's such an incredible
[00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:42.380]   you know they built it up by making it free and making it easy and doing all these other
[00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:46.940]   things as this incredible platform where half a billion people will watch a single video
[00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:50.420]   you know and so it really is the you know radio like when I want to listen to a song
[00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:53.500]   or someone talks about a song half the time I just go to YouTube to see what it you know
[00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:58.940]   to be to hear the song you know and it's and it really is truly playlists in some ways
[00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:04.820]   on YouTube have become a have become a replacement for you know for radio for some people you
[00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:08.580]   know for definitely younger generation and so so I think they they've definitely built
[00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:12.220]   that up and then of course when they when they decide they're gonna try to make money with
[00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:16.300]   it or try to fit it into a model that makes sense for them it's difficult and I and you
[00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:20.100]   know I'm the worst person people change the rules on me and I'm I throw all kinds of tantrums
[00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:24.780]   so so it's so I like the one he's angry.
[00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:29.220]   Yeah I have feelings about it too because you do get a great freeze we'll talk more about
[00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:34.340]   this I'm sure on this week in Google as we have on the Twit but you I guess the point
[00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:40.420]   here is to contrast this to iTunes and but maybe not I mean she by the way Zoe Keating
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:44.300]   makes the bulk of her money by selling her music on iTunes and iTunes doesn't let you
[00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:47.500]   sell directly you still got to go through CD baby so it's not like YouTube we just upload
[00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:51.100]   a video and iTunes isn't their own studio the way a lot of other companies is becoming
[00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:56.620]   so it's it's interesting the battle they've chosen to fight this just in the drunk government
[00:45:56.620 --> 00:46:02.980]   employee who landed a drone in the White House was an employee of the National Geospatial
[00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:07.860]   Intelligence Agency the NGA is the agency responsible for providing the government with
[00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:14.340]   timely relevant and accurate geospatial intelligence in support of national security so really
[00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:20.180]   it was a it was a test it was all research he was off duty he got drunk at a nearby apartment
[00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:24.300]   heard about it the next day turned himself in it's like to make back theory when it's
[00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:28.220]   perfect strangers I'm pretty sure this was an episode of Perfect Strangers where Valpica
[00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:34.500]   the helicopter and it lands in like the governor's mansion you're doing it's like the late
[00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:40.700]   theory when I'm wondering whether it was more like exactly what you had described at
[00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:43.780]   your house where he just he and his friends were drinking they're like oh let's go take
[00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:52.980]   the drone shot up into the sky and I'm sure that's exactly what happened it's not you
[00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:56.740]   know he didn't I bet you anything he didn't fly it toward the White House it's really
[00:46:56.740 --> 00:47:03.740]   easy to lose control of these drones as I know especially I know where he's going to
[00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:12.180]   get drone I feel that this is this this year is gonna be like the year that drones both
[00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:20.460]   take off and crash like there's some horrible stories are a lot of stories it's movies it's
[00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:25.500]   movies like that that the Roman candle movie that's gonna have people at the FA going
[00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:30.460]   yeah we're gonna have to really do something about this right now but what what I think
[00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:34.340]   I don't want to do anything I'm quite happy I live in the candles on your roof to shoot
[00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:38.540]   down the Roman candles on the drone they get a stick in a nail you get a bigger stick
[00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:43.660]   I think that we need 3D printer templates for weaponry for our drones that's all there
[00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:48.540]   is to it oh it's very simple starting with with when the starting springtime secret service
[00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:54.900]   agents will all be equipped or radio a gun a taser and a butterfly net on a really really
[00:47:54.900 --> 00:48:02.940]   long-term protect America according to Forbes the world's most valuable brands you know
[00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:08.140]   I see these and I go well I don't know how how they do this the top afford any of them
[00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:13.620]   yeah well that's true top 100 most valuable brands span 15 countries and cross 20 industry
[00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:18.700]   categories we started they say with a universe of more than 200 global brands they had a
[00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:24.540]   presence in the US they first determined earnings before interest in taxes they average those
[00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:29.460]   over three years subtract from earnings a charge of 8% of the brands capital employed
[00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:32.940]   then they apply the maximum corporate tax rate in the parents current parent companies
[00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:36.940]   home country to that net earnings figure then they allocated percentage of those earnings
[00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:41.500]   to the brand base of the role brands playing each industry to this net brand earnings number
[00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:44.900]   we applied the average price to earnings multiple over the past three years you know what it
[00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:48.860]   was just a spreadsheet that's all they put it in a spreadsheet and the and the winner
[00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:57.980]   is Apple computer number one what a surprise brand value 124.2 billion dollars I think the
[00:48:57.980 --> 00:49:03.020]   crazy thing is that is the increase over last year it's not just the the the the the
[00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:08.060]   ranking it's the the difference between it apple and then and number two I mean it's almost
[00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:14.580]   it's twice it's twice number two which is Microsoft although I have to say this may be
[00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:19.340]   contour yeah this may be controversial on an apple podcast but I'm very excited about
[00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:24.300]   what Microsoft announced last week yeah not just the a hole in lines but I think windows
[00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:30.100]   10 in general they seem to be on track for us a much improved strategy which is good you
[00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:34.700]   need competition to keep everybody honest exactly and this isn't this is again not to
[00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:37.940]   turn this we're not gonna turn this into a windows podcast but one of the things I thought
[00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:41.660]   was most interesting is I think that there are a lot of really interesting and really promising
[00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:47.380]   products in that keynote I think the most interesting one of the most interesting though
[00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:52.220]   was the keynote itself where it was really presented in the form of week not we can't
[00:49:52.220 --> 00:49:57.700]   just roll out a series of announcements we have to shape a story and leave these journalists
[00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:01.660]   and the people watching the last scream stream away with a story of here's here's who we are
[00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:05.420]   as a company here's what we were capable of doing so even if you see some bumpy spots
[00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:09.100]   over the next couple of years you will understand us by the trail of the dead that we find
[00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:13.780]   it was fairly fairly compelling and it did follow the apple template starting off at
[00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:19.420]   the beginning with a a litany of how we're doing and one point five billion users and
[00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:25.420]   ending with Satya Nadella their new CEO and a mock turtle neck and black jeans it's amazing
[00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:29.660]   that all these years later apple still announces devices and Microsoft still announces platforms
[00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:33.500]   well I think that's changing I think the hollow lens is very interesting and I wonder
[00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:36.540]   what apples response is gonna be they didn't just announce the hollow lens the hollow lens
[00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:40.300]   is an open development platform it's not like a closed thing okay that's like that's good
[00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:44.460]   right that's not yeah that's fantastic that's what I love best about Microsoft right I mean
[00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:48.220]   that's that's as I said on Twitter we were talking we're gonna talk about this on Twitter
[00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:52.700]   like during the day and that it's like apple is not capable of having success on the scale
[00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:57.500]   of a Microsoft office Microsoft is not capable of having a success on the scale of the iPad
[00:50:57.500 --> 00:51:01.740]   so that's there's definitely playing to their strengths yeah I'm very interesting and I wonder
[00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:07.900]   if the hollow lens will be I feel we're looking at the future of UI look at this Leo a Facebook
[00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:13.660]   has Oculus now Google has Google Glass and Microsoft has hollow lens so the all of them have a presence
[00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:18.460]   in VR or AR however you want to term it and apple has nothing in that space but apples also
[00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:22.620]   yeah apples got pet but they're also apples not a first mover in any of these categories and not
[00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:28.220]   first to phones tablets TV boxes or watches so if this is the next thing at what point is that
[00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:31.820]   market mature enough for apple to enter and what way would they enter it I think it's also I think
[00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:35.980]   it's not forget app that Microsoft created the first mouse it was apple that popularized it
[00:51:35.980 --> 00:51:43.500]   right I think it was right that first mouse was created by Niklas we're at Logitech up to be
[00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:48.380]   and actually even before that Douglas Engelbart at Xerox park yeah but but the first commercial
[00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:53.900]   mouse was sold with Microsoft office years before apple came out with the Macintosh
[00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:58.780]   one I think that it's just a very you know apple doesn't like to show their notes so
[00:51:58.780 --> 00:52:02.860]   so a lot of these other a lot of everyone else and I and I don't really know I mean because I think
[00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:06.620]   Google Glass is a perfect example of the danger of showing your notes so of throwing something out
[00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:11.500]   they're not not sure and just see how people react to it and then they react badly to it and then
[00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:15.580]   it's really hard to kind of corral that back up again it's a very big difference well Oculus
[00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:20.700]   Rift you don't see what's out there you're in a world of your very own which I I try it at CS
[00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:24.220]   again like the latest version and it is very disconcerting because you have it on and it looks
[00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:27.900]   beautiful now and it's smooth and there's almost no compression and it's real time and you can
[00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:31.420]   move your head up and down you can jump up and down but you put your hands up and you can't see
[00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:36.060]   them and that is a very primal sort of what's going on here feeling but two but two important
[00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:40.940]   things number one Google is actually Google Glass is just one example of what they're
[00:52:40.940 --> 00:52:45.900]   doing they're also a half a billion dollar investor in Magic Leap which is a very very
[00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:52.460]   similar very similar exactly that has made the most frustrating press releases No to Mankind
[00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:55.660]   which is it's almost like a scene for The Simpsons where they're going to tell you
[00:52:55.660 --> 00:53:00.060]   everything about how awesome this thing that they're building is except for any details whatsoever
[00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:03.740]   because they're what they're doing is so top secret so they're they've got their hands in
[00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:09.900]   a lot of different ways of articulating that but the thing is I I don't want Google and
[00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:13.580]   Microsoft and other companies to be dang for oh look at them they built they they have this
[00:53:13.580 --> 00:53:17.340]   this Google Glass concept of course it failed after a year well it didn't fail because they
[00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:21.180]   never actually did it as a product they do they I think they legitimately said that here are some
[00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:25.500]   ideas that we think might be important we can't really figure out what how good these ideas are
[00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:28.860]   until we put these in the hands of real people and have them tell us how they're using this
[00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:33.340]   and so for so for so good glass should definitely not be an embarrassment for them if anything
[00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:37.020]   the all there if there's a there's a very short list of things I think that Apple is
[00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:43.180]   doesn't show as much confidence as other companies that Apple is more than happy to make money off
[00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:46.700]   of something that they know there's a market for and that they know there are other people
[00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:49.900]   have been doing this and they there's no here's what here's what here's a here's a finished thing
[00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:54.700]   and a finished base of customers here's how we can do that better they I can't think of more than
[00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:58.540]   maybe one instance which they've done something where no here's a product that is so good that
[00:53:58.540 --> 00:54:03.340]   we are going to be pathfinders here we're gonna be the innovators in the pioneers we're not just
[00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:07.500]   going to be the people who come in two or three years later after lots of hundreds and hundreds
[00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:12.220]   of explorers have died to find the route over the Rockies now that now we're gonna bring the
[00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:16.620]   railroad in now that they've done that for us so I wish that Apple could have a little bit there
[00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:20.060]   would be an additional source of pride if they could point to things to say that there were
[00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:23.420]   there's no such thing as a smartphone and then we created the smartphone there's no such thing
[00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:27.180]   as a tablet that we created the tablet there's no such thing as a laptop that we created the laptop
[00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:32.700]   well and I think that I think what's ironic about the whole thing is that Apple is one of the
[00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:36.220]   biggest copy you know they have all these patents but they're one who gets copycats where they look
[00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:41.100]   they let everyone else you know be the front row you know because as I say there's something like
[00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:45.820]   as someone who has glass and I think that there are things that glass does that nothing comes close
[00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:50.060]   to you know you want to do point of view training videos of how to do something if you want to
[00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:53.500]   oh no no but I got to tell you I got to tell you HoloLens is going to be better
[00:54:53.500 --> 00:55:00.380]   both both Oculus Rift and Glass have a significant flaw they're not augmented reality they're not
[00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:07.820]   heads up displays they demonstrated with HoloLens fixing a light switch and you're looking at the
[00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:13.980]   actual light switch while somebody's on Skype talking you through it and drawing on your view of
[00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:18.700]   the light switch to say do this do this much better than looking at a manual over your right eyebrow
[00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:22.620]   it's a complete different experience but we were doing I mean what we were doing with Glass was
[00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:26.780]   two-way conversations where I see what you're seeing and you see what I'm seeing now it didn't
[00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:30.780]   have the hologram where you're drawing on it but I'm sitting there what I was doing was basically
[00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:34.060]   saying okay now grab onto this part of the camera and I can see you're we both have the same camera
[00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:37.980]   you're either doing what I what I you know I can see that so it wasn't looking at a manual it's
[00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:42.460]   actually talking to someone two-way and that that was you know one of the things that was really good
[00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:46.860]   about Glass and I think I think that Microsoft product is going to be you know a Skype two-way
[00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:52.300]   two-way Skype guy talking to you and furthermore drawing on the thing you're fixing and saying turn
[00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:57.260]   that this way now right right right it's a much more it's a much more ambitious thing but remember
[00:55:57.260 --> 00:56:01.900]   that that was part of the thought process that Google put into Glass to begin with that you know
[00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:06.540]   how you know Steve Jobs said well if you if you if you have a stylus on a touchscreen device that
[00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:11.580]   means that that designer failed Google's whole idea was look if this is putting something into
[00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:15.820]   your field of vision then we failed the design the whole point of their point of view for this was
[00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:19.740]   that here's a computer that it will not take up your it will not obscure your vision it will not
[00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:24.140]   obscure your hearing it will not obscure your sense of touch no phone can do that no heads up
[00:56:24.140 --> 00:56:28.700]   display can do that no laptop can do that if this is just live your life do whatever you want to do
[00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:33.740]   except we will have this little piece of software that will put a little bit of a cue above your
[00:56:33.740 --> 00:56:38.940]   field of vision to help you not have to ever take out your phone ever again so it's it's it's a
[00:56:38.940 --> 00:56:43.580]   different I understand it's a different goal it's all but I love how like technology really is art
[00:56:43.580 --> 00:56:47.180]   and art comes from a point of view and a statement that someone wants to make and so
[00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:51.580]   there is a signature house style to the way that apple wants to design something there's a signature
[00:56:51.580 --> 00:56:55.260]   style to the way that google wants to design something and when you talk to the designers and
[00:56:55.260 --> 00:57:00.540]   you found you've asked you why why is why isn't this like something that can actually put a put a
[00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:04.940]   an arrow on this building to show me what what what what building I want to go to they will tell
[00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:08.540]   you that we don't want you to ever have something in front of your eye we want you to be able to see
[00:57:08.540 --> 00:57:12.140]   what you want to see here what you want to hear right that's that's that's great design no matter
[00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:16.620]   no matter how useful or not useful the result might be I love hearing those stories from the
[00:57:16.620 --> 00:57:20.620]   designers what their point of view actually was I'm excited about the idea of augmented reality
[00:57:20.620 --> 00:57:24.700]   I've thought from the day one both glass and all in the strips I miss the boat because
[00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:29.180]   AR is the future and AR is not a new technology by the way I just want to know whether the amazon
[00:57:29.180 --> 00:57:33.420]   cobra commander style fireface is gonna ship that's that's what I'm waiting for the fireface
[00:57:35.420 --> 00:57:39.820]   uh you know everybody's now rushing if they haven't already been doing it in secret labs somewhere
[00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:45.020]   to create some AR solution but I just I feel like this Microsoft got it right now there's a long
[00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:51.260]   history including the mouse including the tablet of Microsoft being first to the table but not being
[00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:55.100]   best I don't want to be pessimistic though Leo but the thing about this that I think intrigues
[00:57:55.100 --> 00:57:58.860]   them also especially companies like Facebook is on a phone I can look at the Facebook app press the
[00:57:58.860 --> 00:58:02.860]   home button I can look at Facebook.com on the web close the browser whether it's Microsoft or
[00:58:02.860 --> 00:58:08.780]   Facebook or Google once it's on my face they control my entire experience and I can't just close that
[00:58:08.780 --> 00:58:12.620]   I have to physically take it off and once I've put it on there's less impetus for me to take it off
[00:58:12.620 --> 00:58:16.700]   so I think it also serves their purposes of getting much higher engagement and attention
[00:58:16.700 --> 00:58:21.740]   in those courses in our places or you can not run that app I think the as a matter of fact I
[00:58:21.740 --> 00:58:27.020]   think hollow lens you can just turn it off and then it sunglasses giant giant sunglasses big sunglass
[00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:31.980]   you know interestingly the did not show hollow lens logo on the sides of it then it would be
[00:58:31.980 --> 00:58:37.100]   absolutely palatable they did not anywhere in the in the video show hole lens out of the house it
[00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:43.340]   really is designed to be adjunct to computing in the home which is interesting
[00:58:43.340 --> 00:58:50.860]   um I you look it's I would guess you if any absolutely that both Google and Apple
[00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:57.420]   will have something similar quickly but I don't know I don't know if I don't know if I don't know
[00:58:57.420 --> 00:59:03.740]   Apple I mean not Apple huh I don't see Apple doing anything with in this space significantly
[00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:07.340]   this year yeah you know I think they've got plenty on their plate they're gonna be pushing
[00:59:07.340 --> 00:59:11.180]   through you know they've got other things doing I'd be very surprised they have a saying that
[00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:16.060]   they need a lot of people to try it and and create problems that they then think they can add value
[00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:20.620]   by solving and there's not been enough trial and problems discovered for this yet yeah that
[00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:24.780]   their whole their whole mo historically and their whole strength has always been here is a product
[00:59:24.780 --> 00:59:30.380]   that does not work well we can make this product work incredibly well yeah yeah so you get
[00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:32.860]   and that means you have to start off with a product that actually exists
[00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:41.180]   uh anyway times times are changing Microsoft second google third Coca-Cola fourth it's
[00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:46.700]   interesting there's three big tech companies one two and three is the most valuable brands in the

[01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:13.980]   wonderful wonderful books on here what are you listening to these days the last audible book I
[01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:20.460]   finished just a few days ago was pat nauswalt's really good memoir of his film addiction uh called
[01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:25.900]   silver screen fiend um you met one one of my other favorite audible books was also a by comedian
[01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:30.540]   was Steve Martin he wrote a memoir that wasn't a more it was less of a memoir than an about a
[01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:36.220]   biography of a person that he used to be it was a biography of the stand-up act that he built
[01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:41.900]   during the 70s and abandoned in the early 80s this is similar to that it documents a brief
[01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:46.940]   period in the late 90s early 2000s where he was just an absolute he was always a film fan but he
[01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:52.380]   became an absolute addict of cinema spending every moment that he was not spending doing stand-up
[01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:57.180]   at the new Beverly cinema almost uh and watching movies and going back home and just opening up
[01:02:57.180 --> 01:03:00.940]   the psychotronic film guy or the guide or some other guy and checking off the movies that he'd
[01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:05.420]   seen and writing down the time that the date and the place where he actually saw it and it's really
[01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:10.860]   a interesting story pretty breezy about four hours long I think he reads it himself about he's
[01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:17.500]   developing his voice and his career as a comedian as an actor while having this addiction that is
[01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:24.540]   maybe about it was like he was at a crossroads it seems in life where he can either commit himself
[01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:29.740]   from 80 percent to his career to 100 percent to his career or be one of these people who just
[01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:34.700]   sees lots and lots of movies and talks about movies but never actually makes movies and it's a really
[01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:40.060]   interesting story about how a person evolves at an interesting part of their life and these it's
[01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:44.140]   I love these memoirs where it's the the story is read by the person who wrote it and lived it
[01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:49.180]   and he's just got a great voice you really kind of want to get into and listen to for four and a half
[01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:52.540]   hour you may not know the name but if you see a picture of Patton Oswalt you'll immediately
[01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:56.300]   he's a he's one of my favorite he's one of my favorite comedians and also one of my favorite
[01:03:56.300 --> 01:04:01.180]   character actors he was on the king of queens for like nine or ten seasons he was the voice of
[01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:06.380]   Remy the rat in Ratatouille but you really can't pigeonhole him with any one role that he actually
[01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:11.660]   did that funny kind of squished up face I guess he has a little agents of shield right now he
[01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:17.500]   also has a podcast the super ego podcast I think he peers on it I don't think that he's always a
[01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:21.260]   few years I get it you're right yeah yeah please like yeah he's like he's a lead of himself let me
[01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:24.540]   play a little you'll recognize his voice probably let's listen to a little bit of his head to ask
[01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:29.580]   that question like I said there were plenty of multiplexas in LA in which you see con air or
[01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:33.900]   broken arrow or Eddie Murphy's remake of the nanny professor nothing wrong with those movies if
[01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:38.300]   people need bread and circuses better it be bread from the best flower in spring water and circuses
[01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:43.020]   under the cleanest canvas tends to help you and it sounds like you it's exactly the kind of thing
[01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:49.260]   you say Andy and by the way happy birthday patent Oswald patent Oswald it's his birthday today
[01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:54.460]   somebody's helmet yay so that's it this is good you know what I did here as you described that I
[01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:58.860]   went to the book silver screen fiend learning about life from an addiction to film because I too love
[01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:04.620]   film and I feel like that's been a huge part of my life and then I added it to my wish list so I
[01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:09.180]   keep a wish list of and this is something everybody who's an audible subscriber probably does because

[01:06:48.620 --> 01:06:54.300]   well i'm tempted i want to know what that is yeah right my dad was my dad was driving
[01:06:54.300 --> 01:07:00.220]   north carolina with my older kids but still at the time they were 15 and 17 and uh yeah he was
[01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:05.420]   listening to girl with a dragon tattoo oh so he had to he had to stop he had to stop that wasn't
[01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:10.620]   going to work for the kind of a show that started to build up to his story yeah oh yeah here's here's
[01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:14.860]   another tip the the version of animal house that you see on cable all the time yeah has been
[01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:19.180]   substantially edited from the dvd you got from red box so don't show that to your little kids
[01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:25.980]   don't lick the minivan and other things i never thought i'd say to my kids that's what you need
[01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:35.100]   to be listening to audible.com/macbreak uh you've all by now used apple id you tap your iphone uh on
[01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:42.380]   the uh register and boom you walk out the door happy uh with no more effort on your part well
[01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:50.700]   apparently one mazuri lawmaker says no no no no no too easy democratic representative joshua
[01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:56.140]   peters from st loris luis says the bill he introduced wednesday requires customers to show a state
[01:07:56.140 --> 01:08:02.620]   driver's license or other identification when they use a tap to pay app because
[01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:08.620]   that's why it went that enough it's witchcraft i don't know if i trashed that touch id
[01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:14.220]   and also clerks will be required to verify the identity and write down the id number and keep it
[01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:22.460]   on record or the and no dancing no dancing or the store could be held liable for fraudulent
[01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:27.580]   purchases and of course i'm you guys are just making fun of him i'm thinking maybe walmart got
[01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:31.420]   to him and said hey you know the problem with these tapping days we don't know who these people are
[01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:35.740]   not as secure as qr code yeah really want to be here or we would really like to keep track of
[01:08:35.740 --> 01:08:40.220]   these people so we're gonna execute this rampage on a little bit using tap to pay to show you how
[01:08:40.220 --> 01:08:45.900]   dangerous it is to do all the constituents who are upset right now you voted for him he didn't
[01:08:45.900 --> 01:08:51.420]   understand he says uh we want to make sure no fraudulent purchases are made using a stolen device
[01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:58.380]   apparently unclear on the idea of touch id or the history of cart fraud well and how much easier it
[01:08:58.380 --> 01:09:03.900]   is to make a fake driver's license than to fake a thumbprint or just socially engineer with us all
[01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:08.300]   in if you validated this of course you if you uh if you validated that you can't prove that someone
[01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:12.700]   is who they are by their thumbprint it would invalidate right an awful lot of criminal uh it's a
[01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:17.660]   conclusion that's all i'm saying you know you know it's you know that it is a pretty accurate way to do
[01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:23.500]   that given that you are standing in front of them and you are holding it down i don't know it's i mean
[01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:29.260]   there's so many ways to we send people out i mean i'm not gonna go on there but i mean people use
[01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:36.060]   credit cards all the time that aren't that aren't theirs apple uh has some targets for battery life
[01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:41.420]   and apparently according to mark german and nine to five mac once again great scoop the cpu inside the
[01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:49.260]   apple watch will be a five level a five current uh ipad and iphone use an a seven eight eight
[01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:58.940]   so a five goes back to the four s or the five five probably yeah i don't remember yeah a five is
[01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:04.460]   what's in the current ipad touch it's a current apple tv it's plenty fast enough yeah for a watch yeah
[01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:09.180]   plenty fast enough they want to hit 60 frames per second leo it's almost like a religious thing
[01:10:09.180 --> 01:10:13.660]   for them for the first time people with knowledge of the apple watch's development have provided
[01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:17.580]   mark german with his specific performance targets apple wants to achieve for the battery
[01:10:18.220 --> 01:10:23.980]   actual numbers may fall short of this they have used a very powerful relatively powerful processor
[01:10:23.980 --> 01:10:30.780]   for a watch and a high quality screen both of which contribute to significant power drain running a
[01:10:30.780 --> 01:10:36.860]   stripped down version of ios codename ski hill the apple s one chip inside the apple watch is
[01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:42.700]   surprisingly close in performance of the version of apple's a five uh while the retina class color
[01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:48.940]   displays capable of 60 frames per second apple initially this is mark german again i'm just reading
[01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:54.460]   him wanted apple watch to provide roughly one full day of usage that's kind of what tim cook
[01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:59.740]   implied you'll charge it every night as of 2014 apple wanted to watch to provide roughly two and
[01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:06.300]   a half to four hours of active application use 19 hours of combined active passive use three days
[01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:13.500]   of stand by or four days if in a sleep mode however sources say apple will only achieve two to three
[01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:19.180]   days and stand by our low power modes that's certainly fine uh i mean you you might might have
[01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:24.220]   had the same experience i had with this motor 360 that so long as i'm apps i'm almost guaranteed
[01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:30.300]   to get through a full day with that's all i care about yep even even if we define a full day is i
[01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:35.020]   have to get up check out at my hotel at four a.m do all kinds of meetings then go out to dinner with
[01:11:35.020 --> 01:11:41.340]   friends and then catch the red eye home and we're sort of fighting full day as like 22 hours i'm fine
[01:11:41.340 --> 01:11:45.660]   anything above that because again i've got at the end of the day i'm going to take off this watch
[01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:50.620]   put it on the nightstand i'm not averse to putting it on top of a charging pad now when i do that and
[01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:54.700]   you know it's interesting because the moto 360 shipped with fairly poor battery life but with
[01:11:54.700 --> 01:12:00.060]   several firmware updates is actually pretty darn good at this point yeah i mean they had to it was a
[01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:04.780]   it was actually a failure it looks like with uh the software where if it couldn't if it lost contact
[01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:09.580]   with a phone it would just just scream for help bloody murder over and over again and don't kill
[01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:14.140]   the battery uh but they did it's more tweaks too but again now that i if they gave me an extra
[01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:17.820]   couple of days of battery life i would certainly take it but there's a there's a point in which
[01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:22.780]   it's like okay this is good enough apple still looking to get two and a half hours of heavy
[01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:28.380]   application use such as gameplay processor intensive gameplay so if you're playing snake on your watch
[01:12:28.380 --> 01:12:32.140]   it should go for two and a half hours anybody plays snake for two and a half hours you know that's
[01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:37.180]   there's no native apps until next year until later that's not even issue right three and a half hours
[01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:42.300]   of standard app use so and that means with the screen on i mean it's used with the screen on the
[01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:46.860]   screen updating you staring at it yeah i mean that's actually pretty good given my experience
[01:12:46.860 --> 01:12:53.100]   with with phones and watches three and a half hours of screen time is a lot for a day most battery
[01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:57.660]   is i think i think i didn't even say that's too much for a watch if you're saying that you expect
[01:12:57.660 --> 01:13:02.380]   anybody to spend three hours looking at this you're probably not clear on what is for actually
[01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:08.300]   there's a more that just the more you need to have a go ahead i'm sorry just i'm sorry
[01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:12.140]   this one last thing i want to say was that the more important thing is how long can you exercise
[01:13:12.140 --> 01:13:16.540]   with this and still have the battery can you actually run a full marathon for hours of straight
[01:13:16.540 --> 01:13:22.620]   exercise tracking yeah so that's gonna marathon if you're fast if you're if you're a a uh
[01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:29.020]   because it's really good marathon three hours right my new training goal is to actually make it to the
[01:13:29.020 --> 01:13:34.300]   end of this run before the the watch like stops letting data whether it's a phone or it's a watch
[01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:38.220]   the thing is that battery life is a currency and you spend it and if you add a radio that spends
[01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:42.300]   more battery life if you add a screen if you add color if you add density all of those things are
[01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:46.540]   battery life that you're expending a pebble is an eating display that gets lots of battery life
[01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:49.980]   but some people want a color display and some people want other features so you always have to
[01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:54.300]   get this trade off of how much stuff it does versus how long it does it for one of the big issues
[01:13:54.300 --> 01:14:00.540]   again balancing act then and we've noted this with uh android wear watches is the display of time
[01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:06.380]   and and red wear watches affect all those smart watches i've ever used when you're when your
[01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:13.500]   hand is down your wrist is down they go dark or they go to a very low power display apple uh has
[01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:18.780]   conducted numerous tests to determine how long it can run in purely timekeeping modes german says
[01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:22.780]   we're told the watch should be able to display its clock face for three hours including
[01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:28.780]   watch ticking animations moving move any moving parts use more juice as you said again that's
[01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:32.220]   if you're staring at it like uh john goober mentioned this on the talk show last week and
[01:14:32.220 --> 01:14:36.700]   i've heard similar but they've spent in a nordin amount of time testing the the gesture for looking
[01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:40.300]   at the watch turning on putting it away turning it off and that's the kind of thing that helps
[01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:43.740]   them get battery efficient that's one thing that's weak on the mode of 360 and my experience i don't
[01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:47.900]   know what your experience has been handy but but sometimes when you flip your wrist up to look at
[01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:51.500]   it doesn't wake up and you kind of shake your wrist a little bit to see what time you know i had
[01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:56.620]   i had that exact same problem the first day but that's because i think residual effects of wearing
[01:14:56.620 --> 01:15:00.460]   the pebble for a month and a half where i feel as though they're looking for the accelerometer
[01:15:00.460 --> 01:15:05.580]   thing rest this is just simply it's it's so you're not asking it's not asking for a snap it's just
[01:15:05.580 --> 01:15:11.900]   asking for uh just asking for a simple turn as soon as i retrain my wrist to not expected to be a
[01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:17.260]   pebble i stop bothering but yeah so what should i do so should i go like this or should i just go
[01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:22.140]   like that nope don't don't snap just go like that and it will like that is all it needs okay
[01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:27.020]   so i need to be trained on how to look at my watch apparently you're turning it wrongly i'm turning
[01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:30.220]   it wrong you're pointing your back your back that's the whole like the singularity is the
[01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:34.220]   convergence of us of the the machines getting trained up for tas and us being trained in the
[01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:38.540]   machine yeah some of that has to happen and so when we talk to siri you know it's like siri i
[01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:44.140]   want you know call fish and you know that was to get there's that's it actually that's a great
[01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:47.580]   point because that's the same thing the first two days with this watch were incredibly frustrating
[01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:53.100]   because of how poorly other devices work because i was talking to i was it does voice commands i was
[01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:57.900]   talking to it like siri and was getting it right maybe half to three quarters of the time but as
[01:15:57.900 --> 01:16:04.300]   soon as i said take a note remember that tomorrow the is going to be 400 people coming and they're
[01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:10.060]   gonna be arriving at 2 p.m if i just speak normally 100 almost every single time if i say remember
[01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:16.060]   that tomorrow or 100 people are coming right it's true you know you don't have to talk to it as
[01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:20.700]   though you're angry with it yeah which is what you have to do with siri german says nearly in order
[01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:27.420]   remember tomorrow to pick up eggs excellent anunciation is training a whole new generation of
[01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:34.780]   an unsiators i'm a trained professional trained announcer and i have difficulty i'm training an
[01:16:34.780 --> 01:16:37.420]   announcer i'm a trained announcer professional
[01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:45.260]   i'm waiting for some kukamanga express ready to leave from track nine track nine where do you go
[01:16:45.260 --> 01:16:55.340]   to school for that i would like to do that actually i want to do it in france the i love the french
[01:16:55.340 --> 01:16:57.820]   ta ta ta ta
[01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:05.340]   apparently apple has circulated three thousand test units already so you might if you go to the
[01:17:05.340 --> 01:17:11.580]   uh campus see a few people wearing these watches mostly the stainless steel variant
[01:17:11.580 --> 01:17:16.940]   they've all probably you have probably come in and have them unlock it off your wrist you know it's
[01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:22.140]   oh yeah or they put it around your ankle like a uh home arrest device yeah exactly you can tell
[01:17:22.140 --> 01:17:26.620]   by the millinazia of their bands leo you can tell them by the millinazia i want that millinazia band
[01:17:26.620 --> 01:17:30.300]   i don't even care about the watch you just want the band you know i think you know i've been really
[01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:35.580]   thinking about the bands i think this is going to be a crazy huge industry is the band because i
[01:17:35.580 --> 01:17:39.740]   you know i now now that you the watch is coming i saw this i don't know if you've seen this thing
[01:17:39.740 --> 01:17:44.620]   that leatherman has yes has a band with screwdrivers and and they have like a little watch and i
[01:17:44.620 --> 01:17:48.460]   and i all i can think of look you know they've watched edition that they're offering and all i can
[01:17:48.460 --> 01:17:53.260]   think of is oh that would be a great band for me they're getting a lot of calls Alex yeah i know
[01:17:53.260 --> 01:17:57.020]   they're getting a lot of call wheel it's called the leatherman second thought was that if your
[01:17:57.020 --> 01:18:00.700]   problem is like with bands like that it's like hairy wrist don't worry after two days of worry
[01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:06.940]   that what hairy wrist will no longer be a problem yeah this is the band by the way of 150 to 200
[01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:14.300]   dollars the leatherman tread it's definitely kinky and it turns into a knife what no no no it's
[01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:18.460]   not gonna do a knife every one of those things are a little screwdriver they're little tools
[01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:22.060]   yeah you just you just take it off and you and you like fold it to what what screwdriver you want
[01:18:22.060 --> 01:18:28.300]   and then you and i gotta tell you i use i use little screwdrivers a lot and i i need one this is the
[01:18:28.300 --> 01:18:33.260]   lumberjacking of america yeah the real the galaxy is this great there's a great story behind it like
[01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:37.980]   the the guy who designed it works for leatherman and was frustrated because at some sort of security
[01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:42.140]   checkpoint he had to hit hilly neighbors multi-tool everybody didn't have a blade on it yeah it's like
[01:18:42.140 --> 01:18:47.260]   if i hide things on a bracelet they're not going to challenge me are they is that true you can go
[01:18:47.260 --> 01:18:52.940]   through uh customs or whatever well they shouldn't because it's not it's not a blade so there's no
[01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:57.100]   blade out they're gonna have with it i'm sorry sir your watch band is a set of screwdrivers
[01:18:57.100 --> 01:19:05.580]   wow you're touching my top what's your issue wow it's nothing awesome what the hell i'm sorry
[01:19:05.580 --> 01:19:13.660]   but exactly if you want this now look at that so you just fold it and there you go oh pop your tribe
[01:19:13.660 --> 01:19:21.820]   try oh i want this i know do we know if apple's gonna make the attachment to the watch proprietary
[01:19:21.820 --> 01:19:26.380]   like the mags if it though there's no there's no there's no chip in it there's no but you have to
[01:19:26.380 --> 01:19:30.380]   light oh i guess you could duplicate it huh there's probably a lot of factors in china reverse
[01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:35.420]   engineering but i bet i bet there's gonna be some sort of like mfi program that says well you know
[01:19:35.420 --> 01:19:39.180]   of course you could buy cheap doffcops but if you have this logo on it and pay an extra 18
[01:19:39.180 --> 01:19:42.860]   dollars you know that this has been right to the speeding tolerances of yeah well it'll just keep
[01:19:42.860 --> 01:19:47.980]   on releasing on its own otherwise you know it just just keeps popping off but that mfi program
[01:19:47.980 --> 01:19:52.860]   is not a joke i mean they test they test that stuff in ordinarily but i mean really test to
[01:19:52.860 --> 01:19:58.700]   watch band really i mean do we need to i don't know i think there's gonna be an i think they want
[01:19:58.700 --> 01:20:03.020]   i think they want to protect the value of the mfi brand yeah and so i don't i don't think they'd
[01:20:03.020 --> 01:20:07.660]   miss the trick to say look we have mfi certified bands that here's here's here's here's rubber bands
[01:20:07.660 --> 01:20:11.820]   that have been like torn apart here's a watch that fell apart and fell into a toilet but hey if you
[01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:15.660]   have an mfi band you will never toilet exit this year five thousand dollar
[01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:19.740]   mfi page now it'll say what kind of accessory do you want to make if it has things that need like
[01:20:19.740 --> 01:20:24.780]   accessory protocol or the home kit protocol you need mfi if you're making a case just go download
[01:20:24.780 --> 01:20:29.900]   our schematics right now and bless you sir there depends which way they go so there will be a magsafe
[01:20:29.900 --> 01:20:34.700]   inductance charging mechanism for the watch that will i presume and be proprietary and probably
[01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:40.620]   expensive um sources according to mark german indicate that was responsible for slower than
[01:20:40.620 --> 01:20:44.460]   expected recharging times something they're obviously going to want to work on
[01:20:44.460 --> 01:20:50.700]   uh there are plastic and stainless steel versions of the charger depending on which watch you get
[01:20:50.700 --> 01:21:00.460]   um end of march start saving now i want one i'm gonna i really i really want to see the over
[01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:05.740]   under on what the addition is gonna cost that's gonna be the fun number that's the expensive one
[01:21:05.740 --> 01:21:10.140]   right the addition you start off with more than five grand or less than five grand and then you
[01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:14.700]   start to say six grand it was fun because you can charge anything i mean if they go by traditional
[01:21:14.700 --> 01:21:18.140]   watch companies you can charge anything you want because you're not paying for materials beyond a
[01:21:18.140 --> 01:21:23.420]   certain point you're paying for a fancy watch that's you know almost limitless in price yeah but that's
[01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:29.180]   how how well can they sell the point that can they make the case that no no we didn't just take
[01:21:29.180 --> 01:21:34.460]   the molds for the cheap one and put a more expensive metal in it and change the mark up to eight thousand
[01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:39.420]   percent instead of forty percent at least at least you know it's a great form of entertainment is
[01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:44.460]   watching these like these companies that really really need to sell you on the craftsmanship
[01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:50.620]   here's eight an eighty three minute unedited video of a watch engineer chan shaping just one
[01:21:50.620 --> 01:21:56.700]   time on one gear in this watch and there are 400 gears just like it the interesting thing is that
[01:21:56.700 --> 01:22:00.860]   there's 900 thousand dollars marketing is all social engineering there's always a low tier a
[01:22:00.860 --> 01:22:04.540]   mid tier and a high tier and you have to pick what's palatable to people so apple traditionally is
[01:22:04.540 --> 01:22:08.620]   said people will pay for a bigger screen or they'll pay for more ram regardless of what the screen
[01:22:08.620 --> 01:22:12.860]   or ram actually cost them those are what we'll accept to pay higher tier prices for and this
[01:22:12.860 --> 01:22:16.540]   time they're trying it well there are two different sizes but they're trying it mostly with materials
[01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:20.380]   will they pay more for aluminum or they pay more for gold and yes there's a cost to the extra
[01:22:20.380 --> 01:22:25.580]   components but it's just how much the market will bear at those price steps one is just like
[01:22:25.580 --> 01:22:28.860]   college set of people who want to be able to say that they have the expensive watch because they
[01:22:28.860 --> 01:22:32.460]   can afford it I mean I think that that's the bottom line I mean they're gonna uh they're gonna put
[01:22:32.460 --> 01:22:35.980]   enough into it I don't know if it's gonna be a real value it's not something I would get but
[01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:40.220]   it's but I think that uh I think that there's definitely a subset of people that buy iPhones that
[01:22:40.220 --> 01:22:44.060]   put the gold plating on them and you know all the bling that they add to them so I think that's
[01:22:44.060 --> 01:22:48.700]   gonna be that's the card audience exactly do you want do you want to like the lifestyles of the
[01:22:48.700 --> 01:22:53.180]   Richard famous tour of any trump any any apartment that trump the Donald Trump lives in where it's
[01:22:53.180 --> 01:23:00.380]   like you see this toilet seat it's made out of 24 carat gold it's incredibly luxurious and everybody
[01:23:00.380 --> 01:23:04.540]   else is saying yeah you're a damn idiot because you just took something common that works the way
[01:23:04.540 --> 01:23:09.260]   you just made it found a way to spend 1.8 million dollars for it you're dumb heavy metal poison

[01:24:04.620 --> 01:24:09.260]   spotlight thing was a privacy thing because you could disable automatic loading images which
[01:24:09.260 --> 01:24:13.020]   was tracking pixels in the mail but spotlight would still show them so now spotlight respects
[01:24:13.020 --> 01:24:17.820]   the preference they said oh that's a very good point yeah uh addresses an issue may
[01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:23.340]   cause the input method to switch languages unexpectedly improves stability and security
[01:24:23.340 --> 01:24:29.820]   and safari and yeah most importantly fixes a number of security issues including thunder
[01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:35.340]   strike and those as you mentioned it's google zero days so you you must download that and
[01:24:35.340 --> 01:24:39.500]   install that as quickly as you can if you're using obviously if you're using Yosemite
[01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:47.020]   there's also updates for iOS right yeah also just as an aside mavericks and mountain line also
[01:24:47.020 --> 01:24:51.100]   got safari and security updates as well right because some of those everyone who who was yelling
[01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:56.540]   last week that apple had abandoned you know older versions not once again not true eight point
[01:24:56.540 --> 01:25:03.900]   one point three bug fixes stability and big deal reduces the amount of storage required to
[01:25:03.900 --> 01:25:08.780]   perform a software update that's really important maybe even a response kind of back-headed response
[01:25:08.780 --> 01:25:15.420]   to that class action lawsuit over a storage but people with eight gig or 16 gig iPhones will be
[01:25:15.420 --> 01:25:20.220]   happy to know with apple like the the usual response is a very human one when people had trouble
[01:25:20.220 --> 01:25:23.980]   downloading the update for iOS 8 there's a bunch of people at apple who have a bunch of relatives
[01:25:23.980 --> 01:25:27.740]   who have those who have those same problems in there they want to fix it they actually you know
[01:25:27.740 --> 01:25:32.380]   not everyone has the latest phone you have people working on the iphone whose relatives have
[01:25:32.380 --> 01:25:36.140]   iphone for us and they want to make sure there's really good performance for that in it so they
[01:25:36.140 --> 01:25:40.220]   they were determined to fix this and i installed it on a couple of devices and it was lightning
[01:25:40.220 --> 01:25:44.540]   quick i didn't have to re-logging and i didn't have to re-board i just downloaded it was ready to go
[01:25:44.540 --> 01:25:54.220]   safari was faster the phone was faster it was a really good update good so 10.9 10.8 10.9 10.10
[01:25:54.220 --> 01:26:06.380]   updated ios 8.1.3 out apple tv pushed an update this week too uh 120 sports i have been added
[01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:13.500]   when no no a channel called 120 sports has been added what is that they can the thing with apple
[01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:17.020]   tv is there's two separate tracks for that so you have the software update they'll get new versions
[01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:21.500]   of ios apple tv runs ios but apple insists on labeling it with a different version number
[01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:25.420]   makes a little bit confusing but they can actually the way that the springboard works on apple tv
[01:26:25.420 --> 01:26:30.380]   is they can those are essentially almost like web apps they can push an icon somewhere so this
[01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:33.980]   is not really an update then it's just a new it's a new channel it's the same way the apple
[01:26:33.980 --> 01:26:38.380]   events channel shows up before every event the itunes festival icon shows up and then goes away
[01:26:38.380 --> 01:26:43.180]   it just they can add things to that grid whenever they want to okay any any problem
[01:26:43.180 --> 01:26:47.900]   they reported with the ios or os10 updates everything's going okay everybody somebody
[01:26:47.900 --> 01:26:53.100]   saying the ios update brick to my iphone six code wrangler says they will always be a percentage
[01:26:53.100 --> 01:26:56.380]   of people for whom the update has an ill effect and it's just because of the complexity of the
[01:26:56.380 --> 01:27:00.060]   code base at this point and how many differences there aren't everybody's phones but usually you
[01:27:00.060 --> 01:27:05.500]   can restore it or do something that'll get you back on track 120 sports apparently is on demand
[01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:08.780]   a video from the nba the mlb and the nfl
[01:27:08.780 --> 01:27:16.460]   and has sports news and highlights of recent games so and i think this is going to be a really
[01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:22.220]   interesting market to to watch as as these uh all of these sports networks are all
[01:27:22.220 --> 01:27:25.580]   what kind of or they're becoming their own network they're kind of slowly you know they're still
[01:27:25.580 --> 01:27:30.220]   taking the money from the broadcasters but they got their own they own the content they're they're
[01:27:30.220 --> 01:27:35.340]   doing you know videoed on demand right now but it is a frightening thing for a lot of these
[01:27:35.340 --> 01:27:39.420]   broadcasters to think about what it looks like if the nfl just decided to start distributing all
[01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:44.780]   of the you know everything live you know at some point which is probably 20 years away but it's
[01:27:44.780 --> 01:27:49.180]   it is something that is they're all kind of moving towards is taking more and more control over
[01:27:49.180 --> 01:27:56.060]   that content like hbo right like hbo like cbs like uh you know a lot of the end with the dish
[01:27:56.860 --> 01:28:01.020]   yeah i mean you know eventually all of the everyone's gonna have i mean all of the networks themselves
[01:28:01.020 --> 01:28:06.060]   are gonna have their own play you know i think that's that's also kind of coming down the path is that
[01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:10.620]   everyone is looking for how is their app going to work on the phone it's you know and the real
[01:28:10.620 --> 01:28:15.500]   loser is not so much the networks as much as the cable operators as this become as cable operation
[01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:19.900]   where it really is cutting the cord but in a the cable operators are gonna have to be happy with
[01:28:19.900 --> 01:28:24.220]   serving up you know bandwidth because everyone's gonna be getting in a whole bunch of different
[01:28:24.220 --> 01:28:28.780]   ways and i think that part of the problem is is that cable can't move as fast as as hbo you know
[01:28:28.780 --> 01:28:33.340]   wants to in a lot of different ways um and i think that we're you know be interesting to see in
[01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:38.460]   april whether we see he starts seeing some you know 4k your game of thrones or in march you know
[01:28:38.460 --> 01:28:43.740]   it's amazing it's amazing how the intermediation is moved from the transport to the display you
[01:28:43.740 --> 01:28:47.180]   always have a middleman but now it's no longer the guy in the truck it's the guy who makes the
[01:28:47.180 --> 01:28:51.500]   screen that you look at right well and and i think that it's but i think that there's there there's
[01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:55.100]   a real opportunity here where we're getting to a point where the content creators are getting
[01:28:55.100 --> 01:28:59.420]   closer and closer to the consumers you know where the people who are writing it and doing it are
[01:28:59.420 --> 01:29:04.540]   getting much closer and there is there's less and less you know proxies in between which is i i think
[01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:09.420]   pretty uh it's pretty exciting for content creators whereas you know it's not the movie industry or
[01:29:09.420 --> 01:29:14.300]   the cable networks or the the cable companies you know all that stuff is kind of going away and
[01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:19.020]   being distributed now there's still youtube or i-tunes or all these other things so there's always
[01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:23.740]   going to be somebody managing that distribution but but i think that the creator has more control
[01:29:23.740 --> 01:29:28.620]   over this than they than they ever have well of course sunday is the super bowl probably the most
[01:29:28.620 --> 01:29:34.780]   valuable television program of the year and nbc says if you have an ipad or mac you can watch it for
[01:29:34.780 --> 01:29:41.820]   free they're debuting a new super stream sunday promotion which allows us base users to watch
[01:29:41.820 --> 01:29:49.500]   11 continuous hours of content through the nbc sports.com website or the nbc sports live
[01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:53.980]   extra app on your ipad or ipad touch i just want the american commercials that's all i want i don't
[01:29:53.980 --> 01:29:57.980]   think i wonder if they put the commercials on or not you know every time they've streamed i've seen
[01:29:57.980 --> 01:30:01.420]   streams in the past they didn't have the commercials which really makes it much less interesting oh
[01:30:01.420 --> 01:30:05.500]   you know you know karaise you can already see the commercials like three days beforehand i know
[01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:09.660]   this is starting to become like ces where everyone wants to announce something before everybody's
[01:30:09.660 --> 01:30:16.300]   announcing everything i want to watch it in c2 i like to see it in the exactly you need to
[01:30:16.300 --> 01:30:21.660]   it's like seeing public art in a museum as opposed to the parkland which was intended that's right
[01:30:21.660 --> 01:30:28.380]   super stream sunday starts february one at noon eastern time that will not only will you get super
[01:30:28.380 --> 01:30:36.060]   bowl 49 you'll get the halftime show with katie perry and the pre and post game shows and an
[01:30:36.060 --> 01:30:39.100]   episode of the blacklist and you don't even have to have a cable subscription
[01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:44.380]   nice and there's also a special there's a special setting so that it'll make the game last even
[01:30:44.380 --> 01:30:49.740]   longer every time i want the cut down another 30 seconds to the clock they cut when they cut out
[01:30:49.740 --> 01:30:55.740]   all the commercials all the all the jabbering all the timeouts it's a an nfl game is about 11
[01:30:55.740 --> 01:31:00.860]   minutes long i kid i kid you not when you add mark on smart speed is about 12 minutes yeah
[01:31:01.900 --> 01:31:06.380]   but it's it's getting it's getting more watchable believe it or not i had i had a brush with great
[01:31:06.380 --> 01:31:11.180]   technology yet it went i went went out to breakfast last week and i was told by the person that was
[01:31:11.180 --> 01:31:15.340]   had been sitting there for about 45 minutes that he'd had a conversation with two people who were
[01:31:15.340 --> 01:31:21.100]   responsible for miking up players uh for the for the new england patriots and they had a long
[01:31:21.100 --> 01:31:25.980]   this he's he's a mac developer too and so they had a long conversation about all the telemetry that's
[01:31:25.980 --> 01:31:31.340]   wired into these uniforms just to make this make football more watchable for people who are not
[01:31:31.340 --> 01:31:36.060]   just insanely involved in football and the under the the the underwriting theme is that the whole
[01:31:36.060 --> 01:31:41.660]   goal is for the nfl to make these games look just like john matten nfl games you know because people
[01:31:41.660 --> 01:31:47.180]   are expecting to see uh electronic illustrations they're expecting to see like these camera shots
[01:31:47.180 --> 01:31:51.020]   that would have been impossible they're expecting to see players highlighted as they're moving and
[01:31:51.020 --> 01:31:55.180]   they're trying to do that sort of stuff so i i kind of like now think that i want to like start
[01:31:55.180 --> 01:32:00.460]   watching football because it's always been so boring to me because again four hours it's supposed to be
[01:32:00.460 --> 01:32:07.420]   as the the the math nerd says four quarters of 15 minutes each four times 15 is 60 minutes
[01:32:07.420 --> 01:32:12.780]   why is this taking four and a half hours even minus 45 minutes musical dance number
[01:32:12.780 --> 01:32:16.700]   well and the cool the cool thing about football in in general when it comes to media production
[01:32:16.700 --> 01:32:23.820]   is is that you have an a a piece of content that is making a lot of money i mean it is just
[01:32:23.820 --> 01:32:29.180]   printing money and and all they want to do is okay between last year and next year
[01:32:29.180 --> 01:32:32.860]   how are we going to make this even cooler you know like like an end and they're not
[01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:37.260]   it's really not a budget item as much as it is as it is like you know how do we make it work i
[01:32:37.260 --> 01:32:42.940]   love the nfl and i love they have a thing on the nfl network of the all the sound from the games
[01:32:42.940 --> 01:32:46.700]   that because they make up all the players here's i'll play a little bit of it for you it's amazing
[01:32:46.700 --> 01:32:50.940]   what the players actually are saying you see them from a distance but here's what they're actually
[01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:57.580]   saying it's kind of it's kind of amazing oh give me a complex man you gotta eat the breakfast
[01:32:57.580 --> 01:33:02.060]   with deep breakfast then lunch i have flaps
[01:33:02.060 --> 01:33:12.380]   i just forgot to breathe holla we gonna bow why you you know always angry once there was his
[01:33:12.380 --> 01:33:17.500]   prince he came from like Syria okay and he lived with some peaceful monkeys outside his hands
[01:33:17.500 --> 01:33:23.740]   boyfriend's cabin it had an old sheep dog named poco sinbad i can't okay i just want to tell you
[01:33:23.740 --> 01:33:28.940]   it's not what you thought when you go ahead you you two smart master make fun of people who
[01:33:28.940 --> 01:33:32.940]   who hurt people for a living that'll work out great actually it's a bet that's of course bad
[01:33:32.940 --> 01:33:37.420]   lip reading they do it every year this is the new one nfl 2015 the bad lip reading
[01:33:37.420 --> 01:33:44.140]   they're so good at it i don't know how they do it so they are so funny uh all right let's take a
[01:33:44.140 --> 01:33:48.860]   break when we come back to your picks of the week gentlemen line them up and we'll knock them down
[01:33:48.860 --> 01:33:55.900]   uh but first to worry about my mattress and that is not a bad lip reading actually want to talk to
[01:33:55.900 --> 01:34:03.260]   you about my casper mattress uh casper is an online retailer of premium mattresses for a fraction of
[01:34:03.260 --> 01:34:07.900]   the cost they are changing the mattress industry now you might say well i'm not going to buy a mattress
[01:34:07.900 --> 01:34:13.900]   online what if i don't like it don't worry in fact i would submit the idea of going to the
[01:34:13.900 --> 01:34:17.660]   mattress showroom and lying on it for five minutes under bright lights while some sales person
[01:34:17.660 --> 01:34:22.220]   stares at you is not the best way to see if that mattress is right for you you have to take off
[01:34:22.220 --> 01:34:27.260]   your clothes you have to you have to really interact with that mattress and casper lets you do it for

[01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:37.740]   all the coverage today but alfred remote has come out for ios if you're a fan of alfred i love
[01:36:37.740 --> 01:36:42.620]   the ester it's terrific it's like you know the modern version of quicksilver it makes it's like
[01:36:42.620 --> 01:36:48.460]   spotlight on hulk serum it lets you do a sort all sorts of keyboard wizardry with your mac and now

[01:37:00.860 --> 01:37:05.500]   degree you're gonna want to you're kind of person would run alfred on your desktop to begin with
[01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:09.900]   before you have any interest in the ios app but if you are the kind of person who would do that
[01:37:09.900 --> 01:37:15.580]   you will find this to be just you know completely up your alley i'm a man who had not i really
[01:37:15.580 --> 01:37:21.420]   love alfred so you need alfred on the mac to make this work yes and you control it with your ipad
[01:37:22.300 --> 01:37:26.380]   yeah and what give me an example one thing you could do with this there they'll show you right
[01:37:26.380 --> 01:37:31.900]   there on the video it basically just shows you all your alfred um was sorry we're all your alfred
[01:37:31.900 --> 01:37:35.820]   activities and again i haven't had a chance to use it yet i have downloaded it but i'm looking
[01:37:35.820 --> 01:37:41.580]   forward i use alfred on the mac love it it's a great it was it was the replacement for quicksilver yes
[01:37:41.580 --> 01:37:46.540]   and uh i love the guys too they're really uh they're really nice do you need the power pack to use
[01:37:46.540 --> 01:37:53.660]   alfred remote or i don't know i'm not although if you had the power pack you could do even more
[01:37:53.660 --> 01:37:59.900]   that's the and get it any i mean get it anyway support them why not all right alfred remote for
[01:37:59.900 --> 01:38:05.740]   ios you needed you on your desktop as well but it's uh highly recommended Alex Lindsey your pick of the
[01:38:05.740 --> 01:38:14.060]   week so um i i do a lot of events and oftentimes oftentimes you know you're recording those events
[01:38:14.060 --> 01:38:19.180]   and you know it's kind of an imperfect situation and you get some echo from a big room or you get
[01:38:19.180 --> 01:38:22.220]   a little bit of hiss because you turned up the mics because that's what you had to do to pull
[01:38:22.220 --> 01:38:26.220]   everybody in and and you have to go back and fix it and there's a lot of great tools that are built
[01:38:26.220 --> 01:38:31.740]   into many of these applications whether it's uh your sound editing op you know applications or
[01:38:31.740 --> 01:38:36.060]   final cut 10 or whatever else you're using and almost all of these you know allow you to use
[01:38:36.060 --> 01:38:40.300]   plugins and and one of the plugins that i've started to use for a lot of this to kind of clean things up
[01:38:40.860 --> 01:38:48.220]   is um is from isotro and this is called rx4 and uh and i've gotten it for i got it for a couple jobs
[01:38:48.220 --> 01:38:53.260]   and now it's something that i find myself really digging into so these are this is a really you know
[01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:56.780]   it's not the cheapest solution i have the advanced one which is i think about a thousand dollars
[01:38:56.780 --> 01:39:02.380]   is it a plugin it's a it's a plugin and a standalone so it'll open up as a standalone but it'll also
[01:39:02.380 --> 01:39:09.180]   open it'll also you'll see all the plugins in final cut 10 um i that's what i'm using i'm mostly
[01:39:09.180 --> 01:39:13.020]   using it in final cut 10 so i've got you know i've got some some stuff that i want to take out
[01:39:13.020 --> 01:39:19.180]   i've got some hiss i've got literally echo so you're like you're in a big room and uh you know and
[01:39:19.180 --> 01:39:25.820]   things are echoing around and it will it will not maybe completely reduce but very much uh you know
[01:39:25.820 --> 01:39:31.180]   not completely eliminate but but very much um get rid of much of the reverb that you have in the
[01:39:31.180 --> 01:39:37.500]   room and the analyzation is pretty nifty and it works yeah it it works it works it's pretty
[01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:43.340]   it's pretty amazing so um you know so it it's it's really good at you know going through there
[01:39:43.340 --> 01:39:49.820]   and finding stuff so you know removing some of the the again some of the hiss room noise reverb
[01:39:49.820 --> 01:39:53.980]   all of those things are things that you can that it really gives you some some heavy surgery
[01:39:53.980 --> 01:39:58.460]   much over top of what uh you can normally do you can see how where you're selecting some of the
[01:39:58.460 --> 01:40:02.860]   stuff you know is available in other applications like adobe audition and and so on so forth yeah
[01:40:02.860 --> 01:40:09.180]   that spectrum view i've used to eliminate laws and stuff in uh in addition similar similar to that
[01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:14.940]   it's it well it can be but the match audio the reverb and what i mostly use is the is the um
[01:40:14.940 --> 01:40:20.860]   noise removal and the reverb reduction um you know are the two things that i'm really uh but but
[01:40:20.860 --> 01:40:24.780]   there's a lot of tools in here that are you know and it's it does feel a little silly to spend
[01:40:24.780 --> 01:40:29.660]   three times as much on a one-one set of plug-in two thousand on the applications yeah it's a thousand
[01:40:29.660 --> 01:40:33.740]   the thousand dollars but i mean it's three times more than final cut itself and and um but it's a
[01:40:33.740 --> 01:40:37.900]   very specialized tool and if you find that you know you have recordings and you're trying to figure
[01:40:37.900 --> 01:40:43.420]   out a way to solve this um you know uh you know this is a pretty pretty awesome collection of tools
[01:40:43.420 --> 01:40:46.220]   um they make a lot of different collections those that's this is the only one that i have
[01:40:46.220 --> 01:40:52.220]   or use currently does this work with logic two yes okay so it'll it's a it's a standard i believe
[01:40:52.220 --> 01:40:58.140]   it's of you know whatever the vst you know plug-ins yeah yeah plug-in format so so it'll do um it'll
[01:40:58.140 --> 01:41:02.780]   it'll work in all of those any application that'll see those things and so um as i said what i'm
[01:41:02.780 --> 01:41:07.900]   primarily uh what i'm primarily working on is is in final cut tend to clean up videos that we've
[01:41:07.900 --> 01:41:13.180]   shot and uh so i um anyway so there's a thousand dollar version and a three hundred dollar version
[01:41:13.180 --> 01:41:18.380]   do you need the master version i mean you know i you know if you're just getting started i have to
[01:41:18.380 --> 01:41:24.060]   admit that that uh i got the the advanced one um because like it's the reverb stuff that i was
[01:41:24.060 --> 01:41:29.420]   the removing reverb which which is the primary reason i got into it and so that's part of the
[01:41:29.420 --> 01:41:35.340]   advanced solution so um you know and so the uh that's that's why i ended up with that but there's
[01:41:35.340 --> 01:41:39.900]   um there's a lot of great tools in the basic one but what i needed specifically needed the advanced
[01:41:39.900 --> 01:41:45.020]   one yeah and i see you might want to look at the bundles too because if you do like those iza
[01:41:45.020 --> 01:41:49.580]   to pro products and i've used a number of their plugins you might want to get the whole bundle
[01:41:49.580 --> 01:41:55.180]   yeah they make a lot of pretty amazing tools and again these are these are not tools for necessarily
[01:41:55.180 --> 01:41:59.740]   for the hobbyists unless you're really a broadcaster might you i mean this exactly it's actually a
[01:41:59.740 --> 01:42:03.980]   podcaster we had some in the early days when i was doing the audio on on these shows there were
[01:42:03.980 --> 01:42:09.740]   some really horrible problems yeah yes and it was nice to have these tools yeah yeah yeah it's nice
[01:42:09.740 --> 01:42:13.740]   it's nice to have a problem that can be solved by saying well if i pay this amount of money i never
[01:42:13.740 --> 01:42:18.620]   have to deal with this problem every day right or or that you have you just have a scalpel that
[01:42:18.620 --> 01:42:23.020]   you can really you know use for it you know a lot of times you know that it's not that the tools that
[01:42:23.020 --> 01:42:27.420]   are built into these apps aren't great but these are people that this is all they're working on you
[01:42:27.420 --> 01:42:31.980]   know is is trying to is figuring this stuff out and it it really um you know i know a lot of people
[01:42:31.980 --> 01:42:37.500]   that swear by ozone for instance you know ozone you know to do a lot of that use those too yeah
[01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:44.300]   and so so these are um you know pretty amazing uh you know solutions for you know from a highly
[01:42:44.300 --> 01:42:47.500]   specialized what's great is it's working inside of the application that you're already using you
[01:42:47.500 --> 01:42:51.420]   know you're not you're not having to pass it out to another application and then work on it you
[01:42:51.420 --> 01:42:56.300]   just open it up and start and start you know cooking through it and um you know again if the
[01:42:56.300 --> 01:43:00.380]   i know that i i was just talking to my sister about um my sister i think is going to get in
[01:43:00.380 --> 01:43:05.420]   doing some podcasting and and um uh and we were talking about it that there's some podcast out
[01:43:05.420 --> 01:43:08.460]   there that she really liked to listen to it but the audio quality was so bad she just couldn't
[01:43:08.460 --> 01:43:12.780]   keep on listening you know and and and if you're going to try to turn this into a business you know
[01:43:12.780 --> 01:43:18.780]   the audio has to be the audio is more important i think in podcasting and webcasting than than video
[01:43:18.780 --> 01:43:22.940]   you know it's you know you can deal with bad video pretty often that's why a lot of these
[01:43:22.940 --> 01:43:26.460]   you know lip dubs and everything else do really well is because the audio is great it's already
[01:43:26.460 --> 01:43:31.180]   pre-recorded and the video can be whatever it is because you know we'll give video a lot more room
[01:43:31.180 --> 01:43:44.060]   than we'll give audio to the work i agree i agree i z-o-t-o-p-e-i-z-o-tope.com rx4 uh yeah it looks cool
[01:43:44.060 --> 01:43:48.940]   i fix clipping that's all i want to know can i fix i know it does it does it does it does it
[01:43:48.940 --> 01:43:55.260]   great clipping yeah it has some great clipping uh fixes it built into it yeah look at this non-destructive clip gain
[01:43:55.260 --> 01:44:02.620]   dclick and it it it uh it does that and i believe it has an a ds-er as well that that works pretty well
[01:44:02.620 --> 01:44:09.020]   wow which you know when you have a lot of those really those those s's that really jump out at you
[01:44:09.020 --> 01:44:14.380]   we should get this uh Jason hell for our editors because we do use final cut i think if we had at least
[01:44:14.380 --> 01:44:19.740]   one uh one license in house yeah good idea yeah if you have one of those tools that you hope never
[01:44:19.740 --> 01:44:25.340]   didn't need to use but if you need to having it would be handy speaking of which Jason have you
[01:44:25.340 --> 01:44:30.300]   tried the new logic 10 just came out last week i haven't it's been a long time since i spent
[01:44:30.300 --> 01:44:34.380]   uh significant amount of time with logic to be honest i'm pretty much firmly in the pro tools camp
[01:44:34.380 --> 01:44:41.660]   uh i used to used to work with logic and i liked it just and this was before it it became kind of
[01:44:41.660 --> 01:44:46.300]   appleized um when it was a separate product from apples catalog and then they bought it
[01:44:46.300 --> 01:44:50.780]   uh it was just overly complicated for me and a lot of people said no i'm not a logic it's different
[01:44:50.780 --> 01:44:57.660]   yeah i'm not a logic user but uh a lot of people i know including my son love logic and um
[01:44:57.660 --> 01:45:03.100]   the new the new logic is apparently a lot easier to use uh it has some really nice new features and
[01:45:03.100 --> 01:45:08.780]   great new sounds so Jason hell uses it Dave whiskers uses it a lot of podcasters use it yeah
[01:45:08.780 --> 01:45:13.580]   it's really good for midi if if you're into midi instruments and everything it's midi editing
[01:45:13.580 --> 01:45:18.860]   capabilities are yeah our top not that's kind of what uh that's what uh Henry uses it for he has a
[01:45:18.860 --> 01:45:25.180]   midi a midi keyboard and he'll he'll do beats and yeah it's pretty cool what you can do um let's see
[01:45:25.180 --> 01:45:30.060]   Andy and an echo your pick of the week uh speaking of tools that you hope you never have to use but
[01:45:30.060 --> 01:45:34.460]   you're glad to have the times you need to use them of course i have a few weather emergency related
[01:45:34.460 --> 01:45:40.220]   picks this week um this is when something i bought like like three or four years ago that oh my goodness
[01:45:40.220 --> 01:45:45.340]   my my glad i have it this is eatens uh it comes called eaten has a line of emergency radios for the
[01:45:45.340 --> 01:45:51.180]   frx line this is the frx three and this is something you buy it during good weather you put in a
[01:45:51.180 --> 01:45:55.580]   closet you put it in a shelf you forget you have it and then when you do have a weather emergency
[01:45:55.580 --> 01:46:01.260]   where you lose power well guess what now you have a radio uh that has all the weather bands on it
[01:46:01.260 --> 01:46:06.060]   you can power it off of triple a batteries when the bet triple if the triple a batteries don't work
[01:46:06.060 --> 01:46:10.060]   it also has a rechargeable battery that of course you plugged it in and charged it beforehand
[01:46:10.060 --> 01:46:16.460]   if you forgot to do that too you have a hand crank so you can charge it up just like this
[01:46:16.460 --> 01:46:20.940]   and if you don't want to do this you can just use the solar cell and leave it outside and it will
[01:46:20.940 --> 01:46:27.740]   charge up uh the radio uh and not only that but it also has uh we have it on the back here it also
[01:46:27.740 --> 01:46:33.820]   has a usb port on the back of it so that you can also use any of these charging methods to recharge
[01:46:33.820 --> 01:46:40.300]   your phone uh when you need it uh and they're tied there fortunately we the blizzard wasn't as bad as
[01:46:40.300 --> 01:46:45.580]   it uh as the worst case scenario didn't even lose power here today but uh this was definitely
[01:46:45.580 --> 01:46:49.260]   something that is always somewhere where i can get it because it's also a flashlight it's also
[01:46:49.260 --> 01:46:54.220]   emergency light uh it's like there i haven't i've had had times where the power is out for like
[01:46:54.220 --> 01:46:59.100]   days at a time worst case scenario and that's when like especially after this the cell tower backup
[01:46:59.100 --> 01:47:04.060]   battery a couple blocks away dies out and now you have no source of any information except for
[01:47:04.060 --> 01:47:09.260]   radio that is good that is focused on emergency uh sort of information uh so this these aren't
[01:47:09.260 --> 01:47:13.820]   that expensive the cheapest one they make is about 30 bucks they have a version that's a couple of
[01:47:13.820 --> 01:47:18.300]   generations past this now that's about uh 80 or 90 bucks that has a much bigger battery it can
[01:47:18.300 --> 01:47:23.100]   actually recharge your tablet uh and stuff like that but imagine this this is why you have kids like
[01:47:23.100 --> 01:47:28.060]   you want to you you want to send some text messages have your kids sitting in the corner like this
[01:47:28.060 --> 01:47:33.180]   churning butter for a good like uh 20 minutes to charge it up just such a good thing just uh just
[01:47:33.180 --> 01:47:37.820]   to have standing by again buy it forget that you have it until oh my god thank god i have that i
[01:47:37.820 --> 01:47:41.740]   bought that two or three years ago uh and the second and last thing i want to recommend is uh weather
[01:47:41.740 --> 01:47:47.420]   apps there are like a million of them so few of them are any good because you have a very peculiar
[01:47:47.420 --> 01:47:52.540]   need for information in especially in a weather situation my favorite is an app called bright weather
[01:47:53.020 --> 01:47:58.860]   because they have the best combination of i just want a quick answer do i need to i'm
[01:47:58.860 --> 01:48:03.100]   planning to go into town or do something on thursday is the weather going to be nice on thursday do i
[01:48:03.100 --> 01:48:07.100]   need to bring an umbrella and it will quickly give you an answer to that so lots lots of apps will
[01:48:07.100 --> 01:48:11.100]   give you the here's a happy sunny icon with a cloud behind that instantly tells you what you
[01:48:11.100 --> 01:48:15.580]   want to do but then there times you really want to have that deep dive look okay so you're telling
[01:48:15.580 --> 01:48:20.700]   me this is there's a storm clearly explained to me what's going to happen is this going to be a
[01:48:21.260 --> 01:48:26.300]   don't make plans day is this going to be a you're okay so long as the streets are cleared by 5 p.m.
[01:48:26.300 --> 01:48:32.780]   or is this really a go down and buy throw some elbows and buy bottled water and and canned goods
[01:48:32.780 --> 01:48:38.140]   sort of thing the other the other good thing to have is whatever your local news weather
[01:48:38.140 --> 01:48:42.940]   app is almost every major city like your your network affiliate will have like a weather app
[01:48:42.940 --> 01:48:47.500]   here in new england my favorite is uh new england cable news and ecn because i still think that if
[01:48:47.500 --> 01:48:52.540]   you want to get the full picture of weather in a short amount of time you will never do better
[01:48:52.540 --> 01:48:57.820]   than the two-minute long explanation that a weather for that a weather meteorologist on tv will
[01:48:57.820 --> 01:49:02.060]   give you because they're the people who will again they don't waste your time they say here's what's
[01:49:02.060 --> 01:49:04.620]   got here's what the weather's going to be for the next two days for something that we're looking
[01:49:04.620 --> 01:49:09.020]   out for if there's really bad weather coming they will explain to you here's how bad it's going to
[01:49:09.020 --> 01:49:12.860]   be and when it's going to be really really bad and also things like and we've all we've got
[01:49:12.860 --> 01:49:17.100]   noticed that nine ninety five or one-on-one is going to be shut down starting for two p.m. and
[01:49:17.100 --> 01:49:21.500]   they're going to start towing people off of the highway starting at eight p.m. onward that's not
[01:49:21.500 --> 01:49:25.980]   that i don't think that i've seen any app that is as efficient at giving you in two minutes here's a
[01:49:25.980 --> 01:49:31.420]   complete picture what's going on as the weather app uh that produced by your local tv station that
[01:49:31.420 --> 01:49:38.380]   will just do nothing but stream whatever the local forecast is so there you are disaster preparedness
[01:49:39.020 --> 01:49:46.220]   from the planet hoss with anti-prepared be prepared my pick real quick i've got the princess we're
[01:49:46.220 --> 01:49:50.860]   kind of sealed off here i'll get her i'll get her out in the falcon i have two picks the folks
[01:49:50.860 --> 01:49:55.740]   who created opera have created a new browser this is not from opera as you know opera was sold
[01:49:55.740 --> 01:50:06.380]   called the valdy an opera uh uh like browser for for prose um it's intriguing it's in beta
[01:50:06.940 --> 01:50:12.620]   uh and gosh knows we really don't need we've got safari and chrome and firefox and spartan now too
[01:50:12.620 --> 01:50:18.940]   is is uh michael's spartan going to be on on the mac and dutch no but i but i mean in general it's
[01:50:18.940 --> 01:50:22.940]   interesting we're getting browser engines again it was a dirt the browser engines for a long time
[01:50:22.940 --> 01:50:28.540]   yeah so uh that might be worth looking at vivaldi.com and there's a new podcast app
[01:50:28.540 --> 01:50:33.740]   called signal that i think is interesting again another category that's probably overrepresented
[01:50:34.940 --> 01:50:39.900]   overcast marco arman's podcast app is kind of the perfect podcast app but this one's kind of
[01:50:39.900 --> 01:50:45.820]   interesting some interesting features that i i i think might be useful for instance uh you can
[01:50:45.820 --> 01:50:54.300]   as you're listening to a show put in a take action cue uh an in-show action item that will say hey
[01:50:54.300 --> 01:51:00.060]   that's this was good it's more than a bookmark i wish it i frankly wish it had more of art well
[01:51:00.060 --> 01:51:06.300]   and has a pretty good list of our shows once you've got your shows uh in here uh it makes it very
[01:51:06.300 --> 01:51:11.900]   easy to listen to them you just press the play button and it will uh kind of play the next thing
[01:51:11.900 --> 01:51:18.140]   you've got there uh it has social media integration i like that so you can post your favorite podcasts
[01:51:18.140 --> 01:51:23.260]   excuse me and uh there's a marketplace makes it easy to find them this is it's an iphone app so
[01:51:23.260 --> 01:51:29.980]   i'm showing you for for purposes of big screenage on the ipad but it's kind of nice just came
[01:51:29.980 --> 01:51:36.060]   out it's called signal and has some uh has some nice features worth worth looking at it's free
