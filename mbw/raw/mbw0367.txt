[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Maybe not a lot of surprises, but there are at least two things that we didn't expect
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   that may be very significant for the Apple ecosystem.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   I'll tell you what, stay tuned and find out.

[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly to show the covers of Mac news and there's...
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   ...IOS News today, big iOS news.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   And so we brought in the big guns.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Of course, Renee Ritchie is here from iMoor.com.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   He was covering the iPhone 5 event from his lair in Montreal.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Absolutely. I had my face and my hands plastered up against the glass looking in his brain.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   No stream unless you were in Berlin or China.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   But hey, what can you do, right?
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Also, Chris Breen is here.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Thank you. The MacDaddy from MacWorld.com.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   I guess Jason was there, right?
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Jason Snow?
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Jason and Dan Morin and Lex Friedman were there.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   The three people in the room?
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Greedy.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Well, they didn't have four, so they're here.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   I guess it is Mac World Magazine. That's pretty important.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   But Andy Inako also in the room and he will be joining us a little later on via phone.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   He's down there in Cupertino still at the demo room.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   So let's recap.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   There really weren't many surprises.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   A new iPhone or two is here.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Renee Ritchie, you of course, the keeper of the rumor mill.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Anything that was not in the rumors?
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   It's hard.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   If you read the book and then go see the movie, did you spoil the movie for yourself?
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   You put all this information online.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   People don't have to read it, but I think it's almost like a compulsion.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   And there were minor details, especially software things,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   exactly what they were going to do with the camera app or the pricing for the iPhone 5C.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   I thought was one of the most interesting things.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   But all the major stuff leaks out of the supply chain.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   So there's references in the beta software that people find.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   And it's really hard to keep a secret now if you go on the internet.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Take some of the fun out of these events.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Take some of the ooh and ah.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   There's no one more thing really.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Well, and I think when Tim came on, they kind of abandoned the one more thing.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   That was really Steve's trademark.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   And I feel like they didn't want to continue with that.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   And say, no, that's a bygone era.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Let's just announce what we have to announce and call a special event when there's that one new thing.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   So you can go to the Apple store now, but you can't order.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   We'll just run down real quickly with the announcements.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   We're two new iPhones and iPhone 5C, which is as predicted, a plastic backed,
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   essentially iPhone 5, unchanged iPhone 5.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   That you can pre-order September 13th in the US, Canada, China, interestingly.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Germany, England, you know, the usual suspects.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   They'll have it in 100 countries by the end of the year.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   But as you say, the price a little bit disappointing if you were looking for a much less expensive iPhone.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   In fact, I thought, and I think Renee, you postulated this as well, that the 5C would mean that Apple could eliminate the 4S from their product line
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   and move everybody to the 5 platform for iOS 7.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Not the case.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   They are still offering an iPhone 4S.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   That'll be the free phone.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   $99 subsidized for the 5C, $199 subsidized for the 5S.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   The unsubsidized price of the 5C, the so-called inexpensive iPhone, is only $100 less than the 5S.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Yeah, that's $5.49.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   I think that's a surprise because, you know, I thought this event, the play would be that this is really about Apple expanding their market for a couple of reasons.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   One, the less expensive iPhone, the security because they wanted to get into the military and other markets like that.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   If the unsubsidized phone is really up to $550, I think it makes it still a tough sell in China, in Europe, where people are not accustomed to having contract phones, but instead they do buy their phones and subsidize.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   And they're clearly other manufacturers that are coming way under that price.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Anocha, for one.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Yeah, this is, well, nobody thought that Apple would make a really cheap phone.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   In fact, there was a pretty good argument that they shouldn't, that that's not how Apple does things.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   But it did, you know, a number of analysts said, if you can get it down to $350 as an unsubsidized or prepaid phone, that you will have a huge market for it.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   They didn't.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Is that a surprise, Renee?
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   It's not a surprise.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   I mean, if you followed Apple for any length of time, you know, that they really don't care to have every customer.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   They know exactly which customers they want, and they're customers that are willing to spend a certain amount of money on a product.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   If you looked at the iPod mini, the Mac mini, the iPad mini, most recently, their pattern is to take a little bit of money off the price.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   You know, they have a certain share of the market and they know that by reducing it $100 or $200, they can increase that addressable market a little bit.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   There was one spec bump that surprised me.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   The FaceTime camera now gets a backlit, illuminated sensor, and I think it's a little bit better on the micron scale.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   But it's essentially an iPhone 5 that does, that has a plastic back, which means it's easier to manufacture because they had a lot of problems with the anodization on the 5.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   So it depends what problem you think Apple was trying to solve, and that problem was never going to be offered a $200 or $300 iPhone.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   5 colors, white, red, yellow, blue, and green, and then Apple, seeing, I think a lot of money slipped by them and the risk accessory market has decided to offer complimentary colorful cases with holes in them so that you can mix and match the colors and have the holes shine through with another color.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   It is an A6 chip, 8 megapixel eyesight camera, that's the new camera in the front, 4-inch retina display, LTE, you know, it's basically an iPhone 5 with the exception of that eyesight camera, the old chip, no fingerprint reader.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   The price is the thing that does a little bit surprise me, unsubsidized, SIM-free, 16 gigabytes, $549, 32 gigabytes, $649.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   I don't think we know what it's going to be in China yet, I mean that's a big question because if China Mobile goes through, we don't know what the subsidy deal or the contract between them would be.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   And you know, it's hard to imagine this will be a $550 phone on China Mobile.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   A little bit of a surprise, we thought maybe they would mention China Mobile, this has been the other shoot-a-drop in China, that's the biggest carrier in China and they have not been on China Mobile because of their restrictive demands of Apple Apple wasn't willing to see them and I don't know if they've made that deal or not.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Well I was wondering if in the stream to China there was just a little footnote there saying, "By the way, don't tell other people but this is where the charge is for it."
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   Because obviously they want that market.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Right.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   This price point, I don't know.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   They did make a big deal about it being the most widespread LTE, like the most compatible LTE device, sorry, phone ever and they did announce NTT.como in Japan, which previously not carried the iPhone.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   So they are at least pushing those international boundaries still.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Some of that's because of the technology catching up.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   All the phones now are having are able to, and I know you talked to Sasha Segan of this about this on PC Magazine on your iMore podcast, all of the phones now.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Thanks to Qualcomm and other chip manufacturers are able to support far more LTE bands.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   And that's very important. You don't want to make multiple phone models.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Currently Samsung does. They have a Qualcomm chip in the US models and an Exynos Samsung chip in the international models.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   And that's because of the different radio bands.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   And the certification processes are really onerous in some jurisdictions as well.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   But there's 40 discrete segments to be supported in LTE and that's hard to get on one chip.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   And because everyone uses a, like there's not that many bands, but everyone uses a slightly different part of that band because there's a range there.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   And then some people have wide supports and people have narrow support. It's much trickier.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   It's like, it really is a black science to get it done.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   So it says pre-order September 13th on the five C chat.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   We have Mr. Naco on the line.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Hey, good news.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   Andy Enoco, who's that one infinite loop? He's at the town hall where he's.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   Have you been up to the demo room, Andy?
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   I'm in the demo room right now. As a matter of fact.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   Tell us what you see.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   Ah, big crap.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   The people.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   I think that this is going to be like site zero forever. Next pandemic disease comes in because everybody's putting their fingers on this exact same like one square centimeter area of five different sample life on five.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   So that's a great thing.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   When you set up a, when you train it for your fingerprint, there is like a grayed out like fingerprint on the screen.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   And what you're asked you to do is keep tapping and holding, tapping and holding, tapping and holding that button with the same finger.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   And the more it learns, the more of those gray like loops and whirls in that big fingerprint gets filled in with red.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   So you know that, okay, I don't have to do this for 10 hours.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   It's getting more and more red.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   I'm closer and closer to success.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   And once you're done, then it asks you to now please try holding this with like other edges of that same finger.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   So I know what the side of your thumb looks like with a tip your thumb feels like.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   There is once you've got it registered in, there is a brand new sort of semi gesture to learn that I screwed up when I first tried it.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   You put the home button as usual to wake it up, but then you lightly rest your finger on the home button without depressing it in order to get the authentication.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   So if you, when I was doing this, I was pressing and holding and activating voice command time and time again.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   But once you got it headed to your head, click one, wake up the phone, resting it, and authenticate you.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Now you're in.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   And it only takes like a half a second for you to go in.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   You don't suppose you have to tap and wait.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   So it works really good.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   You can authenticate as many as five fingers.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   And I tried doing it with like not the hand that I'd authenticated with.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   It wouldn't let me in.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   It seems to work really sweet.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   Apple says they're going to use this.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   We'll talk more about the five S in a little bit.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   This is a five S only feature, but Apple says they're going to use this not only for unlocking the phone, but also for authentication on the Apple store, the app store, the iTunes store.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   That means they trust it enough to say, yeah, this is as good as a password.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   Yeah, that really surprised me.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   I was pretty sure it was going to be using for unlocking.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   I kind of thought that not that they wouldn't trust it for e-commerce, but I thought that at least you want to see, well, let's get 5 million people using this first just to satisfy ourselves that this is it's okay to unleash the hounds.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   But yeah, they're confident enough about it to make this a day one feature that's really impressive about how much they feel about it.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   And also, I think it really does speak to how much CPU power is in the new A7 processor.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   I mean, every single thing they put into that, that presentation today was fueled by the fact that they've got an amazing horsepower CPU inside that phone.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   Yeah, they will tell and we'll talk more about that in a little bit.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Let me get just while you're there in the demo room, any other impressions, did you get to play with the camera?
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   Not yet, because there's still a big crowd and it's hard to see how the whole of the camera works.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   I did check out the flash. The flash certainly looked like an immediate improvement over what I usually expect from an iPhone.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   Instead of that weird greenish, blueish color, it seems nicely balanced.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   It's still not, it's still the same problem where it's an LED, so it's not quite so powerful, but you're already immediately getting really nice natural color.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   As far as the other things that the camera promises to do, I'm just not in a position to really check that out.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   Yes, I don't want to say.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   The demo photos, they look very good.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   Apple's saying they have dual LEDs, one on the blue end of the spectrum of the color spectrum, and one in the warmer yellow end of the spectrum,
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   and that they can mix the two to give you a flash that matches the ambient light of the room up to a thousand different settings.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   That's what they said. So very variable power, breech one, so a variable color, really cool stuff.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   That's a great idea, and I don't think anybody's doing anything anywhere near like that.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   So, what are your impressions of the presentation itself?
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   Again, typical application presentation, really tight, really focused.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   They know they have our attention for the first 15 minutes, no matter what they said.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   So that's a good opportunity to talk about how happy they are to be in so many international markets.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   They showed up, the revamped Stanford store.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   I think that we're going to be not too long before we see them be proud about the revamped San Francisco store.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   But really it was two or three very, very concise messages that were repeated over and over again through implementation in different ways,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   meaning that we have this hot, hot, hot new processor that lets us do a million things better.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   Like again, you could spend so much time just talking about the camera where it's doing things like, well, we're going to sort of pre-take every version of this photo when you click the shutter,
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   and then we're going to combine the best parts of every single iteration of that photo to give you the best possible picture.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   So, although they're not doing something as cool as Noki is doing with that immense like 10, 20,000,000 sensor,
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   they're saying, well, we're going to make a marginal improvement to the hardware,
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   but we're going to open up the potential of this really cool CPU to build a synthetic image that's better than anything we could do for real.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   And the other secret message was international, international, international.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   One thing was we all know that they're talking about the 5C being, here's our inexpensive phone for international markets.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   But the other thing is that they also made sure that everybody knew that this has more radios than any other iPhone we've made,
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   and that's the 5C.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   And that's their way of saying that this is a truly international phone. And just to make sure that I get this into,
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   I did spend some time at the 5C. It definitely underscores the point that plastic cases are not the problem, badly designed plastic phones are the problem.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   It doesn't feel like a plastic case. Because of that steel frame, my fingertips are sort of telling me that, no, this isn't plastic.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   This is an animal metal that instead of plastic, it really feels like a solid, well-made item.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   Does it feel like the plastic on the Nokia phones, you know, that kind of soft touch polycarbonate or something else?
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   No, again, it feels a bit, to me, it feels more like an animal. I wouldn't call it slippery, but it has a sort of, it's hard to articulate,
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   but like, that sort of like dense feel to it. It doesn't have like a pebble surface to it.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   It doesn't have a rubbery texture to it. Like I said, an animal is as close as I can get to it's playing the feel of it.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   It doesn't feel like a $99 phone either.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   It is kind of in effect a coating around on a metal frame.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   Yes.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   Anything else, Andy, before we let you go, because I'm sure you want to get back over there and play with those phones tomorrow.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   Not much. Again, I got the shake almost Costello's hand. That was pretty cool.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   I got the shake Tim Cooks hand, which I've never actually met him before. So now I've met Tim Cook.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   I met the nice president. So this has been a very good day for me somehow coming up with the right thing to say that didn't make me sound like an app to somebody that I really, really respect.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   You shook Al Gore's hand, Tim Cooks hand and Elvis Costello's hand in one half hour period. That's pretty darn impressive.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   That was, well, again, I was about to say and not embarrass myself, but you know what, Leo, the day is still young.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   I'm sure.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   All right. Hey, thank you so much. Andy Enoco. He's there at the town hall in Cupertino, California, where Apple has just announced two new phones.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   We'll let you go, Andy. Go play with, you get your choice. Go play with Elvis, Al, Tim, or the phone, your choice.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   My new close personal.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   Thank you, Andy Enoco. Great to have you here on the West Coast.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   We'll have more in just a little bit. We'll talk more about the two new phones. Our hosts are panelists.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   Renee Richie from iMore.com, who's, of course, watching this with a great interest as well.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   Well, we all are. Chris Breen from Macworld.com.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   Our show today brought to you by our friends at Shutterstock.com.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   Now, 28 million. I love one of the things I love to do is go to the Shutterstock site and look at the count.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   Now, they say at the top over 28 million stock photos, illustrations, vectors, and videos.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   But if you scroll down a little bit, you can see the actual number as it increases.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   Currently, 29 million. 141,181 royalty-free images.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   159,000 images added this week. That's one of the things that's great about Shutterstock.com.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   That and the amazing search tool. Please, create a free account.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   You don't need to give them a credit card number. Just create an account so you can start playing with the search engine,
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   so you can search for iPhones, of course. But then you can narrow it down, if you like,
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   using the Spectrum tool, which lets you select different colors from a color wheel.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   You can save images that you like to your light box.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   It's a great way to save images you might use later to save them for inspiration, but also to share them with colleagues.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   And you can do all that for free without even paying a dime.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   Now, if you'd like to download images, they have individual image packs or a monthly subscription.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   That's what we use. If you're a publication or you use a lot of stock photos,
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   that's a great deal. 25 images a day with a standard subscription.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   And I'm going to tell you how you can save quite a bit in just a moment.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   Try their beautiful iPad app. Or iPhone. It's just gorgeous.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   It really looks more like just a gallery of wonderful images.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   And don't forget, it's not just photos. If you click the tab at the top of the Shutterstock page,
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   you can look at video footage as well. Very high quality. 1.2 million high quality royalty free stock videos.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   What does royalty free mean? It means you pay for it once and you can use it in your PowerPoint presentations,
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   on your blog, whatever your creations are. These are great. Look at that. That makes me want a mojito.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   Or a barbecue. Mmm. Shutterstock.com.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   Now, if you decide you don't need to have a credit card to get up at an account, so do that.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   But if you decide to buy, please, I invite you to use Macbreak and the number 9 as the offer code.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   Macbreak 9, one word 9 for the month of September.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   And we will take 30% off that first purchase, so that makes a subscription really good.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   Shutterstock is truly international. They're in more than a dozen countries.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   Full-time multilingual customer support throughout the week.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   You're never going to need it though. You're just going to start browsing and have fun.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   Get those images. Shutterstock.com. Please use our offer code Macbreak 9.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   Leo support Renee Richie, Chris Breen, talking about the new iPhones.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   So the 5C is, you know, I mean, there you go. It's not exactly cheap, but a lower cost, more affordable phone.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   You said it would be good for the kids, Chris.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   Yeah, I think the colorful casing is going to be attractive to parents.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   And parents, one, if they can get the lowest model, which is 99 bucks, they're not...
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   That's the subsidized price. Yeah, subsidized. But if they're already with AT&T or Verizon on a family plan,
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   sure, $99 at a pay for that phone. My daughter's going to get one. I hope she's not listening, but she's going to get one.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   Good. And I'm not sure what color you had. I guess I'll have to consult with her about this.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   But, you know, I think for a lot of parents, and well, I recall, not... It was many years ago that I walked into tech TV,
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   call for help, and it was just after the iPod mini announcement, and you said, "What happened?"
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   I said, "New iPod mini, talked about the price." I think it was $249, and we both said, "Too expensive."
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   Not going to buy that for the kids. Not going to buy that for the kids. Not going to do well, and it turned out to be the best I could have ever made.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   So that shows you what we know. And in fact, I did buy one for Abby.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   Yeah. Right. So I'm a kind of a pushover when it comes to that.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   The kids really do want the iPhones. And I mean, I offer my kids Android devices all the time.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   Windows phone devices, Blackberries, even though they want the iPhones.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   Yeah. And I think particularly with the colorful cases, that's the one they're going to want.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   They don't care about a gold iPhone.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   Well, that's the next thing. I mean, everyone talks now about the next million users, all us Geeks, all us early adopters.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   We've gotten our smartphones. We've upgraded many times. We're maxing out the market.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   And the next billion customers are going to be people upgrading from feature phones, or getting their first smartphone.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   And what's important to them is usually very different than what's important to us.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   And they're more price sensitive than we are, but they also want fun features and they want more durable devices.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   And this looks exactly where Apple's aiming the iPhone 5C.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   Now, for mom and dad, let's take a look at the 5S.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   Yeah. No surprises here. They're not calling it black anymore, though.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   There's gold. They didn't call it Champagne. There's white, I guess.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   It's not white. It's got a silver.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   Silver. Yeah. Yeah. And there's space gray.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   Yes. What a name.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   This will be available September 20th. What I'm not clear about is that mean you could pre-order a week earlier, pre-order a 5C and get it September 20th?
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   Yes.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   And you'll be able to get the 5S day of.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   Why no pre-orders for the 5S?
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   You know, those lines around the Apple Store look really good in the paper.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   Oh, there might be. We'll have to wait until all the information is up.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   But it's right after the event and maybe not all the eyes and teas have been dotted and crossed.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   It's odd that they would not give you a chance to pre-order it as a week ahead.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   Easier for everybody. I mean, we heard about the slate one a couple of weeks ago.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   And one of my writers, Ali Kazmuha, she works in the Annotization business and she kept saying black is so hard to anodize.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   Gold is the easiest color. You just put some iron oxide in and it goes gold.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   But black is really hard and Apple had a lot of chipping and scratching problems.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   And if you're going to change a color, especially a really popular color, light black, this is probably the best color plus resiliency combination they could come up with.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   Unlocked price on 16 gigabytes, 650 for 32 gigabytes, 850 for 64 gigabytes.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   There is no 128 gigabyte phone. A little disappointing, I think to some.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   But frankly, the trend is that way. I mean, people are streaming stuff. You got match. There's no reason to load everything up on the phone.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   Of course, it's the same frame. Although, I have to say, in the gold, it looks different. It looks like a new phone, doesn't it?
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   Yeah, it does. I'm still curious about the earbuds, whether they're...
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   Are they gold? Are they gold? I mean, you know...
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   No, Apple's never made anything but white.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   True. Only the Johnny I've auction versions are gold.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   Apple invented white earbuds. And really, that was a trademark for a long time.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   I'm getting gold, Leo. Oh, can I get the gold? Look at that. It just looks like the phone of the rich and famous. It looks gorgeous.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   Price is the same as always, subsidized at $200, $300, $400.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   I have to say, though, in this day and age, charging $100 to double the flash ram seems a little bit pricey. They could have done that for less.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   But they're Apple. They can get away with it.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   The big differences on this phone, of course. And I do love that metal around the fingerprint reader in the home button, just as predicted.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   And a much improved camera. And of course, we're going to get to iOS 7 in a bit, because that's going to be a new feature, not only for the new iPhones, but for the new iPhone.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   But also for anybody with an iPhone 4 or up, an iPad 2 or up, and an iPad Mini.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   So iOS 7 we'll talk about in just a little bit. But let's talk a little bit about the 5S.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   Internals, maybe there was a revelation there. It's a system on a chip. It will be the A7.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   Apple's saying the first smartphone with 64 gigabit, I'm sorry, not gigabit, regular bit.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   Monobit, 64-bit architecture.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   What is that important? What does that mean?
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   On mobile? I mean, the interesting thing is they say 64-bit desktop class architecture.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   Apple managed the 32-bit to 64-bit transition on the Mac really well. It was almost transparent to users.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   And it looks like they're doing the same thing with iOS. But on the desktop, it was all about giant, you know, you can address huge amounts of RAM, giant Photoshop files.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   Huge Final Cut Pro videos. And it's not clear yet, or at least they haven't shown yet what they're going to be doing on mobile, or what they're going to allow developers to do on mobile that will take advantage of 64-bits.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   You know, a kudos to Mark Gurman for nailing that and the Clayton Morris for nailing the VM7 chip.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   What Clayton got wrong was the speed bump. He was saying Benchmark showed a mere one-third faster.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   Apple's saying as much as twice as fast.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   Yeah, and the graphics and CPU speed. I mean, maybe Clayton heard that the 33 and thought it was percent and not X, because some of the stats they showed are really impressive.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   I do have to point out, and this is the problem when you talk bits. Twice the bits doesn't mean twice as fast, by any means. In fact, it can mean slower.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   Yeah, and also you have to look at how they ran their benchmarks. Of course, they're going to run them in such a way that their hardware is shown off in its best possible light.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   Right. So we'll see. I mean, it's the same thing with batteries when they run through the battery statistics and say, "Yeah, you get X number of hours here, there, and everywhere else."
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   But people who have iPhones understand that sometimes you can drain a battery in a matter of hours, depending on what you're doing.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   That's a very good point. And, you know, if you talk to someone like Brian Klug from Anantec or Sasha Segan from PCMag,
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   the test bear out that Apple gives you real world usage numbers. Most manufacturers will say, "24 hours of battery life and include 8 hours of you sleeping in that test," which is not really straightforward for a user.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   But the big thing here, which was in a previous iPhone, is the standby time, 250 hours, which shows probably some of the low power optimization done in the A7 chip.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   Yeah, we're going to talk about the M7, which is a very important part of it. But I want to stick with the A7 a little bit here.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   And particularly with 64 bits, I think 64 bits is playing a numbers game. I don't see any benefit on a phone to 64 bits. I truly don't.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   You have larger registers, but most of the time you don't want to use those large registers.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   You don't, you know, the biggest difference is more addressable RAM. They don't say how much RAM's in here, but there's no way that it's as much as 4GB, which is the limit of the 32-bit processor.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   So I'm not convinced 64-bit is significant. Yes, it's using the new ARM V8, apparently.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   It's bragging rights. It's bragging rights, right? Or am I wrong on that?
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   I mean, it depends if you have a 400 PPI screen. Is that really advantageous to a human being or is it bragging rights that you got?
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   That's true. 1080p, you do a 3-inch display.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   That's right. Yeah. A billion transistors, which is kind of a nice number.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   It's a sexy 102 millimeter, a square millimeter die size.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   I think, you know, they're getting more performance out of this thing.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   We have to remember that these are ARM-based designs that Apple fabs to make their own processor.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   We don't know. Do we know what the GPU is in here? Renee, do we?
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   We don't. The suspicion was that it would be the new PowerVR Rogue chip, which is a really impressive chip.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   And the one thing to keep in mind is Apple used to introduce the A series and the new iPads when they were in the spring.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   But now they introduce them in the iPhones, but this means that the iPhone 5, the iPad 5, and the iPad Mini 2 will probably be getting this chip.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   And we start to look at Apple's gaming ambitions. When you start putting this chip throughout their iOS device lines, it becomes, you know, maybe a 64-bit makes no sense on a phone, but maybe in an iPad, the kind of software they want to make will make a lot more sense.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   So maybe we're going to see a 4GB or higher iPad.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   If not now, maybe when their set top box plans become clear, but it looks like they're future-proofing quite a bit here.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   Because one thing people hate is they get like the iPhone 4 gets iOS 7, but not the 3GS, and people complain that Apple doesn't future-proof their devices enough.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   And they start to put 64-bit in. Maybe that's a sign of where they're going in a couple of years.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   So, and they're apples, by the way, claiming up to 2X GPU as well as up to 2X CPU.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   They dragged out Infinity Blade, which just cracked me up because, of course, they announced Infinity Blade Dungeons at an iPad event more than a year ago, a game which never was released.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   This time they're saying it's going to come out on the 20th, the same day that the phone comes out.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   Yeah, I think that was the silent apology.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   Now, really, this time we're going to do it. And, no, day and date, it's going to be there for you.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   I like Peter Cohen says, it's a tech demo. I mean, Infinity Blade's never been the best playing game, but boy is it the game you want to show it, but yeah, to justify the money you spent on that hardware.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   It's pretty.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   The big thing, and I don't, so you said Clayton got this, is the M7, this secondary chip.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   This is, for reminds me a lot of what Motorola has done with the X, their X processor, or what are the X8, or what they call it, or X7, I can't remember.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   But the idea is this was a D, in the Motorola case, it was dual DSPs that were low power so that the phone could kind of be alert even without powering up.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   That's kind of how Apple's going to use the M7, but instead of using it to listen, it's going to use it to watch your movements, to watch the gyroscope and the accelerometer and the other sensors.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   This is for health purposes, for, yes, monitoring movement.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   I would have kind of liked them to do Siri, like Google now with, you know, onboard parsings. You don't have to wait for the network.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   But then it had been awesome. Hello Siri, so you could wake it up. And I, it's just a little, I mean, this is great.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   Nike Plus is going to be there. It kind of, it's a harbinger of I watch's future maybe, but to me, getting better Siri would have been more important than getting all the, the pedometer functionality in this version.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   Seems that they could use this to do that to listen for, okay Siri.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   And, oh my, just woke up my phone.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   Well, I think as Renee says, a lot of this is forward looking and I think that M7 chip is as well.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   So, I mean, as we were talking earlier, some kind of watch strategy.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   It really is a harbinger. Yeah. It really is saying, yeah, we're going to be doing this right now with Nike.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   Maybe not next time.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   Yeah.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   Or maybe next time. As we pointed out many times Tim Cook is on the board at Nike.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   And feel sick talk next year is a talk.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   Ah, yeah. That's another thing to point out. This is, this is not the big year of big changes to the iPhone.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   This is the small changes.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   No, it's the S model.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   And so, yeah, faster.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   Did they say it was thinner? Probably not.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   It's not thinner. It's the same exact chassis, right?
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   So, they, but they haven't put in this fingerprint reader.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   Sapphire coding to make it more durable.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   I love the metal ring. Apparently that senses your finger moving into position.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   And as Andy pointed out, you don't press.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   You just hold it there lightly.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   You press to unlock, you press to open the, to activate the home screen like you would normally, and then you hold it there for a second to authenticate.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   Uh-huh.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   It looks like it works pretty well. I like the, I mean, it's important that they do offer a password back door.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   So, if you can't get it to work or your thumbs are broken or something, you can always enter the password.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   Well, also, if you're in a really cold climate, you don't want to pull that phone out and take your gloves off.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   That's right.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   You do this, so you leave that there.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   So, that's your winter option.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   Well, it is capacitive. I mean, it looks interesting. The Sapphire is there to stop it from scratching.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   You have the metal ring to detect that there's a finger there to power up the authentication chip.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   And then you, you depress it to activate the home screen and then the fingerprint reader.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   So, they've kind of thought out the process really well.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   And it seems to indicate that you have to be alive at least to do it, which is kind of nice from a security perspective.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   I wonder how they test that.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   They use Play-Doh finger.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   Sausages. They use those sausages from Korea that they use for capacitive screen.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   I do think it's significant, I guess I said this to Andy, but I do think it's significant that they are trusting it enough to use it for the Apple Store, the iTunes Store.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   They're putting their money literally where their thumb is, where your thumb is.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   And that's a big deal because that means they want eventually, I think, to make this be a payments authentication system.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   Oh, yeah. Well, I think we've talked long and hard about this, where Apple really wants to be in the business of using these devices as a credit card.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   And eventually taking a cut of any transaction that you make, and this is one avenue to doing that.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   I also think this would be great, and I don't know if there probably isn't an API.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   We'll have to look at the dev center.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   But it'd be great if you could have this also authenticate for things like PGP and encryption and things like that.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   Yeah. Even just to open apps.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   If you have photographs or you have text messages, you don't want people to see.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   Do we know if there's an API? Have you looked at that?
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   They didn't announce anything and they did announce other APIs. So usually they, Apple's fairly serious about supporting their APIs.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   So, I mean, I'm pretty sure they want to test it themselves on hundreds of millions of people before they give it to developers to play around with.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   That makes sense. That makes sense. Are you disappointed? There's no NFC. Is this replace NFC?
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   The thing with NFC, Leo, that I never understand is that people talk about NFC, but Apple doesn't care about chip sets that they can invent features for.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   They care about feature sets that they have chips to support. And there's so much functionality that NFC is just a chip.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   Depends what you do with it. Depends what features you offer. Apple's going to be doing a lot of really interesting things with Bluetooth, low energy and Wi-Fi direct.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   When people say they want NFC, Apple's doing it just not with an NFC chip.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   So does the end user really care what the name of the chip inside the package is? Probably not as much.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   Yeah. I just feel like NFC is gaining momentum now and other platforms. And in fact, it's in everybody else's phone now.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   Apple's the last holdout.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   But it's kind of the Apple way to do things their way. You look at something like iCloud where there were existing structures for doing that kind of cloud sharing.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   And Apple's, "No, no, no. We're not going to do any of that. We're going to invent our own."
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   Because they believe firmly in their technology. And I guess they've got the plan ahead on the whiteboard saying, "Yeah, no, this is what we're going to do."
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   And when you look ahead, I mean, they have Passbook, but it doesn't tie into any of this yet. But Passbook Kit is an abstraction that you could put a lot of stuff behind.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   So maybe with an iPhone 6, it suddenly gets NFC for chip-based transaction. Passbook Kit gets NFC recognition and the authentication.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   The touch ID gets put all of that at once. Apple's usually really slow to roll out new radios. But when they do an implementation, it's usually a very feature-focused implementation.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   So I can just see this as sort of getting all their pins in the right place on the board before they move.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   Apple's iOS Dev Center just tweeted that the gold master has been released of iOS 7. If you're a developer, you can download it now along with an updated Xcode.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   They've got a C11A465. So I think that makes sense because they're about to release it on the 20th.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   Once they've announced this, the GM would come out. Developers can sign off on their stuff, make sure it works.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   And when the new device comes out, hopefully it all works right.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   They said that we will be able to download iOS 7 on all ever devices that are iOS 7 compatible on the 18th to two days before the iPhone comes out.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:23.500]   Which is normal, typical pattern. And does that mean iPad 2? iPad 2 end up, including the mini-
[00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:27.000]   I've had it's results. Yes. I saw the same respect.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   Because there was speculation about that whether they were going to release that on the slide. It said it would work.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   But what Renee, you're saying it doesn't work well? No, I saw mixed reports. Some people were reporting.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   Some people who were in the room were saying that it was going to be for the iPhone first and then the iPad version come out at the iPad event.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   And some people said it's all coming out and I haven't gotten a clear answer.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   You know what they weren't clear? That's right. They weren't clear in the presentation.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   Right. Because through the grapevine, you hear from people using the developer edition for the iPad.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   And they say it's way behind in terms of stability.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   Well, the beta was released weeks later. Yeah. As well. Yeah.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   All right. And the same thing with the iWork apps. I mean, they showed off and that's a whole other conversation.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   But Apple probably doesn't have the engineering resources to get all those iWork apps updated with a new look and feel for launch because they're so busy working on the iPhone version.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   Well, let's finish up on hardware and then we will take a break and we'll talk about iOS 7. We'll talk about iWork.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   New camera in the 5S, F2.2, which is very fast, 1.6 microns. They didn't say how many megapixels?
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   It's the same. It's the same. It's an 8 megapixel camera.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   Thank goodness. I mean, the megapixel thing, they increase the size of the microns, which is inverse to the megapixels.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   If you go up in megapixels, usually you chop the sensor up, make it much smaller.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   And that's that famous Steve Jobs iPhone 4 event. It's all about the photons. It's the photons Leo.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   Right. And this sucks in more photons. Somebody in the chatroom, my artist is saying that the gold master does include an iPad iOS 7, by the way.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   We'll see if we can confirm that. So, same megapixels, but it's bigger microns, which is good for low light.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   The dual color LED flashes. I think that's interesting. I don't think anybody else is doing that.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   F2.2. F2.2. It's 5 elements.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   Apple, once again, putting a lot of emphasis on the camera and the quality of the camera.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   Even their ads, right? Say the cameras, you know, number one camera.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   Well, thank goodness they're doing it for the flash too, because that's always been the vulnerability of that camera.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   You shoot at night with the flash and it's just terrible.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   You should mention that Apple stock down 2%, almost 3%, down $12, but that's always what happens.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   Yeah. You buy on the rumor you sell on the news and this is the news.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   The other interesting thing, Andy, whenever he's here, points out the image signal processor on the iPhone 5 is amazing.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   It does fantastic white balancing, fantastic exposure, and they're making that better with the A7 as well.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   It doesn't have optical image stabilization, like the HTC One or the Nokia Lumia range,
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   which does really good low light, not so good motion photography, but they're going to do auto image stabilization.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   So, they're doing a lot of what other people do in the glass, in the software, and we'll have to see how it turns out.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   But it just shows how important the chipset is and why Apple wanted to control the entire design of that processor.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   Yeah. And I think they're right not to increase the megapixels, they're right to focus on back-end software.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   That's where all the action is going to be. There's no doubt about it.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   So, a 15% larger sensor.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   Oh, I forgot to mention 10 frames per second burst mode and 120 frames per second slow motion video.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   That's 4x, I think.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   It's a 120p, but it's at 720p, a little lower resolution. That makes sense.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   Slowmo's fun. I mean, this is a lot of this is catch-up.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   If you look at the HTC One, it's an F2 camera with even larger micron size, larger pixels.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   They have slowmo, so do the Galaxy line has slowmo burst mode and so forth.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   The ability to look for the best picture and a bunch of pictures, that's all catch-up.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   And I don't mean...
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   It depends how well the implement is.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   The HTC stuff was fantastic, but finding Zoey's was a little counterintuitive in the software.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   So, it depends how well they surface all that for the end user.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   And that's absolutely true. And this is where Apple will shine because neither Samsung nor HTC has very easy to use software.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   So, that's where Apple can really shine.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   All right, I think that's all there is to say about the 5S, except the price, which we mentioned,
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   is the same as the old iPhone price, $650, contract-free for 16 gigs, $199 subsidized for 16 gigs.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   And I guess there'll be lines. I bet there'll be lines this year because there's no way else to get a day of, right?
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   Right, you have to be at the store.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   I think, yeah, you have to be at the store, although, for that 5C, I think they're going to chip a lot of those things.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   Do you think that's going to be the big seller of the two?
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   I think it is.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   Yeah, I honestly do, except for those people who really want the gold.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   You know, if you're only one year into a contract on an iPhone 5, maybe this isn't going to be enough that you're going to want to pay that extra
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   hunk of cash in order to get the price.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   Interesting, yeah.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   Did we see if it was 802.11ac? I didn't look on anything.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   It is not.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   It's disappointing.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   AC is available in the Galaxy S4 and the HTC One.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   Newer phones have AC.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   And Apple's new routers.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   And Apple's router.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   That's right.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   Apple's one of the companies that's shipping an AC router.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   I forgot about that.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   In fact, that's what I have at home.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   That's what I've been testing the HTC One and S4 with.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   I don't think that makes much to be honest.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   I don't think that makes much difference.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   Most internet access isn't as fast as that.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   AC is mostly of value in Trun network transfers.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   Right.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   Which is important for the iPhone, just because, I mean, the Dan Flash and the iPhone saturates before USB 3, so there's not even any
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   point in putting USB 3 on.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   It's not PCIe, so we can't get Thunderbolt.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   It'd be nice to have some form of high-speed transit.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   You want to move big movies around.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   Interesting.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   Okay.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   Let's take a break.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   When we come back, let's talk software.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   iOS 7 and I work free.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   Not updated.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   Or maybe updated.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   I don't know.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   It'll look more like iOS 7, I gather.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   The icon has been improved.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   Our show today brought to you by SmileSoft, where those great folks who do PDFs
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   and have a PDF pen 6, the new version of PDF pen is Fab-Boo.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   I've been using it for some time now.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   It adds some nice features, including the ability to export to Microsoft Word.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   If you work in the real world, that's a very handy feature.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   You can sign contracts.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   You know, in the process of buying a house, in real estate, they still fax your contracts to sign in fax back.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   Well, when they fax it to me, I get in my email.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   Sign it with Smile PDF pen pro and I fax it back via email.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   That's the way it ought to be.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   For iPad, for iPhone and for Mac, PDF pen is fabulous.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   Everybody should have this.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   The best way to read and annotate PDFs to add text, images, signatures.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   I have my signature as a stamp in the library and it's a boom sign.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   I do the initials too.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   It's so much easier.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   You can make changes to a PDF fix, typos, resize and delete images, fill out PDF forms.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   You can OCR scan the documents.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   It's all built in and it's just $35.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   You can get it on the App Store if you're on a Macintosh or go to smilesoftware.com/macbreak
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   and download a free trial, which is a great way to do this.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   And of course, you should also have the companion software on your iPad and/or iPhone as well.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   Updated for iOS.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   It's really a fabulous program and we love the folks at Smile Software.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   Go to Smile.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   You can't see my screen chat.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   I don't know if you could see it or not.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   Smilesoftware.com/macbreak and it will say welcome Macbreak fans.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   You can even see the nice David Spark video showing the latest options.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   This is the same company that has text expanded.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   Frankly, if I were you, I'd buy both of them.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   So PDF pen pro is $99.95.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   I got the wrong price.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   That was a text expanded price and you can still download a free trial, but not at smilesoftware.com/macbreak.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   Go there first to let them know that you saw it here, just so that we don't have any confusion.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   Smilesoftware.com/macbreak.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   iOS 7, people are downloading it right now.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   The gold master is out and if somebody is in the chat room and has downloaded it,
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   if you can confirm if the iPad version is in there as well.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   They are.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   Wow, that's very interesting.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   Everything's in there.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   That's good news.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   That means presumably if they've got the bits, they'll be pushing it out at the same time.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   Yeah, iPhones and iPads according to the Verge on September 18th, they must have worked really a lot of overnights in the iPad.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   They worked their apps off.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   Here is a screenshot from Shane EI in our chat room of the download.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   Pre-release version of the iOS 7 GM seed for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   Devices updated to the seed cannot be restored to earlier versions of iOS.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   That's pretty typical.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   You see all of the different versions it will work on, including the mini, which is good news.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   The third generation and the second generation iPads as well as the fourth generation iPad.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   And iPhones going all the way back to the iPhone 4.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   If you have an iPod touch, it's fifth generation only.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   So what is new?
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   We didn't learn anything today about iOS 7.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   It sounded like everything that they'd already talked about at WWDC.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   Yeah, that was just a quick catch up for those people who hadn't been paying attention
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   for the press to say, "Oh, look at these new wonderful things we're going to do."
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   But we saw all this stuff on the WWDC.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   Renee, you've been talking a little bit about the under the hood stuff, the things like the
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   particle physics engine and so forth.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   Does it all now make sense when you look at the A7 processor?
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   Yeah, I mean, again, this is the big play for the future.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   Apple's got this habit of trying to change the paradigm of interface, whether it's command
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   line with the Apple II or GUI with the Lisa and the Mac or multi-touch with the iPhone,
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   and making the entire operating system built on this physics and particle engine,
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   it just makes it more discoverable, more playful, all the things that you need when you want
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   to take one more step towards mainstreaming computer appliances.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   And it makes me really excited because developers who always used to tell you,
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   "I could try and do those mic matters, photo app style animations, but I can do maybe one of them."
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   They can do all of those for free now.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   It's just built in.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   There's SpriteKit, there's UI Dynamics, there's UI Motion.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   They can make all these fantastic, object-oriented interfaces that took a lot,
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   that took a lorem-brickter before to make, and I think we're going to see not just with iOS 7,
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   but the next year of software development when developers get really used to it,
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   I think we're going to see another leap forward in mobile apps, and that's what I'm really excited about.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   And Infinity Blade 3 is not the pinnacle of what's possible.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   That's just OpenGL ES3, which they announced with this too, which was a surprise,
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   because they hadn't announced before what OpenGL engine they were using in iOS 7.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   So this, okay, tell me, help me out here, this is a big deal, ES3.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   Yeah, so I mean, the Mac, Mavericks, they said OpenGL force points something, I forget,
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   but they hadn't said anything about iOS, and the higher the version of OpenGL support,
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   it just makes everything that a game developer wants to do in 3D.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   I mean, SpriteKit is great for 2D, there's no scene kit on iOS like there is on the Mac,
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   so everyone uses an engine, like the Unreal Engine or whatever,
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   but underneath all that is the language, the OpenGL ES language,
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   and that's going to version 3.0, and that should make a whole new generation of 3D games possible.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   What else in iOS 7 is significant?
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   Anything else to mention?
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   All stuff we've seen, I like the new photo gallery.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   You can see those little teeny mini thumbnails and expand them out, so you can see the whole thing.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   The new gestures are nice, if you want to use them, they're much faster.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   They're less discoverable, but if you want to use them to peek backwards or navigate sideways,
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   I mean, that's very useful for power users.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   What are the gestures? Show us.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   You can, so they've shown them off before, so I mean, they're not embargoed,
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   but if you're in mail, you can slide your finger across to go back in the hierarchy to see mailboxes,
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   and then mail accounts. If you're in Safari or Calendar, you can slide between web pages or days.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   It just means you don't have to press a button, go back, press a button, go back.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   You can just very naturally do it.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   One of the things that iOS has always done really well,
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   especially compared to other platforms, is that one-to-one finger mapping.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   It feels like you're moving a piece of paper, and as long as that's almost perfect, it feels like an illusion.
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   You're actually touching something and moving it around with your finger, and this goes to the next level.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   Safari, the bookmarks now are these tabs.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   It looks like a Rolodex, and you can flip through them, you can touch your finger on them,
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   pull them around to different positions, throw them off the screen.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   Multitasking is like that too. It looks like WebOS now, where they come up with little cards,
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   and instead of having to press a delete button, you can just grab the card and throw it off the screen.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   That makes it much easier again, for five-year-olds, 80, 90-year-olds to use computers.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   Okay, that's what we're looking for.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   iWork is now going to be free.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   iWork apps are going to be free, and iPhoto too, free when you buy a new iOS device.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   Much like iLife used to be free. You'll get iMOV, iPhoto, keynote, pages, and numbers already on the phone, I gather.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   Yeah, if you purchase a new device, they're going to be on there, but they don't have a garage band.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   It's a lot.
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   And as a musician, I'm sure you're disappointed.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   Well, I think it's one of the most brilliant apps in there, but I understand that not everybody uses it.
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   Is it five bucks?
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   Yeah, it's five bucks as cheap. It's worth it to anybody who does anything with composing music.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   I've been saying that i think that the new Mac Pro will be bundled with all the Pro apps.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   Do you think this is maybe a little hint that Apple's going to do more bundling?
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   They've done this all along with iLife.
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   I'd sure like to see them do that, because i think there is some...
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   That's a big differentiator for them. And as I think they fall behind a little bit in hardware differentiation,
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   especially on the phones, software differentiation becomes important.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   Yeah, I think with this new Mac Pro, they've narrowed what they're finding the Pro consumer ads.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   I mean, we're really talking about kind of a high-level Pro now, instead of the enthusiastic Pro Sumer.
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   You're talking about for a Mac Pro?
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   For a Mac Pro now, because of the storage issues and the number of devices you have to add to it.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   So yeah, I think in that case, adding all the Pro apps would be pretty sweet.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   I don't know a lot of Pro's that are going to care if logic is on there or not.
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   But having Final Cut Pro and their aperture, particularly if they update the thing,
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   would make... I think it would impress people.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   And that's the other thing. I don't think they've updated any of these new iOS apps,
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   except they look like they're iOS 7, right?
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   I'm looking at the screen shots and they appear to be the same.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   They look like the same.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   No, they look like the same.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   As far as I understand, there's no time.
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   I mean, they're doing everything they can to get iOS 7 out.
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   No time?
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   Benjamin Mayo, as a writer on Twitter, said that GarageBand might be not going free because you have to pay for the loop still,
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   that those are licensed to not own by Apple.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   Ah. That makes sense.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   I like to see musicians get paid, so I'm good with that.
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   I'll buy it again.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   And I guess a loop-free GarageBand wouldn't be that interesting.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   Well, it would require that you actually have some talent in order to use the Pro.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   Yeah, so that eliminates me. I can tell you right now.
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   Let's see. What else? Anything else software-wise?
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   I want to make sure we don't miss anything important.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   There was a lot they didn't show off to FaceTime audio.
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:22.000]   It's an amazing sounding.
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   Is it much better?
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   Yeah, I mean, they didn't show it off too much, but it sounds...
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   When they announced H Wideband Audio with the iPhone 5, it was restricted to only a couple of carriers,
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   so almost nobody could use them.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   I think in Germany. But FaceTime audio sounds absolutely fantastic, and that's something.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   Some people poo-poo it. They say, "Oh, I've already got a phone app."
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   But you already had SMS before iMessage, and this is a way to make person-to-person VoIP calls,
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   and I think that'll be more of a big deal as time goes on.
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   And then they said, but they eluded to, but didn't say exactly what,
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   that Siri was going to have more capability and be a little...
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   I don't know what.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   There was going to be a male voice.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   Well, they have some optional voices that you can download in addition,
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   so they're going to have kind of the standard Siri voices,
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   and then if you want to add the extra content, I believe you'll be able to do it.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   More than just a male in a female.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   You've always had different voices in different languages.
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   You could get a male voice in Great Britain, for instance.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   But in the US versions, you'll have a male voice available now.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   What else is new?
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   So you're looking at the page right now.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   Yeah, you can make restaurant reservations with this thing now.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   That's the open table stuff that Siri used to have, and Apple took out.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   The new stuff is Wikipedia and Bing.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   Oh, yeah, they mentioned Wikipedia and Bing.
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   They didn't mention that.
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   Bing for photos.
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   They left that out.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   Oh, and the Twitter stuff.
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   Right.
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   You said that was what Leo's saying.
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   Lady Gaga was the big Twitter demo.
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   Did they say, "Tell us what Lady Gaga just said?"
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.000]   It was all over the screen.
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   Gaga tweet after Gaga tweet.
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   Oh, Lord.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   I think that's just because that's the only person Tim Cook follows on Twitter.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   Is that right?
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   That's an odd thing, but a little known fact.
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   You're right.
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   Here's her picture.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   She's all over it.
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   They love Gaga.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:14.160]   In fact, I think these Elvis Costello thing, he performed, of course, was just because they
[00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:15.160]   couldn't get Gaga.
[00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:18.000]   She's at the iTunes Festival in Europe.
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   In fact, they showed that at the very beginning they were talking about the iTunes Festival.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   There's some new Siri stuff.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.760]   Siri looks weird on an iPad.
[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:28.600]   She just takes up too much space.
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:30.280]   She just takes over the iPad.
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:33.840]   Will she read you the Wikipedia entry or just pull it up?
[00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:36.280]   They haven't shown her reading anything beyond.
[00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:38.960]   I think she reads a few more things I think than last time.
[00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:40.520]   She or he, depending on your geography.
[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:41.520]   Right.
[00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:43.760]   But they haven't shown a lot more reading, which is unfortunate because...
[00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:47.440]   Siri will always be a woman to me.
[00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:50.480]   The one thing with interfaces is you want consistency, like whether it's gestures or
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:51.480]   natural language.
[00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:54.520]   And if Siri reads one thing but not another, you never really remember what it will or
[00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:55.520]   won't do.
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:57.520]   Sometimes it's something you don't use because you never should.
[00:55:57.520 --> 00:55:58.520]   Right.
[00:55:58.520 --> 00:55:59.520]   I have that problem with Google now.
[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:00.520]   Yeah.
[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:01.520]   But sometimes it'll read it to you.
[00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:02.520]   Sometimes it won't.
[00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:03.520]   Yeah.
[00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:06.800]   It's one of those things where you shout at Siri enough times and she doesn't respond correctly.
[00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:09.240]   And then you just put her aside.
[00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:13.480]   Unfortunately, you got to be careful when you say Google now around my phone because it's
[00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:14.480]   a...
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:15.480]   Oops.
[00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:17.040]   It keeps waking up.
[00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:18.040]   Go.
[00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:19.040]   Shh.
[00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:20.040]   Google later.
[00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:21.040]   Google later.
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:23.160]   Oh, no, it's transcribing.
[00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:27.240]   It's transcribing everything I say right now, which is great.
[00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:29.400]   It's supposed to wait for OK Google now.
[00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:31.480]   Oh, there it goes.
[00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:35.200]   Apparently, all I have to say is Google now.
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:38.680]   This is interesting.
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:43.880]   Apple announces the iPhone 5S, the most forward thinking smartphone in the world according to
[00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:45.440]   the Apple press release.
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:48.000]   What do you think they mean by that?
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.520]   I think it's kind of what we're talking about here.
[00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:55.000]   It's that they've got a lot of stuff that's going to be used in the next year.
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.320]   Some day.
[00:56:57.320 --> 00:56:58.320]   Forward thinking.

[01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:09.960]   new phone but just feels like it also ran.
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:13.680]   It seems to me that the fingerprint reader alone is significant enough.
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:16.320]   Certainly a much better camera is significant enough.
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:18.840]   And the new look is significant enough.
[01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:26.120]   Even gold is enough to probably get Apple through this year.
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:27.400]   They look like they innovated.
[01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:29.720]   They look like they did something new.
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:33.920]   Enough for the people who are investing the Apple ecosystem to say, "Yeah, I'm going
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:34.920]   to get that."
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:36.680]   Yeah, well, I think people continue.
[01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:40.360]   If they start with an iPhone, a new one comes out, they're ready for an upgrade.
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:42.560]   They're going to jump to another iPhone.
[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:46.480]   It's kind of the rare iPhone user that says, "I'm sick of this whole thing.
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:48.120]   I'm going to jump to an Android phone.
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:49.520]   I'm going to jump to a Samsung."
[01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:55.200]   And we've seen from at least Apple's PR is that people tend to jump from an Android
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:05:00.000]   to an iPhone more often than they jump from an iPhone to an Android device.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000]   That's interesting.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000]   I didn't know that really.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:08.080]   It's -- these have just become sort of commodity objects now.
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:12.600]   The hardware advances are not like they were in the first couple of generations where you
[01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:16.680]   got the first iPhone and you said, "Well, clearly this needs a better camera or it needs
[01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:19.600]   a camera or it needs this, that or the other."
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:23.360]   We're now to the point where these things are so sophisticated and full-featured, you
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:27.400]   really have to look at iteration instead of this feature is missing.
[01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:31.960]   So for the fingerprint detector, for example, totally didn't need it.
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:35.840]   This is just something that somebody thought, "Okay, well, this would be a nice extra.
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:38.920]   Maybe it gets us into the government and military markets.
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:39.920]   That makes sense for us."
[01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:44.840]   But it's not something where people said, "Oh, well, this phone is missing this crucial
[01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:45.840]   feature."
[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:46.840]   Nobody's been saying that.
[01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:47.840]   Nobody's missing this.
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:50.400]   But that's a -- what an innovation would be.
[01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:52.040]   That's a quality an innovation would have.
[01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:57.040]   This is something new that nobody -- now, it's almost exactly a year since Apple bought
[01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:01.840]   a Think-A-Thantec, the fingerprint company that presumably is the technology in this.
[01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:11.680]   Can Samsung copy this and have the Galaxy S5 or the Nexus 5 from Google have fingerprint
[01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:15.120]   scanning in it or is this technology that Apple now owns?
[01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:16.800]   I mean, SID, Leo?
[01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:17.800]   Is that what it is?
[01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:21.960]   No, but I don't know because they had S voice after Siri, S wallet after.
[01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:22.960]   Yeah, SID.
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:26.680]   You're -- oh, you're used for Samsung, right?
[01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:33.320]   Can they copy it and can they copy it as well or does Apple own this technology?
[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:36.160]   If they own multi-touch, they had all the -- they had all the touch, the finger.
[01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:40.840]   I forget the name, finger works patents and people went ahead with multi-touch.
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:44.320]   You know, I went to the Samsung event earlier this year and Android Central went to the
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:47.240]   latest one and they were accused of not being innovative either.
[01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:53.200]   They said the Galaxy S4 was more of a Galaxy S3S and Android has internal competition as
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:57.640]   well as external because the Moto X is great competition for the Galaxy S4 as well and
[01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:59.120]   so is the HTC One.
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:05.160]   So they really have a very fast pace of innovation and it looks like Apple is picking very small
[01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:10.520]   battles and picking very small user experiences and tackling those.
[01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:14.440]   So I'm sure a lot of people right now are very interested in fingerprint reading, but
[01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:18.120]   Apple will have the head start and especially the mind share because they're usually pretty
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:21.120]   good at making these Santa Claus commercial features.
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:22.120]   Right.
[01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:24.960]   And I think it's more than a Santa Claus commercial feature.
[01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:27.520]   It would have been if it merely unlocked the phone.
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:28.680]   Then I'd say, yeah, fine.
[01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:31.000]   It's like face recognition on Android.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.600]   It's not something people are going to use.
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:37.640]   The fact that Apple has the confidence in this to use it for commerce tells me that Apple
[01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:42.320]   has much bigger plans for this and I think this could be very big.
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:47.320]   If it really is a reliable authentication method, if it can be used to unlock your PGP key,
[01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:53.720]   if it can be used to authenticate Bitcoin purchases, that kind of thing, there is a
[01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:55.800]   lot of promise in that technology.
[01:07:55.800 --> 01:08:00.960]   And if Apple can own it, and that's where my question comes from, if their patents and
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:06.640]   their acquisition of authentic mean they can own it, that could be very big news for Apple.
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:07.640]   Yeah.
[01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:11.240]   And I think particularly with all this stuff coming out about the NSA, people are increasingly
[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:18.440]   concerned about security and how much does everybody know about my data.
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:23.760]   I think the next step forward would be if Apple could somehow guarantee that we're going
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:26.400]   to keep your stuff safer than anybody else.
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:27.400]   Right.
[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:29.960]   Well, and as people are putting out in the chatroom, fingerprint reading is not new.
[01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:30.960]   Absolutely not.
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:31.960]   We've seen it on Lenovo's.
[01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:32.960]   We've seen it on the ATEVE.
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:35.320]   We've seen it on the Atrix rather.
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:38.360]   We've seen it on many other devices.
[01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:39.680]   But it was never very good.
[01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:41.520]   I've had it on many devices.
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:42.760]   It was unreliable.
[01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:44.800]   It was finicky.
[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:49.240]   It didn't seem like it was really genuinely authenticating.
[01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:50.740]   It wasn't.
[01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:51.800]   And I think it wasn't cooked.
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:55.600]   And I think this is a very good example of where Apple has done in the past, they've
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:09:01.240]   taken a technology that exists, but made it work, and made it work successfully, and
[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:02.640]   then owned that market.
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:06.320]   And I think that to me is the thing to watch here.
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:12.360]   And also the motion stuff with the M7 is intriguing in terms of a watch.
[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:16.720]   Although what this kind of supports, what you've said, Renee Richie, is that the watch
[01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:23.760]   may be a very simple exercise device, a Nike fuel band almost, instead of the full-featured
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:25.400]   device, at least at first.
[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:27.720]   Well, I think it'll be informational and active.
[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:31.160]   But the other thing before I forget is Apple made a point of saying that the fingerprint
[01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:34.960]   stays on the local device that it's not being stored on a server anyway, which I think
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:40.240]   was very deliberate on their part, given all of these scandals.
[01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:41.680]   And Apple's got this good track record.
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:45.440]   I mean, people don't back up, we'll make time machine, we'll make time capsule, people
[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:49.000]   don't save, we'll do iCloud, people hate putting in passcodes.
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:53.040]   Our research says almost no one uses a passcode because it's such a pain in the ass.
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:57.200]   They make short iTunes passwords because entering them is so onerous on mobile.
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:02.400]   So if it takes away that sort of frustration and allows more people to actually use authentication,
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:04.400]   then I think that's where Apple sees the win.
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:07.200]   It also seems to me to be Apple's alternative to NFC.
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:13.440]   At this point, not putting NFC in this phone means to me that Apple's not going to do NFC,
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:15.280]   that that's it on NFC.
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:21.000]   And while every other phone does do NFC, Apple offering an alternative that it owns could
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.200]   be a very interesting play going forward.
[01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:30.320]   They could say you can use NFC, sure, or you can use our far superior fingerprint authentication.
[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:31.320]   Right.
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:35.540]   And I've seen how this is going to work on the iTunes store because, I mean, how many credit
[01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:37.760]   cards does Apple own right now?
[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:38.760]   Right.
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:40.040]   And just make that exactly.
[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:43.360]   So now you've got this one touch buying technology.
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:44.760]   That's what I think is very interesting.
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:45.760]   Yeah.
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:46.760]   Now it doesn't do everything NFC does.
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:48.320]   It does the authentication part.
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:50.760]   There's location stuff, there's ability to tap an NFC.
[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:51.760]   They're doing that with Bluetooth.
[01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:54.720]   I mean, they're going to do that with Bluetooth low energy of those features.
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:58.960]   And we discussed that Horace D'Eggia graph on Twitter on Sunday.
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:03.080]   But if you look at that graph, almost every platform is leveling off near a billion except
[01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:07.240]   iTunes accounts, which is still spiking up that hockey stick and protecting those iTunes
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:09.120]   accounts will become more and more important.
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:10.320]   This could be very significant.
[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:13.080]   I think this is the thing to watch.
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:18.720]   And one of the bellwethers, one of the indicators that I was looking for is the willingness to
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:19.720]   do commerce with it.
[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:24.240]   The fact that Apple is tells me this must be more than a gimmick.
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:25.840]   This is something Apple's going to invest in.
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:26.840]   All right.
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:27.840]   We're going to take a break.
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:28.840]   We're almost done.
[01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:34.160]   Your tips, tools, anything you want to add as a final thought.
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:36.000]   New iPhones are here.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.920]   Nothing surprising with these.
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:43.840]   The 5S, the full-figured brother to the 5, including fingerprint reading and an improved
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:48.400]   camera, iOS 7, of course, and a gold color.
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:56.160]   The 5C5 colors, including product red, which is nice to benefit AIDS relief in Africa.
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:12:00.960]   And $100 lower price tag, both will be available.
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:04.280]   You can walk into a store and get them if you can get through the line on September 20th
[01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:08.560]   pre-order for the 5C only on September 13th.
[01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:10.200]   I have to think that's purely marketing.
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:12.560]   I can't think of any other reason.
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:15.960]   That's purely because Apple wants a line, right?
[01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:18.960]   I can't think of any other reason for that.
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:19.960]   I mean, they didn't.
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:20.960]   Last year they didn't.
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:23.760]   They had pre-orders for the iPhone 5 and they were almost no lines.
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:25.720]   And it just seemed to be better for everybody.
[01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:26.720]   It's better for everybody.
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:33.160]   If I would far prefer to pre-order it and have it arrive on the 20th by FedEx, then I
[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:34.880]   have to go to a store and get it.
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:37.920]   They want lines, which is too bad.
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:43.920]   I think that's sacrificing user convenience for marketing.
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:45.480]   I can't think of any other reason for it.
[01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:46.680]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:47.680]   Come back now.
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:50.880]   Of course, the best time to go to Gazelle would be now.
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:54.360]   Don't waste any time if you're looking at it and thinking, "Okay, you might have made
[01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:55.520]   a mistake.
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:56.520]   You shouldn't wait.
[01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:57.520]   This is it.
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:12:58.520]   It's time."
[01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:03.280]   Gazelle is extending their normal 30-day offer to get you to October 15th.
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:05.920]   Plenty of time for you to get in line.
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:07.960]   Pick up a new iPhone on the 20th.
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:09.320]   Transfer your data over.
[01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:14.280]   Then pile that iPhone with all your other gadgets into a box and ship it off to Gazelle.
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:17.840]   By the way, right now your phone could be worth a million dollars.
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:20.520]   Check out the Gazelle sweepstakes on the front page.
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:23.120]   Gazelle buys back old iPhones.
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:28.960]   The iPhone's from a variety of manufacturers including Blackberry, HTC, LG, Motorola, Nokia,
[01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:30.760]   and Samsung.
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:34.720]   Maybe you're looking at that Galaxy S3, "Boy, an iPhone 5C would be a good alternative."
[01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:41.800]   Let's just see how close to an iPhone 5S or a 5C we can get if we take our Samsung Galaxy
[01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:43.520]   S3.
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:44.880]   Get an offer for that.
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:46.120]   Of course, it's in good condition.
[01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:47.840]   Hey, we're pretty close.
[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:51.120]   $145 from Gazelle for an S3.
[01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:52.600]   Now, here's the deal.
[01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:55.880]   They will pay the postage on anything worth more than a buck.
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:57.960]   So add that to your basket.
[01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:01.680]   You have to October 15th to cash it in.
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:03.760]   Find some more stuff lying around the house.
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:05.600]   You got an old Surface tablet.
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:11.200]   You want to get rid of an Asus, a Google, a Samsung, Amazon Kindle, an iPad you want
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:12.200]   to get rid of.
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:13.600]   Pile that in the box.
[01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:20.120]   Old iPods including the touches, nanos, and classics, a MacBook or even an iMac or a Mac
[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:22.520]   Mini, even an old Mac Pro.
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:23.840]   This might be the time.
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:25.880]   I don't know how much my old Mac Pro is worth.
[01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:27.160]   I'm just kind of curious.
[01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:29.040]   I have the, what do I have?
[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:31.040]   I can't even remember what I have.
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:33.600]   3.2 gigahertz, Xeon.
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:36.800]   It was, let's see, what would my, not enough?
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:39.080]   I can almost guarantee you since it's three years old.
[01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:43.080]   It's in an excellent shape because it's just been sitting under my desk.
[01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:45.240]   Oh, you have to do all the other specs.
[01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:47.920]   Well, it's going to take me too long.
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:49.760]   But they'll buy your Mac Pro.
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:54.160]   I'll tell you what, the shipping on a Mac Pro is non-trivial, but they'll pay for it.
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:55.160]   Now here's the beauty part.
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:58.440]   When they get the stuff, their data experts will check the condition and wipe it at the
[01:14:58.440 --> 01:14:59.600]   same time.
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:01.680]   I mean, I would suggest wiping it before you send it.
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:04.600]   But if you don't, don't freak.
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:09.200]   And then they'll pay you with a check, a PayPal credit, if you want to get paid instantly.
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:13.200]   My suggestion, if you buy stuff on Amazon, get the Amazon gift card, they'll bump that
[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:14.680]   value by 5%.
[01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:18.320]   Gazelle is paid out over $100 million now to more than half.
[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:22.800]   Look at that, an iPhone 5, 315 bucks, you're going to make money on it.
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:25.600]   See, I don't understand why somebody would, I guess because you didn't want to extend
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:28.240]   the contract, but you're going to be at AT&T for the rest of your life anyway.
[01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:35.200]   You might as well just extend the contract, pocket $115, and you'll replace that iPhone
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:36.200]   5 with a 5S.
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:38.960]   You'll be happy.
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:40.280]   This is why I love Gazelle.
[01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:43.840]   They're going to give you cold hard cash for your used gadgets.
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:46.600]   Gazelle.com.
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:48.400]   Try it today.
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:55.800]   And now through October 15th, by the way, you can lock in that iPhone price.
[01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:58.760]   Time for our tips or favorite stuff.
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:15:59.760]   What do you got?
[01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:04.840]   I think you're downloading, are you downloading the iOS GMC right now as we speak?
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:06.320]   No, I've already downloaded it.
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:07.320]   Oh, so.
[01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:12.120]   That would be a, I even have to pay 99 bucks because I'm going to be an Italy or somewhere
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:13.120]   on the table.
[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:14.120]   Yeah, sorry.
[01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:15.120]   No, I brought a gadget.
[01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:16.720]   You know what this is because I has one too.
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:17.720]   Do you have one too?
[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:19.640]   Oh, but we should, we should ask the people at home.
[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:20.840]   Do you know what this is?
[01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:22.480]   It is not a shark fin.
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:23.480]   Do you do?
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:24.480]   Do you do?
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:25.480]   Sharknado.
[01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:26.680]   Do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:28.320]   It looks like one with a flat top.
[01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:30.600]   Wait a minute.
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:31.720]   Here's a little tip.
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:35.760]   It's got an ethernet port on the back, a power port and a USB port.
[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:36.760]   Wait a minute.
[01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:41.200]   Ooh, is there, is there a babushka doll in a Russian matrussian doll in here?
[01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:42.200]   Yes, it keeps opening.
[01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:43.800]   No, there's a hard drive in it.
[01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:45.240]   What is that, Chris Brain?
[01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:50.400]   This is a connected data transporter and the scenario is this.
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:51.560]   I have one, but I haven't used it.
[01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:52.560]   Tell me, is it cool?
[01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:58.720]   It is cool because a lot of people use and share data over Dropbox or SugarSync or one
[01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:00.240]   of these other services.
[01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:01.240]   And that's great.
[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:05.920]   Except the nice thing about the transporter is that all your data is stored locally on
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:06.920]   the drive here.
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:13.280]   Now, that's a laptop drive, but they have what, gigabyte and 512 gigabyte and two terabyte
[01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:15.520]   of devices, so you can get it populated.
[01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:18.320]   If you don't, you can get it 199 without anything.
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:23.200]   And if you have a hard drive sitting around, you store your own in those are laptop drives.
[01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:26.920]   And the nice thing about this is that some people are concerned about keeping their data
[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:32.360]   up in the cloud, particularly if you're in a medicine, you're an attorney, you don't
[01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:34.520]   want that stuff on a cloud service.
[01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:39.920]   So instead, you store it here, you plug it into your router via an ethernet cable, or
[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:43.080]   you can get a wireless adapter if you want.
[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:47.200]   People you will share files with people just as you would with Dropbox.
[01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:51.000]   And instead of going up to the cloud, they're going actually to your device.
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:56.960]   It uploads out through your ethernet port and people can get the stuff that's stored
[01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:58.800]   directly here.
[01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:03.080]   One of the nice things about this is that you can have multiple units across offices.
[01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:08.440]   So let's say you have a dental office, for example, and you've got five different units
[01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:09.920]   throughout this thing.
[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:14.120]   You can have a transporter in each and every one, and they will sync all the data between
[01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:16.520]   all five of them automatically.
[01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:20.720]   So regardless of where you are, you go from your home where you have one to your office,
[01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:24.360]   you can have access to that same record and that same data.
[01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:28.520]   In order to use this, however, you need to be using the transporter client on your computer.
[01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:33.000]   You don't do it through a web browser because the people who make this say, you know, that's
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.960]   kind of one of the problems we have with cloud storage is not secure.
[01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:40.200]   So any data that is transferred over here is encrypted.
[01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:42.360]   It's AES-256, I think.
[01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:43.360]   Right.
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:44.360]   Yeah.
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:45.360]   So when it goes up, it's encrypted.
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:49.640]   When it comes down, it's decrypted by the transporter software that's on your computer.
[01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:51.280]   So I am able to browse.
[01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:53.800]   I'm looking at my transporter at home right now.
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:56.440]   I just can't get the files off of it, but I can see what's going on.
[01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:57.560]   I see it's connected.
[01:18:57.560 --> 01:19:01.040]   So I download the transporter software, put it on this machine.
[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:05.000]   And now, like as I travel, I could sync to it like I would drop boxes and be waiting
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.440]   for me at home when I get home.
[01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:07.440]   Absolutely.
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:12.440]   And I love the idea of having dual transporters and using that as a mutual backup solution.
[01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:13.440]   Yeah.
[01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:16.880]   So these are people that originally came from Drobo.
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:17.880]   Nice software.
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:23.280]   They've updated to the 2.0 software, which is easy to install interface.
[01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:27.200]   Again, you can supply your own drive, just pay the 199.
[01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:29.760]   And you can have a couple of gigs of storage.
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:33.000]   If you tried to do that on a cloud service, you'd be paying through the notes.
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:34.000]   Yeah, yes.
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:38.960]   It may say, well, that sounds expensive, but it's cheaper than buying a terabyte on Dropbox
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:39.960]   or Google Drive.
[01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:40.960]   Exactly.
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:41.960]   And then also, and consider the security.
[01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:42.960]   Yeah.
[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:46.280]   There's some people that just can't use cloud storage, and this is the solution.
[01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:49.920]   Their whole pitch to me was this works just like Dropbox.
[01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:52.960]   So that's what I'm curious to see.
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:53.960]   I have it set up.
[01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:55.800]   I just haven't used it.
[01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:58.120]   It's actually they were bought back by Drobo.
[01:19:58.120 --> 01:19:59.120]   So now they're back in the fall.
[01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:00.120]   They're back in Drobo.
[01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:01.120]   So funny.
[01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:02.120]   Yeah.
[01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:03.120]   Transporter.
[01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:05.120]   And it's at connected data.com.
[01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:06.120]   Right.
[01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:08.200]   Or you can also go to file transporter.com.
[01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:09.200]   Oh, OK.
[01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:10.200]   And that'll take you there.
[01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:12.960]   Renee, Richie, what do you got for us today?
[01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:14.880]   I have an oldie, but a goodie Leo.
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:18.880]   There's an app called Air Video that you run a little server app on your computer.
[01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:22.280]   And then it's an app that runs on your iPhone or iPad.
[01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:23.880]   And on the surface, it just does one thing.
[01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:27.120]   It will take any video you have on your computer.
[01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:31.920]   It will transcode it on the fly if it has to, and it will push it either to your iOS device
[01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:35.960]   or via AirPlay to a big screen TV attached to your Apple TV.
[01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:39.160]   So if you have a bunch of old videos on your computer and you just want to watch them on
[01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:43.200]   your Apple TV and you don't want to have to go through and run them through handbrake
[01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:47.800]   or do anything else to make them Apple TV compatible, it'll do all of that for you.
[01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:49.240]   Oh, that's the nice thing.
[01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:50.240]   Absolutely.
[01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:54.400]   And the nice thing I used it for is that my mother still has a big CRT television.
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:55.400]   It works.
[01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:57.840]   She sees no reason to update to an LCD TV.
[01:20:57.840 --> 01:20:59.880]   But that means she can't use an Apple TV.
[01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:04.280]   So if I go there, there's no putting an Apple TV on it.
[01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:07.200]   There's no direct way to connect anything anymore.
[01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:12.000]   So what I did is I took an old iPod touch and I just used the old AV cable, connected
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.800]   it to her TV, and put this app on it.
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:18.600]   And now I can take any video on my computer in the same way that I would over an Apple
[01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:19.600]   TV.
[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:22.520]   I can just project it to the CRT television.
[01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:28.880]   And it'll even support iTunes DRM videos by shooting them into Safari first and use Safari
[01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:32.760]   to decode them, authorize and decode them, and then shoot that back to the television
[01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:33.760]   set.
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:37.800]   So for anyone on older television technology that the new Apple TVs don't support, or
[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:41.920]   for anyone who has a bunch of videos that they collected way before iTunes became the
[01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:48.520]   monolith that it is now, it's a really smart, really clever, really easy app to just let
[01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:53.280]   you watch the videos on your computer or whatever connected storage you have on your
[01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:56.240]   device or your Apple TV.
[01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:57.240]   Very cool.
[01:21:57.240 --> 01:21:59.240]   Almost all the time.
[01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:00.240]   Awesome.
[01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:05.520]   I'm going to mention something that I mentioned on iPad today that you can't get yet, but
[01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:09.040]   I've been playing with the beta and I think it's going to be something to watch for.
[01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:16.240]   This is going to be an iOS app called Ping that the idea is to replace email with something
[01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:21.800]   that still works over email transport but looks a lot more like maybe I am.
[01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:24.560]   It's much more instant and immediate.
[01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:29.000]   I think they're going to do eventually do an Android version, but right now it will be
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.000]   iOS only.
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:34.040]   It works with your Gmail or your AOL account, your Outlook account.
[01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:39.200]   As you can see if you're watching the video here, what happens is it becomes like an instant
[01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:42.960]   messenger interface where you can have threaded conversations and so forth.
[01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:48.000]   It makes email work more like how people are using messaging today, but you still have
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.240]   the advantage of it's running over Gmail.
[01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:53.520]   It's running over an email server.
[01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:59.040]   I think really, I've played with mailbox and of course the Gmail app and I just feel like
[01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:01.280]   mail email is so broken.
[01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:04.920]   We need to kind of reimagine email and I'm impressed by this project.
[01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:07.840]   They went public last week.
[01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:13.920]   They're doing like mailbox, they're doing signups, so you go to PingAppPINGAPP.com and
[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:16.080]   put your email address in and they'll do the same thing.
[01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:19.720]   They'll say, "Actually what you put in is your phone number actually."
[01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:24.280]   They're going to send you a text saying here, it's time to download it.
[01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:27.240]   Then you're behind 138,000 people or whatever.
[01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:28.960]   I'm not sure when they plan to release it.
[01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:29.960]   I think it's fairly soon.
[01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:32.080]   They may be waiting for iOS 7.
[01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:36.040]   That may be the key for them on releasing this.
[01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:39.080]   But a really interesting take.
[01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:44.440]   They're doing some thinking about what email could be or should be and I think we need to
[01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:45.840]   rethink it.
[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:46.840]   PingAppP.com.
[01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:49.400]   I've been playing with it a little bit and I'm pretty impressed.
[01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:51.040]   Hey, thank you for being here.
[01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:52.040]   This has been a big day.
[01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:53.400]   This is an Apple announcement day.
[01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:56.360]   Always a lot of fun Chris Breen couldn't do it without you.
[01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:57.680]   We love Macworld.com.
[01:23:57.680 --> 01:24:00.600]   The Mac Daddy and I love it when you come up here and we see in person even though we
[01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:02.600]   don't, you didn't have your album of the...
[01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:04.600]   You know I was going to bring one in but I just...
[01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:06.400]   She's gonna buy it.
[01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:07.400]   An album hat.
[01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:08.400]   An album hat.
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:09.400]   That's what I need to ask.
[01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:11.360]   ReneeRitchie, imore.com.
[01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:14.840]   Thank you for breaking away from your live coverage at imore.com.
[01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:18.080]   We do all about it though there and I'm sure you'll be doing more about it throughout
[01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:19.080]   the day.
[01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:20.960]   Lots more to say about the new iPhones.
[01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:24.080]   Thanks also to Andy Inako who phoned in from the demo floor.
[01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:28.320]   Always great to have Andy on our side of the country working for us.
[01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:29.320]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:31.240]   Thanks to Chad Johnson as always our producer.
[01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:32.240]   We do Mac break weekly.
[01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:33.240]   Normally, there he is.
[01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:34.240]   What are you wearing?
[01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:35.240]   I'm wore shirt.
[01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:36.240]   I'm wore shirt.
[01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:37.240]   Awesome.
[01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:38.240]   I'm wore shirt.
[01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:39.240]   Where'd you get that?
[01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:42.960]   Renee's since I'm over the last time he was here.
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:47.240]   So I decided that today would be a good day to wear it underneath the car.
[01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:48.240]   Thank you, Chad.
[01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:49.240]   You're welcome.
[01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:50.720]   We do this show.
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:56.040]   If there are an Apple announcements at 11am Pacific, 2pm Eastern time 1800 UTC.
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:57.760]   On Tuesdays, please stop by.

[01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:02.640]   As always, we have a nice studio audience.
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:07.240]   It's really fun to do this for real people as opposed to you imaginary people out there
[01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:08.760]   on the other side of the camera.
[01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:10.880]   You can get audio and video after the fact.

[01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:20.800]   wherever you get your podcast, whether it's iTunes or whatever.
[01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:24.520]   Instacast, pocketcast, dog catcher.
[01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:26.600]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:33.120]   We do have a special up now, I think, or soon our coverage of the new iPhone announcement,
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:39.280]   Sarah Lane, Chris Breen and Scott Borne, our former co-host on Mac break weekly joined
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:40.680]   us for that event this morning.
[01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:42.880]   You'll be able to get that at twit.tv/specials.
[01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:43.880]   Yep, it is.
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:45.440]   Wow, that was fast.
[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:48.720]   Special number 170.
[01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:50.480]   Is that right or 179?
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:51.480]   170.
[01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:58.760]   And the Apple official video is now available.
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:25:59.760]   So imagine a few.
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:00.960]   Here's what I would suggest you do.
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:04.800]   Download ours, download the Apple video, synchronize them up.
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:05.800]   It'll be--
[01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:08.800]   When the lion roars, you want to start an Apple feed.
[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:10.640]   It'll be awesome.
[01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:11.640]   The third roar.
[01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:12.640]   Yeah, third roar.
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:14.560]   Very important to get that third roar.
[01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:15.560]   Thanks everybody.
[01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:16.560]   We'll see you later.
[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:18.520]   Now get back to work as break time is over.
[01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:21.880]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:25.240]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:27.820]   (upbeat music)
[01:26:27.820 --> 01:26:30.400]   (upbeat music)
