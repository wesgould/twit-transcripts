[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, the star of our show, Mr. Alex Lindsey from thePitchacord.com.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Thank you.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Hello, hello.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   The other star of our show, Mr. Andy Anotko from the Celestial Waste of Bandwidth,
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   columnist for the Chicago Sun-Times Tech Reporter, and the other star of our show,
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Mr. Chris Spreen, the Mac Daddy, the Buffont of all knowledge at Mackerel Magazine.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Merlin Mann has the day off.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Wait a minute, wait a minute, what did you just do?
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   You just did your hair.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   No, I just did my scalp.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   He's tightening his hair down for the show.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Yeah, gotta keep it down.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   It's very important.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   He doesn't want to lose his head.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Well, that's one beautiful thing about that hair.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   You might lose your head, but the hair will not get lost.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   It's more than just cuticle material.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Many things to say, I guess we're getting close to iPad day, week from Saturday,
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   the iPad ships, and now the iPad apps are kind of coming out, right?
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Do you get your appointment?
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Do you have an appointment?
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Oh, or is it just showing up in the mail?
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Do you get an appointment?
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   I'm picking mine up at the store.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   So you receive in the mail, if you say I want to pick it up, you receive in the mail?
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Well, I set up an appointment so that I could come in.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   I think they're giving out appointments.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   I don't think I'm the only one showing up there.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   This is like you 300 show up at this time and you 300 show up at that time.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   They're gonna avoid lines, obviously.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   They're trying not to have lines.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   We will suspend one iPad 12 feet above the floor.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   This is going to get team building exercise.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Any one of you will be out of reach, but if you team up together.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   We're trying to build a community here.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   I asked for mine to be delivered, even though it's a Saturday.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   They said they'll get it to me on Saturday.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Oh, man, why didn't I do that?
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Well, I'm on the air.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   I'm doing the radio show.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   What I'm really hoping is it will arrive at a radio.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   I got two o'clock flight.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   I decided not to do the overnight because I know that I'm going to be too excited to play with my iPad.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   So I didn't want to do an overnight because I need the actual sleep.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   So I'm going to take a two o'clock flight so I need to get it in the morning.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Oh, yeah, you do.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Well, I'm going to ask the obligatory question.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Andy, did you get your iPad yet?
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   No, I do not.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   I would not even commit to the phrase yet because I don't know.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   You don't even know.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   The iPod is still there.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   There it is.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   The wire monkey version of the iPad where I can get everything from the phone.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   I can get everything from this except for nourishment and love.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Although it is some sort of a simulation.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   So I got my fingers crossed.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   I have my hopes.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   I have a certain amount of serene confidence that by the time I am on live national network television
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   on April 3, I will have a functioning iPad in my hands.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   We're getting, you know, I love the fact that now that Steve Jobs answers e-mail, by the way,
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   from a 3.12 iPhone, he hasn't updated to 313 yet.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   That's the word.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   That's the word on the street.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   So now, how do they know that?
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Does it say, must say in the e-mail or maybe I don't know, must do something?
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Oh, someone hacked that or looked at the header.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   The header must say it.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Yep, sure.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   That makes sense.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   See, that's how inside Steve Jobs is for him.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   3.12 is actually 4.5.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   You know what?
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Don't you think that's probably exactly what it is?
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Andy, at the nail on the head, of course.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   He's running the iPhone 4, but it's all modified to make it look like the iPhone 3.1.2.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   I think it's interesting that Steve is so chatty lately.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   I think they've given PR, you know, because they've been working so hard for the last decade.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   I think Steve just gave him a few months off and said, "Don't worry.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   I'll handle all the e-mail questions that come in."
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   From his iPhone.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Yeah, from his iPhone because it's that good.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   He's snapping out these answers.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   I have this vision at Steve at the kid's soccer game, standing on the sidelines going, "You know,
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   answering e-mail."
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   So he sent out an e-mail.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   I guess somebody e-mailed him saying, "When's the iPad?
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Where's it going to be available?"
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   He says, "And they always very terse."
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Right.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   You know, he says, "Initially at Apple retail and online stores and Best Buy."
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   No word about AT&T.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Even though AT&T is the world.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Of course you had a soccer game.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   At his kid's soccer game while he was typing in, so we don't really know.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   We don't know.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   He couldn't have just forgotten.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Exactly.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Well, also the 3G model doesn't come out until the end of April.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Do they really?
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Does AT&T need to have the Wi-Fi models that are coming out on the 3rd?
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   By the way, this isn't the first Steve Jobs e-mail to emerge.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.280]   I guess if you get an e-mail from Steve Jobs, your first reaction is, "Quick, send it to Apple
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.280]   Insider."
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.000]   Steve was asked if there was a way to get documents onto the iPad through iWork or the
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   iDISC, his response was, "Yes."
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Well, hey, you know, soccer game doesn't have a lot of time.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Got to respond quickly.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Steve Jobs when asked if he should worry about the MacBook Pro refresh.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   This one went to Mac Rumors.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   This is actually a great...
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   This person could have been me setting this.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.600]   A Mac Rumors reader emailed Steve Jobs about concerns about how long he's had to wait for
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.000]   the new MacBook Pro updates.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Apple's recent focus on the iPad.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.480]   He wrote, "I recognize the need for secrecy at Set-Up, but I'm really losing heart in
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.560]   the lack of vision for the MacBook Pro and Mac Pros.
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.400]   I've been saying that very thing.
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.880]   Not expecting a response, but as someone who has personally switched dozens of people onto
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.720]   the Mac way, this is a sad e-mail for me to compose."
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:26.360]   Steve responded with a short reply that said, "Not to worry."
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.640]   You want to read the tea leaves on that one, Andy and not go?
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.680]   It is unwise to tip the vessel of wisdom, young Padwan.
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.680]   Worry not.
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.680]   Worry is the...
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:45.680]   Don't we should start putting his verbs at the beginning of the sentence.
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.680]   Worry not.
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.680]   Would be good.
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.680]   You can start sounding.
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.680]   He's getting more yodel-like as it is anyway.
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.680]   There is no track.
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.680]   I think it's more like there's always going to be a MacBook Pro refresh.
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.680]   There's always going to be a new version of this, that, and the other.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:09.680]   I think he's just basically saying that I'm not going to tell you a date.
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.480]   I'm not going to give you a feature list, but if you're asking the question, are we canceling
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:19.040]   the MacBook Pro product line or down-breaking it to a power PC processor, the answer to that
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.000]   would probably be no.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.560]   The unofficial Apple web blog got one too.
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.680]   A reader of the TUAW says an e-mail that was reported from Jobs.
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.040]   A reader asked if there was a way he could transfer his Google Docs to his iPad through
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.080]   iWork or iDisk.
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.280]   Jobs said, "Yep."
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.840]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.840]   That was yes.
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:47.040]   Then another e-mail, Julio R. Julio R. asked Steve, "Can we expect a universal mailbox on
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.040]   the iPhone?"
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.040]   Steve's answer was, "Yep."
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:56.200]   I'm thinking that Steve Jobs needs to talk to this guy because he's just leaking all kinds
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.200]   of information.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.360]   I don't think they understand.
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.360]   This is how Apple works.
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.360]   Look, shot up.
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.360]   Shut up.
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.840]   Whoever this Jobs guy is going to stop.
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:05.840]   You're fired.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.840]   No, we found the lead.
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.040]   We have people to take care of this.
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.200]   We have a PR department.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.720]   We have Phil Schiller shot up.
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:16.560]   Now, I got a credit that Steve Jobs is answering this stuff because we're the PR department.
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.520]   They're not going to say, "Yep."
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.560]   They're going to say they're going to bread a paragraph, at least.
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.760]   They'd also find a space at the end to mention that Apple kicked off the computer revolution
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.840]   with the introduction of the Revolutionary Apple II in 1976.
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:38.880]   By the way, one of the emails, this was last week where the MacRumors reader asked about
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.760]   Google's Picasa.
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:50.720]   That was from an iPhone 3.12, but the email about the Yep email from an iPad, the header
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:51.720]   said iPad.
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.400]   He just changed his iPhone's suffix.
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.400]   He's messing around.
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.640]   He just changed the signature, you're safe.
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.640]   That's the thing.
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.640]   It's the signature.
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.640]   I just wrote this on my iPad.
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.640]   It's just the signature.
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.640]   Right now, my iPad.
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:08.560]   Well, because he wants people to think he's that kind of a big shot that might have access
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.560]   to early hardware.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:10.560]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:15.680]   It's kind of like the tab of the back of your jeans erasing the 36 and running in a 32.
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:16.680]   I did that.
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:17.680]   How do you want to keep?
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.960]   I just said, if Andy doesn't have one, there's no way he has one.
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:25.640]   When I bought my Lexus, I bought a GS 300 and they had the 400.
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.560]   When the salesman said, "I just bought you can buy the little badge."
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.560]   It says GS 400.
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:33.600]   I just took the old one off with the new one.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.760]   Thanks for the suggestion.
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:43.240]   Yeah, I put a Ferrari logo on the front of my Toyota Sienna and it's really fooling for
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.240]   a lot of people.
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.000]   I didn't know Ferrari made a van.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   It's very sweet.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.860]   But evidently, new study show that people are happier if they're clear that they make
[00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:53.480]   more than the people around them.
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.480]   That is true.
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.480]   I saw that.
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.480]   That's true.
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.800]   That is, we could do a game on this.
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.640]   So I like to have a Lexus 800, even though one does not exist.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.160]   I simply tell people that they made a custom for me.
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.520]   I would like to do a game where maybe next week we could do this.
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:12.920]   We come up with three Steve Jobs responses and one of them is true.
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.040]   You pick which one is true.
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.040]   Yeah, we can do it.
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.680]   Ask a question and then we'll do an answer.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:20.680]   What is the magic?
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.040]   Two of them could be magic eight ball answers.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.640]   And it's point to positive.
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:26.640]   How much?
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.640]   Thank you very much.
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:31.240]   No pepper these responses with.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.800]   Do you think Steve would swear?
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.200]   I don't think so.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.840]   What do you guys think this is?
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:41.440]   You usually wait for the 11 p.m. show before he breaks out the raw material.
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.440]   That's right.
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.440]   The blue stuff.
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:48.600]   He's come to the realization that's more of a resort sort of crowd like at 738, even
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.240]   9.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:54.080]   The comedy stylings of Mr. Steven Jobs.
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.240]   What do you guys think of the palm thing?
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:58.840]   It's not strictly an Apple story except I guess you have to say that the iPhone is
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:04.040]   what killed WebOS and the Palm 3 on Friday.
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.680]   Are we surprised?
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:10.280]   You know Friday, Friday, a palm admitted that their losses were double what the analyst
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.280]   expected.
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:17.920]   61 cents a share something like that and then the outlook was bleak for the next quarter.
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:22.040]   And two analysts, two Wall Street analysts downgraded Apple stock price.
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:26.200]   I'm a palm stock price to zero.
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.200]   That's got to hurt.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.200]   You have a.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.200]   Zero big zero.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.560]   I love to have that as a goal.
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.560]   How much?
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.840]   How much are you going to write first this week?
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.120]   My goal is zero.
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:38.440]   I think that's attainable.
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:42.000]   We believe that the target price for palm is nothing.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   Wow.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   Great.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.240]   And this is in the era where we have mortgage backed securities that are still trading for
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.320]   a few cents, which is death in a puddle.
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.160]   And yet it's like, oh, but palm.
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.160]   Poms really did.
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.160]   Yeah.
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.160]   I feel bad.
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.160]   I think it's terrible news.
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.160]   Why do you think what happened?
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.800]   John Rubenstein said, well, if we just come out on Verizon before the droid did, we had
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:00.800]   a chance.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:01.800]   But I think that's silly.
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:06.160]   I think if they come out two years before the iPhone, they would have had a chance.
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.160]   Yeah.
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.160]   That's the problem, isn't it?
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.160]   Yeah.
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.160]   They would have had a chance.
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:15.080]   Also, the problem with developing new phone OS is a new phone hardware like that.
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.120]   It's a rich man's game.
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:19.800]   You have to have enough money in the bank that you can take a shocking loss for a couple
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:23.520]   of years while you build it up and build your developer community and build your user
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:27.760]   community and finally get enough information back from a few hundred thousand users that
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:31.800]   you can build the thing that you hope that you wouldn't have been able to make first shot.
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.880]   Palm just did not have that kind of a war chest.
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:38.240]   If you look at all the devices like that over the past five years that have been in their
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:43.720]   ways revolutionary, and they're all been backed by people who had the ability to simply say,
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:44.720]   you know what?
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.720]   I think it's a great project.
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.400]   We're going to keep it on the market until people realize how cool it is.
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:52.040]   The Amazon Kindle being really the case in point.
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.680]   That was a crazy billionaire project.
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:59.400]   Again, the crazy billionaire Jeff Bezos also being able to afford his own private space
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.400]   fleet.
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.280]   You know that this thing is going to be sold for as long as it takes for it to become a
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.360]   success.
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:10.960]   Now we found out that pretty much from all indications, their big plan was to not so
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.680]   much be in the hardware business, but be in the electronic distribution business now
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:19.800]   that they're also going to be doing an iPad version of the Kindle app.
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:23.280]   So that's the sort of waiting game you can play when you have so much money coming in
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.720]   from other sources that you can do that sort of thing.
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:30.920]   Palm really the best thing they could have done a few years ago was simply focus on hardware
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:38.480]   and sell to anybody who wants to put any OS on the thing be the HTC only not quite so
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.680]   Eastern European in design.
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:41.680]   They make great hardware.
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:47.200]   It's just that they just didn't have what it takes to bring WebOS to a really really
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.200]   good point.
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.240]   I think that when we look at the I think are the leaders at this point.
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:55.960]   I mean I think the coming leaders of the smartphones which is Google and Apple what
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.640]   you're looking at is two companies that are making an indirect play.
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:00.440]   The phone is simply a tool.
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.080]   It's not the end product.
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:07.440]   Their main business is something else and they're using this as a way to leverage that.
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:13.320]   And I think that that is very distinct and it gives them a key advantage because they
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.360]   don't have to make money directly from the phone necessarily.
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:19.240]   I mean they may be making money but they have a lot of other ways and they have a lot of
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:22.560]   other things funneling in when all you are as a phone company trying to do that from
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:26.960]   a startup position or a near startup position is I think I think that's I don't think we
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:27.960]   could do that anymore.
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:33.360]   I don't know if you guys had this feeling but when I saw Palm come out and try to make
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:36.360]   this attempt I kept thinking BOS.
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:39.280]   And so when this fell apart.
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:40.280]   Which they bought.
[00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.240]   Did they not buy the BOS?
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:43.240]   I believe they did.
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.240]   Did they?
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:45.240]   Yeah.
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.240]   Ha.
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.240]   Well okay they were cursed.
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.280]   They built their company on an end to even burial ground.
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.280]   Not a good idea.
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:56.800]   But you know you look at this perfectly lovely stuff except that when you look at who you're
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:00.240]   competing with not so good.
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.840]   Is it Apple completely or is it Android?
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:07.960]   In fact there's a rumor floating around that Palm might try to save itself this doesn't
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:12.760]   make any sense by the way but putting Android on their palm free.
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:13.760]   Yeah no.
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.960]   I don't know that it makes no sense.
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:20.160]   Again I think that there are a lot of people reacted really really well to the pre as an
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.720]   object.
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.720]   And I think that it's beautiful.
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:24.720]   Yeah.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.600]   If they decided to open it up to other operating systems I really think they could have something
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:28.600]   there.
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:35.360]   I've read that article it's one of those adorable completely unsourced things that you really
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:39.800]   just say okay well that's just something that is found in my backyard as a news item.
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:43.240]   But it really would if if if Paul is going to succeed they're going to have to do stuff
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.240]   like that.
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.840]   I think Android is a really good avenue for them to go.
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.840]   Right.
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:54.000]   Do you yeah there's CTIA is going on right now and there's a lot of Android handset.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.040]   Handsets a lot of Android handsets right now.
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:57.040]   Yeah.
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.040]   Coming out.
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:02.720]   It is is is starting to look like a worthy competitor for the iPhone in a way that nothing
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:03.720]   else has been.
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:04.720]   Absolutely.
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:08.560]   It's it's the it's the most minute they made a hugely forward in maturity over the past
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:09.560]   six months.
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.080]   And two point one is great.
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.080]   Yeah.
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:12.920]   Two point two point one is fantastic.
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:16.840]   It's still not in the same class as iPhone but it really did clear over that good enough
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:17.840]   bar.
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:21.520]   And the fact that you can get a wide range of different kinds of hardware is a selling
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.440]   point that the iPhone can't deliver.
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:26.960]   It brings its own problems of course but still a lot of people like to be able to have exactly
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:29.160]   the sort of handset that they want.
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:33.240]   And actually that's sort of that sort of splintering of the Android market could also
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:38.200]   help out Palm because a year ago maybe a year and a half ago you kind of want for there
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:42.800]   to be just one kind of reference Android device that every piece of software is going to run
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:43.800]   on.
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:47.440]   Now I think that the Android community has sort of come to the realization that that was
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.840]   that's never going to happen again.
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:54.480]   You got two thousand apps in the web OS store compared to 170,000 170,000 an apple and I
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.480]   think it looks 20,000.
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:59.680]   That's not as big a deal as I would initially think.
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.440]   I think that people don't want to be able to get every single app that might be available
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.800]   for every single situation.
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:09.240]   I think that as long as there's at least two really good apps and just pull a number
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:13.960]   out of a hat like 12 different categories, you're covering the interests of about 75%
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:14.960]   people out there.
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:18.000]   As long as they can Twitter, as long as they have a good access to documents, as long as
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.920]   they have a good media player and a couple others, it's not important that you have the
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:26.200]   ultimate palm top app for doing a Gantt chart.
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:32.920]   I think the danger there is the difference between Walden Bookstore and borders or Amazon
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.840]   is that on Amazon I get anything.
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.800]   Borders I get most of the stuff.
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:40.720]   Walden Bookstore, the one you get a lot of times I just don't bother to go in because
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.480]   there's not going to be anything I want there.
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:46.200]   I think that the problem is, yeah, they have a lot of the top sellers and if that's what
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:49.080]   you're looking for, that's the case.
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.440]   One of the apps that I'm going to recommend from the iPhone today for the thing, it is
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.520]   one of the most obscure things I googled it.
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:57.000]   I didn't even know it existed, we can half ago.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.720]   I googled it and there's like four applications on the iTunes store that do it in different
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:02.720]   ways.
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.280]   Is it better to have that?
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:10.360]   To have 178,000 applications but not know that they exist or to have 2,000 really great
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:13.320]   applications and know what's out there.
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:18.400]   When the Mac first came out, I remember there was a Macintosh store on TerraVile in San Francisco
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:22.440]   out in the avenues that had every program.
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:26.120]   They could, they had every Mac program on their shelves.
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:29.800]   It's silly to even contemplate that day today.
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.320]   There was an advantage because you could see what was there.
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.320]   That's what we used to say, isn't it, Annie, in the old days of the Macintosh?
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:40.720]   Well, it may not have as many apps but as long as it's got the app you want, who cares?
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:43.800]   Because your car keys are always in the last place where you look for them.
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:47.240]   Same thing, you stop looking for apps when you find the one that you really, really like.
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:52.440]   I don't care that if there are three good word processors for a certain platform and the
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:55.440]   second or the third one that I find is absolutely perfect for me.
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:59.040]   It doesn't matter to me that on Windows or any other operating system, there might have
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:03.280]   been 30, 40, 50, 60 more.
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:06.840]   Obviously more apps in the app store, more quality apps in the app store is better than
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:10.040]   fewer but I don't think that that's a metric.
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:14.600]   That's the end all be all for whether a phone or an operating system is any good.
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:15.600]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.640]   I had a conversation like this over the weekend.
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:22.120]   I went to a buddy's house and he has an Android phone and I had my iPhone and we're talking
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.840]   about getting him onto the Mac eventually.
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:28.080]   But of course we had to get into a match over who's phone was better and who had more
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:31.280]   stuff and he said, "Okay, well, let's compare the apps that we actually use."
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:37.480]   We sat down and really we have a comparable set of applications because as Andy says,
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:41.640]   you need a core functionality on your phone and we both have that.
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:45.360]   So yes, it's great that Apple has the bragging rights that they could say we have a bajillion
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:48.880]   apps on this thing but how many of them do you need and eventually does that work to
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:52.560]   your disadvantage because you can't find the stuff that you want because they're umpteen
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.960]   copies of application apps.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:58.880]   Well, I do think that one thing that becomes important and I think that app is to address
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:03.840]   quickly is with 170,000 apps, the hardest thing is finding good ones and being able to search
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:07.080]   and really know whether the, for instance, the recommendations, the recommendation system
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.360]   is so crazy on the-
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:10.360]   We need to improve that.
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:11.520]   That really is a problem right now.
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.800]   That's a huge thing because I mean right now if you see a lot of bad recommendations on
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:18.440]   a current version, yeah, you are less likely to buy and you don't really know and if you
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:21.440]   see a bunch of good ones, you don't know if it's going to be good.
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:26.360]   And now I have to admit at $3, you know, a lot of times if I see relatively a lot of
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:28.920]   good responses, I'll go ahead and buy it.
[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:33.520]   At $5, I have to really see an overwhelming- $5 or more I have to see an overwhelmingly
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.520]   good response to buy something.
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:39.360]   And then you see, I mean like Sim- like the new, or Sim City, I saw Sim City, I was like,
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:42.360]   oh, I kind of like to, you know, see what Sim City's like on an iPhone.
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:47.640]   And I saw so many bad reviews in the front page that I was like, well, maybe I won't.
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.960]   You know, for, you know, even though they dropped the price, I just don't know whether
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.680]   it's really crashing or not.
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:52.960]   And there's just not any way to update it.
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:56.040]   It's not as fluid or doesn't feel as fluid as like Amazon.
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:57.960]   Amazon I trust fairly often.
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:58.960]   Isn't that funny?
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:03.360]   I wonder why because Amazon's the same situation, isn't it, where there isn't much control over-
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:04.200]   It is, but it seems to sort.
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:05.200]   It seems to sort better.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.600]   Well, you can vote on the-
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:07.600]   People vote on them.
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.520]   You still vote on them on iTunes as well.
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:10.520]   Like this many people.
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:15.200]   But I think that what you see first is based on people's ratings.
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:16.200]   You know, so what you-
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.200]   And that's if-
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:20.480]   And that's, as somebody pointed out, is a real flaw because people aren't rating them
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.640]   until they, in most cases, delete the app.
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:26.320]   So it's really, ratings are biased towards the negative, almost always.
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:29.760]   You know, that's when you are asked to rate the app, unless you actively go out, when you
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.000]   delete an app from your iPhone.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   That's-
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   So that's going to totally bias it.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   Yeah, so something-
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.120]   Well, I also have to wonder about the audience that's rating these things.
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.120]   If you look at iTunes-
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:38.120]   In 12.
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:39.120]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.120]   You've got 11 and 12 year olds rating these things.
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:44.840]   And maybe you can tell by the spelling and the amount of punctuation.
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:48.080]   But it's harder to do things on Amazon.
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.520]   To create a review, it's more of a process.
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:54.000]   So people who are really passionate about something, one way or the other, are going
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   to tend to do it.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.720]   And you can tell if the review is well-written.
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:01.720]   And maybe because of the platform, it causes people to really think about it and offer
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:08.160]   intelligent reviews instead of OMG with 25 exclamation points.
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.000]   Every game is great, by the way.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.480]   By the way, you see the statistic.
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.200]   One of the analysts came up with it.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:18.400]   Apple has sold half a billion dollars in iPhone and iPod Touch games in 2009.
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.880]   That's not bad.
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:20.880]   500,000.
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.880]   It actually increased online game sales by 4%.
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.280]   It sold so many.
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.640]   The total was up 4%.
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:31.840]   And one third of that is going to plants and zombies.
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:36.640]   You know, I did my usual news thing on KGO this morning and I managed to sneak in and
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.640]   reference to plants and zombies.
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:40.000]   So that's what does that mean?
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.640]   That means I have a problem, doesn't it?
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:42.640]   It does.
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.680]   I wake up at three in the morning, I play plants and zombies.
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.640]   I've beaten the game and I'm still playing plants and zombies.
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.440]   I'm on my third round.
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.440]   Halfway through the third round.
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:51.440]   I'm in the horrible fog area.
[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:52.440]   The hog area.
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:53.440]   I hate the fog area.
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.440]   But you know why?
[00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:58.200]   You, ish-choo, the lantern and fog blower.
[00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.040]   It's just a waste of the space.
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:01.560]   You need another slot dude.
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:03.520]   I know, but you've got to see what's in the fog.
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:04.520]   I have two extra slots.
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:05.520]   You don't need to see what's in the fog.
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.800]   You can totally win the game without seeing what's in the fog.
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:12.200]   It is a little bit more stressful.
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:15.640]   So the shortest verse in the Bible and not co-wept.
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:19.960]   That had nothing to do with you talking about plants and zombies.
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:22.440]   How have you managed to do that?
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:24.640]   It's got unrelated, crushing sense of depression inside.
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.360]   How have you avoided that game?
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:28.560]   I don't understand how you've managed to avoid that game.
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:34.200]   I have, it's, it's like, I'm like a, I'm like a basketball coach for some, for some places.
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.560]   I've got exactly so many slots in the lineup.
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.880]   I have only one slot available for a game.
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.120]   It is still orbital.
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:44.160]   I'm very happy with my current provider of gaming, of gaming distraction.
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:46.160]   I'm not looking to switch providers at this time.
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:49.800]   My strong, my strong suggestion is that you not pick up plants and zombies.
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:50.800]   You're not put.
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.880]   I have a reverse choice.
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:55.000]   Do not put this on your iPhone.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   It's all I have to say.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   Do not.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.400]   It is bad news.
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.880]   Bad, bad news.
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:02.480]   It's just, well, here's the deal.
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:03.480]   You have to control yourself.
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.120]   It's like, it's just like being around a lot of sweets.
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:08.960]   You just have to learn that I will only have one sweet in the day, not 10 of them.
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.840]   Is there Botox for plants versus zombies?
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:11.840]   I need that.
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:13.680]   They just paralyzed my hand so I can't go.
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.840]   Have you played this game yet, Chris Breen?
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:16.840]   No, I have not.
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:17.840]   Don't, don't, don't.
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.040]   No, okay.
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:22.080]   We thought we had a problem with the tower defense games.
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.720]   This is really a tower defense game.
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:24.720]   On steroids.
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:25.720]   Yeah.
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:26.720]   It's way funnier.
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:31.560]   No, because I get games mostly based on what my daughter wants to play.
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:35.160]   So far, the zombie stuff, not so much, but doodle jump.
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.160]   Yes.
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:38.920]   Although she loves pocket God, which is maybe the cruelest game I've ever played.
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:39.920]   That is so mean.
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:43.800]   You tilt people off the island and throw them in the volcano.
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:44.960]   She loves that game.
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:45.960]   Isn't that game 18 plus?
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:48.720]   Because every, there's something on my iPhone that every time I try to update it says,
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:49.720]   this is 18 plus.
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:52.280]   Well, probably because it's a horribly cruel game.
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:54.120]   You take these little pig beans.
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:25:17.660]   So you're only a delt
[00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:22.560]   and then they're the spiky things and you have to put them down these ramps before they're
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:25.020]   impaled on the spikes.
[00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:27.020]   They have poor hygiene.
[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:31.060]   So it's interesting because I guess I didn't really enjoy the game sufficiently because
[00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:34.060]   I didn't understand that you were supposed to be a mean to these guys.
[00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:35.060]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:36.060]   Yeah.
[00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:38.300]   I was trying not to and it's very boring if you're not mean to them.
[00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:40.500]   Oh, you have to be if you're nice to them.
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:41.500]   Nothing happens.
[00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:42.500]   Nothing happens.
[00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:44.620]   You have to make bad things happen.
[00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:48.860]   You have to make horrible things happen.
[00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:52.020]   They do have zombies in it though on one of the islands if you bury them and then cover
[00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:53.300]   them with dirt while they're alive.
[00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:56.580]   They turn into zombies and then they come and they feed on the other pig beans.
[00:25:56.580 --> 00:26:00.740]   Is there like a New Testament version of this game where it's mostly about love and
[00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:02.220]   you know, neutral respect?
[00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:05.060]   Isn't so much about punishment and Ben flames.
[00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:09.780]   We all just, you just go around healing people and forcing people to sort of objectively
[00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:13.340]   reconsider their actions, their responsibilities towards the other, towards the people.
[00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:15.980]   What would want to play that?
[00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:16.980]   That's the problem.
[00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:18.980]   And that's why we have the world.
[00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:23.420]   That's probably good.
[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:27.780]   Erica Sedoon writing in for the unofficial Apple web blog has an article on nine ways
[00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:29.340]   Apple can improve the app store.
[00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:31.860]   We were talking about, you know, improving the review process.
[00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:32.860]   Right.
[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:39.540]   Hers are kind of more from a developer's point of view offer in app purchase promo codes.
[00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:43.980]   Freebies in other words, because we often when we get offers to review, we'll get these
[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:44.980]   promo codes.
[00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:45.980]   I do, man.
[00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:46.980]   I don't quite understand how to use them.
[00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:50.060]   And I keep on, I end up buying them thinking I'm going to get the promo code.
[00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:55.540]   Well, it's also a problem for the developer themselves because there's tax issues and
[00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:56.540]   right.
[00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:57.900]   It's weird.
[00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:59.300]   So she says that should be changed.
[00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:01.740]   There is now, this is one of the things that just got out of this week.
[00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:04.020]   You can now give gift cards.
[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:06.820]   You can gift apps, which is kind of nice.
[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:11.340]   Next time you log into your iTunes store and you play with the app store, you'll see the
[00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:15.420]   iTunes store terms and conditions have changed.
[00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:17.820]   And it's the gift section.
[00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:23.300]   However, gifts cannot be used for in app purchase is in app subscriptions, upgrades, or the iPod
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:25.980]   Touch OS.
[00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:26.980]   Some gifts.
[00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:29.220]   I mean, this is kind of crazy.
[00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:32.340]   Number two, other device specific iPhone archive files, IPA.
[00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:34.580]   I don't know what she's talking about here.
[00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:41.420]   Something to do with downloading the app as a standalone on your computer than syncing
[00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:42.420]   an IPA.
[00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:46.820]   I do admit that I'm getting more and more into the situation where I really want some
[00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:51.420]   of my iPad or my iPhone apps to work on my laptop.
[00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:52.420]   Are you having that?
[00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:55.420]   Like there's a couple of them where I just go, well, this would be really great if there
[00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:57.940]   is a plants versus zombies for the desktop.
[00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:00.100]   Just so I don't want to play plant versus zombies.
[00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:01.500]   Just so, you know.
[00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:02.500]   No, I don't.
[00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:03.500]   Come on.
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:04.500]   I know you want to.
[00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.020]   It's not where I play plants and zombies.
[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:09.060]   Create application families and introduce something called complete my app.
[00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:11.260]   This is interesting.
[00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:15.620]   So if you, this is for the iPad developer, so you have an iPhone version and you have
[00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:19.180]   an iPad version, there should be an inexpensive upgrade that says, would you like to get the
[00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:24.900]   iPad version for $5 more and, you know, have a family, right, of apps?
[00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:25.900]   Yeah.
[00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:30.740]   And it would also be good if I could, like, if you are the fan of the apps of a certain
[00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:35.380]   developer to have a much more intimate way of figuring out that, oh, here's another
[00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:38.340]   one that, you know, that bloody zombie games as well.
[00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:39.820]   This guy has just come up with a new pinball game.
[00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:40.820]   Great.
[00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:41.820]   I'll take a look at that.
[00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:42.820]   4%.
[00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:43.820]   That's what I say.
[00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:44.820]   4%.
[00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:46.780]   If you're an affiliate for Amazon, you get four.
[00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:52.340]   If I put a tag directly into Amazon, affiliate, I feel it would be a huge thing.
[00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:55.420]   I mean, of course, it would cost apples some money and they're selling so well.
[00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:56.420]   Do they really need this?
[00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:58.700]   Well, it would, it would make it better.
[00:28:58.700 --> 00:28:59.700]   They sell more.
[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:02.580]   You know, because people would have a, have a reason, you know, more reason.
[00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:03.580]   Are we agreed?
[00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:08.100]   Remember, Apple said for a long time, we don't make any money on music.
[00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:09.100]   It's a push for us.
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:12.420]   We sell iPods with it because it costs it the downloads are sufficient that we don't
[00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:13.420]   make any money on music.
[00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:15.700]   Are we agreed that they make money on the app store?
[00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:17.180]   I think they do.
[00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:19.140]   30% of, you know, $5 or $5.
[00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:22.020]   I bet you there's a couple that lose money on on bandwidth because they're, they're like
[00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:23.980]   really, really big.
[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:27.220]   But when you look at the 9.9 cents, the 99 cent ones that are, I mean, a lot of these
[00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:31.060]   are, I mean, some of them are 20, you know, $199 and it's a 24 megabyte file.
[00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:34.300]   I don't know, you know, but I bet you they're making somebody on them.
[00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:38.100]   I wonder if Apple puts pressure on developers of larger apps to charge more.
[00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:42.060]   In fact, like does Apple in any way, you know, they're going to have the same model
[00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:44.540]   for the iBook store where you set the price.
[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:46.980]   We take 30%.
[00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:50.460]   And I'm sure there are conversations going on about what prices would be okay.
[00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:54.060]   But I mean, they say they're not going to, you know, the thing is, it's a totally different
[00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:58.260]   economy in books because you already have like an 80 year old pricing structure.
[00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:01.220]   You already have a lot of hands that are already in the till and you already have an
[00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:04.940]   industry that's sort of used to setting the wrong prices as opposed to, I think it might
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:09.820]   be different when if and when the iBook store is opened up to independent authors, like
[00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:14.380]   if I want to put content on the iBook store, if I'm just sort of recycling old content,
[00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:18.700]   I'm perfectly fine with you getting like a bundle of interesting things that I published
[00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:22.140]   and then repolished for 99 cents per download.
[00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:27.420]   But if I've just been, I've just given an author of a six figure advance because she's
[00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:30.420]   just slept with somebody really, really famous and she's willing to work with a ghostwriter
[00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:34.420]   in a hotel room for about a week to get something out quick and dirty, then maybe I'm going
[00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:37.700]   to be less inclined to sell this sort of thing.
[00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:41.260]   Well, I'm really curious as to whether we would end up with like almost a podcasting
[00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:47.100]   style thing where people could, for instance, upload stuff, upload books that would be free.
[00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:48.500]   You know, that would be great.
[00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:49.500]   For magazines, that would be free.
[00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:52.380]   But you talked about that in the music store too.
[00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:54.900]   You always wanted indies to be able to do that and they really never did.
[00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:56.900]   I mean, CD Baby is the only way to do that.
[00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:59.300]   They never really came up with a good way for indies to be selling.
[00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:02.660]   I'm saying like, if I want a free magazine, if I want to put up a free magazine and just
[00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:05.260]   go for eyeballs, you know, it's all going to be advertising.
[00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:06.260]   I'm going to go for eyeballs.
[00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:08.140]   I should be able to put it up and let people let them go for the download.
[00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:09.900]   So you have to do that in the app store?
[00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:11.340]   Well, like I said, do you could.
[00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:12.340]   You could have a free app store.
[00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:15.220]   It would be great to see if there, I hope that we see free books would be great.
[00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:16.220]   Free magazines.
[00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:17.220]   Is there free music?
[00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:20.220]   See, well, it's not free music and that's kind of a bummer.
[00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:21.220]   Yeah.
[00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:22.220]   Well, except the stuff that Apple promoted.
[00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:24.020]   They have the monthly free song of the week.
[00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:25.020]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:26.420]   But I think it's part of that.
[00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:27.620]   So you go ahead and Andy.
[00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:28.620]   I'm sorry.
[00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:32.100]   No, I was just going to say that they already have so much of the infrastructure for that
[00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:33.100]   kind of thing built in.
[00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:35.820]   I've been looking at the iTunes LP format.
[00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:40.100]   Not the thing that you call iTunes LP trademark, but the technologies that are behind it and
[00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:44.220]   how they are actually just open web development technologies that you could be used to build
[00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:45.900]   just about anything.
[00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:51.860]   And I've built a couple of magazines sort of things that work inside the iPad simulator.
[00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:53.620]   It would be very, very easy to.
[00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:59.100]   So you start off with that ability for anybody to develop a very, very media rich, media
[00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:02.900]   rich experience of a new version of a magazine, a new version of a book.
[00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:07.740]   You also have the iTunes store that is very, very good at simply say, identifying RSS feed
[00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:10.660]   and alerting users that there is new free downloadable content.
[00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:15.860]   I don't see any reason why Apple on a technical basis couldn't simply say, if you're going
[00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:21.020]   to have iTunes LP content that forms this standard that has already been pretty set using
[00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:26.780]   this framework that has already been published and you simply stick this behind an XML feed
[00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:30.820]   and simply point it to the iTunes store, we will allow you to we will allow that product
[00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:36.820]   to load on an iPad or on an iPhone just as a as though an ordinary podcast that could
[00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:41.380]   explode everything because it would allow guys like me to simply put work out there.
[00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:44.180]   We won't be able to make any money off of it, but sometimes you're just happy enough to
[00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:49.100]   publish it while still preserving the experience of selling a DRM book.
[00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:53.580]   If if a major publisher wanted to wanted to monetize their content that way, I really
[00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:57.460]   think it's just take this thing you already have put a wire from here to here and selling
[00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:02.220]   it a brilliant new product that would just that would just as a reviewer, I would have
[00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:04.820]   to say, you know what, I'm going to have to write a separate piece about this because
[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:08.780]   this has got me more excited than just about anything else I've got in this device.
[00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:12.020]   Yeah, because I think that you know they do that with everything other than music and
[00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:16.500]   I think that's partially just a function that people in the music industry haven't really
[00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:17.500]   gotten it.
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:21.540]   They haven't really gotten that they can make as much money or more you know, as much
[00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:25.980]   money or more money through other things than they're making through their music.
[00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:31.180]   You know, the thing is that there's you know, it's such a small segment of what most people
[00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:35.020]   do as far as making money with the music, but they keep on you know charging for but
[00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:36.540]   that's that way that business model works.
[00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:40.260]   But if you look at it, all the other things in the iTunes store, everything else has some
[00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:46.620]   kind of equivalent, whether it's video or you know, or the periodical stuff or the applications
[00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:47.780]   that has a free part of it.
[00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:52.180]   I think it also keeps some control over how much people are going to charge for books
[00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:55.900]   if there's a lot of free content out there, you know, without having to tell them what
[00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:56.900]   they're going to charge.
[00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:59.860]   And I do think that Apple's like approach to this, this agency approach.
[00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:03.540]   I think this scares Amazon a lot.
[00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:06.100]   Does it do you guys think that this is a real issue for Amazon?
[00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:07.100]   Oh, sure.
[00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:11.980]   Yeah, I think that Amazon has tried to put the lid on it and basically do what Apple did
[00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:15.900]   with music and say, no, you can only go to this level and that's the price and that's
[00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:18.540]   how it's going to be because it's easy for our customers.
[00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:22.940]   And we all bought that when Apple told us that about music, we was like, yeah, go Apple.
[00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:23.940]   Now Amazon tries it.
[00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:25.340]   We're like, no, that's terrible.
[00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:28.340]   How can you possibly do that Amazon?
[00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:32.100]   And now that the publishers can simply say, well, you know, Apple's not doing that and
[00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:37.080]   we as publishers can decide the price of these things, we're going to go that way.
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:41.360]   And Apple or sorry, Amazon can't do a whole lot about it except with the independent publishers
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:45.280]   who they can hold the fact that, well, you know, we actually are selling your real paper
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:50.200]   books and I don't know that you want us to just get rid of all the books that we have
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:54.000]   in our store because we can do it and we have.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.840]   So I do think that Amazon does seem like Amazon gets into some real big bad wolf kind
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:04.440]   of situations when they, you know, when they start doing that to little book sellers.
[00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:09.300]   Well, I think they do and I think the fact that they're not able to pull this off with
[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:10.300]   the big publishers.
[00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:12.100]   So they've lost with the big publishers.
[00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:15.980]   So now they're going after the little publishers and trying to strong arm them.
[00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:17.820]   I don't think it plays well for them.
[00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:22.360]   Plus Apple, I'm sure would be more than happy to get anybody and everyone, you know, who's
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:26.760]   a real publisher to come into the iBook store, simply kill Amazon.
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:29.880]   Because all Apple's asking for is that you just, they just say you can't sell it for
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:33.760]   less somewhere else than you're selling it for us or you have to give everybody else the
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:35.360]   same deal that you're giving us.
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:38.160]   And that's all that they just want parity and they're not trying to, there's no price
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:39.160]   control.
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:42.000]   You can charge $80 for your book if you want.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.320]   Although I think Apple does think there's going to be some downward pressure.
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.320]   Right.
[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:48.160]   But then what does, what happens to Amazon when they insist with the small publishers
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:50.560]   that, okay, no, you can only sell for $699.
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:51.560]   Right.
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:53.240]   And Apple says, well, that's less than we're going to do it for.
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:55.160]   So you guys make the decision.
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:56.160]   You want to work with us?
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:00.880]   No, but if Amazon puts the down on pressure and says it's $699 only, then Apple just says,
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:04.040]   well, you just have to sell it for $699 in the Apple store as well.
[00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:05.040]   Right.
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:07.480]   That's all they care about.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:10.360]   I think though that Amazon sees the handwriting on the wall.
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:14.640]   They know that right now that they have a proprietary format, they have fortune, but
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:18.960]   by now they fortunately have the ability to deliver content to any device that their customer
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:25.760]   has, but they still have a locked up, locked up model that doesn't allow a lot of interaction
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:28.040]   with other book readers and book reader formats.
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:31.320]   I think they kind of know that they're going to have to, that if they simply say no, they're
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:36.080]   no longer the only store that allows you to sell content, that there are no other places
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:41.040]   that anybody that can burn any pub version of a manuscript can now sell in lots of different
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:44.120]   bookstores and maybe even get a broader audience than on the Kindle.
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:48.520]   I mean, this, if anyone who doesn't think that Amazon is very, very worried about what
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:54.320]   the iPad and all those other tablets represent, you should go to the Amazon store, the Kindle
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:57.840]   store and see that every single ad that they've put in, even the ones that simply appear
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:01.640]   on Amazon.com, they don't simply tout the benefits of the device itself.
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:04.640]   They always say, it works great in bright sunlight.
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:07.760]   It's got a battery that lasts two weeks.
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:08.760]   Right.
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:09.760]   Right.
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:10.760]   That's without saying the I word at all.
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:14.080]   Just remember that, you know, we got, we got things going on here too.
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:20.160]   I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to issue a target stock price for the Kindle.
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:21.160]   Zero dollars.
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:22.160]   Zero dollars.
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:25.400]   I'm not going to say it's dead.
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:27.440]   I'm just going to say zero dollars.
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:28.640]   I don't, I don't think it's dead.
[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:31.720]   I think, I think they're going to see it into the Kindle DX, which now makes absolutely
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:33.200]   no sense whatsoever.
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:37.880]   I think that you, I think that you can sell an ebook reader for $250, $260 that gives
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:41.600]   people an experience that they value more than they would value the iPad experience.
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:46.320]   I honestly, I think that one of the best, one of the, the companies that is the best
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:52.440]   beneficiary of the iPad is going to be Sony because they make the best cheap ebook reader
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:56.640]   on the market, the Sony reader pocket edition cost $199 bucks.
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:59.600]   Things actually dropped the price a little bit even recently.
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:04.320]   And it's EAIC display battery that lasts forever and it's small enough to fit in a shirt pocket,
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:07.120]   even though it's bigger than the screen you'd get on your smartphone.
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:12.080]   So this is going to be a lot of people who are attracted to electronic books, but don't
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:15.640]   want something as big as a Kindle and certainly don't want a real computer like an iPad.
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:17.240]   They're going to look at this device.
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:20.160]   They're going to see that Sony says buy your books wherever you want.
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:22.480]   We will play it for you because we support every DRM.
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:26.480]   We support the most popular DRM in every open book format on the, under the sun.
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:31.120]   They're really well positioned to thrive in all the cast offs that are going to be created
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:32.800]   in the wake of the iPad.
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:37.000]   Did you, did you guys see the Neo phony, we pad?
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   Have you seen this?
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.200]   No, it's made up based on their, on the Nintendo we know, no, no, it's, it's an Android.
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:46.600]   It's 11.6 inches, 1366 by 768.
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:55.840]   It has webcam to USB sockets, flashcard reader, WWAN modem, you know, good graphics, battery
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:58.800]   spokes, elastic, hours, who knows.
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:02.160]   And anyway, it's just, it's, but it's going to be based on the Android.
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:03.400]   It's the first one that I happened.
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:04.760]   It's the first one that I looked at.
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:07.800]   Of course, it looks a lot like an iPad, but it's the first one that I looked at going,
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:11.640]   wow, that could actually be, you know, if they can get it off the ground.
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:14.520]   That's the first one that I looked at and went, well, that would be pretty cool.
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:17.000]   Yeah, but you know, there are two, there are two problems there.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.280]   No hint at a release date, no hint at a price.
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:20.280]   Yeah.
[00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:23.600]   And you can also tell that there's these on photos of actual working mockups.
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:29.040]   These are just either CGI renderings or they have a simple engineering sample, like a fit
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:33.200]   and function mold test that they then photoshopped hypothetical screenshot on.
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:34.200]   Well, there are.
[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:36.240]   I mean, clearly, there's going to be some Android based tablets.
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:37.960]   Oh, no, there's going to be lots of great Android.
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:38.960]   Lots of based devices.
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:41.360]   Many of which have already been actually shown off.
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:45.920]   There's one device whose name escapes me that has a really cool hybrid display that will
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:53.320]   work extremely well in bright sunlight and was clearly either unintentionally or fortuitously
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:57.080]   designed to be the opposite of the iPad where it has plenty of USB ports.
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:00.560]   It has not just a webcam, but a cool rotating webcam.
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:04.640]   So you can use it for teleconferencing or while you're taking notes during a class, you can
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:09.320]   just rotate it the other way around and be shooting your professor giving his lecture
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:12.680]   while you're taking notes on it.
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:16.040]   It was working fine during the during a video demo a few weeks ago.
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:20.680]   I still don't know what the pricing is, but this is clearly that kind of device that
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:24.920]   is a lot of people are going to thrive to if they don't like the closed model of the iPad.
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:29.920]   2010 is going to be super exciting for anything that's even remotely related to a slate.
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:33.640]   So that's why the devices that are actually working that aren't being sold yet, but they
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:36.280]   can actually show you a working thing.
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:41.320]   Exciting a lot more than hi, we spent a day in Photoshop and now we're proud to announce
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:43.160]   how great our new tablet is.
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:47.960]   It's like, and it seems like unless you really have a compelling argument, you're really going
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:50.440]   to have to live in the 400 and below level.
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:54.240]   Going head to head with an iPad, you're just going to get compared to the iPad constantly.
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:59.320]   That's the thing that you have to be astoundingly good or be $400 and low.
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:02.520]   And man, getting those components for $400 is quite a thing.
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:08.760]   Well, that's like the old the iPod market when Apple owned the iPod, anybody who wanted
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:13.800]   to do anything in that space had to shoot low until the iPod shuffle came out and then that
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:16.040]   was, well, sorry, you can't do that either.
[00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:17.320]   So yeah, I think you're right.
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:22.760]   I think you're looking at the $150 to $250 space, which Apple isn't going to occupy yet,
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:28.760]   but someday we've got Kindle and Nook apps for the iPad.
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:30.480]   We're going to talk about that in just a second.
[00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:34.240]   Also, some more publishers signing up and more iPad applications out there.
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:35.240]   Actually, that's how I started the show.
[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:37.480]   We're going to finally get around to that just a little bit.
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:38.480]   We're thinking about it.
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:39.480]   Well, I think about it.
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:44.560]   But before we do, I want to talk about Gazelle really happy to have Gazelle as a advertiser
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:46.360]   on the show.
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:49.800]   This is the place you go to get cash for your gadgets.
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:53.280]   We all have extra gadgets, extra stuff.
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:54.280]   I'm building a box.
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:59.040]   Yeah, that's what you do when you go to Gazelle.com/Macbreak.
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:03.080]   Now, this is fun because this is a sponsor that's not going to cost you anything.
[00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:06.400]   In fact, this is a sponsor that's going to send you money.
[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:15.240]   If you go to gazelle.com/Macbreak, you can get cash for your gadgets.
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:18.680]   You get stuff lying around, enter it in, and see what it's worth.
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:22.960]   I'm going to put an iPhone on the front page there, and it says, "Well, what which iPhone
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:23.960]   do you want?
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:24.960]   Do you have?"
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:27.040]   I have an old 2G 4GB, let's say.
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:28.800]   It's not going to be worth very much.
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:30.880]   They ask you a few questions about condition.
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:32.640]   Does it make a call successfully?
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:33.640]   Free of water damage?
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:34.640]   Rate it.
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:35.640]   It's in fair condition.
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:37.480]   I do have the original stuff.
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:41.080]   You get more the more you have, then they say how much they're going to pay you, and
[00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:42.080]   you add it to the box.
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:45.640]   Now, they send you a box postage paid.
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:48.240]   You put all your gadgets in the box, send it to them.
[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:50.560]   They send you a check.
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:51.560]   How do you like that?
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:55.600]   They even have a great graph on the site that says how the value has changed over time.
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:59.360]   Notice if you've got an iPhone 2G, you might want to sell it.
[00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:03.520]   The price has dropped in two weeks, about $10.
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:05.000]   I can't get you a little more money, though.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:12.360]   If you go to gazelle.com/macbreak, they're going to give you 10% more, right off the top.
[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:15.840]   Check out, use the bonus code MACBREAK.
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:17.960]   You get 10% more.
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:19.600]   Some other reasons you want to look at gazelle.
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:21.440]   Of course, we all have a lot of extra gadgets.
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:23.720]   It would be great to get rid of those gadgets.
[00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:27.240]   It's also a great way to get your gadgets recycled.
[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:31.880]   If they can't pay you anything for it, if it's not worth anything, they will recycle
[00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:33.240]   it for you.
[00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:38.640]   If you've got a cause, whether it's Girl Scouts, a little league team, you're trying to raise
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:45.880]   money for your local school, gazelle will set up a gazelle page for your nonprofit.
[00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:51.560]   Better than a bake sale, less expensive than expensive fundraising events.
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:56.040]   They remove all the personal data, by the way, from your gadget.
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:44:00.480]   The guarantee no item will ever end up in a landfill because of their recycling.
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:03.480]   The service is free.
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:05.280]   You get to keep 100% of the value for your charity.
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:10.080]   I've already got an email from people who have set up gazelle accounts for their school
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:11.080]   and so forth.
[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:12.080]   It's just a great way to do it.
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:16.720]   You just tell the parents, "Look, we know you got extra stuff, recycle them, and we get
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:19.720]   the money."
[00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:26.760]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com/macbreak.
[00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:30.720]   The amount you get depends, of course, on the quality of the item.
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:35.240]   If you want it full value to set in the battery and the power cord, if you have it, I'm going
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:37.240]   to send in a big box in before middle-level.
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:38.240]   We sent in a couple of weeks.
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:39.240]   We got some cash.
[00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:40.240]   We were frankly skeptical.
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:41.240]   Yeah, we were frankly skeptical.
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:45.160]   They got exactly what they said they would get.
[00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:48.880]   If they recycle, by the way, all of gazelle's recycling partners adhere to strict environmental
[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:49.880]   policies.
[00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:50.880]   No export, no landfill.
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:53.000]   I got to say, that's worth it in itself.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   We have so many old-time-reseptors.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   Just turn under.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.560]   And you're trying to figure out who's going to come pick it up, and usually they charge
[00:44:57.560 --> 00:44:58.560]   you for it.
[00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:02.680]   If someone's going to take it and recycle it for me, that's pretty good.
[00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:03.680]   Send me a box.
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:04.960]   Now, you want to check this out?
[00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:08.640]   I want you to try it and get 10% extra by using the coupon code MACBRAKE.
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:12.440]   So go to gazelle, G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com/macbreak.
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:16.920]   If you decide to use gazelle, make sure and check out that you use the word MACBRAKE,
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:17.920]   and they'll add 10%.
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:20.920]   This is the first sponsor we've ever had that doesn't cost you anything that gives
[00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:21.920]   you money.
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:22.920]   I like it.
[00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:23.920]   That's important.
[00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:24.920]   We need more like that.
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:29.280]   All our sponsors from now on need to give you money.
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:33.080]   And by the way, if you're using gazelle, we get a little money in a way from that.
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:35.840]   They've been very happy that we've done this is our third commercial for them, and they
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:38.440]   said, "But we're getting good response, so please keep it up.
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:39.440]   We appreciate it."
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:45.120]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E, gazelle.com/macbreak.
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:47.360]   So we're starting to see the...
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:51.040]   I guess it's because the iPad's coming out in a week, week from Saturday.
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:54.000]   We're starting to see a lot of iPad applications.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.560]   Amazon and Barnes & Noble have both announced that they will do apps.
[00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:02.360]   Now, does this mean that they have been approved or just that they're going to...
[00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:03.360]   Because there's...
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:04.360]   People, it's funny.
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:07.520]   Opera put out a press release saying, "Oh, Opera Mini's going to come out for the iPhone
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:10.920]   pending approval, but there's no way in up in hell they're going to get it."
[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:15.440]   I was like, "I think the idea of doing a press release is to put pressure on Apple going,
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:16.440]   "Oh, we did it."
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:19.280]   Oh, how little you know Steve Jobs.
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:21.680]   Apple, they always keep the pressure.
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:24.760]   You tell Apple it's going to be a bad idea and they're going to go, "Oh, never mind."
[00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:28.800]   How little you know about Apple if you do that.
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:29.800]   Yeah.
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:34.200]   Well, it sounds Steve just going to send him an email that says, "Nope, nope."
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:35.200]   Nope.
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:36.200]   Sorry.
[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:43.480]   I just think that they have to make sure that especially a company like Amazon, they have
[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:46.080]   to make sure that they have an answer to the question, "Well, what does this mean for
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:52.480]   the Kindle store?" and they can simply say, "We are pleased that the iPad has been released
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:58.160]   because that means that our 500,000 titles, the largest commercial library available in
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:02.160]   the any book we can probably will be available for this land-breaking new device."
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:07.000]   Also, you notice that there is a Friday deadline, Friday of this week to anybody who wants to
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.240]   have an iPad app approved before the other.
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:11.240]   Yeah.
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:12.240]   Right.
[00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:19.240]   That's why a lot of people in your social group might be a little unshaved, a little bit smelly
[00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:22.440]   because, for us, they thought they might have a little bit more time.
[00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:25.160]   The term papers are due at midnight and that's going to be it.
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:29.760]   Let me ask, actually, Houdini 7, are you going to get this?
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:31.320]   We're going to have a Twitch iPad app.
[00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:35.600]   Houdini 7 wrote the great iPhone app for a nice Twitch, which is really spectacular.
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:36.600]   He's done an update.
[00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:39.760]   Are you going to have your iPhone version or your iPad version ready?
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:40.760]   He says, "Yes, we will."
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:41.760]   Excellent.
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:44.720]   Houdini 7, and by the way, I owe you an iPad.
[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:49.280]   We're going to have to send Houdini 7 an iPad because he's done such a great job developing
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:51.480]   the iPhone app.
[00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:54.280]   Now we have an iPad app that supposedly, if it gets approved.
[00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:58.680]   Now, Zappel doesn't guarantee approval, but they say if you want a chance of getting approved
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:02.400]   in time for April 3, you need to get it to us by Saturday.
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:05.040]   What are you guys hearing from developers?
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:08.400]   Are you hearing that a lot of them are going to jump in and use the development tools or
[00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:09.400]   a bunch of them?
[00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:10.400]   Yes, everything.
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:11.400]   Really?
[00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:15.640]   So, just wait for the device and say, "Ha, this tells us something."
[00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:16.640]   Everybody.
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:17.880]   Everybody I've talked to.
[00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:18.880]   Yeah.
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:20.240]   I mean, it's a big opportunity.
[00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:25.680]   I've had a bunch of alpha and beta iPads apps running on the simulator because you've got
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:28.520]   to start working on this software sometime.
[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:31.640]   You know that there's going to be hundreds of thousands of people who just want to see
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:35.000]   what the difference is between an iPhone app and an iPad app.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   That's a huge marketing opportunity.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   You can push out an update a week later after all of your staff has had actual iPads to
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.520]   load the thing on.
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:46.760]   Even I'm sort of in that boat where there's sort of plans that I've been having for the
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:50.520]   past six or seven months to do iPhone content.
[00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:55.160]   Now, it just seems like, "Well, geez, if I can get this done in time for the iPad launch,
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:57.840]   isn't that a cool deadline to suddenly have?"
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:03.720]   So, I really do think that the first generation of iPad apps are going to be really aren't
[00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:09.240]   going to show off the true abilities of the iPad operating system, the iPad interface,
[00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:14.760]   because everybody is still writing apps on desktops that will work with mouse and work
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:16.040]   with pointers.
[00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:20.800]   It will technically be a touch-based interface, but without the living, breathing iPad in front
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:24.600]   of you, so you can just put a control here, tap and see how it works, realize that, I
[00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:27.080]   don't know, it should be down here or not up there.
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:30.120]   It's going to take having a live sample to run the software.
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:33.440]   Before people really figure out how to run an iPad app, I think that there's going to
[00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:37.680]   be apps available on April 3, but the real apps are going to be available two weeks later.
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:45.280]   Well, and I think the only danger is specifically the way the review process works on iTunes
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:48.640]   is that a lot of people like me, I'm going to be downloading a whole bunch of things
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:53.360]   that are iPad apps, but what happens if you put out something bad, you'll make some money
[00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:57.440]   at the beginning, but the issue is that you get a bunch of bad reviews, and then you have
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:00.880]   to climb over that hole because there's no way to get rid of those reviews of that application.
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:03.880]   Now, I might put out apps, but I definitely wouldn't put out my treasures.
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:06.480]   You know, like the thing that I really think is going to go well.
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:08.400]   Well, you want to make sure, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:15.120]   I'd rather, you know, I am constantly tempted to go fast rather than well, and I am rarely
[00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:17.120]   happily surprised.
[00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:19.880]   Wait a minute, let me parse that.
[00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:21.680]   I am rarely happily surprised.
[00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:24.280]   Oh, you're never so, you know it's not going to go well.
[00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:27.680]   You know, the thing is when you go fast, when you go, you know, you think that it's
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:29.080]   worth, I mean, and it will be.
[00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:31.320]   People are going to make a lot of money, and especially people who do something really
[00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:32.320]   cool.
[00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:33.760]   They've already done a bunch of iPhone development.
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:36.680]   They already kind of have an idea, and they're going to be in the right place at the right
[00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:40.920]   time, but there's a big risk if you throw something out there really fast to be part
[00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:44.840]   of that first crowd of people, and then you get, and then you get a thousand people who
[00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:48.640]   give you a one star and say, "This stinks, it crashes all the time," or "I hate the
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:50.040]   interface," or whatever.
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:55.000]   Now you and your company have to dig yourself out of that hole, and that's the, you know,
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:00.280]   I definitely wouldn't put my name or the app, the name that I really want on the first
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:04.800]   thing that I put out there, because I'd be afraid of it not going well, especially if
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:06.320]   I'm shooting into the dark.
[00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:07.320]   Right.
[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:08.320]   Right.
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:12.120]   Well, and you are, but on the other hand, wouldn't you love to have it out day of?
[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:13.120]   I would if I knew that.
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:15.360]   I mean, how small is that store going to be?
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:17.160]   How many people are going to download that at?
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:18.160]   It's going to be great.
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:20.760]   The problem is you just don't know how long it's going to take to fix the bug.
[00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:23.000]   Well, and how many bad reviews you're going to get.
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.560]   I mean, everyone's going to be downloading them.
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:25.560]   It's a gamble.
[00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:26.560]   No, it is.
[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:27.560]   It's totally a game.
[00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:29.560]   I'm just not, I'm not a very good, I don't, when I go to, I'm going to Vegas in a couple
[00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:32.480]   weeks, and I'm not sitting at any of the tables.
[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:37.040]   Well, some apps are linear enough that you'll, you'll, you'll, you'll fine tune them, but
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:38.560]   you'll get it 95% there.
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:39.560]   Yeah.
[00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:42.080]   I've been looking at a lot of different comic book apps, as you can guess.
[00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:46.160]   And I really think that like the Iverse app for instance is at least 95% there.
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:50.160]   I can't imagine them making a big improvement on what they've already got.
[00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:53.240]   Again, I'm sure that as soon as they've got the live thing and they get to touch the
[00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:56.640]   interface for the first time, they're going to maybe move this button there, maybe this,
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:59.200]   make this bank of buttons a little bit larger.
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:03.040]   If anything, the only consistent problem that I'm seeing is people who are just taking
[00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:08.520]   existing iPhone user interface skills and trying to just transplant them one to one
[00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:14.000]   to the iPad, because when you launch an application and you get a blank screen, that new document
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:19.320]   button that used to be so big in an iPhone screen is now just tiny little Chrome, but
[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:21.640]   it's just sort of hidden off in the corner of the screen.
[00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:26.040]   But I think that a lot of apps are going to be very, very successful on April 3rd.
[00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:32.040]   I really hope that Plask thinks about doing a comic life that exports directly to the
[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:33.040]   iPad.
[00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:35.000]   Oh, wouldn't that be fun?
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:40.760]   And then free publishing on the iBook store and you got a name.
[00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:44.200]   Even if you like me, you could make a comic book with my own pictures.
[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:45.200]   Yeah.
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:46.200]   Yeah.
[00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:47.200]   Yeah.
[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:48.200]   Definitely could do that.
[00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:50.200]   Definitely could do that.
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:53.520]   Here's an app that's destined to fail.
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:53:00.400]   AT&T will be providing wireless service for a couple of new unusual 3G applications like
[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:01.880]   Vitality Glowcaps.
[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:06.600]   This is a pill bottle cap, which calls or texts you if you forget to take your pills.
[00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:11.440]   I just, you know, the first lawsuit because AT&T dropped the call and grandma dropped
[00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:12.440]   on the floor.
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:13.440]   I don't know.
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:19.680]   The other one is Appysphere is working on a SIM card equipped dog collar that will let
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:22.840]   dog owners keep track of their pets.
[00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:25.120]   And you can establish a geo fence.
[00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:27.160]   I think the liability risks are less there.
[00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:30.200]   Although, yeah, I mean, all you have to do is slip that into a kids lunchbox.
[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:31.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:32.360]   And you're done.
[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:37.080]   I did order there's something I think it was called puppy tweets, a little collar that
[00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:40.240]   I'm going to put around Aussie that tweets whenever Aussie scratches or barks or runs
[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:41.240]   around.
[00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:44.720]   No, I think I think the big impact is going to be next on the news at six.
[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:49.520]   Is your dog sexting back after this?
[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:56.880]   It's only a matter of time and gadget is at CTIA and boy have they got a load of new
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:58.960]   phones and stuff.
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:01.680]   This is the big cell phone event of the year.
[00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:02.680]   Where is CTIA?
[00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:03.680]   It's usually in Vegas.
[00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:04.680]   Isn't it?
[00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:06.680]   I don't know where it is this time.
[00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:08.320]   Right.
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:13.080]   Lots of new hands on the new I one this new Motorola, which is running, I believe it's
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:14.080]   running Android.
[00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:15.760]   A lot of Android stuff.
[00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:22.800]   This I one is the first Android power push to talk from using the IDEN network from Sprint.
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:24.480]   It's called the Motorola I one.
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:30.520]   I mean, there's a ton of these or I mean this is the Android is dominating CTIA and I have
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:33.200]   to think that Android is coming on strong.
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:36.800]   If there is a threat to Apple at this point, it's definitely Android.
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:41.320]   Well, the question is it those blackberry I mean, when I talk to blackberry users, they
[00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:44.160]   just they like Verizon.
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:45.160]   Yeah.
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:49.360]   They're still in that land of everyone hates their phone just hated the other ones more.
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:50.960]   Now they don't even like their phone.
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:52.640]   They like other ones more, but they still like their network.
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:53.640]   There's Verizon.
[00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:55.800]   Or the company gave it to them and that's what they use.
[00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:59.400]   But it doesn't seem like people who used to call it crackberry don't really call it that
[00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:00.400]   anymore.
[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:01.800]   They kind of look at it like, well, it's the crap.
[00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:06.720]   The one I want and we'll find out about this tomorrow is the HTC's supersonic, which will
[00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:10.560]   be a 4.3 inch screen Android 2.1.
[00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:15.600]   It's the latest version, the one that's on the Nexus 1 with the sense UI on top of it.
[00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:22.400]   But most importantly, it'll run Clearwire, sprints 4G, Wi-Max on it.
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:23.400]   Is that out?
[00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:24.400]   Is it working?
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:25.400]   It starts tomorrow.
[00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:26.400]   Yeah.
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:29.440]   Well, that's the issue because you can get 4G in some towns.
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:32.240]   We were able to get in Austin and Vegas, but not here.
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:33.080]   Was it fast?
[00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:36.680]   You know, you have to talk to Colleen about that.
[00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:38.680]   My sense was it wasn't much faster than 3G.
[00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:39.680]   The word is the...
[00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:45.320]   The word is that 4G falls off very fast outside of the cell tower.
[00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:47.320]   So that was explaining it.
[00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:48.320]   That's actually...
[00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:50.680]   I was talking to Tom Anderson.
[00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:53.960]   He's a writer for Make Magazine and programmer for Agilent.
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:58.920]   He was saying, as it drops off, as you get out away from that cell tower, it really drops
[00:55:58.920 --> 00:55:59.920]   off fast.
[00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:02.800]   So you get crazy fast speeds and they can say that it gets those fast speeds, but not
[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:04.360]   for very far.
[00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:08.000]   Dell has... Dell Mini 3 is very popular.
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:13.240]   The new Ricris and Mini 3 is the Aero for AT&T.
[00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:16.800]   It'll have Android on it.
[00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:19.160]   Unfortunately not 2.1.
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:22.840]   My advice to anybody thinking about switching to Android is get 2.1.
[00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:26.520]   If the phone has 1.5 or 1.6 on it, don't do it.
[00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:31.040]   As you said, Andy, the 2.1 is significantly more mature.
[00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:33.120]   Do we think it's just a horse race between these two?
[00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:34.120]   Do we think...
[00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:36.200]   Yeah, who else?
[00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:37.200]   Anybody?
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:38.360]   Blackberry, RIM?
[00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:45.320]   I think, again, they're people whose needs are not being served by Android or iPhone.
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:49.240]   And I think in some ways that's the best market to have because people who are Blackberry
[00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:53.040]   owners who are just that focused on messaging, they're never going to be happy with anything
[00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:54.040]   else.
[00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:57.840]   You can start charging them $1,000 per text and they'd start shopping around, but they'd
[00:56:57.840 --> 00:56:59.320]   probably keep coming back to Blackberry.
[00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:00.640]   They're so entrenched right now.
[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:03.960]   See, that's not the response that I'm getting from people that I talk.
[00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:08.840]   Because I ask why they still have their Blackberry out of mostly out of morbid curiosity.
[00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:12.000]   And it's all like my company gave it to me or I like Verizon.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.840]   Nobody talks about wanting to do it anymore.
[00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:15.520]   I'm sure of Windows Mobile as well.
[00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:21.280]   You know, Windows Phone 7 edition starter, whatever the hell they call it, which won't
[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:23.560]   be up to the end of the year, is it looks pretty nice.
[00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:24.560]   It looks...
[00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:27.560]   It's got a great UI based on the Zoom UI.
[00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:32.320]   But still, Windows Mobile is done very well, mostly because it's corporate.
[00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:33.800]   That's the phone you get from the company.
[00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:34.800]   Yeah, when you...
[00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:39.480]   The issue, your uniform and you put on the yellow jumps, you think you have to work
[00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:40.480]   in there.
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:42.480]   And here's your Blackberry or here's your Windows Mobile.
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:43.480]   Or your ID phone.
[00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:49.000]   Yeah, your ID badge and here's your phone and this is what you must use.
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:54.040]   Which is fine for certain large companies, but in terms of people, normal people going
[00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:56.160]   out and seeking out this phone, I don't think so.
[00:57:56.160 --> 00:58:01.520]   Colleen is saying in a chatroom that when AT&T had a good signal, the 3G was faster than
[00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:03.520]   the YMAX, we were able to get in Las Vegas.
[00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:06.760]   However, she says the YMAX was more reliable.
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:11.280]   I like everything that would be more reliable.
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:12.760]   It's more reliable.
[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:14.160]   It's like extra reliable.
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:15.320]   More reliable.
[00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:21.920]   Let's see, what else is going on in the news today?
[00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:25.040]   Apple adds two publishers to its store for eBooks.
[00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:27.600]   I think it represents a lot of independent publishers.
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:32.000]   So what they did is they locked in like 200 little publishers with that.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:37.040]   By getting Perseus Group, you get 330 small presses, Grove Atlantic, Harvard Business School
[00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:39.120]   Press, the Zagat Guides.
[00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:40.120]   Yeah.
[00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:41.120]   Oh.
[00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:44.440]   I mean, this is the big, I think that turning that one over with the large publishers is
[00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:47.760]   kind of a, they're not too worried about Amazon, I think at this point.
[00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:51.760]   I also got one of my favorite small publishers, Workman.
[00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:55.920]   And Workman does the What to Expect when you're expecting series?
[00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:58.960]   And is that one you read a lot?
[00:58:58.960 --> 00:58:59.960]   That's the best.
[00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:00.960]   I did.
[00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:01.960]   I read it heavily.
[00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:05.440]   That's one that scares the hell out of me when you're about to have a kid.
[00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:07.120]   So they have the nice gentle guide.
[00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:08.120]   So then you read this one.
[00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:09.600]   Ah, you think of all the things that can go on.
[00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:12.480]   Well, I've been reading What to Expect when your daughter turns 18.
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:14.600]   And so far it's been very accurate.
[00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:16.160]   She had her 18th birthday yesterday.
[00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:17.160]   Did you do it?
[00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:18.160]   Did you do it well?
[00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:19.160]   It's kind of scary.
[00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:22.000]   We did as well as we could considering we were both in tears, my wife and I.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:24.360]   Our daughter's turned in 18.
[00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:25.360]   Chris, it's no fun.
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:27.400]   Let me tell you, you don't want your kids to grow up.
[00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:30.400]   No, I'm very happy with the H.E.S. right now.
[00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:35.120]   Yeah, I'm thinking ahead because I'm going to be very creaky by the time he turns 18.
[00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:37.280]   That's what I thought.
[00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:39.560]   I thought, man, I'll be 53 when she's 18.
[00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:40.640]   That's over the hell.
[00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:42.320]   I don't think that anymore.
[00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:43.880]   They also do the silver palette cookbooks.
[00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:49.160]   I think cookbooks on the iPad might be a killer app interactive.
[00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:50.840]   Interactive cookbooks.
[00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:53.960]   Maybe it talks to you because one of the problems I have with cookbooks is I'm busy going like
[00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:54.960]   this.
[00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:55.960]   Now I go, what do I do now?
[00:59:55.960 --> 01:00:01.200]   If the cookbook would actually say, turn off the heat, that would be awesome.
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:02.200]   Video, you're right.
[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:03.200]   Wouldn't that be cool?
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:06.600]   That was actually when we were designing the tablet that we were thinking of doing two
[01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:08.920]   years ago, that was the first application that we could work with.
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:10.800]   That was like the first thing that we would do is cooking.
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:14.800]   And Workman is a very innovative forward thinking publisher.
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:17.920]   I think that's exactly what they're thinking of.
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:23.240]   So now everybody but Random House has agreed to go with the iPhone store.
[01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:24.760]   They hold it out for them.
[01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:25.760]   What is their problem?
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:27.360]   Some random reason, I'm sure.
[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:29.200]   Sorry, you can't buy any Random House books here.
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:30.200]   Have anything else you want?
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:31.200]   That's not going to last.
[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:35.840]   Meanwhile, what's happening with the textbook publishers like Pearson and some of these
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:39.000]   other because clearly there's a huge market there.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.200]   Yeah, I think that they've all come along.
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:43.280]   I mean, that's going to be.
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:44.280]   I think they're all in.
[01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:48.640]   And I think that the other thing is that we've had some interaction with folks that are developing
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:52.240]   for developing the next generation of learning materials.
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:56.240]   All of these manufacturers are light years ahead of most publishers.
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:01:01.960]   So whether it's Pearson or the Hofel Mifflin or whoever it is, all of these companies
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:03.920]   have been working on interactive versions for a long time.
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:04.920]   They've been talking about interacting.
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:07.960]   They've been building the content for a long time.
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:10.440]   So they've seen this writing on the wall for a long.
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:15.320]   Whether it was going to be a pad or people doing on the computer, they're actually probably
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:20.040]   more ready for it than most of the people out there.
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:22.960]   Amazon is playing hardball at this point.
[01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:26.840]   They're really trying to get the publishers not to do agreements with other companies.
[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:32.000]   All Apple is saying is, if we do a deal with you, you agree not to sell a book for a lower
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:37.120]   price at any other digital bookstore.
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:40.480]   Amazon, though, has all sorts of restrictions.
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:44.560]   Amazon really would like to bury the iBook store.
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:46.360]   That's not going to happen.
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:51.280]   As pressuring publishers that have yet signed deals with Apple to refrain from doing so,
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:53.320]   according to the New York Times.
[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:56.280]   I don't think this one works for Amazon.
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:57.280]   That kind of happens.
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:59.280]   It's kind of high maintenance rather than low maintenance.
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:02.400]   One's like, you know, well, Amazon has a different structure.
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:07.640]   They don't want to be basically a commissioned reseller as Apple is.
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:09.480]   They want to set the price.
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:10.480]   Apple says you set the price.
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:14.480]   We'll take 30% of whatever you set the price to be, as long as it's not less than anywhere.
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:18.120]   Do we get Apple learned from their music stuff?
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:20.120]   Just like forget it.
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:21.600]   That didn't work for us.
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:23.520]   It's controlling the price of the songs.
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:25.160]   Like we're not going to go down that path again.
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:28.720]   It's kind of too bad because one of the reasons that I think that you don't see DRM on songs
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:33.520]   is Apple put the screws to music publishers saying, okay, we'll give you the variable
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:36.000]   pricing you ask for, but you've got to take DRM off.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.960]   That was a nice little stick to have.
[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:41.560]   I think that you got to remember that the reason why they put on the 90s and 90s and
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:44.280]   price tag was because they were inventing this story.
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:47.960]   A lot of the decisions that they made with the iTunes Store 1.0 was just, here are all
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:51.160]   the ways the Sony music store screwed things up.
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:55.040]   Here's the way that your universal store could not possibly work or be a success.
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:03:00.520]   One of them was, I don't care how popular the song is, you ain't getting $2.38 for
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:01.520]   a bit of honey.
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:02.520]   Well, that's it.
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:04.160]   And the sales went down.
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:05.240]   There's the problem though.
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:12.080]   If you sign a deal with Apple saying, we're going to do this agency-style relationship where
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:16.680]   we set the price, you get 30%, and we agree not to sell it for lower than anywhere else.
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:21.960]   Amazon, you just sign a deal with Amazon that says Amazon will set the price.
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:26.320]   What's to stop Amazon from setting a lower price and screwing you with Apple?
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:30.240]   Well, because what you're going to have to do in every agreement is tell Amazon that
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:32.240]   they can't sell it for whatever price, but it can't go below this.
[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:33.240]   I mean, that's what's going to have to be in every deal.
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:34.240]   That's not the deal's Amazon's making.
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:36.360]   Well, it takes all Amazon's flexibility away.
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:38.400]   I think Amazon's a big loser here.
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:42.960]   As we saw with McMillan, Amazon can try to play a tough guy, but they just can't do
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:43.960]   it.
[01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:50.600]   Well, the other issue is this makes what Apple's agreement does is it makes every other online
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:55.920]   publisher compete with them only technically and with Marketmass, which is, you know, that
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:59.880]   is, I mean, it is bringing everybody into their briar patch and making them duke it out.
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:00.880]   Yeah, that's a good rock.
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:01.880]   That's a very apt analogy.
[01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:02.880]   Yeah.
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:08.280]   Well, it's interesting to watch as this develops, but I have a feeling that this Donnie Brook
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:12.880]   Apple has all the advantages.
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:15.160]   The Kindle on the Mac look really nice.
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:16.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:17.160]   Kindle on the Mac.
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:18.160]   Have you played with that?
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:19.160]   I haven't got it yet.
[01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:21.640]   I just saw the screen captures and I was like, wow, it looks better than on the Kindle.
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:22.640]   I got it.
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:27.600]   I wish that it had something as simple as just being able to rotate the screen 90 degrees.
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:31.440]   I think it's an obvious feature that any book screeter should have given that it's so easy
[01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:35.080]   just to simply turn your notebook on the side.
[01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:36.080]   Works great.
[01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:37.080]   Come on, Andy.
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:38.080]   What?
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:39.080]   I want to read.
[01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:46.000]   I'm not saying that this would be that this would be the optimum reader that I would have.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000]   Yeah, okay.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:51.960]   What I'm saying is that it's an obvious option that people would want.
[01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:55.680]   I mean, it's not a case of I read most of my books.
[01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:59.520]   The habit that I've built in that I've come to over the past couple of years of using
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:04.880]   my Kindle is that I use my iPhone for incidental.
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:08.400]   I have got a few minutes waiting in line reading when I want to sit and read it and
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:11.280]   enjoy something, then I get my actual Kindle reader.
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:15.480]   The notebook would be a cool hybrid between the two because I don't always travel with
[01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:17.200]   my book reader.
[01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:23.080]   If I had the ability to turn that 90 degrees instead of sitting like this, you know, going
[01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:29.940]   tap, tap, because they're only like 20 lines per display and simply be able to lean back
[01:05:29.940 --> 01:05:34.840]   and simply have something approximating a full large print book page in front of me.
[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:37.360]   Yeah, hell yeah, I'd use that option.
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:38.360]   I just don't see myself.
[01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:39.360]   Here's the thing.
[01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:43.840]   Once I have an iPad, I would never consider reading a book any other way.
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:45.400]   You know, I mean, I know we shall see.
[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:46.400]   I mean, but it matches.
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:48.120]   You don't have an iPad.
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:49.120]   Right.
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:50.920]   God forbid he says.
[01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:51.920]   Yeah.
[01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:52.920]   I mean, that's back.
[01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:55.160]   It's gone from being a luxury to a must have.
[01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:56.160]   Exactly.
[01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:57.160]   Well, where do you see?
[01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:58.160]   Where do you see my Mac pick this week?
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:00.160]   You're going to have to have an iPad.
[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:04.000]   Oh, oh, we're going to get our picks of the week in just a second.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.680]   Any last minute news stories you guys have I left?
[01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:08.680]   I know I've left a lot out.
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:11.360]   There's so many stories, but we got to what we got.
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:14.600]   Anything agent going once going twice.
[01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:16.680]   I was at the school auction on Saturday night.
[01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:17.680]   It's all right.
[01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:21.240]   Sold to the man in the cowboy hat.
[01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:24.800]   All right, let's get to our picks of the week in just a second.
[01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:30.880]   Chris Breen is here the Mac Daddy from Macworld Magazine, the editor of the Mac 911.
[01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:31.880]   Yeah, he said what?
[01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:32.880]   Yes, I'm here.
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:33.880]   I have something.
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:34.880]   Hold on.
[01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:35.880]   Hold on.
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:37.080]   Save your pick, my friend.
[01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:41.240]   Andy Inaco is also here from the Chicago Sun Times in the celestial waste of bandwidth,
[01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:45.600]   Mr. Alex Lindsey from the picks of corpse also here picks a core.com.
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:49.520]   The guild of multimedia artists picks a core.tv for the podcasts.
[01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:51.520]   Got a bunch of them coming up for NAB.
[01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:52.520]   We are going to go crazy.
[01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:53.520]   Can't wait.
[01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:54.520]   We are.
[01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:56.520]   We're I'm sending Colleen and Lisa, but I'm not going to go and we're not going to cover
[01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:59.640]   it because because I said, well, Alex has got this one will in hand.
[01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:01.960]   I got I'm going to be there for six days.
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:08.080]   I'm I'm I'm I'm speaking on on Saturday and Sunday and then we hope to do some we're
[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:10.120]   going to definitely do some streaming.
[01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:15.880]   We are doing we're going to probably shoot 60 episodes, but we're going to compile them
[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:19.120]   into bigger shows because it's too many to put out.
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:21.400]   And so but we're going to cover as much as we can.
[01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:25.240]   We're going to try to really give you kind of a virtual experience of the of the event.
[01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:30.920]   So we should have a lot of fun, but that's coming up on April 12th and yeah, and it's
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:33.400]   going to be a lot of fun.
[01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:35.800]   We are getting to our picks in just a moment before we do.
[01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:40.080]   I do want to mention our friends are good friends at audible.com, the great bookstore
[01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:44.080]   online that you can download audio books from.
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:48.520]   Pick a book from its collection of 70,000 titles.
[01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:49.920]   Download it within a minute.
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:51.680]   It'll be on your computer.
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:57.420]   Sync it up to your zoom, your Kindle, your iPod, your iPhone, any of hundreds of different
[01:07:57.420 --> 01:08:02.120]   devices that work with audible books, and now you're ready to hit the road, whether I'm
[01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:10.040]   driving in the car, working out at the gym, even things as simple as cooking dinner or
[01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:11.040]   cleaning the house.
[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:12.240]   I love to listen.
[01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:18.320]   And what the beauty of audible.com is you get to read more.
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:19.840]   It brings reading back into your life.
[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:24.000]   You know, who has time these days and yet I've read literally several hundred books.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:30.220]   I think it's up to 400 books now since I started as an audible customer in 2001 books I probably
[01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:35.140]   would never have read had I waited till I had time to read.
[01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:38.900]   I love audible audible.com/macbreak.
[01:08:38.900 --> 01:08:39.900]   You can go there right now.
[01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:40.900]   Sign up for the gold account.

[01:08:42.220 --> 01:08:48.420]   We always let Andy Ennaco make his pick because he's a devoted audible reader.
[01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:53.940]   I'm still in the middle of the big burn, which was my pick from a couple of weeks ago, which
[01:08:53.940 --> 01:08:55.960]   no pun intended is definitely hotting up.
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:59.240]   Hey, hey, let's bring out your headline.
[01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:03.360]   But part of the fun is especially when you have the subscription that says that you just
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:05.720]   simply get one every month, whichever one you want.
[01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:08.800]   You do tend to sort of bookmark ones that catch your eye.
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:13.720]   And so the next one that I've got my eyes on for my next credit is a really neat looking
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:15.640]   book on Sputnik.
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:20.560]   It's called Red Moon Rising Sputnik and the Hidden Rivals that ignited the stage.
[01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:27.560]   Sounds really, really cool because I've heard, so of course I've always been reading about
[01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:32.940]   history of space exploration and space technologies from the 20s and 30s, pretty much onward.
[01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:36.120]   And from the descriptions of the reviews I've read, it sounds like they've done a really
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:40.840]   good job of choosing not the entire history of space exploration and the development of
[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:46.060]   satellite and rocket technology, but just let's just choose this narrow window of getting
[01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:51.820]   Sputnik up and going and how the United States and the Soviets reacted to that.
[01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:55.300]   Because at one full swoop, you can talk about a whole bunch of different things starting
[01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:58.740]   with one of the most interesting characters in the history of space exploration, which
[01:09:58.740 --> 01:10:04.840]   is a Russian scientist with a name of Karlov, who was one of the biggest state secrets
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:06.000]   that the Soviets had.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.820]   They would not let his name go out anywhere because they feared that he would be attacked
[01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:15.940]   because this one man, believe it or not, had the entire Soviet space program inside
[01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:16.940]   his head.
[01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:17.940]   Wow.
[01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:23.460]   It wasn't like NASA where they had about 24 different project managers in the series.
[01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:24.820]   He was there in Verner von Braun.
[01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:27.780]   Was he a Russian or was he a German?
[01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:34.220]   He was Russian, as a matter of fact, he was Hugo Slavian, who Stalin put in a work camp
[01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:38.500]   because he was essentially, because he was a Slav and was not to be trusted, even though
[01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:46.460]   he was more like the Goddard of Russia than the Soviets, anything else.
[01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:50.300]   He early on was saying, "Geez, we could put a rocket onto this and we'd actually use
[01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:54.940]   it for satellites, we'd use it for space exploration, and then say, "Ha, ha, fine, go upstairs,
[01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:57.140]   go up north and mine salt for us."
[01:10:57.140 --> 01:11:01.780]   Then after it became clear that, "Oh, actually, we're going to need to launch really huge
[01:11:01.780 --> 01:11:04.540]   payloads of really destructive bombs into space.
[01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:06.060]   Who do we have any guys like that?"
[01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:07.620]   Yes, we do, Mr. Premier.
[01:11:07.620 --> 01:11:09.580]   You sent him to the Gulag eight years ago.
[01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:12.420]   Well, find out whoever approved that order and have him killed.
[01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:13.420]   It was not me.
[01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:16.780]   Bring it back because we've got big plans for him.
[01:11:16.780 --> 01:11:22.900]   You get to hear the story about how the Soviets started to divert too much of their money
[01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:28.860]   and resources into this rocket program when it suddenly became a matter of national prestige.
[01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:33.700]   You do hear about von Braun, about how, after the war, there were whole units that were
[01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:38.660]   just doing nothing but scooping up every piece of Nazi rocket technology and every Nazi
[01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:41.980]   rocket expert they can no matter what their pedigree was, no matter what their politics
[01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:48.060]   were because they became huge national resources for the defense program.
[01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:50.980]   Not only that, but the politics, the engineering.
[01:11:50.980 --> 01:11:55.860]   I think when it comes to reading history, I think it's always a lot more fulfilling to
[01:11:55.860 --> 01:12:00.180]   choose that one narrow window and focus on it so you get the entire picture of the world
[01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:05.620]   that existed during that time as opposed to some of the broader histories where you just
[01:12:05.620 --> 01:12:09.620]   have enough time to say, well, they had the chief designer, then the chief designer died
[01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:15.300]   on the operating table and that with him went the all the Soviets hopes for lunar exploration.
[01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:17.180]   They're like, wait, wait, what about the chief designer?
[01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:26.020]   Anyway, in 1970, I've only read bits and pieces of it's, I'm sorry.
[01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:27.020]   I can't wait to.
[01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:31.620]   I've only read bits and pieces of it through reviews, but it sounds like the sort of book
[01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:32.620]   that's right at my alley.
[01:12:32.620 --> 01:12:36.780]   Also, the reviewers that I've read seem to think that it has a nice mixture of technical
[01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:40.100]   detail and making it into a clear picture.
[01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:43.300]   So that's the next one up on my list after I finished The Big Burn, I think.
[01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:46.220]   Red Moon Rising Sputnik in the Hidden Rivals that excited us.
[01:12:46.220 --> 01:12:49.620]   Also the influence of the audio book says that the reader has a Russian accent.
[01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:50.620]   Let's hear.
[01:12:50.620 --> 01:12:52.540]   Which is probably exactly right for the channel.
[01:12:52.540 --> 01:12:56.940]   Stronsky is a narrator.
[01:12:56.940 --> 01:12:58.580]   It sounds like moose and squiddle when I say it that way.
[01:12:58.580 --> 01:13:03.780]   Under the command of SS group and furor Hans Kamler suddenly heard a sound like the cracking
[01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:04.780]   of a giant whip.
[01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:05.780]   Okay, maybe.
[01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:06.780]   Then you.
[01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:08.180]   Well, he has a slightly Russia accent.
[01:13:08.180 --> 01:13:09.980]   The rocket had just broken the sound barrier.
[01:13:09.980 --> 01:13:10.980]   He sounds good.
[01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:12.780]   And it was still accelerating.
[01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:15.020]   Outrunning its own blast wave.
[01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:16.780]   That's a 25 seconds.
[01:13:16.780 --> 01:13:18.060]   Oh, I love this stuff.
[01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:19.060]   That's a voice I need.
[01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:20.780]   I need for my Apple is angry Russian.
[01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:21.780]   Angry Russian.
[01:13:21.780 --> 01:13:22.780]   I have Scottish woman.
[01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:27.660]   What do you mean for your you have you know like voices you can buy Scottish woman.
[01:13:27.660 --> 01:13:29.420]   I have a Scottish woman.
[01:13:29.420 --> 01:13:33.020]   Robert, Robert Ebert, Ebert's his voice sounds like him.
[01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:37.860]   Well, I know, but I went to the company who makes it and they sell all these you can you
[01:13:37.860 --> 01:13:41.820]   can buy other and I thought it would be fun to have a Scottish woman read read me the news
[01:13:41.820 --> 01:13:45.140]   and it was but I can't understand what you're saying.
[01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:52.860]   So it was really really fun.
[01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:55.060]   We'll fucking huge.
[01:13:55.060 --> 01:14:00.300]   Well, I had have voices to that's the question.
[01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:01.300]   Yeah.
[01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:02.660]   It doesn't have a speaker.
[01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:05.380]   No, well, we know that it has text to speech.
[01:14:05.380 --> 01:14:11.300]   We don't know yet whether that's a system level resource that developers will have immediate
[01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:14.660]   access to it does you can speak anything that's written on the on the bad.
[01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:19.740]   I don't know if it's going to be like the text that speech features that are on the
[01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:23.500]   Mac OS where it's just a resource you can install your own voices and do all kinds of
[01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:24.500]   fun stuff like that.
[01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:29.860]   You'd have to put speakers on it though right Andy because it doesn't have speakers.
[01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:33.780]   You'd have to have a good way of listening to it like maybe probably you'd want if you're
[01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:36.820]   going to be doing it that way you'd probably want to have Bluetooth speakers plugged in
[01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:39.860]   but it has it just got some.
[01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:43.220]   Unfortunately, you know, I'm not going to buy the adok.
[01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:46.660]   I'm going to just use a Bluetooth keyboard the Apple Bluetooth keyboard with it.
[01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:49.300]   Yeah, that's that's that's a 2DP.
[01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:52.860]   You could use any Bluetooth audio device.
[01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:55.620]   You know what that means I can use it in the car.
[01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:57.340]   It'll work with my Ford sync.
[01:14:57.340 --> 01:14:59.740]   Well, see that's that's something that I really, really want.
[01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:01.660]   I want the I want the dashboard mounted.
[01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:06.380]   I want the absolute ultimate car dash app for any mobile device anywhere.
[01:15:06.380 --> 01:15:07.380]   Right.
[01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:08.380]   This thing.
[01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:09.380]   Yeah.
[01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:15.340]   And yes, I'll be it'll light up the interior of my car like a like a like a like a magnesium
[01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:16.340]   flare.
[01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:19.300]   But that's that's a that's a small price to pay.
[01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:23.740]   Don't you think they'll be a new a new ticket designation for the California highway patrol
[01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:24.740]   glowing.
[01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:26.420]   Well, sorry, it does have a built-in speaker.
[01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:28.260]   Every time someone tells me does it speak.
[01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:29.980]   I always think yeah.
[01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:33.300]   Oh, yeah, built your microphone built in speaker.
[01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:34.780]   Oh, I didn't realize that.
[01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:36.180]   That can't be very good speaker.
[01:15:36.180 --> 01:15:40.100]   See, unfortunately, I'm at that horrible point in which I know enough to be confident about
[01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:41.300]   what I know about the iPad.
[01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:44.820]   I don't know enough to be absolutely arrogant and immediate when someone tells me something
[01:15:44.820 --> 01:15:46.300]   that I don't believe is true.
[01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:48.300]   It's like I know.
[01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:49.300]   So we ignore Leo.
[01:15:49.300 --> 01:15:50.300]   He knows nothing.
[01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:51.300]   So let's hear this.
[01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:52.540]   Let's hear the Scottish lady.
[01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:56.500]   So we're going to hear a little little Scottish lady.
[01:15:56.500 --> 01:16:01.460]   So you can buy these, but not from Apple.
[01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:06.060]   My name is Mrs. David Traggin.
[01:16:06.060 --> 01:16:07.060]   I heard her.
[01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:13.620]   All new boxes found 3,680 matches for search messages table.
[01:16:13.620 --> 01:16:14.620]   It's a Scottish company.
[01:16:14.620 --> 01:16:16.620]   I think that they did it.
[01:16:16.620 --> 01:16:17.620]   I had a text window.
[01:16:17.620 --> 01:16:18.620]   And I was booked for you.
[01:16:18.620 --> 01:16:19.620]   I was booked for you.
[01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:20.620]   I was booked for you.
[01:16:20.620 --> 01:16:21.620]   I was booked for you.
[01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:22.620]   I was booked for you.
[01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:23.620]   You've been doing it for the two people.
[01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:24.620]   Hey, wait a minute.
[01:16:24.620 --> 01:16:26.620]   They have a live demo on the website.
[01:16:26.620 --> 01:16:27.620]   Eventually.
[01:16:27.620 --> 01:16:31.900]   That's like a real person.
[01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:34.140]   I'm going to be the man who wakes up next to you.
[01:16:34.140 --> 01:16:35.140]   All right.
[01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:36.140]   Now let me see.
[01:16:36.140 --> 01:16:37.140]   They have a lot of different voices.
[01:16:37.140 --> 01:16:38.140]   They have lots of them.
[01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:39.140]   They don't have angry Russians.
[01:16:39.140 --> 01:16:40.140]   Is this the one?
[01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:41.500]   Yeah, that's it.
[01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:42.500]   So Heather.
[01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:44.980]   Do you think that English actor would have had him?
[01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:45.980]   I have had him.
[01:16:45.980 --> 01:16:46.980]   You're not seeing a movie.
[01:16:46.980 --> 01:16:47.980]   Sculptish English.
[01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:48.980]   I did that really badly.
[01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:50.140]   Sorry, but let me.
[01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:51.140]   So text box.
[01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:52.140]   How do I do this?
[01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:53.700]   You see the play button.
[01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:57.540]   But I want to type something in the box.
[01:16:57.540 --> 01:16:58.900]   This is not a live demo.
[01:16:58.900 --> 01:16:59.900]   Oh, I see.
[01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:01.900]   You have to download the live demo bar.
[01:17:01.900 --> 01:17:02.900]   No, no, here it is.
[01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:03.900]   No, here it is.
[01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:04.900]   Here it is.
[01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:05.900]   All right.
[01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:06.900]   Let's see.
[01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:09.900]   And then you can decide who you want it to be over next to it.
[01:17:09.900 --> 01:17:11.900]   All right.
[01:17:11.900 --> 01:17:13.060]   Let's see if I say that.
[01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:15.700]   If I sound like fat bastard, here we go.
[01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:17.500]   So oh, look, there's Irish.
[01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:19.220]   There's a lot of them there.
[01:17:19.220 --> 01:17:21.260]   Black country.
[01:17:21.260 --> 01:17:22.260]   What is that?
[01:17:22.260 --> 01:17:23.260]   Okay.
[01:17:23.260 --> 01:17:24.260]   Synthesizing.
[01:17:24.260 --> 01:17:25.260]   Catch them.
[01:17:25.260 --> 01:17:26.260]   My Bailey, baby.
[01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:27.260]   All right.
[01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:33.620]   What else could I what?
[01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:36.180]   So what is so these are a bunch of great Britain.
[01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:37.820]   We'll go down further.
[01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:38.820]   Sounds.
[01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:41.260]   Here's German.
[01:17:41.260 --> 01:17:42.260]   This is fun.
[01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:44.060]   Get in the blue belly, baby.
[01:17:44.060 --> 01:17:46.900]   Oh, this is good.
[01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:47.900]   Southern male.
[01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:48.900]   Southern.
[01:17:48.900 --> 01:17:50.100]   You mean American Southern?
[01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:51.100]   Try it.
[01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:53.820]   Where's it going to be?
[01:17:53.820 --> 01:17:55.580]   Captain my Bailey, baby.
[01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:57.900]   It's like my enthusiasm.
[01:17:57.900 --> 01:17:59.900]   My library.
[01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:05.980]   I have this like 1904 like theater training book on how to do like perfect regional dialects.
[01:18:05.980 --> 01:18:07.980]   And this is this one.
[01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:11.540]   That's why I'm flashing back to that book right now.
[01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:13.540]   No need any longer with this website.
[01:18:13.540 --> 01:18:14.740]   Yeah, this is this is great.
[01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:17.260]   We can learn all the dialects by synthesis.
[01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:18.260]   This is Irish.
[01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:20.260]   That the Alabama copenta.
[01:18:20.260 --> 01:18:21.260]   That's an extra.
[01:18:21.260 --> 01:18:22.260]   Made in road rise.
[01:18:22.260 --> 01:18:23.260]   Up to meet you.
[01:18:23.260 --> 01:18:24.260]   You fat bastard.
[01:18:24.260 --> 01:18:25.340]   Oh, that's good.
[01:18:25.340 --> 01:18:26.340]   I like Caitlin.
[01:18:26.340 --> 01:18:27.340]   She's got spirit.
[01:18:27.340 --> 01:18:28.340]   Anyway, sorry.
[01:18:28.340 --> 01:18:29.340]   C-E-R-E-P-R-O-C.
[01:18:29.340 --> 01:18:31.340]   And you can buy them.
[01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:33.340]   Yeah, they're $45.
[01:18:33.340 --> 01:18:34.340]   Wow.
[01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:35.340]   Mm.
[01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:36.340]   That's kind of pricey.
[01:18:36.340 --> 01:18:38.340]   But it's fun.
[01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:40.820]   It was a test.
[01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:43.740]   I took one for the, you know, for the team.
[01:18:43.740 --> 01:18:47.180]   Let's get your pick of the week as long as I got you on the screen here.
[01:18:47.180 --> 01:18:48.620]   Alex, my pick for the week.
[01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:49.620]   Okay.
[01:18:49.620 --> 01:18:50.620]   So this is a professional.
[01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:51.620]   I have two picks.
[01:18:51.620 --> 01:18:52.620]   One for my iPhone.
[01:18:52.620 --> 01:18:53.620]   That's more general.
[01:18:53.620 --> 01:19:01.420]   That's my software pick for the week is just a really, really great, well-written application.
[01:19:01.420 --> 01:19:05.260]   So it's by Tweak Software.
[01:19:05.260 --> 01:19:06.860]   And it's TweakSoftware.com.
[01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:08.300]   And it's called RV.
[01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:09.500]   Now here's the thing.
[01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:12.980]   These are guys that used to work at ILM doing heavy R&D.
[01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:18.900]   Then before that they were working at Alias and at Wavefront, I think Wavefront, I believe.
[01:19:18.900 --> 01:19:24.500]   Anyway, and these guys have just incredible amounts of experience with architecture.
[01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:28.460]   And what they did is they built a replay system, a system that you can sit on and when you're
[01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:30.540]   working on a set, or not even on a shot.
[01:19:30.540 --> 01:19:32.020]   When you're working on a shot.
[01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:33.340]   I mean, it's not a video tab.
[01:19:33.340 --> 01:19:35.180]   It's for when you're working on actual shots.
[01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:36.180]   I don't mean that.
[01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:37.180]   I was thinking of something else.
[01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:40.580]   So the, when you're working on a shot and you want to give feedback, so you want to
[01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:46.260]   have two people in different places, they theoretically could be in different buildings.
[01:19:46.260 --> 01:19:49.700]   But really, like if, you know, if I'm at ILM and I'm in building A and someone else is
[01:19:49.700 --> 01:19:53.980]   in building D, but we want to have a discussion and talk about it, or we want to, you know,
[01:19:53.980 --> 01:19:55.580]   look at stuff and replay it for daily.
[01:19:55.580 --> 01:20:01.100]   This is something that a lot of companies doing any kind of visual effects work, video
[01:20:01.100 --> 01:20:04.260]   work, you need to have some kind of feedback software.
[01:20:04.260 --> 01:20:10.020]   And this is the most amazingly well-written, stable, incredibly, like thinking about all
[01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:14.020]   the little things that you would need as a company to put this stuff together.
[01:20:14.020 --> 01:20:18.780]   And so it is, and it's just really written by production guys for production people.
[01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:22.540]   And so what RV lets you do is you can load up an image and I can load it up on my computer,
[01:20:22.540 --> 01:20:26.740]   Leo could load it up on his computer or someone in another building could load up it on their
[01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:27.740]   computer.
[01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:30.860]   When I hit play, it'll keep all the frames synced together.
[01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:35.540]   If I change the color corrections or circle things or change things, it'll show up on
[01:20:35.540 --> 01:20:37.140]   their computer as well.
[01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:38.820]   So both of these things are all synced up.
[01:20:38.820 --> 01:20:41.940]   I can, you know, be using different kind.
[01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:44.900]   They could be using a quick time preview and I could be using looking at the film plates
[01:20:44.900 --> 01:20:49.420]   and it would keep all the color, you know, scientifically connected to each other.
[01:20:49.420 --> 01:20:52.660]   It's kind of like go to meeting for video editors.
[01:20:52.660 --> 01:20:53.660]   Exactly.
[01:20:53.660 --> 01:20:58.340]   This is the, and it's 300 bucks and it is, it is the go to meeting for visual, I never
[01:20:58.340 --> 01:21:02.060]   thought of it that way, but it's the go to meeting for visual effects people or for anyone
[01:21:02.060 --> 01:21:04.380]   doing kind of graphics, video, whatever.
[01:21:04.380 --> 01:21:06.980]   And it is astoundingly well-written.
[01:21:06.980 --> 01:21:09.660]   I mean, it's over-engineered, way over-engineered.
[01:21:09.660 --> 01:21:15.500]   When I sat down, I used to work with one of the guys that, that, uh, Seth Rosenthal and
[01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:18.260]   I mean, I had played with it.
[01:21:18.260 --> 01:21:19.340]   I was like, well, it's pretty cool.
[01:21:19.340 --> 01:21:21.340]   And then he showed me what it really could do.
[01:21:21.340 --> 01:21:24.980]   And it is the playback is, is, is incredibly smooth.
[01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:29.780]   The connection is incredibly smooth and it's just, this is a little bit of a pro thing,
[01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:33.700]   but I just feel like it's such a great example of a well-written app.
[01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:38.860]   And so on the high end, it's 300 bucks, as I said, about half an Alex, on the high end,
[01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:39.860]   that was my, my pick.
[01:21:39.860 --> 01:21:44.420]   My other on the different end of the pick on my iPod, iPod is another example of a really
[01:21:44.420 --> 01:21:50.900]   well-written app that, uh, that I just, I just, I'm just very happy with.
[01:21:50.900 --> 01:21:55.540]   Uh, and that is, it's, so I needed to get, I needed to work out, I needed to find a workout
[01:21:55.540 --> 01:21:56.780]   that I can do in the hotel room.
[01:21:56.780 --> 01:21:57.780]   That's been my problem.
[01:21:57.780 --> 01:22:00.380]   Like four or five minutes in the morning or ten minutes in the morning, it has to be
[01:22:00.380 --> 01:22:01.660]   something quick and I get in the shape.
[01:22:01.660 --> 01:22:04.140]   So I started doing Google, this is what I was talking about, Google Tabat.
[01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:07.620]   Oh, it's, Google, short workouts and then saw Tabata.
[01:22:07.620 --> 01:22:09.380]   And Tabata is four minutes of hell.
[01:22:09.380 --> 01:22:10.380]   Oh, I like it.
[01:22:10.380 --> 01:22:11.380]   And your sore.
[01:22:11.380 --> 01:22:12.380]   I could do anything.
[01:22:12.380 --> 01:22:13.380]   No, no, no.
[01:22:13.380 --> 01:22:14.380]   Well, that's the whole thing is that's my whole thing.
[01:22:14.380 --> 01:22:15.380]   I can do anything for four minutes.
[01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:18.740]   And so what it does is you do 20 seconds hard workout and then you wait 10 seconds.
[01:22:18.740 --> 01:22:21.020]   Then you do 20 more seconds and then so do wait 10 seconds.
[01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:23.140]   This is a well-known workout.
[01:22:23.140 --> 01:22:26.900]   It was designed by a Japanese, uh, speed skating coach.
[01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:31.260]   So it's, and it's been around for a while, but I've seen research that this intense,
[01:22:31.260 --> 01:22:34.140]   interval workout is the, is, it gets more done in less times.
[01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:36.380]   Well, in your body, it feels like it's been beaten for half an hour.
[01:22:36.380 --> 01:22:37.380]   I think it's still working.
[01:22:37.380 --> 01:22:39.380]   Like it's as if you were biking for the next half hour.
[01:22:39.380 --> 01:22:40.660]   So which one do you recommend?
[01:22:40.660 --> 01:22:43.300]   So here's the deal is I got Tabata Pro.
[01:22:43.300 --> 01:22:46.900]   And what I love about it is it's super clear.
[01:22:46.900 --> 01:22:48.540]   So this is, this is the taba.
[01:22:48.540 --> 01:22:49.540]   Can you see it here?
[01:22:49.540 --> 01:22:50.540]   Yeah.
[01:22:50.540 --> 01:22:51.540]   There you go.
[01:22:51.540 --> 01:22:53.700]   It's super clear because what happens is you're going to set this down and you're going
[01:22:53.700 --> 01:22:57.060]   to hit go and you've got a pair of weights that you're going to swing around for, for
[01:22:57.060 --> 01:22:58.060]   four minutes.
[01:22:58.060 --> 01:22:59.420]   And it is super clear.
[01:22:59.420 --> 01:23:00.420]   It's super simple.
[01:23:00.420 --> 01:23:01.420]   I don't have to learn.
[01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:02.420]   I don't have to figure anything out.
[01:23:02.420 --> 01:23:04.420]   It works exactly as advertised.
[01:23:04.420 --> 01:23:06.060]   It's just, it's not a complicated app.
[01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:07.940]   I think this is a great example for people developing.
[01:23:07.940 --> 01:23:12.140]   It's just, but it's a timer that's built for this and it, and it does 20 seconds on,
[01:23:12.140 --> 01:23:15.820]   20 seconds off, 20 seconds on, 20 seconds on, 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, but it gives
[01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:19.220]   you, and it's, it just like it gives you the little countdown and it tells you three,
[01:23:19.220 --> 01:23:20.220]   two, one, go.
[01:23:20.220 --> 01:23:22.220]   You know, and you're like, go, go, go, go, go.
[01:23:22.220 --> 01:23:26.380]   And it's just, you know, and as had not complicated, probably someone who knew what they were
[01:23:26.380 --> 01:23:30.660]   doing, wrote this in a weekend kind of thing.
[01:23:30.660 --> 01:23:32.060]   And give you audio cues too.
[01:23:32.060 --> 01:23:33.060]   So I could.
[01:23:33.060 --> 01:23:34.060]   It does.
[01:23:34.060 --> 01:23:35.060]   So you can have your music playing and then you'll hear a cue.
[01:23:35.060 --> 01:23:37.300]   You totally, I don't know if it does it over top of the music.
[01:23:37.300 --> 01:23:39.420]   I imagine your music sits playing your music in the background.
[01:23:39.420 --> 01:23:40.980]   I just set it down in front of me and hit it.
[01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:41.980]   It's a four minutes.
[01:23:41.980 --> 01:23:42.980]   It's one song.
[01:23:42.980 --> 01:23:45.620]   I guess I could do that, but it's, you know, the thing is, is it's, it is, you just do
[01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:46.620]   four minutes.
[01:23:46.620 --> 01:23:47.620]   How many times a day though?
[01:23:47.620 --> 01:23:48.620]   Once.
[01:23:48.620 --> 01:23:49.620]   That's what?
[01:23:49.620 --> 01:23:50.620]   Hey, I can barely.
[01:23:50.620 --> 01:23:51.620]   You're working as four minutes a day.
[01:23:51.620 --> 01:23:52.620]   I did that.
[01:23:52.620 --> 01:23:53.620]   I started doing this this week and I'm still broken.
[01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:54.620]   And what do you do?
[01:23:54.620 --> 01:23:55.620]   That's all I do.
[01:23:55.620 --> 01:23:56.620]   You swing kettlebells.
[01:23:56.620 --> 01:23:57.620]   What do you do?
[01:23:57.620 --> 01:23:59.420]   No, I do, I do, I use the dumbbells.
[01:23:59.420 --> 01:24:01.300]   And I have them on 20 pounds.
[01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:05.740]   And you do basically like a, you start, it's, it's not a cleaning jerk, but I can't think
[01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:06.740]   of what they call it.
[01:24:06.740 --> 01:24:09.980]   It's like a, you, you start kneeling with your dumbbells on either side of you.
[01:24:09.980 --> 01:24:10.980]   Yeah.
[01:24:10.980 --> 01:24:11.980]   You come up and put them over your head and bring them down.
[01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:12.980]   It's like a clean shirt.
[01:24:12.980 --> 01:24:13.980]   It's like a dress.
[01:24:13.980 --> 01:24:16.660]   Like a, like a, like a, it's like a full, it's like a squat press, you know, where you
[01:24:16.660 --> 01:24:18.900]   and you do that and you do it for how long?
[01:24:18.900 --> 01:24:20.300]   20 seconds, four minutes.
[01:24:20.300 --> 01:24:22.460]   20 seconds on, 10 seconds off.
[01:24:22.460 --> 01:24:23.460]   Yeah.
[01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:25.260]   And, and you, you will feel it the next day.
[01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:26.260]   Yeah, you'll feel it.
[01:24:26.260 --> 01:24:29.620]   I have to say, you know, so, because my, my workout has kind of, the lean-out ex is amazing,
[01:24:29.620 --> 01:24:32.180]   but an hour, I was having a hard time scheduling an hour.
[01:24:32.180 --> 01:24:35.940]   So now what I do is I talk on the phone, I sit on my, my stationary bike for about an
[01:24:35.940 --> 01:24:37.100]   hour every morning.
[01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:40.300]   So I get, I get my, you know, I get my kind of that and then I just, and I just whack
[01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:41.300]   this really hard.
[01:24:41.300 --> 01:24:44.900]   I'm telling you, I mean, you, you put a 15 or 20 pound weight on there and you do that
[01:24:44.900 --> 01:24:45.900]   for four minutes.
[01:24:45.900 --> 01:24:47.460]   It seems easy.
[01:24:47.460 --> 01:24:50.860]   And if you do it really hard, because you'd be ideas that you're working out full till.
[01:24:50.860 --> 01:24:53.500]   And by the way, I want to, oh, we have to do the disclaimer that we used to do for the
[01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:58.180]   show is that I recommend that you consult your physician.
[01:24:58.180 --> 01:25:02.060]   If you, you know, if you think that Tabata is cool, I'm recommending the application.
[01:25:02.060 --> 01:25:06.100]   I will say that if I had done this 50 pounds ago, I probably would have given myself a
[01:25:06.100 --> 01:25:07.180]   coronary.
[01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:11.140]   So it is, it's, it's much harder than it seems.
[01:25:11.140 --> 01:25:13.300]   And I'll sell your physician before doing Tabata.
[01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:19.340]   Yeah, but, but the, but the application is a great, is a great example of a, of a, just
[01:25:19.340 --> 01:25:20.980]   a really well-made app that's very focused.
[01:25:20.980 --> 01:25:21.980]   And this is exactly what I was talking about.
[01:25:21.980 --> 01:25:24.700]   I didn't know that Tabata existed until this weekend.
[01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:26.500]   And then I went and did a search and there's like 10 of them.
[01:25:26.500 --> 01:25:27.500]   Yeah, there's like 10 time or so.
[01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:28.660]   That's why I had to ask you which one.
[01:25:28.660 --> 01:25:29.660]   I bought them all.
[01:25:29.660 --> 01:25:30.660]   And this is the best.
[01:25:30.660 --> 01:25:32.460]   And I, I think I like this one the best.
[01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:33.460]   I find it the simplest.
[01:25:33.460 --> 01:25:35.180]   It's not that has the most features or anything else.
[01:25:35.180 --> 01:25:36.180]   It's simple to bother.
[01:25:36.180 --> 01:25:37.180]   That's exactly what I needed to do.
[01:25:37.180 --> 01:25:39.260]   It's a lot of pro to hammer.
[01:25:39.260 --> 01:25:40.260]   Anyway, that's it.
[01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:44.900]   20 seconds of work, 10 seconds rest, 10 seconds to prepare.
[01:25:44.900 --> 01:25:45.900]   And that's it.
[01:25:45.900 --> 01:25:46.900]   And you do that for four minutes.
[01:25:46.900 --> 01:25:47.900]   And you do it hard.
[01:25:47.900 --> 01:25:52.220]   If you do it hard and then you go sit down for one.
[01:25:52.220 --> 01:25:54.740]   And we're not recommending that you do that without consulting a physician.
[01:25:54.740 --> 01:25:55.740]   Yeah.
[01:25:55.740 --> 01:25:58.420]   You can't afford to lose any listeners.
[01:25:58.420 --> 01:26:02.060]   And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Christopher Breen, the Buffont of all knowledge will work
[01:26:02.060 --> 01:26:03.060]   out his hair.
[01:26:03.060 --> 01:26:04.060]   Yes.
[01:26:04.060 --> 01:26:09.460]   Here, here on my desk, I have a few thing, not the foam hot dog, but that's always good.
[01:26:09.460 --> 01:26:10.460]   Yeah, that's good.
[01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:12.300]   Is it a USB device?
[01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:16.180]   No, it's strictly analog.
[01:26:16.180 --> 01:26:24.460]   No, I have a, I have a Bowers and Wilkin MM1 set of stereo speakers.
[01:26:24.460 --> 01:26:26.460]   Now they make the Zeppelin.
[01:26:26.460 --> 01:26:27.460]   They make the Zeppelin.
[01:26:27.460 --> 01:26:30.460]   They also make some fabulous, real big speakers.
[01:26:30.460 --> 01:26:32.900]   And this is their first computer, computer speaker that they've made.
[01:26:32.900 --> 01:26:35.500]   I love, you know, I want to, but that's those are the big speakers I'm going to buy for
[01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:37.660]   my someday stereo system.
[01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:38.660]   Yeah.
[01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:39.660]   Yeah.
[01:26:39.660 --> 01:26:44.100]   I have a set of BMWs upstairs and they are, they're very odd looking from 20 years ago.
[01:26:44.100 --> 01:26:47.940]   They have a little hat on, but they sound amazingly good.
[01:26:47.940 --> 01:26:50.620]   These are their first desktop speakers they've ever made.
[01:26:50.620 --> 01:26:54.620]   They're not cheap at 500 bucks.
[01:26:54.620 --> 01:26:56.180]   They have no subwoofer.
[01:26:56.180 --> 01:27:00.500]   It's simply two satellites and they sound really, really good.
[01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:03.500]   There's a three inch woofer pointing down in here.
[01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:04.500]   There's a driver in here.
[01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:09.500]   There's some DSP functionality in here so that you can plug these things in via USB
[01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:12.300]   or get an analog input.
[01:27:12.300 --> 01:27:13.380]   Plug your headphones in.
[01:27:13.380 --> 01:27:17.980]   They sound fabulous because it's getting processed.
[01:27:17.980 --> 01:27:22.660]   Or I've been using some monsoon speakers for the longest time with a subwoofer on them.
[01:27:22.660 --> 01:27:25.620]   And I like that sound, that big, thumpy sound.
[01:27:25.620 --> 01:27:26.860]   So you're not going to get that.
[01:27:26.860 --> 01:27:30.580]   If you're a gamer and you're expecting these things to shake the building, they're not
[01:27:30.580 --> 01:27:31.980]   going to.
[01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:34.180]   But they're very clean.
[01:27:34.180 --> 01:27:36.020]   You get to hear everything that's in the music.
[01:27:36.020 --> 01:27:40.940]   I was listening to Abbey Road, the remastered stereo version.
[01:27:40.940 --> 01:27:42.660]   And I had no idea that it'd come together.
[01:27:42.660 --> 01:27:46.340]   There was a Moroccan part right dead center and I didn't hear it until I listened on
[01:27:46.340 --> 01:27:47.620]   these speakers.
[01:27:47.620 --> 01:27:48.620]   I like them a lot.
[01:27:48.620 --> 01:27:52.700]   They have a cool little remote control that looks like this for those of you at home and
[01:27:52.700 --> 01:27:55.180]   watching on video.
[01:27:55.180 --> 01:27:57.140]   And you can use it when you're connected through USB.
[01:27:57.140 --> 01:28:00.860]   You can use it to pause and play iTunes, control the volume, turn the thing on and off
[01:28:00.860 --> 01:28:03.020]   and mute the speakers.
[01:28:03.020 --> 01:28:04.020]   They sound wonderful.
[01:28:04.020 --> 01:28:10.780]   They've been out in Britain for, since the beginning of March, getting great reviews on
[01:28:10.780 --> 01:28:12.780]   the iTunes store there.
[01:28:12.780 --> 01:28:15.420]   They'll be coming out in this country in the next couple of weeks.
[01:28:15.420 --> 01:28:20.100]   Apple will have exclusive option to maintain these things.
[01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:24.500]   I think for 30 to 60 days and then you can get them from other outlets as well.
[01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:28.300]   So you say, even without a subwoofer, you feel like they give you good sound.
[01:28:28.300 --> 01:28:30.380]   They give great sound, but not thumpy.
[01:28:30.380 --> 01:28:31.380]   Not thumpy, obviously.
[01:28:31.380 --> 01:28:35.060]   Not thumpy, but they'll fill a room and also they're near field.
[01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:37.860]   So they're not the kind of thing you're going to put across the room and listen to.
[01:28:37.860 --> 01:28:42.860]   They sound fine if you do that, but really within about three to four feet, they focus
[01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:43.860]   beautifully.
[01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:47.620]   So if you use them as computer speakers, which is what they are, you'll get great sound
[01:28:47.620 --> 01:28:48.620]   on them.
[01:28:48.620 --> 01:28:49.620]   Wow.
[01:28:49.620 --> 01:28:50.620]   That's very tempting.
[01:28:50.620 --> 01:28:51.620]   They're very nice.
[01:28:51.620 --> 01:28:52.620]   It's pricey.
[01:28:52.620 --> 01:28:56.500]   I guess when you buy your 27 inch iMac, it kind of doesn't feel like, yeah.
[01:28:56.500 --> 01:29:01.220]   Yeah, you don't get field W speakers with the idea that you're going to save money.
[01:29:01.220 --> 01:29:02.220]   No.
[01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:03.500]   They're really quality engineered things.
[01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:09.700]   Yeah, I've been lusting after the 800 series speakers now for months waiting to buy.
[01:29:09.700 --> 01:29:14.900]   I just noticed that when I went there that they have a, this would be a good pick too.
[01:29:14.900 --> 01:29:20.540]   I'll try it, but they have a thing called Society of Sound where you can buy 24 bit
[01:29:20.540 --> 01:29:26.660]   flack versions of albums like the new Peter Gabriel album, which I just love.
[01:29:26.660 --> 01:29:34.500]   So you can buy from them a 24 bit version, super high quality version of this uncompressed,
[01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:37.220]   you know, flack compressed, unlessly compressed.
[01:29:37.220 --> 01:29:39.580]   You can also get Apple loss for all their stuff.
[01:29:39.580 --> 01:29:42.660]   And it's a, yeah, it's something you've set up with Peter Gabriel.
[01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:46.780]   So it's a lot of people from real world studios that are offering their music.
[01:29:46.780 --> 01:29:50.980]   So they say $60 a year and then you get a bunch of different albums.
[01:29:50.980 --> 01:29:51.980]   Yeah.
[01:29:51.980 --> 01:29:52.980]   Yeah.
[01:29:52.980 --> 01:29:56.780]   I've picked up about three or four albums from there and the quality is really good.
[01:29:56.780 --> 01:29:57.780]   Yeah.
[01:29:57.780 --> 01:29:59.860]   Because this is better than CD quality.
[01:29:59.860 --> 01:30:00.860]   Yeah.
[01:30:00.860 --> 01:30:01.860]   Yeah.
[01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:04.140]   And these are a lot of musicians you haven't heard of before that you're unlikely to be
[01:30:04.140 --> 01:30:08.460]   exposed to wonderful musicianship, the engineering is fabulous.
[01:30:08.460 --> 01:30:10.740]   And again, the encoding is just terrific.
[01:30:10.740 --> 01:30:16.380]   You know, Peter Gabriel is a perfect example of why big names don't need labels anymore.
[01:30:16.380 --> 01:30:19.500]   I guarantee he's making way more money doing what he's doing now.
[01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:23.580]   Oh, I think that that's also a signed album, the new album is a regular album.
[01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:24.580]   Is it?
[01:30:24.580 --> 01:30:25.580]   I don't think so.
[01:30:25.580 --> 01:30:26.580]   I think he's publishing it.
[01:30:26.580 --> 01:30:30.220]   I think he's publishing himself his last album wasn't his last album was completely self-published.
[01:30:30.220 --> 01:30:35.220]   Absolutely.
[01:30:35.220 --> 01:30:39.580]   I mean, the last two albums have both been Scratch My Back The New Album Is Brilliant.
[01:30:39.580 --> 01:30:40.580]   It's covers.
[01:30:40.580 --> 01:30:41.580]   It's Peter Gabriel.
[01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:42.580]   It's covers.
[01:30:42.580 --> 01:30:43.580]   It's not what you would think.
[01:30:43.580 --> 01:30:44.580]   Right.
[01:30:44.580 --> 01:30:45.580]   It's very different, but it's beautiful.
[01:30:45.580 --> 01:30:46.580]   I'll play some.
[01:30:46.580 --> 01:30:48.780]   Yeah, but everything is very slow.
[01:30:48.780 --> 01:30:49.780]   Slow.
[01:30:49.780 --> 01:30:54.060]   So if you're feeling a little down, it's not the kind of album that you want to put on.
[01:30:54.060 --> 01:30:55.060]   I'll play here.
[01:30:55.060 --> 01:30:56.060]   I'll play.
[01:30:56.060 --> 01:30:57.060]   They have some samples on here.
[01:30:57.060 --> 01:30:59.060]   I think heroes is great.
[01:30:59.060 --> 01:31:00.060]   I love all of these.
[01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:01.060]   I'll play.
[01:31:01.060 --> 01:31:02.780]   Yeah, it's cover of heroes is fabulous.
[01:31:02.780 --> 01:31:08.740]   Everybody knows the, everybody knows the Mike, the Paul Simon Boy and the Bubble from
[01:31:08.740 --> 01:31:09.740]   Graceland.
[01:31:09.740 --> 01:31:12.620]   This is his version of Boy and the Bubble.
[01:31:12.620 --> 01:31:17.140]   It's not what you, not what you heard before.
[01:31:17.140 --> 01:31:19.180]   And this is 24-bit coming to you.
[01:31:19.180 --> 01:31:26.620]   It's just dry wind and it swept across the desert and it curled into the circle of birds.
[01:31:26.620 --> 01:31:27.620]   It's just beautiful.
[01:31:27.620 --> 01:31:28.620]   I think it's a beautiful, here's heroes.
[01:31:28.620 --> 01:31:29.620]   Really?
[01:31:29.620 --> 01:31:30.620]   Spare.
[01:31:30.620 --> 01:31:31.620]   Yes, spare.
[01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:35.340]   Apparently he, I'm told that he recorded the voice tracks and then.
[01:31:35.340 --> 01:31:36.540]   Figured out what to do.
[01:31:36.540 --> 01:31:37.540]   Instrumentalized it.
[01:31:37.540 --> 01:31:38.540]   Yeah.
[01:31:38.540 --> 01:31:39.540]   I wish I could swim.
[01:31:39.540 --> 01:31:40.540]   Yeah, this is beautiful.
[01:31:40.540 --> 01:31:41.540]   You're right.
[01:31:41.540 --> 01:31:49.980]   I forgot about how it got to this.
[01:31:49.980 --> 01:31:51.980]   Like dolphins.
[01:31:51.980 --> 01:31:53.900]   It's not what you'd expect from Peter Gabriel.
[01:31:53.900 --> 01:31:55.780]   There's no, it definitely sounds like Peter Gabriel.
[01:31:55.780 --> 01:31:56.780]   It just does voice.
[01:31:56.780 --> 01:31:57.780]   Yeah, it's not what you'd expect.
[01:31:57.780 --> 01:31:58.780]   But there's no beat.
[01:31:58.780 --> 01:31:59.780]   There's no rhythm.
[01:31:59.780 --> 01:32:00.780]   No rhythm.
[01:32:00.780 --> 01:32:01.780]   Good pick.
[01:32:01.780 --> 01:32:02.780]   Thank you.
[01:32:02.780 --> 01:32:06.460]   Boy, that makes me want them badly.
[01:32:06.460 --> 01:32:10.540]   Mr. Andy Inoco, it is your turn to make me want something.
[01:32:10.540 --> 01:32:15.740]   Uh oh, you're, you, you've done been muted, Andrew.
[01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:16.740]   Unmute.
[01:32:16.740 --> 01:32:17.740]   Unmute.
[01:32:17.740 --> 01:32:21.140]   I was testing a feature of my pick of the week.
[01:32:21.140 --> 01:32:22.900]   Oh, just kidding.
[01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:24.980]   The sound sucker.
[01:32:24.980 --> 01:32:28.420]   It is a feature that makes noise and a feature that would make people listening.
[01:32:28.420 --> 01:32:31.500]   Think, gee, Andy's not even paying a chance into this.
[01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:32.500]   He's not preparing.
[01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:35.980]   Something he's going to be showing off later on.
[01:32:35.980 --> 01:32:40.620]   Because my pick of the week is something, an app that is not unfamiliar to many listeners
[01:32:40.620 --> 01:32:46.820]   is the MLB at bat 2010 app, which is a sign to me.
[01:32:46.820 --> 01:32:49.860]   That's like a sure sign of spring modern in modern life.
[01:32:49.860 --> 01:32:55.780]   The time when it comes for me to buy a new version of the MLB at bat app, just as a basic
[01:32:55.780 --> 01:33:01.340]   app, it is a fantastic thing if you are even a casual fan of baseball, because it is just
[01:33:01.340 --> 01:33:05.180]   a sort of a dashboard app that tells you everything that's going on in the league right
[01:33:05.180 --> 01:33:09.060]   now and everything that's going to be going on in baseball tonight.
[01:33:09.060 --> 01:33:13.460]   So and because this has a feature where you can tell what your favorite does, what your
[01:33:13.460 --> 01:33:17.780]   favorite team is, I can tell it to by the way, I'm particularly interested in events related
[01:33:17.780 --> 01:33:19.300]   to the Boston Red Sox.
[01:33:19.300 --> 01:33:24.260]   So that means that because I've set certain options properly, every time a game starts,
[01:33:24.260 --> 01:33:28.540]   I'll get a little alert in whatever app I'm using saying that, oh, by the way, socks
[01:33:28.540 --> 01:33:30.660]   are playing the Astros today at right now.
[01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:31.660]   They're starting up right now.
[01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:34.340]   When the game is over, I find out who won and who lost.
[01:33:34.340 --> 01:33:38.300]   If I'm interested, I tap a button and then I get just simple display that will show me
[01:33:38.300 --> 01:33:41.460]   play by play game by game exactly what's going on.
[01:33:41.460 --> 01:33:44.420]   Right now there's an a socks game going on, but I can see that the Braves are playing
[01:33:44.420 --> 01:33:50.700]   the Mets in the bottom of the eighth with the other runs hits errors, get a complete
[01:33:50.700 --> 01:33:51.700]   scoreboard.
[01:33:51.700 --> 01:33:58.180]   There is a really excellent feature though that they've added with this latest with the
[01:33:58.180 --> 01:34:02.780]   2010 edition that has slightly amazed a bunch of people.
[01:34:02.780 --> 01:34:09.660]   And it's already had always had the ability to play live live game audio.
[01:34:09.660 --> 01:34:14.580]   So if I hit the listen now button at the bottom of this game, it will it'll have access to
[01:34:14.580 --> 01:34:19.380]   let me see if I can increase this down here.
[01:34:19.380 --> 01:34:24.780]   So it will get sometimes not only the play by play from one local station, but also the
[01:34:24.780 --> 01:34:26.660]   local station or the opposing team.
[01:34:26.660 --> 01:34:27.660]   Yeah.
[01:34:27.660 --> 01:34:28.660]   Okay.
[01:34:28.660 --> 01:34:29.660]   Now watch this.
[01:34:29.660 --> 01:34:32.620]   It also has a quick time button at the top there.
[01:34:32.620 --> 01:34:39.140]   So if I tap the quick time button, it will stop playing it in its own like app based player
[01:34:39.140 --> 01:34:44.740]   and open open that same stream in Safari just as a playable stream.
[01:34:44.740 --> 01:34:47.340]   So right you can see it's launching Safari.
[01:34:47.340 --> 01:34:53.580]   It is now I tap this button to actually start playing it resume the playback within Safari.
[01:34:53.580 --> 01:34:55.500]   Will you get video?
[01:34:55.500 --> 01:34:58.980]   Hang on.
[01:34:58.980 --> 01:35:00.220]   And in a second the stream will start.
[01:35:00.220 --> 01:35:03.620]   Now the nice thing about Safari in the background is it continues to run the background, right?
[01:35:03.620 --> 01:35:04.620]   Exactly.
[01:35:04.620 --> 01:35:05.620]   That's what I mean.
[01:35:05.620 --> 01:35:13.460]   So if I hit the car, I can simply keep going and if I launch my GPS app, it still works.
[01:35:13.460 --> 01:35:14.460]   It still works.
[01:35:14.460 --> 01:35:15.460]   So I can listen to the game.
[01:35:15.460 --> 01:35:16.460]   That's awesome.
[01:35:16.460 --> 01:35:17.460]   Brilliant.
[01:35:17.460 --> 01:35:18.460]   Brilliant.
[01:35:18.460 --> 01:35:19.660]   The price went up a little bit.
[01:35:19.660 --> 01:35:21.220]   Used to be 10 bucks for the season now.
[01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:23.860]   It's 15 bucks for the season, but the excellent thing.
[01:35:23.860 --> 01:35:26.860]   Oh, wait, I'm rebroadcasting, contra-immeagally.
[01:35:26.860 --> 01:35:31.700]   Oh, God, you violated the single most important tenant in all of broadcasting.
[01:35:31.700 --> 01:35:36.540]   It's going to be our last Mac break week.
[01:35:36.540 --> 01:35:38.060]   We don't know what happened there.
[01:35:38.060 --> 01:35:41.300]   The other cool thing about it is that they do keep updating the app over the course of
[01:35:41.300 --> 01:35:42.300]   the season.
[01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:44.460]   So new features keep appearing.
[01:35:44.460 --> 01:35:48.340]   A lot of people are complaining that they're charging extra five bucks.
[01:35:48.340 --> 01:35:53.300]   Also if you subscribe to MLB.com, you can also get live game video, but that's something
[01:35:53.300 --> 01:35:56.620]   you have to have an extra subscription for and there's the usual app store complaint.
[01:35:56.620 --> 01:36:01.300]   So this should be really, this should be a free app and how come I have to pay?
[01:36:01.300 --> 01:36:04.180]   I have to pay extra to get the live video.
[01:36:04.180 --> 01:36:08.820]   But if you are in any way interested in baseball, not even saying if you have to be a fan of
[01:36:08.820 --> 01:36:14.260]   baseball, if you're even marginally interested in baseball, it's such cheap money because
[01:36:14.260 --> 01:36:20.340]   I don't have the amount of focus that's necessary to really keep on top of what my favorite
[01:36:20.340 --> 01:36:23.460]   teams are doing day by day, by day, game by game.
[01:36:23.460 --> 01:36:27.340]   But I can certainly, when I take my phone out of my pocket, see that, oh, okay, that's
[01:36:27.340 --> 01:36:28.340]   the result of that game.
[01:36:28.340 --> 01:36:34.220]   I know that the only flaw of this program is that it does inform you that if Red Sox are
[01:36:34.220 --> 01:36:38.780]   playing split squads, they did indeed lose both of their games on Sunday, that is a defect
[01:36:38.780 --> 01:36:40.580]   that I would like them to correct.
[01:36:40.580 --> 01:36:42.100]   Please only tell me when the Red Sox win.
[01:36:42.100 --> 01:36:46.740]   Do not tell me when they lose or at least don't tell me when they lose in an epic fashion.
[01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:51.300]   But there's so many times where you just want to keep get up to date a little bit.
[01:36:51.300 --> 01:36:55.460]   Last year, my dad and I do a lot of watch a lot of games together.
[01:36:55.460 --> 01:36:59.540]   The first question I come into visit him with the Sox playing tonight.
[01:36:59.540 --> 01:37:03.340]   And of course, I just simply get out MLB.com, tap one button.
[01:37:03.340 --> 01:37:04.740]   I know exactly what's going on tonight.
[01:37:04.740 --> 01:37:05.740]   So I know that great.
[01:37:05.740 --> 01:37:06.740]   We'll have dinner in.
[01:37:06.740 --> 01:37:08.580]   We will watch the game on Nessin tonight.
[01:37:08.580 --> 01:37:10.180]   And that's going to be our schedule for the entire evening.
[01:37:10.180 --> 01:37:13.420]   And you find the audio on 3G works fine.
[01:37:13.420 --> 01:37:15.300]   The audio on 3G works fine.
[01:37:15.300 --> 01:37:16.460]   It's not great.
[01:37:16.460 --> 01:37:21.900]   Also, it can be a little bit spotty, not because the app is a bad app, but because you're talking
[01:37:21.900 --> 01:37:26.340]   about streaming a streaming audio over the internet, which has its own variables and
[01:37:26.340 --> 01:37:30.060]   then streaming audio over 3G, which also has its own variables.
[01:37:30.060 --> 01:37:33.620]   But if you are in a static location, like here in the office, that's absolutely not
[01:37:33.620 --> 01:37:35.980]   going to be a problem streaming this over 3G.
[01:37:35.980 --> 01:37:38.340]   Even when you're driving, you might drop a connection.
[01:37:38.340 --> 01:37:42.100]   You might drop the dropout for one moment or another.
[01:37:42.100 --> 01:37:45.220]   But I find that at least in New England where I have really, really good coverage, I have
[01:37:45.220 --> 01:37:49.660]   no problem going from site to site and driving a whole half hour, 45 minutes and listening
[01:37:49.660 --> 01:37:51.420]   to game audio as I go.
[01:37:51.420 --> 01:37:55.900]   And the last thing is, it's just such a well designed app.
[01:37:55.900 --> 01:37:59.340]   It is available also for the Blackberry and for the platforms.
[01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:01.580]   But this is a Mac oriented show, isn't it?
[01:38:01.580 --> 01:38:05.380]   I've just put it on my Android just because somebody said it is on the Android and it
[01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:06.380]   is in fact.
[01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:07.380]   So that's pretty cool.
[01:38:07.380 --> 01:38:08.380]   Yeah.
[01:38:08.380 --> 01:38:09.380]   And they just came up with the Blackberry version.
[01:38:09.380 --> 01:38:13.340]   So you know that this is an app where they're getting a lot of, it's not just something
[01:38:13.340 --> 01:38:17.620]   they're doing as an experiment for one season, that this is a big part of their ongoing
[01:38:17.620 --> 01:38:18.620]   business.
[01:38:18.620 --> 01:38:21.460]   Maybe what their iPad app is going to look like.
[01:38:21.460 --> 01:38:25.020]   But just came back to what I was going to say that I love the fact that this is so well
[01:38:25.020 --> 01:38:26.020]   designed.
[01:38:26.020 --> 01:38:30.460]   This is one of those, if you're doing a seminar on how to design an iPhone app.
[01:38:30.460 --> 01:38:31.460]   It's just gorgeous.
[01:38:31.460 --> 01:38:32.460]   This is such exactly.
[01:38:32.460 --> 01:38:37.380]   It's not only, it puts a huge amount of information in one screen, yet it never seems cluttered.
[01:38:37.380 --> 01:38:40.940]   It always is highlighting, putting your eye exactly where it should go.
[01:38:40.940 --> 01:38:45.500]   And with the toolbars at the top and the bottom, without being cluttered, you're never really
[01:38:45.500 --> 01:38:49.100]   lost as to what you need to tap to get to where you want to go.
[01:38:49.100 --> 01:38:51.020]   So this is just a fine, fine app.
[01:38:51.020 --> 01:38:53.420]   But I'm happy to give them 15 bucks a year for this.
[01:38:53.420 --> 01:38:56.900]   And I might become a baseball fan once again with this thing.
[01:38:56.900 --> 01:38:57.900]   That's great.
[01:38:57.900 --> 01:38:59.740]   Even, can you pick your favorite team?
[01:38:59.740 --> 01:39:00.740]   I can pick my favorite team.
[01:39:00.740 --> 01:39:03.500]   Did you tell what your favorite team is?
[01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:06.740]   Even if it's one of those teams that you really shouldn't be following because they're
[01:39:06.740 --> 01:39:08.900]   all money-grubbing bastards.
[01:39:08.900 --> 01:39:11.060]   But like the Yankees maybe?
[01:39:11.060 --> 01:39:12.060]   I didn't say anything.
[01:39:12.060 --> 01:39:13.060]   Yes.
[01:39:13.060 --> 01:39:15.740]   You can define multiple favorite teams.
[01:39:15.740 --> 01:39:18.700]   So for instance, I just have the Red Sox in mind.
[01:39:18.700 --> 01:39:22.180]   But if I wanted to have my favorite national league teams added to that list, I can just
[01:39:22.180 --> 01:39:23.740]   add this list.
[01:39:23.740 --> 01:39:29.300]   I have nostalgia for the Cubs, so I've just added the Cubs to my list.
[01:39:29.300 --> 01:39:31.780]   So I'll be finding out every time that they lose.
[01:39:31.780 --> 01:39:34.700]   You can also change priorities.
[01:39:34.700 --> 01:39:37.900]   It's a very, very nicely done thing.
[01:39:37.900 --> 01:39:39.180]   You can also turn off.
[01:39:39.180 --> 01:39:41.500]   I've got notifications here.
[01:39:41.500 --> 01:39:45.700]   And so you can easily turn on and off a bunch of different features.
[01:39:45.700 --> 01:39:50.100]   So for instance, you can tell it to-- I've just turned notifications back on.
[01:39:50.100 --> 01:39:54.100]   So for the Boston Red Sox, I can tell it that I just want to know what the-- don't tell
[01:39:54.100 --> 01:39:56.020]   me when game starting or ending.
[01:39:56.020 --> 01:39:58.020]   Just tell me what the final score is when the game--
[01:39:58.020 --> 01:39:59.020]   That's cool.
[01:39:59.020 --> 01:40:00.020]   I like that.
[01:40:00.020 --> 01:40:01.020]   --school.
[01:40:01.020 --> 01:40:04.260]   Or you can even just tell it-- if it's like a playoff game or if they're Sox or playing
[01:40:04.260 --> 01:40:07.820]   the Yankees, you can have it just every time there is an event.
[01:40:07.820 --> 01:40:10.060]   Every time there's a run score, let me know about it.
[01:40:10.060 --> 01:40:13.220]   Or every time there's an event or a new game video, let me know about it.
[01:40:13.220 --> 01:40:18.700]   And you can be as-- so that could be the most fun you've ever had when your spouse or mother
[01:40:18.700 --> 01:40:22.100]   has forced you to go to a family wedding instead of watching a really great game on
[01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:23.100]   TV.
[01:40:23.100 --> 01:40:26.540]   Because you'll be-- as long as you're discreet with the headset, you'll definitely be plugged
[01:40:26.540 --> 01:40:28.620]   into the game for the entire--
[01:40:28.620 --> 01:40:29.980]   And then you can go to the wedding.
[01:40:29.980 --> 01:40:31.700]   And then right after that, you can go to the divorce.
[01:40:31.700 --> 01:40:32.700]   Yeah.
[01:40:32.700 --> 01:40:37.780]   And now when the teacher takes away your transistor radio, she's taking your iPhone.
[01:40:37.780 --> 01:40:39.620]   She takes my son's iPhone away.
[01:40:39.620 --> 01:40:40.620]   She?
[01:40:40.620 --> 01:40:41.620]   Yeah.
[01:40:41.620 --> 01:40:42.620]   My son uses his iPhone.
[01:40:42.620 --> 01:40:43.620]   He's just Google.
[01:40:43.620 --> 01:40:44.620]   He's Google and he's been doing that.
[01:40:44.620 --> 01:40:45.620]   Yeah, sure he is.
[01:40:45.620 --> 01:40:49.300]   Hey, my pick is something that I should have picked a long time ago, who do any seven who
[01:40:49.300 --> 01:40:54.060]   is in our chat room is an iPhone developer and has updated the Twit app.
[01:40:54.060 --> 01:40:55.140]   So this is a free app.
[01:40:55.140 --> 01:40:56.900]   You can get it from the App Store.
[01:40:56.900 --> 01:40:57.900]   It's a great Twit.
[01:40:57.900 --> 01:40:58.900]   It is really great.
[01:40:58.900 --> 01:40:59.900]   It's so good.
[01:40:59.900 --> 01:41:01.740]   And the other one is even better.
[01:41:01.740 --> 01:41:06.260]   And I think this is probably a step in his development towards the iPad app.
[01:41:06.260 --> 01:41:09.060]   It allows you to listen in real time.
[01:41:09.060 --> 01:41:11.460]   In fact, you could see we're going right now.
[01:41:11.460 --> 01:41:13.300]   We're on Twit.
[01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:15.580]   You can also chat while you listen.
[01:41:15.580 --> 01:41:19.060]   It'll log you right into the web-based version of our chat.
[01:41:19.060 --> 01:41:21.020]   And that's giving you the log of the IRC?
[01:41:21.020 --> 01:41:22.020]   Yeah.
[01:41:22.020 --> 01:41:23.020]   That's the IRC chat.
[01:41:23.020 --> 01:41:25.260]   You see, my nickname is iPhone Leon.
[01:41:25.260 --> 01:41:28.060]   If I connect, I'll be right in the chat server.
[01:41:28.060 --> 01:41:31.340]   While you're listening, he's got some nice new features.
[01:41:31.340 --> 01:41:32.340]   By the way, there we are.
[01:41:32.340 --> 01:41:34.060]   There we are in chat.
[01:41:34.060 --> 01:41:38.900]   He's got some nice new features, including, I'm very happy to say, video.
[01:41:38.900 --> 01:41:43.100]   So here's the recent Twit audio, the audio archive.
[01:41:43.100 --> 01:41:46.100]   If you pick a show that has video, there'll be a video archive as well.
[01:41:46.100 --> 01:41:50.140]   So you can watch a downloadable video.
[01:41:50.140 --> 01:41:55.420]   There's bookmarks, of course, to all the shows and to ODTV, which tapes the shows.
[01:41:55.420 --> 01:41:58.500]   You can set your time zone and so forth.
[01:41:58.500 --> 01:42:03.420]   But if you go right here to the front page where it shows the current calendar of broadcasts
[01:42:03.420 --> 01:42:08.300]   and press the live video button, this does exactly what Andy was talking about, which
[01:42:08.300 --> 01:42:10.180]   launches a quick time streams.
[01:42:10.180 --> 01:42:15.460]   So it will continue to run in the background as you do anything else.
[01:42:15.460 --> 01:42:17.060]   Very nice job from Houdini7.
[01:42:17.060 --> 01:42:20.100]   We really appreciate Houdini7 doing this for us.
[01:42:20.100 --> 01:42:21.100]   Absolutely free.
[01:42:21.100 --> 01:42:25.260]   And as I said, even though I don't pay them, I think we're going to have to send this guy
[01:42:25.260 --> 01:42:28.180]   an iPad so he can develop on the iPad for us.
[01:42:28.180 --> 01:42:29.940]   He's sending me an email.
[01:42:29.940 --> 01:42:30.940]   ShiftkeySoftware.com.
[01:42:30.940 --> 01:42:31.940]   Okay.
[01:42:31.940 --> 01:42:32.940]   All right.
[01:42:32.940 --> 01:42:33.940]   ShiftkeySoftware.
[01:42:33.940 --> 01:42:34.940]   Yeah.
[01:42:34.940 --> 01:42:35.940]   Really nice.
[01:42:35.940 --> 01:42:39.060]   And by the way, I'm still in the chat room as iPhone Leo, so be kind, be nice.
[01:42:39.060 --> 01:42:41.820]   And we're still going through the old version of this.
[01:42:41.820 --> 01:42:43.820]   Now, that's one app.
[01:42:43.820 --> 01:42:47.820]   As long as we're talking about free apps, I mentioned that if they ever put FarmVille
[01:42:47.820 --> 01:42:50.940]   on the iPad or the iPhone, I'd be in deep trouble.
[01:42:50.940 --> 01:42:52.420]   Well, we're getting pretty close.
[01:42:52.420 --> 01:42:53.420]   This is from NewToy.
[01:42:53.420 --> 01:42:55.540]   This is a game called We Rule.
[01:42:55.540 --> 01:42:58.500]   And if you like FarmVille, you'll like it a lot.
[01:42:58.500 --> 01:42:59.740]   This is absolutely free.
[01:42:59.740 --> 01:43:00.740]   It is very social.
[01:43:00.740 --> 01:43:02.340]   You invite your friends and so forth.
[01:43:02.340 --> 01:43:03.340]   I'm Chief to it.
[01:43:03.340 --> 01:43:07.140]   If you want to play with me, I can go over here to my farm.
[01:43:07.140 --> 01:43:08.620]   And let's see.
[01:43:08.620 --> 01:43:10.260]   Oh, I've got some harvesting to do.
[01:43:10.260 --> 01:43:11.820]   I've got wheat that I've raised.
[01:43:11.820 --> 01:43:12.820]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:43:12.820 --> 01:43:13.820]   My wheat crop died.
[01:43:13.820 --> 01:43:14.820]   Oh, that's such bad news.
[01:43:14.820 --> 01:43:18.780]   I'm going to have to plant some more wheat or maybe some corn over here.
[01:43:18.780 --> 01:43:20.260]   Let's plant some corn.
[01:43:20.260 --> 01:43:21.260]   That's sad.
[01:43:21.260 --> 01:43:22.460]   You see, you got to pay attention.
[01:43:22.460 --> 01:43:26.460]   It gives you notifications on the front page of your iPhone when your wheat is ready.
[01:43:26.460 --> 01:43:28.020]   So very important that you would.
[01:43:28.020 --> 01:43:31.780]   And you can use mojo to harvest or to grow faster.
[01:43:31.780 --> 01:43:35.260]   But if you use your mojo, you'll run out of mojo.
[01:43:35.260 --> 01:43:37.100]   And then you got to buy more mojo.
[01:43:37.100 --> 01:43:38.100]   Hooray.
[01:43:38.100 --> 01:43:40.340]   My wheat is ready.
[01:43:40.340 --> 01:43:41.340]   And I can do that.
[01:43:41.340 --> 01:43:42.820]   You can also decorate.
[01:43:42.820 --> 01:43:46.500]   It's got all sorts of things you can do on here.
[01:43:46.500 --> 01:43:47.580]   Building, decorating.
[01:43:47.580 --> 01:43:50.780]   It's very much like the Sims or Civ or anything like that.
[01:43:50.780 --> 01:43:57.420]   But you can see very much, very much influenced by FarmVille.
[01:43:57.420 --> 01:44:01.420]   And once I get to level four, I'll be able to redesign everything.
[01:44:01.420 --> 01:44:02.420]   Pretty impressive.
[01:44:02.420 --> 01:44:04.380]   There are ads in it, but very unobtrusive.
[01:44:04.380 --> 01:44:11.780]   So if you have a hankering to waste even more time with your iPhone and geodefense swarm
[01:44:11.780 --> 01:44:17.580]   and plants versus zombies aren't doing it, this is called We Rule of Free Application
[01:44:17.580 --> 01:44:19.300]   for the iPhone.
[01:44:19.300 --> 01:44:20.380]   That's really quite a bit of fun.
[01:44:20.380 --> 01:44:22.420]   I'll plant some corn over here.
[01:44:22.420 --> 01:44:24.140]   There you go.
[01:44:24.140 --> 01:44:26.620]   And some corn there.
[01:44:26.620 --> 01:44:27.620]   There we go.
[01:44:27.620 --> 01:44:29.940]   And I'm going to try that wheat one more time.
[01:44:29.940 --> 01:44:34.300]   Because wheat is such a great product.
[01:44:34.300 --> 01:44:37.220]   Unless you can't process it very well.
[01:44:37.220 --> 01:44:38.220]   That's right.
[01:44:38.220 --> 01:44:39.220]   And carefully.
[01:44:39.220 --> 01:44:42.660]   This is a gluten-free wheat I raised just for you on my genetically modified.
[01:44:42.660 --> 01:44:45.900]   So you've got little settlers and everything.
[01:44:45.900 --> 01:44:47.260]   So a couple of free apps for you.
[01:44:47.260 --> 01:44:51.020]   The Twit app, which I highly recommend if you listen to this show, you can listen live.
[01:44:51.020 --> 01:44:55.780]   You can also watch and listen to shows after they're done by audio and video directly through
[01:44:55.780 --> 01:44:56.780]   the app.
[01:44:56.780 --> 01:44:59.540]   And then it is Twit approved.
[01:44:59.540 --> 01:45:04.620]   Both of those available in the iPhone app store or iPod Touch App Store.
[01:45:04.620 --> 01:45:07.460]   Oh my God, harvest my corn.
[01:45:07.460 --> 01:45:08.460]   Don't mind me.
[01:45:08.460 --> 01:45:10.620]   I'm just going to keep farming.
[01:45:10.620 --> 01:45:15.180]   So thank you, Alex Lindsey, the PixelChore.com is the place to go to find out more about Alex's
[01:45:15.180 --> 01:45:19.740]   multimedia group of artists working in learning.
[01:45:19.740 --> 01:45:24.700]   Met somebody in South by Southwest who's working with Africa.
[01:45:24.700 --> 01:45:25.700]   He's an Igerian.
[01:45:25.700 --> 01:45:27.380]   He's working with Africa to do the same kind of thing.
[01:45:27.380 --> 01:45:28.860]   And I want to hook you two up.
[01:45:28.860 --> 01:45:31.020]   You should be very interesting what you're doing there.
[01:45:31.020 --> 01:45:32.020]   Love to talk to him.
[01:45:32.020 --> 01:45:33.020]   What was his name?
[01:45:33.020 --> 01:45:34.660]   I have it written down somewhere.
[01:45:34.660 --> 01:45:35.660]   I don't.
[01:45:35.660 --> 01:45:36.660]   Was it Manny?
[01:45:36.660 --> 01:45:37.660]   Emanuel?
[01:45:37.660 --> 01:45:38.660]   Was not Manny.
[01:45:38.660 --> 01:45:40.860]   But he didn't know all the stuff you're doing.
[01:45:40.860 --> 01:45:42.500]   What country are you mostly in Zimbabwe?
[01:45:42.500 --> 01:45:44.820]   Zimbabwe is what we spend most of the time in.
[01:45:44.820 --> 01:45:49.260]   But I'm also going to be in looking at, I've done some more Contanzany in Kenya.
[01:45:49.260 --> 01:45:50.260]   We're Wanda.
[01:45:50.260 --> 01:45:51.260]   We're looking at Uganda.
[01:45:51.260 --> 01:45:52.420]   I heard you're doing more.
[01:45:52.420 --> 01:45:53.420]   Yeah.
[01:45:53.420 --> 01:45:54.420]   Well, we're working on it.
[01:45:54.420 --> 01:45:56.100]   We're doing everything in proposal stage right now.
[01:45:56.100 --> 01:46:01.180]   But we're hoping to actually get something, some brick and mortar setup in one of those
[01:46:01.180 --> 01:46:02.180]   countries soon.
[01:46:02.180 --> 01:46:03.180]   That's very exciting.
[01:46:03.180 --> 01:46:06.100]   I'll be speaking at the e-learning conference in Zambia at the end of May.
[01:46:06.100 --> 01:46:10.700]   Just in case you're there, if you're there, you can come by.
[01:46:10.700 --> 01:46:14.300]   Pixelcore.com, Pixelcore.tv for the podcast, the NAB podcast.
[01:46:14.300 --> 01:46:15.940]   You're coming soon.
[01:46:15.940 --> 01:46:20.340]   Somebody's telling me there's a game on the iPhone called Zombie Farm, which combines
[01:46:20.340 --> 01:46:21.340]   the two.
[01:46:21.340 --> 01:46:23.260]   I might stay away from that.
[01:46:23.260 --> 01:46:24.260]   I got it.
[01:46:24.260 --> 01:46:25.260]   I haven't played it yet.
[01:46:25.260 --> 01:46:26.260]   I'm afraid.
[01:46:26.260 --> 01:46:27.260]   I'm afraid we've been okay.
[01:46:27.260 --> 01:46:28.260]   Zombie Farm.
[01:46:28.260 --> 01:46:30.900]   Mr. Chris Breen, we love having you on the show.
[01:46:30.900 --> 01:46:31.900]   You're the greatest.
[01:46:31.900 --> 01:46:36.700]   You can read Chris's stuff, of course, in the Fabulous Mac Real Magazine on Newstands
[01:46:36.700 --> 01:46:37.700]   and online.
[01:46:37.700 --> 01:46:38.700]   Right.
[01:46:38.700 --> 01:46:39.700]   Right.
[01:46:39.700 --> 01:46:45.900]   And I'll put in a plug for my screencasting for the Mac from Linda.com that came out just
[01:46:45.900 --> 01:46:47.380]   a while ago.
[01:46:47.380 --> 01:46:48.380]   Superb.
[01:46:48.380 --> 01:46:49.380]   Superb.
[01:46:49.380 --> 01:46:50.380]   Yes.
[01:46:50.380 --> 01:46:51.380]   One, they did a great job.
[01:46:51.380 --> 01:46:52.380]   Wonderful.
[01:46:52.380 --> 01:46:56.980]   Andy Inaco is at the Chicago Sun Times and his website is CWOB.com.
[01:46:56.980 --> 01:46:59.540]   He'll be getting the iPad any day now.
[01:46:59.540 --> 01:47:01.660]   Make sure you keep an eye peeled.
[01:47:01.660 --> 01:47:03.820]   Any day within March or April.
[01:47:03.820 --> 01:47:07.140]   As will I.
[01:47:07.140 --> 01:47:08.140]   Thank you all for joining us.
[01:47:08.140 --> 01:47:12.380]   You know, I think it only fitting that we should try Sue from the Black Country to
[01:47:12.380 --> 01:47:14.740]   wrap up this show from a seer prank.
[01:47:14.740 --> 01:47:15.740]   Tom, he's over.
[01:47:15.740 --> 01:47:17.740]   No, get back to work.
[01:47:17.740 --> 01:47:23.020]   I'm such a fish my burrito.
[01:47:23.020 --> 01:47:25.620]   We need like a little Mac break dude to like do some break.
[01:47:25.620 --> 01:47:26.620]   I'll tweet.
[01:47:26.620 --> 01:47:27.620]   We are on a real home.
[01:47:27.620 --> 01:47:30.620]   I'm in a burrito delay.
[01:47:30.620 --> 01:47:37.420]   And people might read that the wrong way because of FCC guidelines.
[01:47:37.420 --> 01:47:40.100]   Like five minute electronic burrito delay.
[01:47:40.100 --> 01:47:44.180]   We're sorry for the time you spent on the tarmac this morning, but our pilot is eating
[01:47:44.180 --> 01:47:45.180]   a breakfast burrito.
[01:47:45.180 --> 01:47:48.460]   We should be able to get the show launched in about 10 minutes.
[01:47:48.460 --> 01:47:52.300]   We'll give you updates as new condiments develop.
[01:47:52.300 --> 01:47:54.860]   That's very good.
[01:47:54.860 --> 01:47:57.380]   You must have spent some time flying my friend.
[01:47:57.380 --> 01:48:02.100]   In the meantime, your flight attendants will leave the cabin door open so that you can
[01:48:02.100 --> 01:48:06.260]   watch me.
[01:48:06.380 --> 01:48:07.880]   [LAUGH]
[01:48:07.880 --> 01:48:14.880]   [MUSIC]
