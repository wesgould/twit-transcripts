[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.600]   We'll also give you my review of the new Mac book pro pros and cons and explain
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:22.620]   Why those speaker grills don't really do much at all. It's all next I'm back break quickly

[00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.900]   I'm cutting down Lee. I'm cutting down Apple talk. You said that every time we ask you
[00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.340]   I'm also apparently working at the docks or its winter here. I like that one yet. Is that a took?
[00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.420]   It is a took. It's what we what we hear call it to keep play call it a jonty shapo on the show
[00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.260]   What do we call it?
[00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.500]   We'll cap cap yeah, yeah, I was just gonna wish him good luck against Apollo Creed
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.700]   I think he has what it takes to go the distance Renee
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:57.460]   Hey, you had talent
[00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:03.960]   Became a thumb breaker. I don't hate Balboa any man who tries to take what I got
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:10.780]   This is exciting talent, but I didn't have was management. I didn't have the proper management rack
[00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.940]   Sorry if you die he dies
[00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.860]   Was it was it a brief talk and stuck in the middle there? Yes. Yes. Well, he was he was a yvondrago in the fourth
[00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:22.860]   I go
[00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.700]   Drago. I have only seen one rocky movie and that was recently
[00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.860]   under a force measure
[00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:37.380]   And I shall never see another one. I think was that Creed is that then you know the first one? Oh the first one. I had never seen it
[00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:43.640]   It's both timeless and incredibly timed like it's incredibly anachronistic so dated yeah
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.280]   Yeah, big story breaking news
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.240]   Which is come
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.440]   America held hostage day
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.020]   30,000 I think we're really seeing a new apple here. We're seeing apple really focus
[00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:05.420]   Narrow its focus. I did get the new Mac book. This is the 15 with a touch bar
[00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.560]   And I have oh and he disappeared
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:16.120]   Hmm, I still see you your black screen. It's a man. Okay unplugged the switcher. That's right
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.880]   There's no case you might put on your Mac book
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:24.760]   I'll do the you see the dongle. You see the dongle. I gotta use here see that dongle
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.600]   That's all right. I don't mind dongles. You always use dongles dongles are us
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.160]   I mean there's always something going on there with the oh god Stockholm syndrome. They've gotten the Leo
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.800]   As a matter of my cereal more
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.800]   a dongle bag
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.400]   So I can carry all the dongles that I need
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.240]   You know including the very important in fact you should probably buy as many of these as you buy a
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:53.200]   headphone jack to lightning. This is the USB to type C dongle a dash which to parallel
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.920]   I didn't have a dongle and you can't you don't have to buy new dongles
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.160]   Because at least Apple gave you for type C ports
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:06.320]   But some interesting things going on which we'll talk about I'll give you my thoughts on this
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.360]   New laptop. I think I have good news for you Andy anyway
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.520]   My funniest story was my boss Kevin he bought his and he didn't pay attention
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.400]   So he got the one with the Quebec French keyboard
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.000]   Oh funny
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.320]   He just called me saying do they all have keyboards like this?
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.960]   Why is there an EX on take you next to the shift bar?
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.680]   What am I how do I use this thing and it was just an accident, but he had about 10 minutes of complete bewilderment?
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.720]   It's really is it is the Quebec French keyboard as dirty or is it still courty?
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.720]   It's courty, but it has a it's it's got a different layout and there is like literally an EX on tg
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:41.440]   And I think there's a you with an accent character on it as well. I have an ox on take you on my name
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.720]   It's actually Leo. So I would appreciate that. I have to always do
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:52.360]   Option ee to get it, but if you get one of those no Apple didn't change your keyboard that much that was a clerical
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.760]   Yeah, we decided to make them all French ha ha enjoy
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:03.200]   Oh, no the story I was talking about but I think it goes along with the kind of a larger a narrative that I'm starting to build in my head
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.200]   Apple has abandoned apparently according to Bloomberg
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.840]   Mark German
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.680]   The wireless routers no more airports
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.480]   The Apple team responsible has been disbanded
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:24.120]   German writes another move to try to sharpen the company's focus on consumer products that generate the bulk
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.960]   It's oh shut up. I hate I hate I hate instant
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.560]   Mark when you want to see it
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.200]   That's the you know the autoplay video which everybody's doing now. It's just just you know
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.200]   This is why we can't have nice things
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:44.280]   They've been doing this over the past year. We were wondering I mean they haven't updated the airport extreme since 2013
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:49.520]   That was an AC router. So it didn't feel like there was you know like an pressing need
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:57.200]   Nevertheless, especially as you see companies like Euro and Luma and Google
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.960]   Doing a ubiquity doing these now mesh routers that solve a big problem
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:07.600]   Many of us have with Wi-Fi access throughout the house and Apple just silence
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:14.680]   Well now we know why they don't feel like this is a business the only thing that users unique about the Apple router that can't be replaced
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.680]   Is the time machine capability right?
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:21.920]   It can't so the internal having an internal hard drive that was automatically set up and I have one here
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.840]   I love it because I don't have to think about it and things I don't have to think about it actually end up using who knew
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.440]   But yes, so the the one that's all you do time capsule
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:34.040]   Sorry all you do is plug it in and it automatically time machines all the computers that you connect it to
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:40.000]   Is no more and also the airport express had the built-in airport. That's my airplay capability. Oh, yeah
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.480]   That was a nice one. It's speakers. Yeah. Yeah. Well, if you're just playing the speakers
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:48.880]   You could airplay it any any set of normal speakers that had a 3.5 millimeter headset jack iron ironically
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.200]   Oh, so it's kind of like an Apple TV for sound I guess yeah
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.640]   Yeah, and that that was licensed by other speaker makers, but the video part hasn't been yeah
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:08:00.640]   I have a airplay JBL system that that would take your place so
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:06.380]   And of course you can use time machine on a lot of routers that have USB ports or cable almost have USB ports
[00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:07.520]   You put on the network. It'll find it
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:12.720]   So or NASA's a lot of time machine built in now right exactly. I have time machine on my NAS to soap
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:20.840]   Discover other apples and automatically back them up though. You would have to bridge you manually. Yeah, it was a manual
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:26.640]   It's not it's not it's not the simplicity of you take this out of the box you plug it in and this app that is run
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:32.320]   natively on your device asks you do you want to automatically save everything you ever do so that disasters can be
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.440]   Deeply deeply mitigated by just by clicking this one button
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:40.800]   So that's that's it's kind of what you said there are a lot of companies that are bank that are doing mesh networks
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.480]   I've got a Google Wi-Fi on the way for testing
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.240]   And they make they solve a lot of these problems
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:51.520]   It is I do understand of Apple's focus on just things that have screens on them
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.320]   You know to basically become that that kind of computer company
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:09:01.520]   It's too bad because it's not as though there aren't still a lot of opportunities to make people's lives better and easier
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:08.000]   With all these accessories that are required to make all the Mac books and all the iPads and all the Apple watches work better
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.640]   So that's too bad is there's some secret sauce that Apple puts into things that
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:15.680]   Unfortunately, it's not going to be a VELP for home networking anymore
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.840]   Yeah, my understanding is that this is very similar to the
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:24.640]   4k and 5k displays which I believe they were testing for a long time and ultimately decided not to release
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:28.640]   It's that they don't necessarily bring anything that there is special sauce absolutely
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.120]   But they don't necessarily push the market anymore when they were releasing airports
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:38.200]   Famously Steve Jobs says look there's no cables and he makes Phil Schiller jump off of things to prove it and for many years
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.480]   They were they were driving wireless
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:40.880]   You know
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:47.440]   They just weren't included in a lot of laptops and Apple included them in notebooks and included routers and really helped push the forefront of the technology
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:51.440]   They would always update them the 802.11 G and N and and AC
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:57.840]   And the same thing with the displays they put out that IPS display after the iMac came out and it was amazing because Apple would buy a million
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:03.240]   Panels in bulk, but now the feeling I think is that they no longer have to drive those those particular technologies
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:07.160]   We have wonderful companies like Ubiquiti and Europe making these mesh networks
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:13.760]   And we have you know companies like LG and Samsung making amazing panels and Apple doesn't have to drive those things anymore
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:21.120]   So they would just as soon reduce their focus back to the core products and let the companies that have now established a whole lot of competency in those products make them
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:27.200]   Yeah, I used to recommend the airport because it was in many ways the best router out there
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:34.400]   But I thought so easy yeah, and well and it didn't do some it didn't have the security issues of the commodity routers Apple kept it up
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:39.440]   To date there were regular firmware updates. You didn't have WPS the Apple used a better system
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.920]   That would turned out to be a flawed system the WPS system
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.080]   So Apple was had an advantage in security
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:50.480]   But that was in 2013 and 2014 and in 2015 I think last year or so here I stopped saying
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:54.880]   By an apple route because they were more expensive. They were better more modern routers that had
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:59.120]   You know similar features and now that these mesh routers are coming out
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:03.520]   Um, I think that's where i'm going now with most people is recommending this
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:09.840]   Yeah, and I guess apple just didn't want to compete in that market and the question you raised
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.760]   Go ahead
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:19.200]   Just a just quick. I think that's really the key that they if they don't they they really are focused on making sure that they stay in a
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.440]   Good position as a company
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:25.680]   Which means that if they can focus on things where there is no competition
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:29.760]   Where they can continue to make their arguments, but here's why we design things this way
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:32.960]   Here's why we build things to this caliber of construction
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:36.640]   This is why we build laptops at the last five years instead of just two or three years
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:42.080]   It's easier to make that statement if you say and by the way, this is the only version of the mac
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.480]   You can buy this i'm like this only mac hardware you can buy
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.120]   This is the only ios hardware you can buy
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.400]   If you start competing in areas where well, we're going to compete against
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:55.040]   Not just the makers of the $200 really good routers that we want to make
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:12:00.560]   We're also competing against people who are making the 40 50 60 dollar routers that are perfectly good for a lot of people
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:04.000]   And it's hard to make the case that here's why our $200 router costs more
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:10.800]   So I really I think that's it's mostly about they really the products. They really like are not just high markup, but once where
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.760]   They're sort of free to
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.240]   Let the hardware make its own argument
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:23.760]   With free of saying we asked but why does this cost $150 more than this other one that also will connect my laptop to the internet
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:27.040]   That's uh, there are reasons why apple hardware is superior in that regard, but
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:32.080]   If you don't have to get into that that that uh, that rat's nest why why jump into it
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.280]   Yeah, and likewise
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:37.600]   You don't want people to go and buy that wonderful new mac book that has this this new fangled airport thing
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.120]   And then just not have a router at home
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:42.400]   Took it up to or to have a really bad router and you don't want them to buy that mac book
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:47.680]   And need to dock it on something and not have a really good display that it could drive you want to you want to provide that really good experience
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:52.400]   And now you don't need to there's other people doing it so it feels almost like the end of one era. Yeah
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.760]   it uh, yeah
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.160]   um
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:59.840]   It also, I mean
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.280]   To be fair
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:05.760]   Even though I recommended them. I mean you had to have an amak to really use it and you had to have a
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:13.440]   Airport software to access it. It wasn't it was a solution and maybe this is in some degree
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:21.920]   Contributed to it is decline that that typical apple required a macintosh ecosystem to even be usable
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.360]   And yeah, it's
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.360]   Yeah, I mean that's that's that's why I think it's too bad
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:32.320]   I think that there's a lot of opportunity to help users by saying that kind of like what they were doing with the
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:36.800]   With the with the with the air pods where it is a bone standard stock bluetooth headphone
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:41.920]   But they realize that we have the ability because we know everything there is to know about the iphone
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:46.880]   If it's an iphone connecting to it, we can essentially make it so much easier to use
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:51.200]   So I think there are a lot of opportunities they would have to make a wireless router that every
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:56.400]   Although routers have become much much easier to use and much more powerful in the past five years since last time
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:00.160]   I really redid the entire office there are things that they could do by simply saying oh
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:06.480]   Okay, I'm going to use the dumb standard that takes three or four years to approve and oh wait a minute
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:11.200]   I see you're a mac great. We're gonna use all this proprietary stuff forget forget forget what I said about the standards
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:17.520]   We're gonna use this wonderful stuff that we developed in house that we can do whatever we want with that will make things 10 times better and 80 times easier
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:22.880]   I got you. This is why you bought this is why you've been $30 more for the apple logo because we're making it so much better
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:26.080]   If you have an if you have an iphone and an ipad and a mac
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:29.280]   So they're missing out that opportunity to help people that way because
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:33.520]   Oftentimes because this is a lot harder to do is harder to again harder to compete with
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:37.600]   Uh, uh, uh, uh, 80 different 80 different models of router that at best buy
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:41.600]   It's easier to say here is the apple router that you're going to be getting with the apple computer
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.600]   This you're going to be getting with the apple iphone
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:51.600]   Yeah, and it's also lack of differentiation like if they ever decided they wanted to get into making something like, uh, an Alexa or like a google home device
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:55.920]   That would that would just subvert a lot of the base functionality in an airport
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:01.520]   I know not everybody would want it but for apple that would be a much more differentiator device a device that automatically pre fetches your backups
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:08.880]   That does a nearline version of iCloud to stage things for you that provides Siri microphones and that you know that does things that only apple could do
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:14.240]   So any like ubiquity is great and iris great and they do things that you know, not exactly what apple could do
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:16.720]   But they're so good at what they do and what apple can bring to it
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.080]   I think now is something different
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:21.360]   So if they choose to release their apple home hub or whatever they end up calling it
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.240]   I think that will probably take the place of airport in their lineup
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:29.280]   The shill asks in the chat room a really reasonable question from a business point of view
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:36.400]   Which is that apple users want to buy apple products? I mean, I I think we'd all agree on that
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:40.160]   An apple user would rather have an apple router an apple monitor
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:44.720]   Would rather have a completely apple ecosystem. Why would apple
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.560]   Abandoned that amazing advantage
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:53.440]   I mean very few companies have that you know situation
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:58.800]   Microsoft doesn't google does well to to taples credit. They don't just like license out
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:04.480]   They don't just ask asos could you build us a router with a couple of these extra features and we'll design a case for it
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:08.160]   We'll put the apple logo on it. That's to their credit, but it is also
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:16.640]   She has a great point in that we we accept we expect that there's a value add with an apple product and it's
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.800]   not
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:22.960]   It's a little bit disappointing that apple can't be intrigued by
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:30.480]   Everything that they can only really get that excited about a laptop. They get excited about a phone
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:36.640]   They can get excited about a tablet. They can't get excited themselves excited about a networking product
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:39.280]   Even though this is something that you know if I'm spending
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:43.360]   $1,820 on a new laptop
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:48.560]   I might decide to round it up to 2,000 bucks if my if my wireless router is
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:54.960]   Six years old and it's I can see it do something inside the store that I gosh is the thorn in my side
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:58.640]   With this old router for five or six years. So I it's
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:03.040]   They do want they do seem to be more comfortable with a restricted portfolio
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:09.360]   Than with the idea of here is how we can make the entire experience better as opposed to here are some things that are
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:13.040]   We think that we're really good at or here are the things that creatively really interest us
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:18.080]   So they're kind of they've been shedding all that stuff for years now and that's just the latest point in the line
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:23.520]   They have so much stuff now too. I mean we live in an ear now where they have a new apple tv and apple watch and
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:28.800]   Airpods are coming out and do we have a company that's gay well, I mean well eventually
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:32.000]   That scales they have these really small teams
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:36.880]   And you look at like what's on dan richio's desk and what's on all these you know the hard words even the platform team
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:40.400]   They're the mo they're the highest valued company in the world way
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:47.520]   They don't work that way though. They keep really small teams doesn't they have the resources they are big enough
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:52.400]   To do more products every other company their size has many products
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:58.240]   The the other question and you raise this question your article at i'm more.com rene is if they're clearing the decks
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:03.600]   What are they clearing the decks for is it because they have something they want to put their attention in?
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.640]   I mean, it's not the new mac pro right
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:10.960]   So yeah, I feel like they're clearing the decks of piece of computer users
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:14.080]   Like uh, no, that might that absolutely might be the case
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:18.640]   It might be that they have established at the biggest growth market for their company going forward of the mainstream and pro and pro
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:23.440]   Sumer markets and that's where their laser focusing and they keep saying we're not afraid to say no
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.600]   And I'd argue that there are companies that have more products
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:29.840]   But there are very few companies that have a lot of really good products and have had successful products
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:30.560]   You know
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:35.760]   Surviving the generational shifts that apple has survived like the companies that were great at desktop have not become great at mobile
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:40.720]   And it's arguable how this generation of companies like the companies are a great at search and not become great at social
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:45.600]   You know, apple is struggling to find out what's next. What's the post post post pc era?
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:49.040]   So keeping keeping focus I think as much as it hurts me because
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:53.680]   Like I don't like the attitude. Well, I'm happy they cancel everything other people like but as long as they keep my
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:58.480]   Oh, no, they canceled my thing. Like I think we all share some pain in this and if they stay focused
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:01.200]   We'll get some stuff we like but we're also going to lose some of our darlings
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.280]   And i'm sure people in the company are losing their darlings right?
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:07.440]   I'm increasingly convinced that apples new focus will be on augmented reality
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:11.920]   Um that that seems to be tim cook keep saying ar
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:16.800]   And that seems to be an area where a lot of companies have some very interesting
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.520]   Plays but it's tandy's point ai
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:25.760]   Huh. Yeah, and tandy's point from last week ai ai ai ai ai ai ai yeah, I mean they're huge
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:29.120]   They're they've been huge investors in ai for years. I don't think it's a huge
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:32.160]   Frankly three years for a router is pretty old
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:36.960]   I'm I generally tell people they need to replace their router every few years because they wear out people
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:43.680]   Don't think they do they seem like solid state appliances and they are but they really do wear out and I I abandoned my airport extreme
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:48.800]   A few months ago, maybe a year ago now because i was a lucky 802 double 802
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:52.480]   Move so slowly. I mean if they'd gone to ad or they'd gone to something else they would have
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.280]   They're up to the new standard so that's not the issue
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:59.280]   But I think apple probably did the right thing three years out if we're not going to make a new one now
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:04.560]   Let's just cut cut the cord and what they they haven't announced this though, right? This is no
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:09.200]   This is mark is really well sourced and you know if he says people have left that team
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:12.480]   Oh, I believe he says many of them went to apple tv which is interesting
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:17.200]   I mean there that that's the interesting part here is apple tv is one spoke in the hub
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:21.200]   But there's people who don't need a set top box so they need something in a room that doesn't have a set top box
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:27.440]   There's a whole range of we've been hearing rumors about apple working on on various kinds of home hubs and next generation networking appliances
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.840]   for years and you know the
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:36.240]   What we now have as a router just might not be an interesting product for them anymore, you know, there was there was uh until recently
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:44.160]   Some excitement that the fcc was going to mandate that cable companies open up the the set top box that they allow their customers
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:48.640]   I don't know what's what the status is in uh, Canada, but at least a lot of other customers in the us
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:52.080]   Yeah to buy a non-com cast or a non-cox or a non
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:55.440]   Uh, time Warner or whatever it is now spectrum box
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:21:01.760]   Uh, and that opened up a potentially opened up a market for apple to make the new set top box, which would have been great
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:06.800]   I suspect you know what happened has happened now with uh after the election is the uh
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:09.680]   Congress has asked the fcc to just stop
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:17.360]   So they've stopped nothing more is going to come out of the fcc and it would be my guess although it is completely a guess that the new administration
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:22.160]   Will back down on things like that. That's uh, that's the kind of regulation
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:28.640]   Or it's seen as regulation. I think it's in a way deregulation. It's opening up, but that seems to be the kind of
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:34.320]   Regulations that uh, uh, the republican congress and republican white house don't want the fcc to do
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:39.920]   So if any company apple, let's say bet that set top box is to be a new market
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.920]   I think now's the time to rethink that bet
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:47.840]   Yeah, there's there's there's a lot that can be changed. It's it could be a change in leadership with the fcc can
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:54.080]   Uh, and in congress can really upset a lot of tables now a lot of things that were kind of sacrosanct
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:57.840]   Or rather seem seem to be a steady sort of predictable thing for
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:03.680]   For designing the next two or three years of your business. They're now back on the table things like well
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:08.160]   What if we uh, what if we let your cable company throttle back Netflix because
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:11.360]   We want to we want to get people to subscribe to our own
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.400]   Comcast based video streaming services
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:21.440]   And what if we want to make it so that you can't have unapproved devices on your router because we're going to say that your
[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:29.680]   The communication layer between your cable modem and your device is a secure protected layer that cannot be violated without violating the digital
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:34.240]   Millennium copyright act. So you you get into this is why like all
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:38.960]   You you don't like the fact that you have large companies like apple and uh
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:42.880]   Apple and google that have like a big important
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:49.520]   Expensive presence in washington, but it's not sometimes not so much them lobbying to get to get things that are uh
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:52.640]   Advent changes to apple oftentimes it's time to figure out that
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:56.320]   We have a device ready to go. We have the box art all ready to go
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:02.000]   Uh, we have our engineer has standing by in front of the white back screen to talk about the design of this thing
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:05.680]   But we know that if they pass this law or if they change this law
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:10.480]   This thing will be could become almost completely valueless to anybody we can won't be able to sell it
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:17.440]   So it's it's a tough tough situation for any company to be in particularly want to innovate beyond a competitive be beyond the
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:23.440]   Status closed desire to allow innovation to happen if I were a lad broke bookie taking bets
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:27.680]   on uh opening up the set top box at this point i'd say that is dead
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:33.360]   And uh, so if if a comp if apple thought that and that would have been a great by the way
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:36.160]   That would have been a great future for an apple tv
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:38.960]   Uh to become your cable box
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.600]   Um, yeah
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:44.320]   Your playstation, I mean it would have been great for so many of those
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:48.880]   The cable by the cable companies didn't want to do cable cards and they were forced to do it by the fcc
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:51.360]   We don't have them in canada. We don't have we're not allowed to have cable cars
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:55.120]   And the broadcast flag is not there's no prohibition. Yeah, you can't do a tivo
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:59.360]   So I uh, I replaced the god awful comcast x one
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:03.600]   dvr system with tivos at great expense i might add because
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:08.640]   You not only have to buy the tivo, which is pricey, but then you have to buy a subscription so you get a cable guide
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:13.760]   Uh, but i'm able to use i have three tivos and i'm able to use them with the cable card
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:20.400]   I wonder how long that's gonna last. Yeah, you know, we have we have to remember that so many of the stuff we tafre
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:27.360]   Granted started off as a point of view that other people consider quaint. There's a reason why
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:31.520]   Uh, it's cable companies are required to have all local access
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:36.640]   Channels unscrambled so that if there's just if there's just conduit running into your house
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:42.400]   You can legally run a cable from that conduit conduit in your apartment to the back of your tv set
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.600]   And at least get the the local broadcast stations for free
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:53.200]   And that was based on the argument some years ago that there should be free over the there should be free over the air network
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:59.280]   Network cable that this people should not be forced to pay for that which is broadcast for free
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:03.840]   And that's just an opinion because cable companies of course can make the well
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:09.520]   They're used to make the argument. Oh, they're still using our network and we still have to send trucks out to maintain those cables
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:12.320]   We should we shouldn't allow people to have that stuff for free
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:18.800]   But again, there was this very very positive but to some people's point of view quaint notion that free tv is a basic
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:22.160]   Inalienable human right and so that also could go
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:29.920]   Rather quickly so all these stuff you you it's kind of shocking sometimes to realize that a lot of stuff that you assume
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:33.280]   Is just the way that we've developed our our our nation
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:40.320]   We're basically standing on sand it could one big wave could wipe it all out and and uh, you know uncertainty is always
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:44.560]   The real threat to all of this because if if companies know
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:48.000]   Well, this is going to happen. This is they can plan for the future at this point
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.720]   We're really in this kind of uncertain situation and I imagine
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:56.400]   Um, you know, there's conversations going on at apple. I that are basically well, you know
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:01.280]   What can we what can we be sure is going to be a business next year and going forward and it's pretty obvious?
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.520]   It's the ichphone
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:06.000]   And uh, we're going to take a break and when we come back
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.040]   I do want to talk about the uh, I finally have caught up with you rene
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:13.040]   I finally got the macbook pro. I bought a 13 for lease and a 15 for me
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:16.800]   I'm using it right now and you got doom running in the touch bar, right?
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:21.760]   Yeah, I hear you can put doom on the touch bar. I haven't done that yet. It's a right of passage for any for any embeddices
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:25.440]   Gotta have doom on it. Yeah, well, how do you play it? Is it like
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:28.960]   I mean there's
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:36.240]   I mean, I just assume you yeah, I mean, I don't know. Well, I just like to exist. It's a bar bet sort of things. Okay, I'll see
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.320]   I got to do it. Give me with 20 bucks. Yeah
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:42.080]   Yeah, that's still pretty cool kotaku 19 hours ago
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:45.360]   Someone should get doom running in the macbook pro's touch bar
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:49.040]   Hours later it is you want to see the video?
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:54.320]   This is this is what it looks like. I don't know if this is really a good use for super mario run
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:57.280]   Oh
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.640]   m
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.240]   G
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:03.760]   It's kind of squished down. Yeah, at least you get the music
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:07.280]   That's crazy. That is crazy
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:13.280]   Yeah, that would be a good screen for like laura's of Arabia like a big yeah
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:20.960]   It's like like two like six six to one ratio. Oh, it'd be perfect for laura's of Arabia. We wouldn't even have to have killer boxes
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:26.320]   Oh my god, I love it. Is that it's an arm chip in there, right?
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:29.840]   There's an arm chip that manages the touch ID process
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:33.440]   But it's also hooked up into the main computer for a lot of the basic functionality
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:39.440]   So I wonder where that display is coming from i'm guessing it's on the max side. Yeah
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:44.560]   Wow, okay. I want to download it and play it right now
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:50.160]   We'll take a break come back with more rene richie from imore.com from the chicago sun times andi and naco
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:52.720]   Our show today brought to you by fresh books
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:55.520]   If you're a freelancer a small business person
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:59.120]   Not short business person small business person
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:07.280]   You might be interested in a way that makes your life a lot easier. You didn't I know I didn't get into business because you loved
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:12.400]   Invoicing because you loved bookkeeping. Well, I guess if you're a bookkeeper, maybe you did
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:15.600]   I'm not a bookkeeper. In fact, I'm terrible at it
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:19.840]   But when and so as a result when I had to do invoices at the end of the month
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:24.800]   I never sent them out. I it was just I just grown but there is something I learned
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:27.280]   And I'd like to pass this along to you
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.840]   If you don't invoice people you don't get paid
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:33.200]   And if you don't get paid pretty sure you're out of business
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.840]   In fact, you know, I was talking to the fresh books guys
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:39.120]   They were showing me the brand new fresh books interface, which is amazing
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:43.280]   Really great and they said a surprisingly large number like more than half
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:49.200]   Of freelancers or small businesses if you asked to them and came to them and said did you make a profit this year?
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:52.000]   Wouldn't really know
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.760]   They would say well, you know, I mean, I'm
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:56.320]   Paying my bills. I don't know
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:58.320]   How much of a profit did you make?
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:00.480]   I don't know
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:03.840]   Fresh books will tell you that it's on the front page with his new interface
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:09.360]   Fresh book starts with making your invoices and it does it so quickly you can create a new invoice in less than 30 seconds
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:15.520]   It looks professional has your logo does everything you need. There's no formatting no formulas
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:18.000]   Just just great invoices
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.760]   And when you send one out fresh books can show you when the client looks at it, which is very handy
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:27.360]   If you have one of those clients to say, but I didn't get the and get the invoice
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:30.080]   And by the way, most clients want to pay
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:34.080]   But they don't like paying the bills any more than you like sending the bills
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:39.440]   So fresh books makes it very easy by putting a a button in there that lets them pay online in fact
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:46.640]   uh, according to fresh books research you get paid up to four days faster because of this little button
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:53.120]   They also have a super handy deposit feature which allows you to invoice for payment up front when you're kicking off a project
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:55.120]   So you don't have to pay out of pocket
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:57.520]   A client's love fresh books as much as you do
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:02.560]   And the beauty of this is because you're using fresh books to track your invoices
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:06.560]   To keep track of expenses. You can actually use the fresh books
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:11.200]   App to snap pictures of expenses receipts and so forth get them right into fresh books

[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:23.040]   You've received what you spent suddenly you do have an answer to the question. How is my business doing?
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:28.560]   You could see with a glance what your own what's overdue whether you're in the red whether you're making money and how much money
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:34.720]   The notification center is like a a personal assistant that tells you what's changed in your business
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:38.960]   Since the last time you visited and what should be dealt with like overdue invoices
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:44.960]   They've got a website, you know, you'll get a web portal, but you also the apps are fantastic on iOS and android

[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:36.960]   Andy and echo rene richie and the new mac book pro
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:40.320]   so rene
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:44.240]   Couple of things. Um
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:48.000]   Hold on. Hold on. I'm gonna gird myself. No, no, no, it's not bad. Don't go for the face
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.800]   Don't go for the face. Not bad. I am still the jury's still out, but I'm getting less and less convinced that the touchpad is
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:55.360]   Is a significant
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:59.200]   Feature. It's cool. I love logging in with my fingerprint
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:02.080]   Uh, not not that apple invented that by the way
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:04.880]   This has been around for some time on pcs
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:08.000]   But I do really love that and you can buy things with your finger
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.520]   Having touch id is great and i'm so glad they put that in
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:15.280]   But I don't find myself using the trackpad that often even on
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:21.280]   Um, you know apps like you know already pixel-mater for instance supports the trackpad
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:25.840]   I don't find it much easier to use a trackpad than just menus or mouse
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:30.560]   And the problem I have with it, which is the problem I thought I'd have which is if you're a touch-touch typist
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:33.600]   You don't want to be checking the keyboard to see what you can do
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:36.480]   That's that just doesn't comport with the way
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:39.600]   You've been taught to use a computer. So
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:45.440]   I'm not this is not definitive yet, but i'm coming more and more to the conclusion that the
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:48.800]   Touchpad is not you know, it's cool
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:53.040]   But not necessarily a must have on the other hand Andy
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:58.640]   I find the keyboard better and we've been playing with it a little bit and and the difference is it's got an audible click
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:04.640]   And the problem I had with a macbook keyboard macbook keyboard is I felt like my I was stubbing my finger at type
[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.800]   And it would stop prematurely, you know like a
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:11.520]   A step on a staircase that's just a little short. He's that's not
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:14.320]   And uh, and I thought I'd get used to it
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:17.920]   I didn't over a year of using the macbook pretty regularly like every night
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:23.680]   Uh, it didn't get used to it. This one seems it's the click. I think it's I don't think it's any less shallow
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:28.560]   But there's just an audible signal that you've hit that you've typed the thing and I'm much more accurate with it
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:34.960]   It's not as good as the full travel keyboards of earlier macbooks, but it's not as bad as I thought it would be
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.320]   Well, they'll put that on a bus that real soon
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:42.640]   New macbook pro. It's not as bad as it's gonna be
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:44.960]   It's highly divisive. Oh, it's still bad
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:49.120]   It's a little bit. Yeah, legally we have to confess that it's still a very very bad
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:52.640]   It's bad. It's not as bad. I don't think it's bad. Okay, and by the way
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:58.160]   We we had a kyle weans of iFix it was on the new screen savers he did it tear down of it
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:02.720]   And he said this this is still that new switch, but it the butterfly switch
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:07.200]   But they have it is a different switch. They've modified it. So it's a little domy here the domy's domy here
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:12.320]   Yeah, so I I think that that was an important improvement and I'd like to see them put them in the macbook as well
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:19.120]   Um, the screen is spectacular. You're absolutely right. Uh, Renee on that that it is a beautiful
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:21.680]   Rich screen
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:25.360]   That just looks fantastic. It's nice to put it next to the old macbook pro
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:28.480]   You really see the differences in the reds and the greens because you get and then you go back
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:30.640]   It's like, oh, why is my display kind of muddy?
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:33.920]   I was skeptical about the giant
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:40.400]   Which is actually the california king. Yeah, it's actually bigger than an iphone seven plus
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:45.840]   Um, but it doesn't I unlike joian astern who complained that she was getting stray wrist
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:49.120]   movements while she typed I haven't the wrist rejection is perfect
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:53.360]   I haven't had any problem. I can't even like if I forced it if I pushed my wrist down and kind of drag it
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:58.480]   It'll move the the cursor like a couple millimeters. Yeah, but I can't get it to why is it bigger
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:01.120]   Is there a functional reason or is it just a design thing?
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:07.200]   They so they wanted more travel on and the nice thing about removing the mechanics is they don't have to care anymore if they're switches underneath it
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:13.200]   Uh, and there's there's no hinge anymore either and before when you had the hinge there was no pressure on the top and all the pressure at the bottom
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:17.440]   So now they it's bigger because they can make it bigger and that's their main form of touch input on the mac
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:19.440]   So they wanted to make it as big as possible. Yeah
[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:24.800]   I mean in many cases I feel like the touchpad in this giant trackpad are really apples response to the lack of touch on the screen
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:28.880]   Um, and I know you know, I can live with that touch on the screen. I I like it
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:33.680]   But it's not it's kind of like the touch bar. It's not it's you know, it's okay
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:39.600]   But the probably have with all the touch stuff is that on a on a on a classic pc in the mac is a classic pc
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:41.440]   You can never count on touch being there
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:45.440]   Which means you can't make it core to the operating system or half or more of your customers
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.040]   Won't be able to use their computer
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:50.160]   So it always has to be an added benefit and then when it's an odd added benefit
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:53.840]   Nobody likes to learn new habits. So they just don't and then nobody uses it
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:55.840]   The kind of
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:59.760]   Dealing with right is how do we handle this because we want to give you a touch?
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:03.920]   Again, both microsoft and google have done a really good job of
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:09.200]   Turning touch into something that if you have it you will really you will find ways to use it
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:11.440]   You will enjoy it. You will find it in an enhancement
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:14.800]   If you don't have it, you really won't notice that it's missing
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:19.760]   If there's no point at which you're doing something a clumsy way because you don't have a machine with touch
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:26.800]   And the other side of that is just as Renee said with what what apple did with Wi-Fi by make by by making the case that Wi-Fi
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:29.440]   And wireless is important. They made it important
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:34.720]   By the making the case with microsoft that touch on a desktop machine is important
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:42.080]   They made it important and now it's it's it's most people you only will you will only have a non touch device
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:47.520]   On a machine that where the price really has to be as dirt cheap as possible
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:50.480]   It's hard to find a machine that doesn't have touch even uh
[00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:55.680]   Even Chromebooks that cost like 200 bucks have touch 250 bucks have touch so
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:02.240]   There's a way to do it. I mean a lot of a lot of the ones that I have friends and bless them
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:07.600]   They just don't upgrade and they have they're from the era of non-touch devices and they've all they all oh free windows 10
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:13.920]   That's amazing. They have windows 10 running on the circa. I guess windows xp or whatever. It's ops and desk ops
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:19.760]   Yeah, that's that that's that's not a happy day running xp on anything is anything that has that doesn't have like a
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:24.080]   That doesn't that doesn't have a pendium inside sticker on it. It's not a very happy day
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:31.040]   But just you have to you always have to make sure you understand that how important
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:34.000]   a company's
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.800]   Beliefs are that this is an extension of apples belief that touch has no port
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:41.040]   It just doesn't make sense on a desktop machine
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:44.800]   And that's perfectly fine and they're prosecuting that idea throughout the rest of their line
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:49.040]   It doesn't mean that other companies are wrong because they believe that you absolutely
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:51.920]   Do have a place for a touch on a desktop machine
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:57.360]   You just have to make sure you're designed for it. And so it's one of the things that's kind of got me interested
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:01.040]   Especially with the 2016 macbook pro is that okay? So
[00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:07.440]   I i i i touched on this last week that i'm sort of getting that sort of deja vu
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:16.640]   When companies realize that oh my god, we've made our of our all of our investment in phones into like clicky keyboards
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:19.840]   And like a stylus based touch screens
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:23.280]   And now this other company's going to eat our lunch because clearly
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:26.240]   Multitouch and virtual keyboards are the future
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:29.120]   But we're screwed because we haven't made plans for that
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:34.080]   I know we'll make ways to make it look like and we as that we have some sort of a touch system
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:39.040]   And that's why it gives me the stage of vu when apple's saying look we have you can touch
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:45.120]   Emoji on this tiny tiny little second keep the second screen we've put you and look we've made the touch pad
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:50.960]   The the the the the the the trackpad even bigger so you can do all of those multi touch gestures that
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:58.480]   Of course comes so instinctively to you on a keyboard when you're looking at a screen. That's what that's about 10 miles away
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:38:59.920]   It's like
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:03.040]   We're not screwed. We we definitely back the right horse here
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:06.160]   Yeah, I think it's I think you're right, but I think it's finer grained than that
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:08.160]   I don't think it said they don't believe in touch on the desktop
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:13.360]   I think they don't believe in touch on mac OS just because of how long it would take to actually make mac OS touch compatible
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:17.680]   And they're putting all the wood behind the arrow that is i iPad is for example iPad pro
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:20.480]   They call it a computer now and it doesn't do everything the mac does
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:25.360]   But if it took them four to five years to get mac, oh, and maybe even two years to get mac OS to be a decent touch machine
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:27.520]   Putting two years into the iPad pro
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:32.720]   And I mean they have they have ios running on mac books and running on iMacs and with touch screens and things like that
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:36.320]   But I just don't think they're ready for prime time and apple is exactly the company that says
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:41.440]   We don't believe in video on ipods until they put video on an ipod and then it's we finally cracked this
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:45.280]   Then this is the way touch is meant to be done and we'll see you in veiling
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:47.840]   They'll invent all the computer
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:55.520]   All of you idiots who bought windows 10 machines we're here to rescue you because we know you've been you've been brave
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:58.320]   You've been pretending you've been happy with these touch-based screens
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:00.560]   We know you've been just putting up a brave friend
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:08.720]   Yeah, the mac book pro and this I I hope this doesn't come across sounding more
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:14.320]   More strong than it actually means. This is just a thought that I an impression that it gave me the more I look at it
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:19.760]   The more I use it the more I play with it. It really does seem like this is like as
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:24.400]   I am the master of buying a car with 75,000 miles and
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:28.480]   Driving it until it just disintegrates like the blues mobile
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:32.080]   I'm familiar with the syndrome where you're like, okay, there's a dent in the hood
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:35.840]   But I'm not going to fix it because you know what I'm not going to have this car in two years anyway
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:37.520]   Or the
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:42.560]   How much would it cost to get a to get a stereo that could have bluetooth natively without a dongle that much?
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:45.680]   Well, again, I mean this there's no future in this car. So I'll just deal
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:50.720]   I'll just make a solution that's not optimal, but it will level last me until this thing ends
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:54.880]   I'm seeing a lot of that in the mac book pro. I'm seeing a lot of these
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:59.840]   This isn't a really great way to solve this problem, but it will do until we finally cancel the mac forever
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:06.560]   Which we all know oh, we're not supposed to say that but there is a there is a circle date somewhere on a calendar somewhere in that new campus
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:13.200]   Uh, it doesn't it doesn't look like stuff that is this is a brilliant idea. This is a natural evolution for this platform
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:19.280]   This is the future computing. It really seems more like this is how to make this get another few years out of the platform
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:25.120]   Because we're not really interested in investing and making it relevant for the next five or ten years
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:29.040]   There's you know, there are other issues. I'll talk about those in a second
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:32.560]   I know just one other thing I do like and is that the four type c ports
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:36.560]   I know everybody talks about dongle. Hell and I have my you know my apple
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:39.280]   Dongle utility belt of dongles
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:45.760]   Well, I mean I carry a laptop case and of course in the laptop case I have all the you know adapters and type c
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:52.240]   Cables and stuff and I reach down battering no usb port there it is grappling gun. No, okay thunderbolt port there it is
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:58.160]   Well, for instance, you know, I've got this logitech mouse and the logitech mouse of course has a usb
[00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:04.480]   Type, uh, you know little dongle that you put into the laptop except I can't use it with that
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:07.600]   So I have to put an extender on it that makes it really ugly
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:12.560]   And and dangerous because I could easily break it off. It's things like that that kind of
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:17.920]   You know, I don't know what to do about that. I guess I won't I won't be using this mouse, right? So
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:20.800]   Uh, and I suppose in time they'll be type c
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:27.680]   Connectors from mice and things like that or maybe I would say use a magic mouse, but even I can't oh I can't be that
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:30.960]   Horrible. Yeah. No, but if you want to use a mouse with your laptop
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:34.000]   You're going to be using an adapter so that the mouse could plug into the laptop
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.320]   That's or a straight bluetooth wireless, you know and I have the the one that came out with the macbook
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:46.320]   $79 adapter giant apple adapter that goes type c to to type c hdmi and usb
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:50.720]   What is that old usb type 2 usb a that's it
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:57.760]   Um and no british naval connector on that one hot disk disk so I could plug this in and then plug a mouse into that
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:03.840]   By the way, the first time I plugged this into the new macbook pro. I had to do a firmware update
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:06.800]   Really for a dongle? I never heard of that
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:12.000]   dongle where so uh, yeah, so I had a download installed yeah
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.160]   I don't think the update went to the dongle. I think it was to the macbook pro, but I don't
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:18.400]   I'm not clear on that
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:22.160]   Um, but I do like having four thunderbolt three
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:28.400]   Type c ports on there in fact other world computing just announced today their doc and I immediately ordered one
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:36.400]   Uh, this is the thunderbolt three doc. They say 13 ports endless possibilities 279 bucks if you pre-order
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:42.160]   But the idea is that you now you know you you can now have two 4k monitors hooked up and
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:47.760]   You know you've got ethernet and all this stuff, you know, you know firewire 800 spit if
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:52.080]   Like the backup and iMac. Yeah. Yeah, I think I do think that there's a
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:56.160]   The lord gibbeth and lord take if I do think i'm not a big huge
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:58.720]   Of the dongle of the dongle world
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:02.720]   However, it is nice that you have four ports that can be whatever port you need them to be
[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:08.000]   Sometimes they're oddly enough. There are sometimes where you do actually want two or three different monitors
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:14.640]   Hooked up your disor hook up your thing and you you don't have to be stuck with just two display ports or just two of these or
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:18.240]   And sometimes you do need as many high speed ports as you can possibly get and you can make them
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:23.200]   Multiple high speed ports again. It would be nice to be able to leave the house without something
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:28.400]   In the bag with that and so we also after getting 2,000 bucks out of me. Oh, by the way, you're not
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:30.800]   Don't close that checkbook yet. Right
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:36.560]   It is thinner and noticeably lighter. I mean it does feel very elegant in the hand when you
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:40.880]   Carry it around and you know, this is where apple really excels, but they paid
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:46.320]   I think you be pay a very high price for this new thinnison lightness and this is where I really
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:51.520]   And maybe you heard uh, oh and jj stones rant about this on sunday
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:55.440]   I really feel like oh great. Yeah, he kind of went off on apple
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:57.600]   And uh, and
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:01.760]   Partly of course is the price because these are these are more expensive than the old macbook pros
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:03.520]   They're really quite pricey
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:07.360]   Um, but also, uh, I was very disappointed we talked to kyle wien's
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:10.880]   And I fix it. They do the tear tear downs. They tore it down
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:15.200]   They gave it a repair ability score of one out of ten, which is as low as you can go
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:18.880]   I asked him if there's a zero he said well, I guess there might be but wait for next year as well
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:26.880]   Mostly because uh, everything is uh, mother sawed it on the motherboard anything if a u s if these one of these parts goes bad
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:33.600]   You're replacing the logic board. There's no way to fix that without replacing the logic board unless you've got some master micro sauter
[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:38.480]   Genius at your command. There's also the design choices
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:45.040]   That just that that bother me a little bit for instance these speaker grills on the side are not
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:47.680]   Speaker grills. They're just holes
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:53.200]   The speakers are ported on the bottom on these vents the speaker grills are not connected to the speakers
[00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:57.200]   They are basically cosmetic. This is mr. Johnny ive
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:02.960]   Um doing his thing and I don't that offends my sensibility. I I kind of want
[00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:10.480]   Um to form to follow function and this is a case of uh, of form being completely devoid of function
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:15.840]   But the biggest issue for me and it's not apple's problem exclusively is
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:22.160]   Uh, kyle said this is these are virtually unrecyclable because the batteries are so heavily glued in
[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:28.960]   Most recyclers are just not going to be able to take the battery out. They're not going to have the means to do so
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:34.960]   Uh, and as a result, they're just going to throw it in a pile because you can't grind it down without taking out the battery as we know
[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:40.560]   My batteries you probably don't want to puncture them in any way. So I watched that show and I so like yeah
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:43.440]   I have a lot of respect for kyle lines, but that's a hell of an accusation
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:49.520]   And like I think you know apple takes huge pride in their certification and their recycling programs and they invented a robot to recycle
[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:53.520]   I think it's a lie. I think this is a pr lie from apple
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:47:01.360]   I think they would get an enormous amount like they they would either the the supplier would get in so much trouble from apple or apple would get in
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:06.800]   So much trouble for lying about it that it's sort of like if I said, oh, bob doesn't file his taxes
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:08.800]   And I like you got to do a lot of investigation
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:14.880]   Like you've got to do like the buzzfeed job or like the washington post style job and actually show me your work before you like
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:18.160]   You just can't make an accusation like I think it's it's way too incendiary
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:22.880]   Well, I agree and I I would hope that somebody will do that work and let's get some reporting on it
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:25.280]   But you can't say my friend told me that you can't resale
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:27.520]   I mean that's he that's he what he said well
[00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:31.200]   He talks to recyclers and you know third-party recyclers don't want to go near him
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:35.280]   Uh, he I asked him about apple apple has its own recycling plan
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:39.200]   Uh, he says I know the company that does it they have the same exact problem
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:48.160]   Uh, so this this notion that apple can recycle it comes completely from just assuming that apple can recycle it that they would
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:54.000]   Ask and people were shocked like the thing the basic I check out back is that we would be absolutely
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:58.240]   Flabbergasted if that was the case and that's from people who should know about those things
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:03.360]   So again, like either apple has a massive problem with their suppliers that they're completely unaware of
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:09.360]   Uh, and and should take immediate action to resolve or you know that that's a rather reckless charge
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:15.520]   That has not been substantiated by the proper amount of even would you would you or somebody do me a favor and let's let's research this
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:19.040]   Let's find out what apples recycling. I'm not I'm not an investigative journalist
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:23.120]   But I will ask around but I hope like someone like the buzzfeeds are washing and post or someone takes it up
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:26.560]   Because you know supply there are problems with suppliers we run into them all the time
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:30.640]   And this is something that that if it is true absolutely needs to be given proper attention
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:36.640]   Yeah, there there there are a lot of claims that I hear where there
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:44.320]   Over time you you start to learn to see the waffle language in place where they can say we think
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:48.480]   You can say that this is the best camera that's ever been put in a phone
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:52.720]   And you're listening for the asterisk and you hear the asterisk so okay, that's that's fine
[00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:58.400]   It's going to be based on a set of rules that they have decided constitutes the best phone the best camera ever put in a phone
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:04.080]   And then there's where they they say something so explicit that either this is a company that is
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:08.480]   Absolutely unafraid by the by being smitten by the hand of god
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:15.120]   That they will say or do anything or they're a company that well, let me read you apple's environmental statement
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:19.360]   You tell me if this confenses you that apple can recycle its laptops
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:24.480]   Whereas committed as this is the only part of this environmental statement that talks about this
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:27.040]   Whereas committed as ever to conserving precious resources
[00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:31.600]   In 2015 we diverted more than 89 million pounds of e-waste from landfills
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:37.120]   And more recently we introduced leum a line of robots that can disassemble an iPhone every 11 seconds
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:42.080]   And sort its high quality component site can be recycled reducing the need to mine those resources from the earth
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:46.960]   It's an experiment in recycling technology. We hope this kind of thinking will inspire others
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:49.120]   That's it
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:55.680]   Yeah, that's it they're talking about the iPhone and they're not even saying leum does this for every iPhone they're saying it's a experiment
[00:49:55.680 --> 00:50:04.000]   Now I want to know how they diverted more than 89 million pounds of e-waste from landfills and what it was it maybe they're just recycling boxes
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:09.600]   That doesn't mean they're recycling these I don't think they're making a claim that they're recycling these
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:16.080]   I think they have made that claim, but it is probably bound by the limits of what their technology can accomplish and that may or may not be
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:18.400]   You know
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:20.400]   That's true of any
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:26.480]   Phone and all of these devices we have as a consumer as consumers kind of pushed companies
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:31.440]   To making them thinner lighter and that means built-in batteries that are difficult to remove
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:36.880]   Uh, and I I think as a consumer i'm going to start looking back to the days when I could remove the battery
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:40.400]   It's good for consumers. It means we could take the battery out put in a new one
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:44.480]   With that the device does not need a major repair when the battery inevitably
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:48.560]   Dies as it will in a few years, and it's good for the environment
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:53.360]   I don't know if anybody going in your lithium ion battery anymore though. Yeah. Well, we did it for years
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:59.440]   We removed batteries from laptops apple laptops and others for years. We removed batteries from phones for years
[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:04.560]   They're just they're denser and you just like you you that you hear stories about companies replacing them and then you know
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:07.520]   Little girls blowing up with them. I know they're rare, but I just don't know if people
[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:10.480]   It's like my father used to repair every car used to rebuild every car
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:12.640]   We had and I'd sit there with him and he'd do all that work
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:15.920]   And now he buys a car opens up the hood and has no idea what it looks like anymore
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:21.680]   And it's just it's a symbol of the we've we've we've gone from the point where you actually had to have a mechanic in the early 1900s
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:25.200]   Sitting in a car with you in case it broke down as you were winding it up on its way
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:30.480]   To a point where people could pretty much figure out how to maintain their cars to a point where you open up some of these electrical cars
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:34.400]   And it might as well be like a nasa or or an air force jet that you're opening up
[00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:40.640]   And I think computers are going the same way they're becoming appliances and people who like I used to assemble computers for when I worked in enterprise
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:44.320]   We would get a whole bunch of them. We buy them from a reseller. We'd sit there and we build them and I love that
[00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:45.360]   That was fantastic
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:48.480]   But you know, that's not how most people interact with computers anymore
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:53.200]   Nor should most people have to know how to do all that kind of stuff and these are well our better computers for them
[00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:54.960]   Well, not necessarily
[00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:59.360]   I mean we want to we don't we don't necessarily want to be able to fix our computers ourselves
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:01.440]   But if a trackpad
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:06.960]   This is what happened to me with my not the last mac book but one previous to that the trackpad stopped working
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:14.320]   And any other previous Macintosh that I had it would be I could take it someplace and they'll remove the trackpad
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:19.040]   They'll replace the trackpad and when I try to figure out how much there's plenty of life left in this machine
[00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:21.680]   How much is it going to cost to get it fixed and it was well?
[00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:27.920]   Unfortunately, the the trackpad is integral to the entire bottom plate of the the entire plate of the computer
[00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:33.520]   And the keyboard is also integral to that as well. So we're basically going to have to sell you an $800 component
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:37.440]   To replace what was probably a 20 cent switch that failed
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:41.760]   And this is the sort of trouble that we're getting into where we cannot fix anything
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:46.480]   The answer is well, you know what you have your computer is two is two years and three months old
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:50.000]   It had a good run the fact that the a key the a key on the keyboard no longer works
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   Lots of other stuff is probably we should just sell you a brand new computer shouldn't we?
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:59.840]   It is kind of offensive the idea that for reasons that are very dogmatic
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:06.640]   These computers are excuse me and many of the reasons for making the design and building these computers is where very dogmatic and not functional
[00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:09.680]   That we are giving away the idea that we can
[00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:16.000]   Like my old cars drive them until they're like the blues mobile and they just collapse into component molecules
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:19.520]   They use it's basically the use them until
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:26.320]   Something costs too much to fix and it's something trivial and stupid and then you're you're expected say well you should buy another
[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:29.840]   Thousand dollar one of those as well. Why would you want to keep this one anyway?
[00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:33.040]   It's it's not a good it's not a good trend
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:37.520]   And although I do think that apple probably has a plan for recycling these things
[00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:43.360]   I don't think that I think that intrinsically they do put recyclability into the design spec of everything that they put
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:45.600]   Onto onto the onto blueprints
[00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:48.640]   It might not be obvious it might not be easy, but I think they will have a plan for it
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:56.160]   I think it's silly the idea that we have to we're assuming that if anything goes if anything goes wrong with this computer the entire thing
[00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:59.520]   It's sucked in the trash. It's not going to be possible to fix anything
[00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:03.680]   Because we want an extra three three millimeters of thinness and that's why
[00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:07.200]   That's why if you don't buy the if you don't buy apple care warranty
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:11.360]   Every repair cost is buy a brand new computer. That's stupid
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:17.440]   Well, it's easy to figure out apple says they send all their recycling to power on services
[00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:19.600]   Which is a roseville, California company?
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:24.960]   They mostly try to reuse like you know resell
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:26.720]   Or
[00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:29.600]   Rief side, but so they do but they do do recycling and
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:33.840]   You know if somebody wants to do the legwork on this I'd be very interested
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:36.720]   in knowing
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:42.880]   Exactly what it's doing and whether they are able to recycle this and I would love to know how much apple
[00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:45.840]   energy apple puts into it the fact is
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:50.160]   You know they certainly are prioritizing thinness and lightness
[00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:56.640]   Over recyclability they're gluing those batteries in like a mother so they're essentially becoming iPads
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:55:02.160]   They are this is made like an iPad with no use of serviceable parts and no upgradeable parts
[00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:04.560]   This is very much like an iPad and you know like again
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:09.200]   I don't disagree with Andy and I'm a traditional computerist and I would love to do all those things
[00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:13.360]   I I have dents in my car and I went to get them fixed and they said oh your car
[00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:18.480]   This is one whole panel you can't just take apart this little thing and fix that you've got to replace the entire
[00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:19.440]   And I how much is that?
[00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:20.240]   And I was like oh my god
[00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:22.880]   There's so much money so I have these dents on the side of my car now
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:28.400]   And it's because they've created all these manufacturing and they use everything as part of the rigid shell that makes the car stronger
[00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:30.800]   Or part of the crumple zone and it's this trade-off
[00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:36.320]   We have the apple was talking about how dense these new macbooks are and how rigid they are and how they don't they don't have as much play
[00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:37.680]   And that's so them as a huge feature
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:42.240]   But that comes because they're building the entire frame to be one big part that makes them more rigid
[00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:46.720]   And it's this entire trade-off so you have you know, you have easier manufacturing and a more solid computer
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:50.960]   But if anything goes wrong, God help you because it's all one giant link one linked parts
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:55.840]   And I would like to see this that's the cost of I would like to see the apple language
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:56:02.000]   That says we do recycle this fully and I don't and frankly, I don't I'm looking everywhere in apple statements
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:06.000]   Yeah, they may not say it. I just yeah, I just assume that they're not like if you say they're lying about recycling
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   That's different than saying they don't recycle
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:15.200]   They're not saying they do recycle. They're implying they do and even this Liam which got a lot of attention
[00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:24.320]   Is an experiment and they say not a final they're not they're not even asserting that it's recycling every iPhone
[00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:30.400]   Um, it'd be nice to have a report the way that they do supplier responsibility reports and diversity reports that talks about
[00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:34.640]   And then you get also their recycling stuff focuses on their packaging
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:38.160]   On reusing rather than recycling
[00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:43.840]   Um, I'd like to see something more specific and I think this is a fertile territory for somebody who's
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:49.440]   Want to do some enterprise reporting and some people say oh you're holding apple to a higher standard everybody
[00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:52.480]   But everybody does deserve it. Yeah, they deserve the amount
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:57.120]   No, but they just like they they get so much attention. They deserve an equal amount of attention on everything
[00:56:57.120 --> 00:57:01.200]   So it's like if there's eight companies and another recycling apple still gets more attention
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:04.880]   So give them more attention about not recycling because it will trickle down to the industry and
[00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:11.440]   I mean the real the real point is they're designing stuff intentionally, you know to be thinner and and more compact
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:14.080]   We we know for sure it's not upgradable
[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:19.760]   And then and I would I would at least trust Kyle to the point where I'd say it's not repairable
[00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:23.680]   Uh, they don't yeah, they don't value your repair bill. They don't want you to take it back to the apple store
[00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:30.080]   That's right and apple has tools to repair it and it may well be apple has tools to remove the batteries. I'm sure they do
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:31.760]   um
[00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:33.040]   but
[00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:38.960]   uh, you know, I think they're moving in the let's say they're moving in a direction that makes it more and more difficult to recycle and
[00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:45.760]   What is almost certainly the case if you are going to recycle a macbook pro you should give it to apple to recycle because if anybody
[00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:52.000]   Nobody besides apple seems to have any clue as to recycle it. I believe that's also true
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:55.120]   Uh, I think they take it in for free. I think the most oh yeah
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:57.760]   Yeah, yeah, they you know
[00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:01.120]   Apple wants it back. There's no question. They would like to recycle it for you
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:06.720]   Oh, yeah, because they're the only company that could say wow this this this thing got recycled because it only had three busted keys
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:09.440]   Hey, look well, we're gonna reclaim that that perfectly good screen
[00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:13.440]   We're gonna reclaim that perfectly good crack bed and we're gonna put that back in the back in the pipeline
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:17.440]   No, it's not operable. It's not operable with any of the new stuff and he's just not compatible
[00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:24.400]   And by the way interesting star a story about the 16 gigs of ram. We remember phil shiller said
[00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:28.080]   Uh because uh, it's because of battery life and this in fact may
[00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:31.360]   Really be the case a great article at mac daddy
[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:35.920]   Uh kind of a deeply technical article at mac daddy talking about
[00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:44.800]   Low power ram low power ddr ram and which low power ddr ram apple could use with the intel chip set that they're using
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:48.240]   And the limitations in order to go above
[00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:51.440]   16 gigabytes of ram they would have to use
[00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:58.640]   Uh different system and it would actually use considerably more power. I didn't realize how much power ram uses
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:03.200]   I mean, I get a lot of the it's again. This is an entirely game of compromises
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:08.080]   Why don't they use kb like well the quad core kb likes the ones with intel program intel iris graphics
[00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:10.960]   They aren't ready yet. Why don't they use, you know, 32 gigabytes of ram?
[00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:13.280]   Well, the lpddr support is not yet there yet
[00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:14.960]   Why did they use aand and not in video?
[00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:18.720]   Well amd would let them do basically anything they want with the chip and they can drive the five game monitor
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:22.000]   They want to drive with it. We're in videos a whole different deal. I mean like all of these are
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:24.320]   Compromises to real-world
[00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:26.880]   Manufacturing choice essentially I think if I can boil it down
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:29.280]   Apple's using a mobile
[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:34.960]   Platform and a mobile memory and in order to go past 16 gigs
[00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:41.440]   They would have to use desktop class memory ddr 4 memory instead of the ddr 3 they're using
[00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:45.760]   But the problem is ddr 4 memory uses more than twice as much wattage
[00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:49.840]   Uh the current ram is about one and a half watts
[00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:53.520]   Uh ddr 4 would use three to five watts
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:59.520]   Which would end up being about 20 percent of the overall system power usage just to refresh the ram
[00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:03.120]   And you're putting in more chips so you have more power just from the extra chips
[01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:06.960]   You're putting in for the more memory. So uh, that's credible
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:12.720]   As I always tell people look if you're choosing apple
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:16.320]   You're going to choose to do it the apple way and if you don't want to do it the apple way
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:19.760]   He's no point in complaining about it. Just you're gonna have to get
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:22.400]   By hitting yeah
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:27.760]   Uh because this is what apple the decisions apple may but it's it's good to see the technical reasons behind it
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:33.200]   I think I've decided that if I do if I ever quit journalism and decided to do a hardware setup startup
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:37.120]   I'm going to create a laptop company the name of the company is going to be three quarters of an inch
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:43.200]   Where every single thing we make is no thinner than three quarters of an inch and the our our motto is going to be
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:49.760]   We're going to see how much we can put into this how much usability how much repair ability how much recyclability we can put into this
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.600]   If we just stick with we we first take all of our engineers at hiring
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:01:00.400]   Are you a question number one is are you okay with never making anything thinner than three quarters of an inch?
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:04.080]   I'm so i'm serious if you ask us to hey, we got all this dead air space
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:09.040]   We will say how can you make use of that dead air space either to remove a fan or do something else
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:15.040]   I think that that's an interesting engineering challenge to say that if you know that you have that hard limit that you can't make
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:18.880]   A thinner than that. What can you do with that space? I think you can make some rather exciting
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:22.720]   Machines for with that limitation, but then steve jobs will throw into a fish tank
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:25.120]   You'll see air bubbles and he'll you know fire you on the spot
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:29.920]   It's just that's okay. No, we'll say we'll say but but steve because of because it's three quarters of an inch
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:34.000]   That means we can use this incredibly exotic metal that makes absolutely no sense
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:39.200]   But it's very exciting from a design point of view and he'd say I like the cut of your jib young man
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:42.560]   There was a fantasy life, don't you?
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:48.000]   There's a famous motry all hamburger joint called dick ends where they they have a little door at the front
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.000]   Every hamburger has to be thin enough to slip underneath the door. Oh, that's when they when they serve it to you. Yeah
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.880]   I don't know if thin and hamburgers is really what we're going for here. You just get lots of them. That's our genius
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:01.120]   You have to buy many many of it. Oh, it's like the white castle. Yeah. Yeah, the sliders
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:03.760]   Apple has released if you so
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:11.280]   Anyway on balance, I love this notebook because i'm not the kind of person that needs more than 16 gigs of ram or needs this special
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:14.640]   Graphics capability. I did buy the top of the line 15 inch
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:21.360]   It's very fast. It looks beautiful. I use it all the time and i'm very happy with it and I don't hate the keyboard, which is
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:24.160]   You know better than I expected frankly
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:32.720]   So if you can afford it, I think this is a apples made a lovely piece of kit as in tomsen would say
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:35.680]   Actually might not say that but that's how he would say
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:39.440]   And you know what's great about this said no comic book keycaps
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:43.120]   I don't know they actually have letters on the keycaps this time, which is just fantastic for me
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:46.560]   I can type once again wait until they're changeable letters
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:54.000]   OLED keys I did I did pre-order that other world computing doc because I would eventually like to get those new lj lg a 5k
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:02.320]   uh monitor or two for my uh home office apple has released a document on using 4k displays 5k displays and
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:04.960]   ultra hd tv's
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:06.640]   with your mac
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:08.720]   Why is why is my mac jumping my uh
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:12.720]   It's the dongle. It's the dongle
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:18.640]   All right, let me get out my apple. You know, we're using some sig dongle
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:24.800]   That's my g so that was amazing. You have a person to flames already. I can't believe the failure
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:30.160]   If we're having a dongle issue here, so let me just i'll lose my ethernet, but I can survive without that
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:33.440]   I do have a dongle for the ethernet if I decide i'll
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:36.720]   Double i'd have to double dongle
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:38.960]   um, all right, so now
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.680]   now
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:45.040]   How about now karston is it look better? I'm using the apple dongle
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:48.240]   Yep
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:49.840]   well
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:51.840]   So much for sig
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:57.040]   Wow, it's also by the way hotter in heck this thing is burnt boining
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:01.520]   That's why you pay 79 for an apple dongle. How much was the sig dongle? I mean, it's
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:04.400]   it's um
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:09.040]   I mean, it's silly, but it's you know, sometimes you want a cable that's you know, got a good coordinates well insulated
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:11.120]   All that things
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:13.920]   well, and here's the good news. I also purchased
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:19.360]   a apple brand ethernet adapter and uh, somewhere in here I have the
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:24.320]   adapter that gets me from usb type a to usb
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:28.560]   Type c and I think with the addition of that I can dongle
[01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:31.520]   Into i'm sure it's in here somewhere
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:34.000]   Is it on there?
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:39.280]   Oh, just plug it in right? Okay, there we go. That's right. I have this so now i've double dongled
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:43.520]   and all doubled on i double dongle very yeah, all should be well
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:47.120]   Wow, show time wow
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:48.480]   Yeah
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:56.000]   Every time I mentioned the word dongle it be people will say it should be a show title, but see this this is how badly apple has beaten us down with
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:03.200]   The ubiquity of dongles. We no longer giggle when we hear that word. That's not right. It's not funny anymore. All right dingle yet dongle
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:05.280]   I'm my double dongles dangling
[01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:09.920]   We got a dangle dongle problem here. Okay, let's move on
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:20.640]   So this is a good document to read if you're thinking about driving a 5k display
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:25.680]   uh off of your mac these this is actually kind of challenging this the mst
[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:31.280]   Multiple stream versus sst and and all of that we don't have to play point for you
[01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:34.880]   It's a problem with single stream as it's uh lower refresh rate is 30 hertz
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:41.600]   Um, let's set her uh, etc, etc if you have a multi stream display, you can do it with a new macbook pro
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:43.600]   That's the good news
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:49.040]   But you have to have the uh radian r9 m 370 x graphics card
[01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:55.440]   On the yeah, you're essentially stitching to because again like the uh intel has pushed the display port
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:06:00.720]   Uh, it was supposed to be in skylake then it was supposed to be in kb lake and then it was supposed to be in can and lake
[01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:04.800]   And now we have coffee lake in between those and I wanted to be called coffee cake because it makes me hungry
[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:08.320]   But we they just can't they they have not made the technology available
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:14.000]   So what apple did internally with the iMac 5k was stitched to two displays together through their custom timing controller
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:19.120]   And now they're doing the same thing through the uh, amd card, which is you know, basically you have two displays
[01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:21.600]   And if those aren't done well, it looks like this which is horrible
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:25.600]   Uh, so it has to be properly controlled and you're limited in what you can use
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:28.080]   But the good news is if you have the new macbook pro
[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:33.360]   You and you can use htmi with a 4k display to get 60 hertz refresh
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:36.000]   And that really does look better. You do want the 60 hertz if you can
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:43.360]   You can do it. All right time for a break more to come in just a moment and a nakos Chicago sun times
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:47.120]   And the cu boulder hat which I love
[01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:53.920]   Because my son okay there you go my son's a buff as they quality material. Yes made from the hides of
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:56.560]   tame bison
[01:06:56.560 --> 01:07:00.720]   Also, also rene richy from i more dot com
[01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:05.200]   Where they are currently constructing it looks like the death star uh behind them
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:09.120]   We're gonna have to investigate this new weapons system that i'm more is creating
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:12.160]   Are showing the target
[01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:17.040]   Are so today just make sure you have a ventilation port. Okay. You don't want a death star overheating
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:19.840]   And the chances of somebody
[01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:23.760]   Dropping a bomb in there you that's smaller than a wamp rat
[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:25.760]   Not gonna happen
[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:29.120]   Are showed today brought to you by ring the ring video doorbell
[01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:34.320]   Love my ring again yesterday my ring did its thing
[01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:40.000]   I was uh, I was uh in the in the shower and uh, I heard dawn dawn dawn
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.480]   Because I have ring go into my phone. See this is a doorbell that attaches to your wifi
[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:48.720]   And it doesn't just ring your devices your mac. There's a mac app
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:54.960]   Your your phone your android or ios device, but it also has a camera on the hd camera on it
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:57.680]   And a speaker and a microphone
[01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:01.360]   So I can hear the doorbell ring which I often don't hear
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:06.640]   I can see who it is and then I can even talk to them and say hey leave the package on the front porch or
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:08.960]   You know, oh, hi, honey
[01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:12.960]   I'm in the shower whatever it is and if you've got you know, what is it?
[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:15.680]   Dinging ditch dong and ditch ding dong ditch
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:21.920]   Do you have kids who run up and ring your doorbell and run away? Well, you've got them crystal clear hide. I deaf video
[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:24.160]   Gotcha
[01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:26.800]   I love the ring video doorbell and i'm not alone
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:29.680]   Remember Richard Branson virgin just put a
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:36.880]   28 million led a 28 million dollar investment into ring because I think he sees the future and ring has used that money to good advantage
[01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:42.480]   Expanding their line, so then they have the new ring pro doorbell. It's a little thinner doesn't have the lithium ion battery
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:48.080]   Uh, so it does require a wired doorbell, but you then get a 1080p signal and it's a kind of a smaller
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:50.560]   uh kind of more spilt
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:55.120]   Doorbell I have the original ring video doorbell, but and I love it by the way
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:09:00.880]   Unlike this is one of the things you absolutely need to get when you get an iot device like this is
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:04.800]   Updatable firmware ring is not only updatable. They updated all the time
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:11.200]   and uh, and that is really critical to keeping a secure device on your uh on your network
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:15.600]   So I'm very comfortable with the ring knowing these guys are are putting the energy in
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:21.440]   Uh, not only do they develop a new ring video doorbell the pro version they also have the stick up cam, which is essentially
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:26.960]   A battery powered ring doorbell without the doorbell still got the camera and the speaker and the microphone
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:30.160]   You can put it anywhere in fact pair it with their solar cell
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:33.920]   And you don't even need to give it power. You literally just put it on the wall
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:39.760]   Maybe uh part of the part of the uh yard that your ring doorbell doesn't see and expand
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:43.840]   Your uh your capabilities video recording
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:49.120]   Motion sensing see here and speak with anybody anywhere
[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:52.960]   This is easily the best uh security camera when you pair it with the
[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:57.520]   Solar panel because it charges up during the day and runs all night got great night vision too
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:04.720]   Love this and they have the ring chime which you can plug into the wall and that makes you uh extends the range of your doorbell
[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:10.400]   Using wifi and of course any we've got a bunch of these kits here and any of the kits include
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:15.920]   The lighted sign to let the world know your system is secure your house is secure

[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:26.560]   These are easy to install. I did it which means anybody can do it
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:33.760]   And just a great thing we've had ours for more than a year now and I couldn't live without it ring.com/macbreak
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:37.360]   This would make an excellent holiday gift for a family member
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:41.520]   Maybe you have an older parent who like my mom is worried, you know
[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:44.880]   It doesn't it's hard for her to get to the front door when somebody brings the doorbell
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:49.360]   She you know, it's she takes her a while to get there. This would be a great thing
[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:57.200]   She could she you know, she could say i'm here hold on a second or leave the package or hi grandkids come on in
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:01.040]   ring.com/macbreak for yourself
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:06.720]   For a friend for a family member a great gift save up to $150 off that ring of security
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:11.680]   kit ring.com/macbreak
[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:19.520]   Uh, we have talked all about mac, you know, sometimes I do we do a show where we don't don't even mention mac
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:24.080]   And this was an all-mac show so far. So let's see. Is there anything to say about
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:29.360]   The iphone well apparently there are some iphone six models that are randomly shutting down
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:36.640]   Uh apple is aware of a problem that affects only a small number of phones and they are offering you replacement batteries
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:41.440]   For those units iphone six and six s I guess yeah
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:46.080]   If this isn't uh, so this isn't the same thing as the touch disease though. This is a different thing
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:52.240]   No, the touch disease was where the the capacitive touch sensors were no longer responding on iphone six plus
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:56.400]   Probably because at some point they bent or dropped or something and became dysfunctional
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:00.400]   The apple saying they're admitting now touch disease, but they're saying it's because you dropped it
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:02.640]   Yeah, they're there say yeah
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:05.520]   And again, you can quibble with like how how easy is it to do this?
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:09.600]   So that's something that and and eventually i'm guessing the you will just force them to repair all of them because eu
[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:13.600]   Uh, so uh, but this is uh, you know, like people like john grooper
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:17.680]   We're talking about this happening to them where it would just shut down as though it had reached no battery state
[01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:22.240]   But then you could power it back on oh so it was something was miscalibrated misdone mis
[01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:28.640]   Diagnosed but replaces the battery fixes it so it sounds like it was in the battery itself not not in the firmware software
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:33.520]   Uh, the good news is if the battery issue has hit you that's a free replacement
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:38.080]   For touch diseases $149 replacement that's still a better what better
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:41.520]   That's a way to do it if you're having that problem rather than go to a third party
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:44.320]   Yeah other sad news
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:49.360]   You broke this story for me and because you were at the mac tech conference
[01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:53.040]   And they had a surprise speaker at mac tech
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:13:00.240]   Yeah, uh, sals ago in who is the czar of the user scripting and automation at apple
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:04.080]   Ladies the head of apple script. He's the head of automator. It basically anything that lets you
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:11.600]   Create your own kind of solution without having to fire up xcode. Uh, he is uh, the head of that team
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:18.080]   Uh gave a gave a really cool talk about something that might be my pick of the week if no one talks about it
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:24.240]   Uh, but finish it by kind of shocking everybody by announcing that he has left apple that
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:30.320]   Apple has informed him that for business reasons his position is no longer exists
[01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:35.120]   Uh, there is no longer a need for a product manager of automation technologies
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:41.680]   Uh, and so after he's after a nearly 20 year career at apple. He is not a free agent
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:46.800]   Uh, I get the impression that there's still some eyes to be dotted and teased to be crossed, but that's it
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:52.080]   Um, that's certainly not a good sign for the future of automation technologies at apple because
[01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:57.040]   um as it was I think that apple was treating apple script and automator
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:03.760]   As kind of like when you move into a house and the previous owners of the house had a big player piano in the basement
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:09.840]   And you personally have no interest in a player piano, but it's too big and too cumbersome and too big of a job to remove it
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:11.600]   So that's why it stays
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:16.160]   I think that's but that was apple's attitudes towards apple script and automator for several years now
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:22.000]   And now it looks I feel as though this is a sign that if you that if you get rid of uh, sell
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.640]   Uh, that must be the reason why you just have
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:28.240]   That's certainly not uh, not reassuring for anybody who
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:31.760]   Worries that there's no future for that stuff at apple
[01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:33.440]   It's also no
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:38.480]   It's uh, not a very well kept secret that uh, sal is just one of those guys that
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:43.280]   You want on your team you want to be the head of your team if there's something that's important to your company
[01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:45.360]   You want to someone like sal
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:49.200]   Uh to be the champion of it there are time there's so many great stories about times where
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:52.080]   Some product manager of some
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:54.080]   application at apple
[01:14:54.240 --> 01:15:01.040]   Was waffling on including apple script support or automated support and you know, he that that that manager has
[01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:04.240]   Sal sneaker prince on the top of their desk
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:10.480]   From a point at which he was jumping up and down on it to convince them how important it was that uh, that their app support
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:16.640]   Automator and apple script so the reason why apple script and ottomator could do so many great things is because not because of
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:22.080]   A huge company support behind it, but because this one product manager was defending their users
[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:24.560]   And to make it to make their stuff great
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:30.400]   Uh, so it's very very troubling. Uh, there's a quote on that uh site. He did he did leave a
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:37.440]   The only public statement he has made in public or at least to me to private in private was on his macOSx
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:38.880]   Automation site
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:43.280]   Uh, this one line that uh, that really does power everything he does he says
[01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:48.160]   Uh, I joined apple in january of 1997 because of my profound belief that quote
[01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:54.720]   The power of the computer should reside in the hands of the one using it unquote and that really is everything that he accomplished
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:16:02.160]   And his team uh with automator and apple script saying if there's not a solution for this in this built-in features and apps on apple
[01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:07.440]   That apple gives you we will let you create that solution for yourself because you paid enough money for this computer
[01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:10.640]   You should be able to uh, create your own solutions for it. So
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:13.360]   That's a sad sign that
[01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:18.080]   There is lack there's a lack of a public commitment at least if apple
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:22.800]   intends to replace apple script or the the importance of apple script with another technology
[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:28.240]   They've shown no signs of it and certainly sal would be the person who would head up that sort of new thing
[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:30.320]   So that's not a good sign of anything
[01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:39.040]   This show actually began with sal seguian. So he was uh, we did mac break uh, under the uh, eegis of uh,
[01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:40.400]   Alex lindsey
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:44.800]   First as video you may remember was the first ten of the p podcast that nobody could play
[01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:51.680]   Uh, because it was so like it was this was back in the day when it was just too much for anybody to play back
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:54.080]   barely could edit it
[01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:56.320]   Uh, and sal did us a
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:02.800]   Number of great automator segments, uh with me and others and I just they were fantastic
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:08.080]   I've loved sal we've gone to many cruises together. He was a regular on the, um, geek cruises
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:10.400]   And, um, mac mania
[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:13.280]   It was a magnificent human being beyond all the automators and things
[01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:17.600]   I got an email from Naomi. I saw your tweet and then I got an email from Naomi pierce's wife
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:19.520]   That this had happened
[01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:23.440]   Sal says he's going to take the rest of the month off and then uh starting december 1st
[01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:26.080]   We'll be considering opportunities and available for consulting
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:29.280]   But I agree with you I so for a long time
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:33.760]   Automator and apple script had been kind of the redheaded stepchild of apple
[01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:36.800]   They hadn't been much paid attention to like that player piano in the basement
[01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:40.080]   Uh, but sal kept it going and sal convinced me
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:44.160]   Because I talked to him. I said, you know, I love it, but apple pays no attention to it
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:50.320]   Automator was really an amazing addition to apple script that gave you such programmability
[01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:53.920]   Um, I said, but do people really use it? I mean you've got
[01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:58.880]   Ruby and python and you've got bash scripting and and he said no you have to understand
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:04.720]   This is very widely used it sells a lot of mac and tushes particularly pre-press applications
[01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:11.120]   uh magazine and newspaper publishing people use automator and apple script to stitch together processes
[01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:15.120]   And it's vital for a large number of pro
[01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:21.840]   Business users so many workflows. It's in the workflow. Yeah, and so those people
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:26.000]   I'm sure are starting to think about other solutions, you know
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:31.920]   Uh, then mac and tushes and I think this is more than anything else
[01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:34.640]   a very clear signal
[01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:40.640]   From tim cook and apple that this is not the business they want to be and they are abandoning
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:46.480]   This market this pro market this this uh, it's and admittedly it's probably a small market for them
[01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:49.040]   Especially when compared to the iphone market
[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:53.920]   But I don't not think this is a good harbinger of the future of the mac and tushes
[01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:56.080]   They use those so I mean they use those things internally
[01:18:56.080 --> 01:19:02.160]   Quite a lot too is my understanding somebody in the chat room saying it's death by death by a thousand cuts
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:05.840]   And it is if you see the hockey very long bit by bit. Yep
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:08.560]   Yeah, I mean, it's just it's just it's also
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:14.960]   I think that a lot of people who are fans of the mac who want to continue to support the mac and continue to buy macs
[01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:18.640]   There there at the point where now we're looking i'll i'm sorry i'll speak for myself
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:21.760]   I'm looking for signs that apple really is committed to
[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:27.360]   Moving this platform forward that the fact that it doesn't sell as as much in volume or as in profits
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:31.520]   As iowice devices that doesn't matter they're committed to this is a great platform
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:33.760]   This is a great operating system. These are great laptops
[01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:36.160]   That alone is the reason why we want to move them forward
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:42.480]   And when they let something as great as automator just die on the vine like that more than that when they let someone as great as sell
[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:48.400]   Go, I mean if you just want to if you just want to hire him to be if you if you learn that while sell makes great burritos
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:53.680]   We're going to hire him to be our chief officer burritos and we will have the best burritos in the entire valley
[01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:56.320]   In that in our all of our restaurants
[01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:59.040]   We can't you can't let a guy like that go
[01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:05.120]   And the fact that they don't see the value of sell somewhere in the company or for all i for all i know
[01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:08.080]   Again, I don't know anything that has not been posted there
[01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:10.640]   even it it really speaks well to
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:13.360]   To sell and Naomi that
[01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:15.760]   Even though I hung out for hours
[01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:22.080]   We were at mac tech together and I don't know anything about the situation other than what was posted
[01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:25.280]   So obviously he's not new he's not
[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:28.400]   loose-lipped he's not
[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:34.560]   prone to gossip or to say good or bad for all we for all I know they offered him another position
[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:39.760]   Which he didn't find suitable and this is part of the the this is part of the exit process so to speak
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:46.480]   Yes, I'll always classy to the end right is so so so don't so don't think that like I know anything that anybody else doesn't
[01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:53.040]   But I have to think that I would like to think that I live in a world in which the as soon as as soon as the word gets out
[01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:55.120]   That sells a goi and is up for grabs
[01:20:55.920 --> 01:21:02.320]   Other companies are going to grab him that his commute is just going to go. I don't know a little bit further to mountain view
[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:04.880]   Instead of kupertino this time
[01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:09.280]   Or that he will be there will be two years from now. We will look at two or three different
[01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:15.600]   Different companies to say gee how come this product suddenly became 10 times better with this with the next release
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:19.280]   They did in 2017 2018 and then we'll rewind and figure out oh
[01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:25.600]   Because in 2016 or 2017 that's when sals are growing became a consultant started working for pretty much anybody who?
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:29.760]   Anybody who offered him a project that was interesting. He is way too valuable to let go
[01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:34.080]   And so if this I don't believe that this is a sign that the mac is dead
[01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:36.000]   I don't think this is a sign that apple has lost its
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:44.240]   Lost its way. I do think though for someone like me who is looking for a reassuring sign that they're not content in just
[01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:50.640]   Making dumbing down the mac so that it is as much like a super ipad as possible that they really see the unique
[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:53.600]   advantages of a high performance high power
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:57.120]   Machine something that it doesn't matter that you're just a consumer
[01:21:57.120 --> 01:22:03.520]   You can actually do what you want to do with this. This is not a sign that encourages me that apple is going to be
[01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:08.560]   Pursuing the mac as a as a really important and interesting platform in the future
[01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:12.480]   Very it really bumped me out in ways that go be go beyond my friend
[01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:15.200]   Not having a job that he liked anymore
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:20.720]   So I would just to riff on what Andy was saying like even if you take apples his work as krek vettoreke did email and
[01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:23.680]   You know someone and said, you know, we're totally committed to this technology
[01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:29.040]   And you can choose to believe that or not believe it but to Andy's point salsa going has just so much institutional knowledge
[01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:34.880]   That it's it's a tremendous. There's no there's no spin on how tremendous a loss that is
[01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:37.680]   And if again, we don't know if he was offered another position or not
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:43.840]   But I think any any vp where their salt would would want to grab him up whether it's internally at apple or at google or at microsoftor
[01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:48.720]   Any of it facebook any of the big companies john groover writes this sounds ominous
[01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:55.840]   Uh, just to this week in my review of the new macbook pro's a huge part of my argument for while i why I feel so much more productive on a mac
[01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:57.840]   Than an ipad revolves around the automation
[01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:00.640]   Technology that seguyan's group developed
[01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:04.320]   I have the impression that seguyan was a bit of a rebel within apple
[01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:08.080]   I always had that impression to fight a good fight to keep advancing the max
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:14.160]   Automation tools if they had simply fired him that would be one thing but the fact they've eliminated his position
[01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:20.160]   Is another I find this to be a profoundly worrisome term of events for the future of the mac?
[01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:21.280]   I hope i'm wrong
[01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:23.520]   He also in his endearing fireball blog
[01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:30.080]   Uh quotes dug at him's of dougs apple script for itunes who says the opposite meanwhile i'm optim him
[01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:32.640]   He says all the same things about sal everybody loves sal
[01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:39.280]   Uh, but but but doug does say i'm optimistic about the future of desktop automation on the mac. I guess I have to be
[01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:45.120]   I am not optimistic you don't let you don't it's not that they fired sal it's that they they
[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:48.160]   They got rid of the position
[01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:53.280]   I might guess is you're going to see a major news of much more major reorgs going on inside apple
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:56.800]   So that part could just be the graceful way that you know if like you don't just fire a sal
[01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:58.800]   Like I don't care who you are you don't fire a sal
[01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:03.360]   That might just be a way in which they were moving things around but I think you're going to see a lot more in terms of
[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:07.200]   Um reorganization in in apple software engineering company
[01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:10.960]   So I wouldn't take that part of it like I think his loss is huge
[01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:17.120]   It's detrimental, but I think the the other rest of it is is just a sign of what's going to come as apple grows their software
[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:18.400]   Yeah, I mean
[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:22.320]   It really is the the mind that they're losing it's not it's this
[01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:24.080]   I I
[01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:25.920]   So I spent lots and lots of hours hanging out with him
[01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:28.240]   I do consider him an am to be personal friends
[01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:34.480]   So I should mention that but that only means that i'm experiencing just his mindset on everything in the world
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:39.760]   And this is the sort of person that is can help out any company you're losing a hell of a lot
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:44.720]   I actually I also can't let this pass without mentioning one of the classic stories about sal
[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:51.440]   Which concerns when steve jobs came back to apple and had the basic every let's he came back to apple
[01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:55.920]   And then basically had that big meeting where they had about a hundred different product managers
[01:24:55.920 --> 01:25:00.960]   Altogether in one room so he could yell at all of them and that your technology piece of crap
[01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:04.480]   Your you should be embarrassed. You're you're turning apple to pile of crap
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:09.280]   Just boom boom boom just bang bang bang manager by manager by manager. I think it's just sal
[01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:11.920]   No, no, don't you use this as an important?
[01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:16.000]   This is what and then he basically said no you're full of crap steve you don't understand you
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:22.400]   You only don't like because you don't understand it and this you back and forth back and forth back and forth not polite conversation
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:30.240]   But basically just two elephants just bang bang bang bang bang and then finally like according to the story steve pauses and it says
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:33.120]   Okay, now about the printing structure
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:41.520]   On the map why why why yeah, it's how tells that story and it and you know that that tells you right there
[01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:43.520]   How important sal is to apple
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:44.960]   and
[01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:50.240]   It's just it's very disappointing and as you say i'm all so i should also cop to being a friend
[01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:52.800]   but um
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:57.840]   I just it really it's worrisome to me now if you've been wondering what johnny i has been up to well
[01:25:57.840 --> 01:25:59.840]   here's the good news he's been uh
[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:05.360]   He's been doing a roving making a buck christmas tree for clarages hotel in london with mark nousa
[01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:09.680]   This is actually when we were in london last year. We stayed at clarages is one of the old
[01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:13.840]   You know old line hotels in london wonderful a hotel
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:20.400]   This says kimorfism was dead look at this is quite beautiful. It's a immersive christmas tree installation
[01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:22.560]   uh
[01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:26.960]   A magical experience in the lobby of the hotel which is in the very posh
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:29.840]   mayfair district of uh of london
[01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:33.200]   So for the installation the entrance to the hotel has been lined with
[01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:38.000]   Four meter high light boxes that glow with black and white photographs of snow covered
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:38.800]   silver
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:44.000]   birch trees and then real birch trees are placed in front of the backdrop in small mounds of artificial snow
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:47.040]   While larger pine trees stand in the foreground
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:49.920]   What are you laughing at? Andy this is uh
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:53.600]   No, no, I just you know, I remember as a little kid
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:57.760]   You know my mom and my dad would just bundle up all of us little kids
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:03.600]   To drive down in the station wagon to the middle of town to look at the bear christmas tree with all of the
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:06.240]   projections projected on it with the
[01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:08.400]   with the simulations of birch trees around it and
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:15.040]   Ah, god. What a what a wonderful church holiday memory that it's in one corner the charlie brown christmas tree
[01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:20.480]   This is very john. I've in johnny. I've in one corner a young meter high tree stands on its own
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:23.440]   something the designers describe as
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:26.240]   Symbolic of the future
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:29.360]   If this is johnny. I was future. I I'm a little worried for
[01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:32.560]   A lot like christmas

[01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:08.560]   Ideas push the world forward
[01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:12.880]   Introducing a tool for all the ideas to come
[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:16.720]   MacBook pro
[01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:19.040]   And explode a light bulb with the touch bar
[01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:27.200]   Wow, that is just weird. That is heroically stupid. That is a heroically stupid. There's a new one frankie's holiday
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:30.960]   Relax
[01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:34.560]   So there's a music box. He's recording into the iphone
[01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:39.520]   Okay, is that santa or frankenstein? I think it's frankenstein
[01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:41.520]   Oh
[01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:45.600]   We're not here
[01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:49.440]   Wait, wait, wait, oh he's testing off his top hat
[01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:53.680]   He's going to the mailbox
[01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:58.320]   And there's a truth check their career. Yeah. Well, no, it's frankenstein. He's got the bolts
[01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:01.680]   Wait a minute. Who is that actor?
[01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:03.840]   That looks familiar. Is that dr. Who?
[01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:05.680]   Okay, and then
[01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:10.000]   Go back to the street with the exploding light bulbs. He's carrying the box that he got in the mail
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.560]   Oh my god, it's it's the monster
[01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:18.400]   Oh, who is that just needs moisturizer. That's all come on
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:25.360]   Franky's plugging in the light bulbs into his bolts and he's gonna
[01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:30.640]   Play the music box
[01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:32.640]   No
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:35.200]   It's like
[01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:37.760]   For the holidays
[01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:42.720]   People are staring at him with puzzled expressions. Oh
[01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:45.680]   One of the light bulbs goes out. Oh, we're frankie
[01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:49.680]   Give him a macbook. Oh, the little girl's gonna give him some
[01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:55.520]   Micky
[01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:57.680]   She just taps the light bulb it comes back on
[01:30:57.680 --> 01:31:00.160]   Everybody's
[01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:16.320]   Nobody knows the lyrics of that song
[01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:18.320]   I've ever heard a way to
[01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:21.120]   All though
[01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:25.120]   Open your heart to everyone
[01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:31.600]   So this is the analog of the ad apple did where the apple employees were going over to the microsoft store on fifth avenue last year
[01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:39.440]   Now it's frankenstein and amazing. I think it's the same director who did that ad where the kid was not relating to his family until he made a video for them
[01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:41.520]   That was a good ad. Leave us the same director both
[01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:44.320]   earlier ads featured
[01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:50.720]   Products being used. These are more. I don't wow. There's still a new Drake ad leave
[01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:53.520]   I mean if none of this did it for you. There's the book end to the Taylor Swift
[01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:58.480]   Um treadmill video now with Drake all right. I'm breaking a bench press Drake versus the bench press
[01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:04.400]   I mean look at the Drake apple music Drake
[01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:10.080]   There's Drake lifting pump and iron lifting the dumbbells
[01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:12.640]   Oh
[01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:15.680]   No mercy
[01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:21.920]   He's got a I didn't know he had a pumpkin tattoo that's interesting. So he's looking at his phone. He's playing bad luck
[01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:26.080]   You know it used to be lip syncing
[01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:28.960]   So take a look what you've done
[01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:32.080]   Cause baby now we got bad blood
[01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:38.560]   Oh no, dude. Is Drake that street really though? I always thought of him as more. He's from the six. He's from Toronto
[01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:40.560]   Yeah, he's more Canadian six
[01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:47.520]   From the winter streets
[01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:50.160]   Hey, if you could survive the winter streets of Toronto
[01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:56.320]   Now he's now he's lifting like you know, that's like two hundred he's pressing 225 there
[01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:59.760]   It's 90 180 plus 45
[01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:02.560]   That's got two. Oh it hurt it
[01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:07.120]   You don't ever want that to happen. Okay. No, he was
[01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:10.800]   Pressing 225. Oh, he's been Taylor Swift or both in urgent care right now
[01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:17.040]   I feel like apples at agency might have lost its way a little bit
[01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:23.680]   I don't know what's being advertised here. This is this is this is definitely apple as lifestyle as opposed to yes
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:26.720]   But what do I get for my two thousand three hundred dollars or madam?
[01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:31.680]   So they're saying that the the frankenstein was everybody loves Raymond Raymond
[01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:34.240]   Was it was it? No
[01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:38.560]   Ray Romano. I don't think so. It wasn't Ray Romano, but it might have been somebody on that show
[01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:41.360]   The brother. Oh was it?
[01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:44.400]   It looked like somebody. Yeah, it looked like the brother
[01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:48.240]   Yeah, maybe somebody it's hard to tell with frankenstein makeup on
[01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:49.920]   um
[01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:51.600]   Okay
[01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:53.600]   Well apples got a lot of money
[01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:56.960]   I preferred the midnight the one they did for midnight
[01:33:56.960 --> 01:34:01.600]   And the go time I think for the apple watch that both of those were really well done
[01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:03.600]   Yeah
[01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:09.760]   Yeah, I don't know they get they I think that this is not the sort of thing that you text your friends to go watch
[01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:14.880]   Coca-Cola has a new uh, cgi polar bear commercial. I'm looking forward to that
[01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:21.680]   Always looking forward to the the the Hershey's kisses that play. We wish you a merry christmas. That's a classic
[01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:26.960]   I get it. It's fun as opposed to the I don't I yeah, okay
[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:34.160]   I'm glad they have they have like a holiday one. That's all it's it's always like 10 p.m
[01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:37.120]   And it's over cranking Stein in the new apple ad
[01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:42.720]   See if serina here's what I found on the web for who plays frankenstein. That's pretty
[01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:46.560]   All right carol nice
[01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:50.720]   That's just good casting
[01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:54.080]   How much you think you got paid to do that?
[01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:56.800]   That's gotta be good payday
[01:34:57.440 --> 01:35:02.960]   Uh, and they had I got a whole village and people who knew the lyrics to that song. It's not cheap
[01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:08.560]   Now how do you feel about apple?
[01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:13.680]   Got johnny. I've designing lobby installations for the clergy's hotel
[01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:22.240]   You got the frankenstein ads or bulb bursting ads. Well the frankenstein ad at the end is it's it says it's basically um
[01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:26.880]   An inclusivity video. Yeah. No, it's it's following along on that
[01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:29.360]   one where they sang to the
[01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:34.000]   Microsoft stories that same kind of feel good. I think this I think this is for a different climate
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.560]   Like I wouldn't put it past them to try to make a point
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:41.440]   Wait a minute. Do you think that's political? No, I wasn't no not political
[01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:48.080]   But I think that in a time of division I think they were very deliberate in making it a very inclusive one way even the monster deserves christmas
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:51.520]   I would expect that it's very interesting to watch the ultra liberal
[01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:55.440]   Companies in silicon valley kind of trying to deal with this
[01:35:55.680 --> 01:36:00.320]   You know apple could really be this could be a boon for apple. Um, tim cook has been begging
[01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:06.880]   for uh forgiveness on the uh tax consequences of repatriating the billions of dollars they have
[01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:08.800]   overseas
[01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:12.240]   And uh, president elect trump is indicated that he wants to do that
[01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:17.760]   So this could actually irony he had his social agenda, but not his fiscal one then you'll have his fiscal agenda, but not his social
[01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:21.040]   It's just so unpredictable. It's hard to know what exactly is going to happen next
[01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:23.760]   But i'll be watching the twitter to make sure to find out
[01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:29.840]   Um app store fees will be cut in half for video services according to the verge
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:35.200]   Um, what does that mean? I don't it's going to cut. Oh, I get it
[01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:39.120]   Okay, actually this comes again from blunberg that german fella
[01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:42.400]   It all starts actually this is lucas shaw
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:44.240]   Alex web
[01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:46.960]   So you know that apple charges 30 cents on the dollar
[01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:49.600]   For purchases on the app store
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:52.000]   They would like to get more
[01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:54.800]   streaming apps in the app store
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:37:00.080]   And uh, they had cut didn't they cut the price for streaming music for some after
[01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:03.840]   Everything but yeah, but it was after a year and I think this just takes it a step further
[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:06.880]   this is uh from 30 percent to 15 percent
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:14.480]   For subscription video streaming apps in other words nephlix really what uh apple doesn't have in its tv app is nephlix
[01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:17.040]   This is clearly a little hey
[01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:23.040]   Come on nephlix work with this here work with this here and I don't think the tv app really makes sense until you have
[01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:29.440]   All of the streaming apps that you use in there then it makes a lot of sense then it's an aggregator that I can really use
[01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:32.160]   But when you have the big boy
[01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:36.160]   Netflix holding out that's a problem. So maybe this is their way of well
[01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:40.560]   I think like there was there's been rumors for years that the big the big companies had sweetheart deals to begin with
[01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:44.080]   Uh, so it's probably just levels app playing field. I would expect that right
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:49.360]   Yeah, I mean you negotiate. I mean it's like the same with any vendor when you have someone who contributes that much towards your
[01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:51.840]   your portfolio they tend to get better terms
[01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:57.840]   Apple uh is going to host hour of code workshops next month December 5th
[01:37:57.840 --> 01:38:05.120]   Through 11th at apps stores around the world. I think this is a great thing. They've opened up registration for their workshops
[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:09.840]   They're doing it with code dot org code dot org each year does the hour of code
[01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:12.480]   I've been to two of them now and they're fantastic
[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:18.160]   Nice what are you doing? So, um this year it's greatly expanded
[01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:21.840]   Previously, it was just literally one hour and you'd show up and I took my godkids and
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:25.520]   They would give you those sort of fundamental job. It was those I forget the name of it
[01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:27.520]   It was the code dot org the code dot org stuff
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:32.400]   Where it just let kids move blocks around to accomplish very simple tasks and make very simple chains
[01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:34.080]   They're gonna use playgrounds
[01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:34.320]   Yeah
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:37.440]   And I think they're gonna have it on multiple days and there's a new playground
[01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:40.720]   There's a new download in so playgrounds got updated to playgrounds 1.1
[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:45.360]   And there's a new download in there that goes with the code dot org stuff that they're going to be doing for hour of code
[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:50.080]   Which is which is really awesome and the apple does offer a free
[01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:53.760]   Guide if you are
[01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:55.920]   Want to do your own hour of code workshops
[01:38:55.920 --> 01:38:57.840]   So if you're a teacher or school
[01:38:57.840 --> 01:39:04.000]   You can download the guide and then have a curriculum to do this yourself using uh, you'd have to have an iPad
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.320]   and uh the
[01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:12.880]   Playgrounds, but this is a facilitators guide freely available for people want to host their own hour of code. We should do that here
[01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:15.680]   That would be really fun
[01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:18.240]   Um, that would be really fun
[01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:22.720]   So so what happens you have it you have an instructor or
[01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:27.520]   Yeah, so the apple staff apple has all these educational people there who are doing workshops all the time anyway
[01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:31.440]   So they all sort of uh we had close to I think an instructor to child ratio
[01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:34.240]   It was magnificent and the kids sit there with their ipads
[01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:38.320]   And I think they had a couple maxed up and they the people go around and help them with the projects
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:41.920]   And they had like they have a speaker in the front and it was really well done
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:48.000]   Here's how you start draw a smile. I have pictures up on iMore but I don't have the oral with me handy
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:52.800]   This is really great. They give you in the facilitators guide. They really they tell you what to do
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:56.080]   So you don't have to really even know how to code particularly
[01:39:56.080 --> 01:40:00.960]   Um, it would be helpful of course, but it's very beginning stuff. I mean it's four loops and stuff
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:05.280]   But uh, that's neat for middle school and above on ipad
[01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:09.360]   Next steps for high school and above on mac next steps
[01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:13.920]   Really great by the way microsoft has announced that they're going to put
[01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:21.600]   Microsoft visual studio on the macintosh yep, which is a little interesting. What do you what is what do you make of that?
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:25.920]   Uh, I think it's just it's a microsoft being sorry and you go ahead
[01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:33.440]   No, just that uh, it's uh, it's an important development app development platform is great for business great for enterprise
[01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:39.680]   It's how you make tools for everything. It's also how you make tools that support office exceptionally well and microsoft's play
[01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:45.040]   In the 21st century has always been we don't care what hardware you run our software on
[01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:50.400]   We don't care the context which you run our software so long as you run our software and support our development and super services
[01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:54.960]   So this is part this is just as important as what they're for what they're doing as putting office on
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:57.520]   Every mobile operating system there is
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:41:04.560]   We've talked before about apples chip choices on the cd ma version of the iphone versus the gsm
[01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:10.080]   iphone and uh, according to bloomberg technology once again, um
[01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:12.560]   apple
[01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:13.680]   Is
[01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:21.120]   slowing down lte on verizon so that is as slow as on at and t
[01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:28.720]   uh, according to researchers at a company's called twin prime incorporated and cellular insights
[01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:35.760]   Neither firm says why but twin prime says it may be because apple isn't using all the potential of a crucial component in the verizon
[01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:39.680]   version it's not using all of uh, of verizon's network
[01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:49.680]   Capabilities the twin prime says we don't think they're throttling the iphone, but maybe they're not enabling all the features of the cd ma version
[01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:56.000]   It's it's always been said that you want to use the cd ma version of the iphone because it has the qualcom chip
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.880]   Versus the less capable intel chip
[01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:05.280]   I would just go with qualcom anyway because they've been doing it for so long intel will get their legs, but I don't know if they have it now
[01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:12.000]   Um apple is funny like so what they typically do is they said this is what we want to support for this phone and every chip has to support that
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:18.160]   And some ships will do better than that but apples might just say we want three x carrier aggregation for the iphone seven
[01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:22.240]   It doesn't matter that chip does forex or doesn't matter that there's an fm radio on the chip as well
[01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:24.480]   They just have no interest in those things and it's not
[01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:26.880]   It's not that
[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:32.480]   No, no, don't you see you're so Canadian you're apologizing because I interrupted you
[01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:34.880]   Well, I was like they've had FM radio capabilities and I was forever
[01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:37.440]   It's just not a part of the chip that they enable and there's all sorts of things
[01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:41.280]   I mean you're dealing with carrier aggregation and and the different features don't want that
[01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:46.080]   They said a target and they said this is what we want for the phone and if the chip does extra things that's fine
[01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:49.760]   But it's not they're not taking anything away. It's just a feature. They never plan to implement right
[01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:57.920]   Uh, I'm just I'm gonna still get the Qualcomm thing because I you know I trust them more and I believe it's probably a better better modem
[01:42:57.920 --> 01:43:05.200]   Yeah, that was always the the story was get the Verizon version. It's the best iphone because you can it's the most capable
[01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:09.120]   I'll spare you my rant about how cdma in the us in china has held back the rest of the world
[01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:13.040]   Uh speaking of china
[01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:17.840]   One of the big question marks with a new trump administration is what kind of trade
[01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:24.720]   Issues are going to come up with china. Uh, of course currently we have a favorable trade situation from chinese point of view
[01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:28.240]   Trump's talked about increasing tariffs and punishing china
[01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:33.680]   In other ways which would make it very challenging for companies that manufacture in china
[01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:38.480]   Devices to be sold in the united states and I could guarantee you right now in apple
[01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:45.440]   They're thinking about well. What do we do if suddenly we have a 15 percent or more tariff on products made in china
[01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:52.320]   Apparently according to uh, edward moir running at cnet apple has told asian firms
[01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:59.040]   That manufacture the phone to explore the possibility of relocating production to the us
[01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:08.080]   Um, that is an interesting note. We've seen before that the uh estimate is that the cost of assembly, which is fairly low
[01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:12.720]   Would add merely four or five dollars to the overall price of the iphone
[01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:15.680]   but according to the nike asian review
[01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:18.800]   and anonymous sources
[01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:20.400]   apple has asked
[01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:25.760]   Two firms to look at uh fox con and pegatron which make you know a lot of stuff for apple
[01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:30.560]   About uh, what would it take to build a factory in the us they've done this before remember fox Tron
[01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:37.440]   Built a factory in brazil when brazilian tariffs got out of control. They were looking at it for india too for similar reasons
[01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:45.040]   Yeah, india it's not merely tariffs india really wants to uh restrict products to those made in india
[01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:49.440]   And uh and and puts all sorts of burdens on companies that aren't
[01:44:49.440 --> 01:44:56.720]   Uh, I mean lictonstein could demand that all lictonstein and iphones be made there too. I mean right for direction. We're heading. Yeah
[01:44:56.720 --> 01:45:04.160]   Yeah, I mean it makes sense. They're certainly looking into that series. I'm sure that that uh research has been ongoing far beyond
[01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:07.520]   Uh, this car in administration because all that has to do again
[01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:14.720]   The the sand is shifting underneath people's feet any company that does not have an idea of what they would do if they were if it suddenly became
[01:45:14.720 --> 01:45:20.720]   Uh, too expensive or too cumbersome to produce all of their stuff where they're currently producing it
[01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:23.760]   They've got to have a plan b or else they're they're absolutely sunk. Yeah
[01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:26.720]   It's hard it's hard to do motor
[01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:32.240]   Motorola tried that a few years ago though and they quickly shifted from we're making this phone completely in the united states too
[01:45:32.640 --> 01:45:37.120]   We're making doing some assembly in the united states to suddenly not talking about that anymore
[01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:40.640]   So maybe again, it's it's not so much that that can't be done
[01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:46.240]   But under the climate that existed three four years ago. It was really really not of uh an easy thing to do
[01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:48.800]   Made in texas right right
[01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:52.800]   Because you only needed to make a few hundred 18. Yeah, ever ever
[01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:56.160]   No, the thing is like it's not minor settings. It's not so much again
[01:45:56.160 --> 01:45:58.960]   It's not so much the cost but it's the proximity like they have a
[01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:05.760]   China set up the send gen industrial zone and they have other industrial zones where all those buildings and all those people are close together
[01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:09.920]   And the us could set up the texas industrial zone or wherever there's huge
[01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:13.840]   The navada like right next area of 50 51 there could be an area 52
[01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:19.680]   That's an industrial zone and you build all those buildings and then you staff them up image. It's just it's a logistical undertaking
[01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:21.680]   You know, it
[01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:29.360]   Of course the idea is that you bring jobs back to the united states the question is whether you really would or would would these factories be highly automated?
[01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:35.200]   Even fox kind of china is moving towards highly automated factories. Yeah, uh, and do people want those jobs? I mean, they're not
[01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:42.320]   I see you know, I'm not I'm no genius on this stuff, but my suspicion is when it really comes down to
[01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:45.280]   uh this kind of trade war that
[01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:52.320]   That the us and back down on this is there's you'll actually cost far more jobs some estimates are
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:55.600]   unemployment would go to nine percent if you suddenly
[01:46:56.160 --> 01:47:00.320]   um start of a trade war with china and other trading partners
[01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:03.040]   It's it's a bad thing. It's a it's a it's a
[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:06.880]   Wonderful thing to get to say to get people to cheer and vote for you
[01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:10.880]   But then as we as we saw with obama as we saw with bush
[01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:16.800]   And we saw as we saw with every president then you get inside the office and you get to see all the information and you're seeing
[01:47:16.800 --> 01:47:22.000]   Oh dear. Yeah, that that that that's that's not that's not a good thing. Yeah. Yeah, that may not work
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:25.920]   Yeah, I don't know. I guess it's when it really when the when the rubber hits the road
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.800]   It's this is we're not going to see a trade war with china. I would hope no
[01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:34.480]   They'll they'll slap a 30 terraffin any hotel with the president's name on it and it'll just change there's all sorts of nasty things
[01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:38.000]   We had we had a uh the kabek premier
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:41.360]   Like our version of the governor was running for election and we have a civil service
[01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:45.440]   That's roughly the size of california even though kabek is I don't know one one thousandth the size
[01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:50.000]   And he he said that he was going to reduce the size to a manageable level and that lasted all of a week
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.800]   Selection because reality is they run the government
[01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:56.800]   This is always and that's why everybody says politicians lie you make a lot of promises
[01:47:56.800 --> 01:48:02.000]   uh during the election cycle and then reality sets in or and and you know
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:05.360]   That's this I think we're used to this by now, right?
[01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:07.200]   I think I told this story before but you know
[01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:11.840]   I knew a guy who wanted to work at apple for years and years and years and he went there and while he was doing his orientation
[01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:15.440]   He said, you know, I have all these ideas to fix these things and they said wonderful
[01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:19.600]   Here's the first time we tried and this is what happened the second time we tried this would happen the third time
[01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:22.720]   I mean if you could figure it out go for it, but we've been trying to do those things for years
[01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:27.360]   But to be fair, Trump continues to reiterate that in his first day in office
[01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:35.600]   He's going to announce his intent to withdraw from a tpp and nafda and uh, we'll see we'll just see what happens but uh
[01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:43.760]   That that was very much effect app not tcpip. That's something totally different. No, you can't withdraw from tcpip. We're all deeply embedded in that
[01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:46.720]   Uh, let's take a break and your picks of the week
[01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:52.480]   Still to come as we continue to talk apple on mac break weekly with andy and naco the chicago

[01:51:14.320 --> 01:51:20.000]   So mine is actually and I I wasn't able to open the dock don't ask i've started up a new computer
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:21.680]   And I'm just getting a beach ball in my browser
[01:51:21.680 --> 01:51:26.160]   But uh if you go to imore.com slash gift dash guide
[01:51:26.160 --> 01:51:30.240]   So i already called one and I spent most of the weekend putting together our top picks
[01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:34.640]   For people who are shopping whether it's for black friday or for the holidays
[01:51:34.640 --> 01:51:37.360]   And we basically went through everything and picked our favorite
[01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:41.680]   You know from big stuff like our favorite iphone our favorite ipad our favorite mac
[01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:44.560]   but also other things like headphones and um
[01:51:44.560 --> 01:51:47.600]   peripherals and you know
[01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:52.080]   Almost anything we could think of that we thought that would go well with people who like sort of apple
[01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:52.720]   E stuff
[01:51:52.720 --> 01:51:58.800]   So if you are on the lookout for a new phone for a new uh computer for music gifts for uh sort of
[01:51:59.280 --> 01:52:02.320]   Any of those things those are the sanheiser headphones that's I will vouch for those
[01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:06.240]   I just bought those uh because I wanted to see what the best bluetooth headphone
[01:52:06.240 --> 01:52:09.920]   Currently could do and bluetooth is the problem
[01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:13.840]   I mean the headphones are great, but they sound much better wired than they do on bluetooth. They'll be honest
[01:52:13.840 --> 01:52:14.800]   Yeah
[01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:19.200]   But it's those weird like you can crack them like it looks like a chiropractic move where you like you twist them around
[01:52:19.200 --> 01:52:21.760]   They're gonna hold them out. Yeah, they're great. Yeah, and they're pricey
[01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:24.880]   But if you want the best bluetooth, this is as good as
[01:52:24.880 --> 01:52:27.200]   And we have some non pricey stuff on there too like you know
[01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:30.560]   They're like the the ui the ue boom two is great little bluetooth
[01:52:30.560 --> 01:52:33.840]   speaker and we have home theater side there's just
[01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:36.560]   photography stuff all sorts of
[01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:41.040]   The stuff that we that we sort of love and we're gonna do individual articles like we're gonna have georgia and srenity and lori
[01:52:41.040 --> 01:52:43.120]   Everybody do their own personal wish lists
[01:52:43.120 --> 01:52:46.240]   But we wanted to get something up just for people who might be shopping this week
[01:52:46.240 --> 01:52:50.560]   Georgia was great on twit this week by the way that whole twit show was magnificent
[01:52:50.560 --> 01:52:55.840]   Wow veritan day. Oh doctor and georgia. Oh doctor and georgia have a little thing going on
[01:52:56.480 --> 01:53:00.960]   Yeah, they fell off each other. It's so cute. I agree by the way apple photo books
[01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:07.040]   People forget but you you know that is a really easy fast way to do it. We always do our christmas cards through apple
[01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:11.200]   Okay, the twig business cards for many years
[01:53:11.200 --> 01:53:16.240]   I would take all the photos I took of my godkids throughout the year and make a photo book and give that to their parents
[01:53:16.240 --> 01:53:19.280]   So that you just get a copy of that I did that for their first five years each
[01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:23.840]   Uh, you know as they get older the books don't they aren't I don't know that's not it's not that
[01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:27.680]   It's not that they're not important anymore, but it's just when you have all those baby years in that little book
[01:53:27.680 --> 01:53:30.400]   It's just an easy home run of a present. Yeah
[01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:32.640]   I was looking for that
[01:53:32.640 --> 01:53:37.600]   I was looking for that just a couple weeks when I couldn't find in photos where you order books and prints and stuff
[01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:42.160]   I think it's in the I think it's in the project. You know photos is so damn opaque
[01:53:42.160 --> 01:53:48.640]   Yeah, I don't the you the ui. It's like I like it. It's streamlined but try and figure out how to do something
[01:53:48.640 --> 01:53:52.160]   I have made them in there. So I know it is possible. I just haven't started photos on this
[01:53:52.400 --> 01:53:57.680]   I want a new computer and I've not started photos on it yet. And so now it wants to use iCloud library. No, no, not now
[01:53:57.680 --> 01:54:01.360]   Memory view that download they go
[01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:06.960]   Uh album projects. I bet it's in projects. Yeah, it's in projects
[01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:12.960]   So what you do is you command five and he command five. Okay. You have to actually go to the menu
[01:54:12.960 --> 01:54:15.680]   and then choose projects
[01:54:15.680 --> 01:54:18.160]   and then you can uh
[01:54:18.160 --> 01:54:19.200]   You can do it
[01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:21.200]   click the create menu to begin making
[01:54:21.920 --> 01:54:25.440]   Your own book card calendar prints or slideshow
[01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:31.760]   See I have to I screwed myself here. I couldn't I couldn't find it no matter how much I looked for it and then immediately
[01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:35.440]   And I had some version of the thought well
[01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:40.800]   It's a feature that I really really liked so I have to be open to the possibility that apple killed it for that reason
[01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:42.720]   It's so hard
[01:54:42.720 --> 01:54:43.760]   Look at this
[01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:48.720]   I'm a book so I'm gonna do uh, let's see our calendar or card. I let me do a book
[01:54:49.120 --> 01:54:55.120]   I have to say they and the thing to remember there are lots of people that do this a lot cheaper than this
[01:54:55.120 --> 01:54:59.840]   But they do they use printers that aren't as good apple really uses the best printers
[01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:04.640]   Um, you know, I have some that are 10 15 years old. Yeah, that's great. They're they're full bleed
[01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:07.520]   The screening is really high quality
[01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:13.040]   Um when my mom sold her house, we we took all the photos of us growing up in the house and made it into a book and gave it to her
[01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:14.880]   Great. Oh
[01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:18.480]   Yeah, that's sweet. That's really yeah, there's a lot of great things you can do with them
[01:55:18.560 --> 01:55:20.000]   Yeah
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000]   Andrew in not co
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:26.640]   Pick of the week. Uh now is a great time to uh, uh to pimp uh south segoyans
[01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:35.440]   Incredible automation websites. He would on his own would create these non apple sites that are say this website is not hosted by apple
[01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:39.840]   Incorporated, but they really should have been because they just are these amazing
[01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:42.800]   Uh, websites tutorials that
[01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:48.160]   Sure, what is possible and just only just encourage you to learn apple script and automator
[01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:54.160]   But actually give you working code that inspires you to wow, you know how like once every tuesday morning
[01:55:54.160 --> 01:55:58.960]   I have to like give that 10 minute presentation with all the data that we collected over the weekend
[01:55:58.960 --> 01:56:03.440]   And it takes me like 45 minutes on monday night or an hour on monday night to put it together
[01:56:03.440 --> 01:56:09.040]   I could actually spend one hour once writing an apple script to actually build a beautiful
[01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:14.640]   keynote presentation based on the data that I have from wherever it is right now and often it was click one button
[01:56:14.640 --> 01:56:16.960]   And instead of being
[01:56:16.960 --> 01:56:19.760]   12 12 hours old it will be maybe five minutes old
[01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:23.920]   And honestly, I even I didn't know like what I could be doing with keynote
[01:56:23.920 --> 01:56:25.680]   Uh, he gave this app
[01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:28.720]   That's part of the talk that sal gave at mac tech on wednesday
[01:56:28.720 --> 01:56:35.280]   And I was giving the closing keynote on friday and on wednesday night. I could you not I had to talk myself out of
[01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:39.680]   Taking this presentation that I'd written that was compo it was finished
[01:56:39.680 --> 01:56:45.840]   It was done and thinking maybe I should just like write an apple script to build it automatically because that would be cool
[01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:48.240]   said Andy
[01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:54.160]   Don't don't you you do why do you want to spend a bunch of time learning something brand new to just
[01:56:54.160 --> 01:56:59.440]   Replicate what you've done automatically, but it really has gotten me inspired that maybe the next time I give a presentation
[01:56:59.440 --> 01:57:04.960]   I'm oftentimes like the very very last night before I'm running through and I see that all that doesn't need to be there
[01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:06.960]   Or maybe I should add this
[01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:11.040]   It'd be really cool to be able to just simply create an omni-outliner outline
[01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:14.800]   That just has like the information I want to present
[01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:20.000]   And then a script is at the very like 10 minutes before I go on is what builds it into the great
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:23.200]   The great presentation with all the all the transitions and stuff
[01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:26.960]   And it's not just keynote is like everything you can do to automate your workflow
[01:57:26.960 --> 01:57:33.360]   On on a mac. It's right there. It also has uh, there are subsites underneath there
[01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:41.440]   If you can there's a macosx automation.com. There's also his latest site dictation commands.com. He gave this amazing
[01:57:41.440 --> 01:57:44.000]   demonstration on wednesday
[01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000]   that
[01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:51.440]   It just it's you think that syri is kind of interesting and kind of useful
[01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:55.680]   uh dictation commands he just showed with some scripts that he added to
[01:57:55.680 --> 01:57:58.960]   To just as a user to the mac
[01:57:58.960 --> 01:58:02.960]   He was able to have the mac do everything just by voice command
[01:58:03.440 --> 01:58:04.880]   And not
[01:58:04.880 --> 01:58:10.560]   Run this script named this now run this script named this it's I want to create a presentation
[01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:12.480]   I'll do it entirely via voice
[01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:19.040]   I will go through an entire photo album and add captions to it one by one by one using nothing but voice commands
[01:58:19.040 --> 01:58:23.040]   And then i'm going to have a put together a presentation for me automatically
[01:58:23.040 --> 01:58:27.120]   Uh, and it really just show you all the all the
[01:58:27.120 --> 01:58:33.040]   Machinery that's baked into macosx that it's machinery. That's just lying fallow
[01:58:33.360 --> 01:58:36.320]   That if you just simply give it give it a spin
[01:58:36.320 --> 01:58:42.720]   Oh my god the stuff that the the time you realize you're wasting in repetitive and easily scripted tasks
[01:58:42.720 --> 01:58:48.400]   These sites can really really change your life in in a major way. It'll give you more goofing off time
[01:58:48.400 --> 01:58:50.720]   Uh, than you ever imagined were possible
[01:58:50.720 --> 01:58:57.680]   Uh, he did automated.us too, and it's funny. I go there and it says for what for leopard
[01:58:59.280 --> 01:59:03.360]   It's from 2008, but it's still good. I would be I would it would be a crime if
[01:59:03.360 --> 01:59:07.280]   Apple doesn't need to improve this they just need to leave it in
[01:59:07.280 --> 01:59:13.200]   OS macosx and if they actually pretended they were proud of it imagine what they could do with it
[01:59:13.200 --> 01:59:19.520]   I think i've always said that I think that apple's real blind side is is realizing not realizing that
[01:59:19.520 --> 01:59:25.040]   The users that you're trying to appeal to in the first two or three weeks they own the product
[01:59:25.040 --> 01:59:27.600]   Unless the thing catches on fire
[01:59:27.680 --> 01:59:32.720]   There's they're going to be users that are have six months of experience and a year of experience and two years of experience
[01:59:32.720 --> 01:59:35.360]   And what are you doing to make their lives easier?
[01:59:35.360 --> 01:59:42.560]   What are you doing to make them happy enough with the the Macintosh that when they get tempted by a windows machine or even a linux machine
[01:59:42.560 --> 01:59:47.920]   What are the what are you showing them that makes the Macintosh materially better than these alternatives?
[01:59:47.920 --> 01:59:54.080]   And I think that by not enhancing not not giving uh automation the support it deserves
[01:59:54.560 --> 02:00:00.400]   It's particularly giving the stellar qualities of just automator. Yeah, I think they're giving they're they're basically saying
[02:00:00.400 --> 02:00:06.800]   I know they're they're letting horses run away from them when they're that the horse needs to be uh doing useful work for apple
[02:00:06.800 --> 02:00:11.200]   Uh just odd but I've always it's been a while since I gave a lot of talks to user groups
[02:00:11.200 --> 02:00:13.680]   but I would always want to talk about automator and
[02:00:13.680 --> 02:00:19.920]   the amount of the jaws that would hit the that would hit laps the the the the the jaws that would just drop to the floor showing
[02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:23.840]   But here's something that you've always been able to do and it's not scripting. It's just
[02:00:24.800 --> 02:00:28.560]   Picking up legos dropping them into the right into the order
[02:00:28.560 --> 02:00:33.120]   Which you want things to happen in and then suddenly with just like eight clicks you have
[02:00:33.120 --> 02:00:41.680]   Uh, you have a a tactical heads up navigational display for your car that just got built by clicking four little blocks together and boom
[02:00:41.680 --> 02:00:46.000]   It gets done automatically. So it's I just wish that apple would
[02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:50.480]   See the value in the stuff that they already have
[02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:52.000]   It's too bad
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000]   But the V sites will really help you out
[02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:59.440]   My picks of the week this week, uh are really kind of informed by the fact that I got a new Macintosh this week
[02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:01.360]   So, uh, whoa
[02:01:01.360 --> 02:01:05.600]   And I do I do not uh, although it is easy migrate my old mac to my new mac
[02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:09.520]   I like to start from scratch and they're just some basic things I always install
[02:01:09.520 --> 02:01:17.360]   You know, I got light roman here my mail mate, which is my favorite, um, mail application and of course, uh, you know final cut and logic
[02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:21.920]   But a couple of picks that I I always install you can use apples on terminal
[02:01:21.920 --> 02:01:24.320]   But if you like the terminal a lot, you got to get i term
[02:01:24.320 --> 02:01:32.240]   To the new beta three is now kind of out of beta and is a is official it is a uh free, uh terminal program
[02:01:32.240 --> 02:01:38.960]   for the uh, the mac and tush that has a lot of features including shell integration
[02:01:38.960 --> 02:01:44.000]   Uh t mux support and so forth that uh, if you start to use shell seriously
[02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:49.040]   You're gonna you're gonna really uh, you're gonna really want and as long as you've started uh
[02:01:49.040 --> 02:01:54.560]   Playing with the shell and this is by the way still why I love macOS. I've got a full
[02:01:54.560 --> 02:01:58.560]   Unix operating system available to me under the hood
[02:01:58.560 --> 02:02:02.080]   Including a full shell, but of course you may want to install
[02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:08.720]   Some unix style uh applications. There are several ways to do this. There's the nix stuff
[02:02:08.720 --> 02:02:12.640]   There's mac ports, but and I and of course brand new mac. I
[02:02:13.360 --> 02:02:15.920]   Kind of debated which one to use because I've used all three
[02:02:15.920 --> 02:02:22.320]   But I ended up choosing the kind of the classic home brew once again once you've installed home brew
[02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:30.640]   Then you can install pretty much, you know thousands of unix apps very easily without disrupting your mac and tush
[02:02:30.640 --> 02:02:35.200]   Um, it is the missing package manager for macOS
[02:02:35.200 --> 02:02:41.520]   And if you know what if you used apt get or pac-man or any of the package managers that are out there you'll understand what that is
[02:02:41.920 --> 02:02:46.400]   Uh, and it's free also home brew is from brew dot sh
[02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:52.320]   And I term is from uh, I better check. I think I term
[02:02:52.320 --> 02:02:59.520]   Dot com I haven't I haven't checked. I just google stuff. Don't you just do that. Yeah, I term to
[02:02:59.520 --> 02:03:04.880]   Uh dot com, but you want to get the the new I think beta. I think version three is now
[02:03:04.880 --> 02:03:09.280]   It's still called I term two, but it's beta three if that makes any sense
[02:03:10.320 --> 02:03:12.320]   Two picks for the price of one
[02:03:12.320 --> 02:03:14.000]   Thank you
