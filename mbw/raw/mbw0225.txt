[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.440]   want to thank him very much for filling in for me last weekend.
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.000]   Andy and Makko from Chicago SunTimes.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.080]   Hope I return the car tanked up and without any odd spells
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.920]   you couldn't get out of.
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.760]   I'm just glad I made a map of all the scratches
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.360]   before I left, because I'll tell you.
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.600]   Also joining us, really pleased to have him, Don McAllister,
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.280]   from Screencast's online.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.960]   Hi there, Leo.
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.880]   Good to be back again.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.520]   All the way from Liverpool.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.120]   Indeed.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.280]   Today.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.680]   And Andy and Alex-- I'm sorry, Alex is out today.
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.280]   Andy's here.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.480]   Alex has the day off.
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.880]   He's on a plane somewhere.
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.880]   Has he always is flying somewhere in the world.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:14.920]   I had a good time at LaWeb.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.000]   That's a fun-- have you ever gone to that, Don?
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.040]   It's just over the bottom.
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.880]   No, it should do.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.400]   Yeah, it's not that far, but this time of year,
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.120]   it's just crazy for me with getting shows out for Christmas
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.520]   and things in the new year.
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.040]   So I couldn't really spare the time this time around,
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.960]   but definitely, next year, I'm going to try and make the effort.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.200]   Yeah, it's a fun event.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.200]   It really is.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.960]   Now, it snowed and froze, and it was cold,
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.880]   but I had a blast.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.720]   And I really thank the week LaMir and his wife, Geraldine,
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.680]   who put the fifth conference on for inviting me out.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.120]   It was a lot of fun.
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.880]   So did anything happen while I was gone?
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.360]   Any Mac news at all?
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.960]   No, the biggest thing on my radar
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.040]   was new spate of rumors about the iPad,
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.600]   and mostly the usual new spate of rumors
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.000]   you get before Christmas when people are kind of eager
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.440]   to get their mandatory 800 words out so they can go home.
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.640]   And you had a lot of fun.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.760]   Yeah, the analysts go, oh, flash the new iPad.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.280]   It'll have a camera and a better screen.
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.880]   Oh, really?
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.640]   Anything else?
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:17.360]   Maybe?
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.920]   I mean, it's pretty obvious, but if they're
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.280]   going to do another generation, isn't it?
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.400]   I mean, will there be any--
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.400]   Yeah.
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.920]   Look, speculation, we don't know what they're going to do.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:27.680]   We don't even know.
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.480]   We're just assuming that they're going to do it
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.360]   as a yearly release as they do the iPhone.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.560]   It could be that they don't.
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.040]   We don't know.
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.040]   Yeah, the only thing I've seen in these rumors that is new
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.200]   and interesting is the idea of there being an SD card
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.000]   slot, and I don't know what to make of that.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.480]   I'm skeptical.
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.720]   I'm very skeptical of that.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.760]   Yeah.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.360]   Well, I could see it going either way.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.680]   The fact that they put SD card slots on pretty much
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.920]   a stock on every device they can put it on nowadays
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.640]   is not a phone is interesting.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.400]   The fact that they already have an add-on device that's
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.480]   an SD card slot, you could often sort of imagine--
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.760]   Oh, you're saying--
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.200]   Well, you mean a reader?
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.040]   Oh, you don't mean as additional memory.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.880]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.360]   You mean a reader?
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.440]   I mean, just like you can buy for $30 the camera
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.480]   at after you get it.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.000]   I got it.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.360]   I imagine the exact same thing with the exact same features
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.040]   only you don't have to spend $30 for it.
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.520]   It's actually a reader that's built in.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.280]   Oh, I could see that.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.920]   I see what you're saying.
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.400]   I thought you meant as additional memory as many phones do.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.880]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:28.680]   Yeah, yeah, OK.
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.200]   OK.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.200]   Now, the main reason for that as well is that there
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.480]   were some case shots came out.
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.080]   So we've got shots of new iPad cases with just the right side
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.120]   slot down at the bottom for the SD card.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.160]   But I must admit, Andy, you did this as well.
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.800]   I lost my camera connection kit, so I
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.960]   had to go and buy a second one.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.960]   So I just wish they would integrate it in the thing,
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.120]   because it's customly too.
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.280]   Which it's a real cluge.
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.160]   You know, the way you have to--
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.680]   And it's easy to lose.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.880]   And you use it once you put it away somewhere,
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:54.960]   then you can't remember what it is.
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:55.160]   So--
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.680]   And if you have a VGA dongle, now you've
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.080]   got three white little dongles that you've
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.680]   got to have a case for something, because you're
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.520]   going to lose them all.
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.920]   Yeah.
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.880]   So I would think-- yeah, I would think
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.280]   that's if it's going to happen.
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.120]   You know, I think that's--
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.560]   What about the speculation that chairman is, I think,
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.280]   is kind of interesting.
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.560]   Remember, Steve Jobs said on the famous analyst call,
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.800]   never would we make a 7-inch tablet.
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.400]   And of course, Samsung now says we've sold a million Samsung
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.040]   S tabs in two months, so it's a very successful form factor.
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.760]   Maybe Steve all along was spreading a little disinformation.
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.440]   Does he think they'll be a 7-inch?
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.440]   No.
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.440]   Sorry, Dan.
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.440]   Go ahead.
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.840]   I'm going on to you, your first.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:37.360]   You've--
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.360]   Yeah, and you speculate.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.200]   Yeah, we talked about this a little bit last week, where I was
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.220]   saying-- I had a haul out the quote where Steve, during an
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.520]   analyst call in October, he was explicitly saying, 7-inch
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.160]   tablets are dead in the water.
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.160]   Dead in the water will never succeed.
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:55.680]   Whoops.
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.040]   And yeah.
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.920]   And I don't know if Apple sold a million iPads in the first
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:01.560]   three weeks.
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.800]   They just simply waited another week to say, oh, we sold a
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.960]   million in the first month.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.080]   But that's actually faster.
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.000]   That would be faster than the first iPad sold.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.520]   There are multiple advantages to how Samsung was selling
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.000]   those tablets where you can buy it from any carrier anywhere.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.400]   So I think it's still a better achievement for Apple.
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.720]   But yeah, there's definitely-- having now used two Android
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.080]   based 7-inch tablets that I really like, I think there's
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.680]   a definite good reason why Apple chose 10 inches, because a
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.600]   10-inch iPad can be so many things that a 7-inch tablet
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.200]   cannot.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.960]   But the idea of having this thing in your back pocket, in
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.800]   your jacket pocket, and not have to carry it around like a
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.000]   little like Chanel clutch, wherever you go, that's a
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.400]   pretty good feature.
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.720]   What about a better screen on this thing?
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.800]   I'd sure like to see a better screen on it.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.800]   It's a fairly low resolution.
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.760]   Yeah, but it doesn't appear low resolution, does it?
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:51.960]   No.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.600]   It's a high quality screen.
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.400]   I mean, I know this talk of the retina display for the iPad,
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.400]   but, you know, it's the same picture.
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.560]   I don't think it's too old.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.000]   It's just not going to happen, no.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.320]   But they might be able to increase the resolution a little
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.800]   bit, but I think, you know, the iPad screen itself is fine.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.000]   But going back to the 7-inch thing, though, the thing that
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.800]   really makes me think they're not going to do it.
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.920]   I know they've said in the past when we had the original
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.200]   iPod, and people were asking for the video iPod and Steve
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.640]   said, no, people don't want to watch video on a small screen.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.840]   It was like an off the cuff thing, but for him to come out in
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:25.240]   that earnings call so deliberately to pan the 7-inch
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.840]   form factor, that's really going to be difficult for him to
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.400]   sort of reel that back in, I think, and actually launch a
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.240]   7-inch device.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.160]   So I'm a little bit cautious as to whether or not they might
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.120]   do in the end.
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.880]   But so soon after that earnings call, the sort of vitriol
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.280]   that he made on the 7-inch form factor, take a lot of
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.080]   reeling back in.
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:42.600]   Yeah.
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.280]   The big disconnect for me is just the fact that they can
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.840]   -- they always have a one-sentence answer to anybody who
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.520]   will say, well, why would I want to buy an iPad instead of the
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.240]   iPod Touch?
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:54.160]   Why would I buy a MacBook Air instead of regular MacBook?
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.880]   This would be a sort of thing where they'd have to say, well,
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:00.200]   here's why you'd want to buy something that's exactly like
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.160]   this other thing, only it's slightly smaller, and we've
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.400]   already understood that you can put this in a pocket.
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.320]   What's the case for it?
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.040]   Yeah.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.040]   I'm not sure about that.
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.560]   I don't think they're going to play the resolution game
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.320]   because the problem there is that they have to make sure
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.080]   that they keep $4.99 as the cheapest price or the cheapest
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:17.800]   iPad.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.280]   I'm not sure if they could substantially increase the
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.400]   resolution to display and still keep that price.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.400]   I don't know.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.520]   But I wouldn't be surprised if they simply made sure that it
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.120]   could play 720p video at full resolution.
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.680]   Just as they could say, oh, and all these wonderful HD
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.240]   videos you can now rent through the iTunes store are now
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:35.680]   available.
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.280]   Now you can watch it at full HD resolution on your brand new
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:38.680]   iPad.
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:39.960]   Hoorah, hah, hah, hah, hah.
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:40.960]   Wouldn't there be--
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.240]   if you change your resolution and issue with--
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.480]   for developers, that's one of the problems people complain
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.760]   about with Android, is that you have all these different
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.280]   form factors.
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.080]   Maybe they'd want it.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:54.080]   I mean, there's probably some resistance from developers,
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.240]   too.
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.680]   Well, the thing that this next release, if and when it does
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.840]   arrive, I mean, they've still got so much that they can
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.800]   add into it without worrying too much about the solution.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.400]   Because people are happy with the screen.
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.000]   I mean, I'm actually happy with the screen.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.960]   I think it's really a really nice screen.
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.040]   I don't see anything particularly wrong with it.
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.400]   And just to bump up the screen just so they can say it isn't
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.000]   really the way Apple would--
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.600]   but they've got the camera, they've got extra storage.
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.680]   They've got extra things.
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.160]   The SD card even could be quite a big selling point for them
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.480]   when that comes out.
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.920]   But I think the camera is going to sort of launch the next
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.280]   generation of people who want to actually buy an iPad.
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.640]   Listen, the camera is still an interesting thing to me,
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.040]   though, because one of the two or three different tablets
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.640]   that I've been really falling closely is the Atom tablets.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.520]   That's being put together by Notion Inc.
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.680]   And they have a really interesting solution for the camera,
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.320]   where it's actually mounted on--
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.640]   if you can imagine a flat bead inside the case,
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.520]   you can actually rotate it yourself to rotate it to exactly
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.200]   whatever angle you want.
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.200]   I don't know what the solution is to the idea of having--
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.840]   excuse me-- the idea of having a device like this,
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.320]   where you still have to--
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.880]   when you're doing FaceTime, you have to hold it like this
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.440]   to get a good angle.
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.080]   Or if-- and even the idea of using an external camera
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.160]   as a camera, even on the Galaxy tab,
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.080]   it's a little bit freaky to be taking pictures like this.
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.720]   It's not unusable by any means.
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.360]   But it's the sort of thing that inspires a search
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.240]   for a really clever solution.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.520]   Yeah, well, it'd have to be clever.
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.400]   I can't imagine Steve putting out anything
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.880]   with a thing hanging off of it.
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.800]   It just doesn't really feel like something a jobs
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.880]   or a Johnny Iave would do.
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.840]   It seems like they're going to do something
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.560]   that's a little sleeker.
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:33.320]   That which might be the good argument for the SD card built
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.600]   in, the SD card reader built in.
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.600]   Normally, you hate to give that really stupid explanation
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.880]   that Apple hates to cut holes on the sides of their devices,
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.240]   even though that seems to be pretty true.
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.560]   But I would love to see an SD card reader,
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.840]   not as an external storage thing or as external memory,
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.360]   but just simply as pop the card out of this thing,
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.040]   put it into this thing, boom, you're done.
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.160]   If they put a camera in it, they almost have to, don't they?
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.160]   Because otherwise, it's hard to get the pictures off.
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.440]   Oh, no, it's easy to get the picture.
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:01.560]   Oh, you sync to iPhone.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.480]   You sync it, yeah.
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.720]   I guess the same as an iPhone.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.080]   All right.
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:08.480]   They would say how easy it is to send photos
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.880]   up to your mobile me account, which everybody has and loves.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.720]   I still worry about the overlap, though.
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.680]   There's so many-- they've got the iPod touch now
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:18.400]   that's got the camera.
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.320]   They've got the iPhone that's got the camera.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.600]   Do they really want to put a camera?
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.840]   I know people are clamoring for it,
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.880]   but is it Apple's way to go ahead and give people
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.480]   what they want?
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.240]   No, people keep thinking.
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.800]   No, they tell you what you want.
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:31.680]   Do you want to take photos?
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.080]   To take one of these smaller iOS devices, the iPad, you know,
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.360]   you immediately unsolctioned.
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.040]   Let's not forget how slow the evolution of the iPhone was.
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.320]   I mean, the first iPhone was Edge.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.240]   Then--
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.760]   I mean, it was-- they are--
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.920]   I think Apple's very deliberate in the way they
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:47.720]   roll out features.
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.120]   I don't think they're going to roll out a bunch of features.
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.560]   The difference there is that remember
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.840]   that the iPhone existed in a complete vacuum.
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.240]   All they had were the iTunes store to support it.
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.040]   We're asked right now.
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.600]   The most significant data point for the iPad having a camera
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.640]   is now there's FaceTime.
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.200]   Now they can say-- and of course, FaceTime becomes even more
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.680]   relevant and more important because now here's yet another iOS
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:10.760]   device that can follow around your kid in the front yard.
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.320]   Oh, don't you want your grandparents to see your kid?
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.520]   You don't want your grandparents to see your kid?
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:16.240]   What kind of sick idiot are you?
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.200]   Well, fine.
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.720]   Maybe you should get an Android device.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.160]   If you don't want your grandparent to get grandparent--
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.520]   You don't want me, your grandchildren.
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:23.880]   You know what?
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:24.760]   No, no.
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:25.920]   Don't even come to the Apple store.
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.440]   I don't think we want you holding an app.
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.520]   I think FaceTime is the Google wave of Cupertino.
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:35.400]   I just-- I can't--
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.840]   OK.
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:37.760]   OK.
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:43.400]   Did you-- what was I going to ask you?
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.200]   Oh, did you see the report?
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:50.680]   This I found fascinating that says that Verizon actually--
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.280]   that Android is not doing as well.
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.840]   You know, Andy Rubin said last week
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:57.120]   that Android is activating 300,000 devices a week, which
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.400]   sounds-- you know, 9 million a month.
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.600]   Sounds like a lot.
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.280]   But the study that came out-- and I'm
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.960]   going to see if I can find who did the study--
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:09.080]   that basically Verizon and their sales of Android
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:13.280]   of the Droid platform was just stopped cold in August
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:14.800]   once the iPhone 4 came out.
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.400]   And then in fact, iPhone 4 really
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.520]   is the dominant-- still the dominant phone, which
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:21.240]   might explain why Verizon is suddenly
[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:24.840]   kind of selling iPads and maybe a little bit
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.160]   interested in getting to that world.
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:30.400]   Did you find that credible that report?
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.960]   I saw a couple of different reports like that,
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:36.920]   one of which that says that activations and sales of Android
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:39.520]   are flattening in the sense that they're still
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:40.520]   doing exceptionally well.
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:43.440]   But this was definitely-- the reason why it's taken off
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.760]   in 2010 is because this is the first year
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:49.880]   in which you had a variety of really very credible, excellent
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.280]   Android devices to actually use.
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:53.680]   Last year, of course, if you wanted an Android device,
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:56.360]   the reason why you wanted it was chiefly
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:00.400]   to do one of these minus several fingers towards Apple.
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:03.640]   But now it's a very credible alternative to the iPhone.
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:07.000]   The other report that I saw that was linked around a few days
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   ago is simply saying that Verizon and other carriers--
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.240]   they almost can't afford to not carry the iPhone now
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.600]   because they can see how much damage the iPhone is doing
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.360]   to the first of the fact that no one's coming into the store
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.800]   to get them.
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:24.400]   Yeah, let me see if I can pull up this graphic here.
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.480]   Because this is a kind of--
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.360]   I'll be honest with you.
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.560]   It was a bit of a shock to me.
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:38.480]   And I'm almost wondering, could this possibly be true?
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.200]   It's from a company called Asymco.
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.520]   And this is from MacRumors.com.
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.960]   Asymco did analysis of Verizon's smartphone device sales
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:50.280]   over the past year, concluding that despite a growing Android
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.880]   platform--
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.560]   and you'll see the blue line at the top of this graph--
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.240]   that's the iPhone.
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.720]   And the yellow bar is a web OS.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.520]   The green bar is Android and Windows Mobile.
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.840]   And the blue bar is, of course, the blackberry platform.
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:08.320]   Verizon finds itself in a position
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.600]   in which it may have had little choice,
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:12.320]   but to accept Apple's terms to bring the iPhone to the carrier.
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:15.240]   In other words, as soon as the iPhone came out, boom,
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:17.960]   it kind of started to clobber Android.
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:21.560]   And the iPhone is absolutely the dominant platform,
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.800]   despite these 300,000 activations a day.
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:28.880]   Or maybe Steve Jobs is right that that number is somehow bogus.
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.640]   Yeah, well, that number, actually, on the same day
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:34.280]   that that number came out, I heard somewhere else say 200,000,
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:37.000]   which per day, 100,000 a day disparity between the figures.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.440]   No, Google said--
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:42.400]   I think Google said initially 200,000 about two, three months
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.600]   ago.
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.280]   And Andy Rubin this week--
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:48.080]   I mean, Andy should know, he is the Android guy at Google,
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.000]   said 300,000.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.840]   So I think it was up from 200,000.
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:53.320]   OK.
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.320]   Yeah, I'm pretty sure--
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:57.240]   I mean, that's the official Google number.
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:00.440]   But now, I'm sure Steve Jobs disbutes it as he did
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:03.160]   at his last keynote.
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.800]   And these numbers kind of maybe supported.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:09.320]   It looks like, despite the huge sales--
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:12.000]   or the purported huge sales of Android,
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.120]   that iPhone is still totally dominant.
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.120]   Yeah, I looked at it.
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.080]   I understood some of it.
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.240]   And I try to have someone else explain it to me.
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.680]   I do have some contacts who do that sort of thing
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.840]   for a living who don't go from where the features of this
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.400]   and what do you think is going to be important next year.
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.640]   But they go for the actual numbers
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:28.920]   they can get their hands on.
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.480]   And they say that it seems credible,
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.840]   but they reminded me that every analyst is--
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:33.360]   Right.
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.080]   In the end, he's no different from anybody else
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.320]   who's giving an opinion.
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.520]   The difference between an analyst
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:40.000]   is that they put their reputation, their reputation,
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:40.840]   their company behind it.
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:42.800]   And they know how to use charts and graphs.
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:43.920]   And I don't know, Esimco.
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.600]   So I don't know how credible they are.
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.760]   Yeah, I've never heard of them before.
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:52.320]   If their data is solid, it's an interesting argument.
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.360]   I still think that Apple's going to be in trouble
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:58.800]   if they don't treat Android seriously.
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.000]   You've got the hot new Android phone.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.760]   You know how much better it was than everything
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.400]   that we've better all the time.
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.040]   Yeah, it's the graph is starting to--
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.680]   They're iterating much more quickly than Apple is iterating.
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:11.880]   I mean, I think that's--
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.640]   Yeah, I think it's more like--
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:17.440]   I think Apple got it almost so close to right out the gate.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.760]   And there was more like they had to do refinements.
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.680]   Android, they came up with something that was usable.
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:22.520]   It was horrible.
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:23.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.080]   It was like if proof that they can ship an OS
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:29.520]   and they could ship an OS that kind of could be used as a phone
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.440]   to a credible OS to a good OS.
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:35.240]   And next year, they'll start shipping really, really good OS's.
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.920]   Isn't it so fragmented, though, for people
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.560]   who don't know about mobile phones and smartphones?
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.760]   I mean, you know what you're getting with the iPhone.
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:42.960]   It's a feature set.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.760]   And it's the same throughout the world.
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.480]   Yeah, there's so many different Android phones
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.840]   and even Android operating systems now
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.440]   that must be totally confusing to anyone who doesn't really
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.200]   follow the market.
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.640]   The thing--
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:56.960]   I think it is, although--
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.080]   I get a lot of people asking about Android phones.
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.120]   I mean, I think that--
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.760]   well, remember Verizon spent a ton of money on these Droid ads
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:05.760]   as god-awful as they are.
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:07.160]   And everybody saw them.
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.440]   And I get a lot of people asking--
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:14.640]   now, here's another stat from the same Asymco report in Q3.
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:15.440]   And that's what's key.
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:20.400]   In Q3, the iPhone of AT&T outsoiled Android at Verizon
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.920]   by a factor of 2.5.
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:24.320]   So if you're just comparing AT&T to Verizon,
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.800]   which is what this report is about--
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.160]   because remember, there's Android phones in all the carriers,
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.080]   including AT&T.
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.920]   So we're not saying Android to Apple.
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.160]   We're saying Verizon to AT&T.
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:40.520]   250% iPhone over Droid.
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:41.400]   That's significant.
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:42.840]   That's huge.
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:46.000]   What interests me, though, is that the brand awareness
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.360]   of people in the smartphone market-- people
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.960]   know what an iPhone is.
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:52.480]   But there's an iPhone, and there's all the smartphones--
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.720]   All this other stuff, yeah.
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.360]   Yeah, you ask anybody in the street,
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.080]   what's the alternatives to an iPhone?
[00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:59.440]   They probably don't even know what Android is.
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.240]   So you've got all these people who know about the iPhone
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.040]   and know about the feature set of the iPhone.
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.160]   The main barrier that I've found out--
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.880]   I mean, people have asked me, you know,
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.200]   that people have been looking for cheap deals for iPhones
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.840]   over Christmas, and there aren't any.
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:14.920]   You pay a premium for an iPhone, because that's what you get.
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:18.320]   And quite a few people who've not been able to afford the iPhone,
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.640]   so they've just gone for another phone,
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.520]   regardless as to what the operating system was.
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:26.200]   I know it was just what the cheapest deal was in that particular time.
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.120]   Oh, look at this now.
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:30.560]   Somebody in the chat room says, the article now
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:31.080]   is updated.
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.760]   The Asymco article is updated with this, a quote.
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.360]   "Assuming the data is accurate.
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:36.280]   We're going to dive into it.
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.600]   But I will state up front that without confirmation,
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:42.280]   the conclusions below should be taken with a grain of salt."
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:43.280]   OK.
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:46.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:48.480]   I guess, you know, when I read it, alarm bells went off,
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.120]   because it's just-- it's like, what?
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.720]   And so maybe, I don't know, it's more information.
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.920]   You know what, the real truth of it is, though?
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:57.560]   Palm's dead.
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:58.520]   But I think we knew that.
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:19:58.920]   Oh, they are.
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:19:59.680]   They already are.
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:01.160]   I think we knew that.
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:04.040]   But well, WebOS is still in there with a chance.
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:08.280]   This is in the tablet war, at least for 2011.
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:11.160]   This is a race in which the leading horse is 10 links ahead.
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:11.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:12.080]   And now it's up.
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.640]   Now it's a battle to see who wins the second place prize money.
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:15.920]   Android hasn't won it yet.
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:22.680]   But HP with WebOS could really just come in and say, we've learned everything good
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:25.640]   that Apple has done, everything bad that other manufacturers have done
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:26.720]   with Android tablets.
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.120]   And we're going to enter smart and smarter.
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:33.880]   And let's not forget that there's also--
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:37.160]   Microsoft isn't saying that they're going to announce it at CES.
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:38.160]   OK.
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:38.660]   OK.
[00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:41.000]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   I thought they would--
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   It's my thing at it.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.680]   Well, there's a great press release saying that we tend to announce
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:49.560]   the abandonment of our CES announcement in April.
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:53.280]   So we'll be renting out the year-old WebOS center gardens
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:57.320]   to a special where we actually play Will It Blend with whatever it was
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.280]   we showed off on in January.
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.560]   Windows 7 tablets.
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:01.200]   That's--
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.520]   Anyone in the first three rows?
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.080]   We're a poncho.
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.320]   It's a Gallagher moment.
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:06.160]   Hey, what about--
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:12.120]   It's so hard to take anything that Microsoft does in January at CES seriously.
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:15.000]   It's like Fantasy League CEO.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.360]   You figure out which one of these devices am I going to bet they're going to still
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:22.080]   be making or still be excited about six months from now?
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:25.800]   It's there's so little that you can actually just put to the back of that.
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:26.760]   How about RIM?
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.320]   I think that the playbook--
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.320]   I mean, it's looking better and better.
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:31.320]   I'm still a prototype.
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:32.240]   I guess we don't know.
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.320]   Has anybody handled it?
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:34.800]   Not me.
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:35.320]   No.
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.480]   No, there's been some videos with--
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:40.440]   She's done hands-on videos, but no one's actually picked it up
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.760]   and actually started to play with that, I don't think.
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:43.680]   It doesn't excite me.
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.040]   They've yet to--
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:48.400]   When you have a company like Notion Inc, they excite me because they say
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:51.880]   that they seem to be saying that we're starting with Android.
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:55.280]   We recognize that their mail app and other apps like that aren't very good.
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:58.520]   So we're building our own mail app that we think works awesome.
[00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:03.280]   We're adding really cool industrial design to make this into a more open, more
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.320]   expandable device.
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:05.480]   That excites me.
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:09.680]   HP, one of the best consumer electronics manufacturers and designers
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:15.160]   out there with WebOS, which is a really promising multi-touch operating system.
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:18.040]   It could really be an incredible alternative.
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:19.080]   That excites me.
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:23.120]   Right now, all RIM has done is say we have a tablet that looks pretty much
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:26.880]   exactly like every other seven inch tablet you have ever seen
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:30.160]   that people are thinking about building.
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:34.360]   We promise that it has a really awesome web browser that plays flash.
[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:37.240]   We don't have much else to say at this time.
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.640]   So I'm not discounting them.
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:41.800]   I'm just saying that they have to start defining who they are
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:45.560]   and why people should start putting up 500 bucks in a drawer and waiting for them to ship.
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:46.400]   Right.
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.160]   I mean, the problem with what they've got though, I mean,
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:51.760]   everything now is, you know, the benchmark is the iPad.
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:54.920]   But it's the iPad of 10 months ago.
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:58.080]   You know, all this new stuff that isn't even in the market yet
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.400]   is being judged against the current iPad.
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:03.280]   So they're not hiding to nothing really when the new iPad comes out
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.360]   with presumably new features, et cetera.
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.000]   You know, we're into the old LeapFrog game.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.640]   And again, Apple's always going to be, you know, if they play the card,
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:13.080]   right, always in front of the other competitors are doing.
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:16.520]   I think you got it right, Andy, when you said it, the race is for second place.
[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:17.800]   I mean, there's no question.
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:21.080]   It's either for second place or wait to be the person who can take advantage
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:23.680]   of when the first horse starts to stumble.
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:26.640]   And I don't see any signs that happening, but we could be in a position
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:31.880]   where it's 2012 and Apple is only the fourth company to recognize that they need an iPad
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:34.440]   that is more useful as a replacement for a notebook.
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:35.440]   Right.
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.440]   Let's take a break.
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.760]   We're talking to Andy and not come from the Chicago Sun-Times
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:40.320]   domicalister screencast online.
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:42.440]   It's Mac, Rick Wiggly.
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:46.080]   And there's lots more to talk about, more carrier news as well.
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.280]   The phones are still, I think, the most interests.
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:51.560]   The phones and mobile in general, the most interesting area.
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:56.160]   I'm looking desperately to, oh, yes, there is one Macintosh story.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:58.840]   I found a Mac story.
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:03.160]   And I have a Mac question with her, the app store.
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:07.880]   But before we do that, I want to welcome a new advertiser to the show.
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:12.880]   And gentlemen, you might want to consider this for the lady in your life.
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.720]   I don't, I like jewelry.
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.720]   Are you laughing?
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:16.720]   I was excited about this.
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.720]   I don't know, that's just the way you say it.
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:19.720]   Lady days.
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:20.720]   I want you to go.
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:23.120]   You like your nickname in school might have been Captain Smooth.
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.120]   It was.
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:26.160]   How did you know Captain Smooth here?
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:29.920]   Telling you that when the holiday season's upon us, there's nothing the little woman
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.120]   likes more than some ice.
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:34.120]   That's why I'm sorry.
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:37.520]   There's also nothing that like more than being called the little woman.
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:44.600]   Hey, I'm clicking the mute button.
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:50.400]   I mean, they get tired wearing the same old dress, but when they get tired, you got to
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:55.040]   try a little tender ice.
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:57.520]   Actually I think, I'll be honest with you.
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:02.320]   Here's why I buy my wife jewelry because I can never find anything that fits.
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:06.880]   I have no idea what she wants, but I know if I get her some beautiful jewelry, she's always
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:07.880]   going to be happy.
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:14.520]   And right now ice.com is giving you $50 to spend and more when you visit ice.com.
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.520]   And I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.520]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:20.520]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:22.520]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:24.520]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:26.520]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:28.520]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:31.520]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.520]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.520]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.520]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.520]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:41.520]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:46.520]   And with the free gift box and the $50 to spend, here comes Lisa.
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:47.960]   She wants, which one do you want?
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:49.520]   You want that diamond bracelet?
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:52.760]   33 carat, sky blue, tow pass, sterling silver bracelet?
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:53.760]   Just $150.
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:58.960]   And with $50 off, it's even more affordable.
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.200]   Engagement rings.
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:03.760]   There's $15,000 in daily prizes.
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:04.760]   You know, I do all my shots.
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:05.760]   Here's tennis braces.
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.440]   I know you like those, Lisa.
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:09.600]   Let's take a look at some of the tennis braces.
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:12.600]   The deal is you get your shopping done now.
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:15.000]   And it's shipped in time for Christmas.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.320]   But you do have to select two-day shipping just to be sure you have.
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:21.960]   If you want your order shipped standard mail, they'll ship it free for orders
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:23.200]   placed before 1 p.m.
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.560]   Eastern December 22.
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:28.920]   But to guarantee, delivered by Christmas, you might want to take that two-day shipping.
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:34.000]   And Ice.com will give you $50 to spend plus a free gift box now through December 22.

[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:39.960]   Mm-mm.
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:40.960]   Mm-mm.
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:41.960]   Ice.com/twit.

[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:52.880]   OK, I'm going to do a little shopping here.
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:55.320]   Don't mind me.
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:56.320]   You go on with the show here.
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.120]   I'm going to get my Christmas shopping.
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:59.120]   Ice.
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:00.120]   I'm/twit.
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:04.640]   I don't think there's any series of holiday commercials that lie harder than the ones
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:06.280]   for like mall jewelry stores.
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:07.280]   Oh, God.
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:08.640]   Don't-- yeah, whatever you do.
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:12.760]   It's like, oh, honey, you went to the mall that's bought one mile away and you bought
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:15.160]   the biggest, packiest thing in the window.
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.160]   Isn't that nice?
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.160]   True love.
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.160]   Now, this is nice stuff, actually.
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:19.320]   I'm looking at it.
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.560]   Beautiful.
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:23.520]   And you can get your shop and done without even going out the door.
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:24.520]   Don't tell her that.
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:27.440]   Guaranteed Christmas delivery if you hurry.
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:30.400]   Take advantage of that December 22 deadline to get $50 off.
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:31.400]   Ice.com/twit.
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:35.800]   It looks like they have Canadian-- looks like Canada, too.
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:39.880]   So yes, Canadian shipping expedited.
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:42.680]   Can that-- Canada Post expedited parcel?
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:43.680]   Yeah.
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:45.560]   Ice.com/twit.
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:48.520]   Now, moving on, my friends.
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:50.520]   Andy, you were very good.
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:51.520]   Thank you.
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:54.000]   That's why Sky has some--
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   Do you ever buy jewelry, Andy, ever, on any occasion at all?
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:05.600]   I'm very, very, very, very, very weak about buying jewelry for women.
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:06.600]   Yes.
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:07.600]   Yes.
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:12.000]   Although, I would be very, very, very, sheer to have one site that has so many things
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.200]   that I feel as though, whatever I want, it's right here.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.640]   And Jayce Moore has endorsed none of this.
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:22.200]   Is that weak that you can't resist it or weak that you wouldn't already--
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.200]   No, he's weak.
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.720]   He's not good at it.
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:28.640]   But Don and I are old married men and we know the secret.
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:29.800]   We really do.
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:32.240]   I'm telling you, I stopped buying clothes.
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.560]   I definitely don't buy household ediments anymore.
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:37.640]   Since I bought that vacuum and it got hit over the head with it, it--
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:38.640]   Jewelry.
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:39.640]   Oh, bad.
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:40.640]   Right, Don?
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:41.640]   You know.
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:42.640]   Yeah, you know.
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:43.640]   Yes.
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:44.640]   Jewelry.
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.640]   That's why I'm wearing the leather jacket.
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.800]   It looks good with the bling.
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:53.480]   Let us move on to more stories.
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:55.880]   Apple's iPad, Time Magazine.
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:58.600]   Did you do this last week, named it?
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:01.280]   First of all, Oprah says it's her favorite thing in the world.
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:08.720]   Now Time Magazine says it's number one on its top gadgets of 2010 Wolf course it is.
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:11.400]   I mean, how could there even be-- what would be second?
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:13.520]   What would be-- what would beat it?
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:17.000]   I'm actually-- either this week or next week, we're starting on the Sun Times.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.960]   I'm doing the countdown of the 3, 2, 1 of the Time Magazine style, like, most interesting
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:26.760]   tech items or companies of 2010.
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:31.240]   And I call it the Time Magazine, most interesting because that means that it can be Hitler.
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:32.960]   We don't necessarily say the best.
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:36.200]   I'm just saying that more interesting in terms of most influential.
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.840]   The iPad is actually number two.
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:39.400]   Something else is number one.
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:40.400]   Really?
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.400]   Shocker.
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.760]   You know, Time Magazine made that mistake last year.
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:44.800]   They made the droid.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:46.800]   Number one, they're backing down now.
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:50.600]   For 2010, number one, iPad-- oh, it's one of those where you get a slideshow so they
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:51.600]   get more ad impressions.
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:53.160]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.160]   Let's see.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.160]   What do you guess?
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.520]   Number two, it's got to be the iPhone, right?
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:57.800]   Let's see.
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:08.520]   And the winner is-- Samsung Galaxy S. There's an Android lover somewhere in there.
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:11.720]   Apple did have four out of the top five, so we know that the rest of these.
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:13.760]   MacBook Air, I have to agree with that.
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:15.240]   That's really done well, hasn't it?
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:18.040]   On its launch, they-- is it selling well?
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:20.480]   Do we have sales figures yet?
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:21.480]   I don't believe so.
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:24.680]   I don't think they've come from Apple as of yet, but I don't love it.
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:26.680]   I mean, every book you've bought.
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:27.680]   Who doesn't love it?
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:34.440]   You know, I just-- a point of interest, I dropped my MacBook Air when I was in Paris.
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:36.440]   It fell off the night table.
[00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:37.920]   It's all I brought to Paris, by the way.
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:38.920]   It's perfect.
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:41.200]   And it does dent, just so you know.
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:42.200]   It will.
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:43.200]   It will dent.
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:47.480]   There's a ding in the unibody as well as on the lid.
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:49.480]   No other damage is working fine.
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:50.480]   In fact, I kind of like it.
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:51.480]   It's a little scar.
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:57.040]   And then there's somehow-- I don't know-- there's a little gouge there as well.
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:00.040]   It's starting to look like a used computer, but boy, it is used.
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:01.040]   This is it.
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:02.040]   This is my go-to device.
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:08.740]   I'll tell you what, like every December I do my musical advent calendar, partly to
[00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:12.160]   like talk about music for an entire month, but also partly because maybe they'll click
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:14.920]   through my Amazon associates link.
[00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:18.400]   And for the month-- and the thing is I'll spend it on something I don't necessarily
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.400]   need, but really want.
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:23.360]   And I'm like, I hope I get $1,000 in gift credits.
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:28.120]   I really-- setting that MacBook Air back to Apple after the loan pay was over, that was
[00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:29.120]   the biggest big amount.
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.120]   That must have been fine.
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:33.600]   Because I bet they would have like, you know, just not reminded me for another month and
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.800]   then not like got the lawyers involved for the free month.
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:36.800]   So you have a MacBook.
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:37.800]   It's like an eviction.
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:40.280]   You know, you've got really-- you've got a year once the process begins.
[00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:42.120]   You could keep that thing for a long time.
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:46.480]   So Apple, you could either spend $1,000 on lawyers or you could just rewrite this off
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:47.480]   as a loss.
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:48.480]   You could squeeze me.
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:49.480]   It's up to you.
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.200]   I might-- you know, I might almost put that number two.
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.680]   I would definitely put the iPad number one.
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:56.680]   I'd put the iPad number one, the iPhone probably number two and the Air number three.
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:59.400]   I'm not sure I put the Galaxy S in that top five.
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:00.400]   Let's see what else.
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:02.040]   Oh, come on.
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.040]   Time magazine.
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.280]   Are you drunk?
[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:08.800]   The Google TV Logitech review number four.
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:10.600]   Did you try it?
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:13.640]   Mm, that's problematic.
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:15.080]   That's really problematic.
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:18.440]   That's a piece of crap.
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:19.440]   I'm sorry.
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:21.400]   Am I speaking too bluntly?
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:25.880]   I would call it a piece of crap, but it's not an interesting $3.99 device.
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:27.720]   I would agree with the Nexus One.
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:28.720]   Yes.
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:29.960]   On that list somewhere.
[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:31.160]   It's number five.
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:32.640]   And it would-- it's my top.
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:34.040]   I wouldn't put the Samsung Galaxy S in that one.
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:38.600]   I think you definitely have to put an Android phone on there.
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:42.120]   Nexus One, I think, would be one of the best ones to come up with if you don't have the
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:44.600]   Nexus S available to you when you're running the list.
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:45.600]   Which you don't.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.880]   And this came out too late in the year to really be the top in the top five.
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:51.160]   Now, the iPhone only comes in at number six.
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:55.840]   I guess you maybe graded down because of the antenna issues, perhaps.
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:57.840]   I think you graded down because of AT&T.
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:04.000]   If you put this on Verizon, this might be number one, right?
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   Not number one.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.560]   No, it's a new iteration of an old thing.
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:09.560]   It's not quite as exciting.
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:15.480]   Apple TV should have been above it because it's more of a reinvention and more of a reinvention
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.640]   than an update to something that we've already seen.
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:21.200]   Number seven, Apple TV, it's one third the price of the Logitech review.
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:24.040]   It should have been way up above the Logitech review.
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:26.720]   I can't even believe that they--
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:29.200]   I think that's still a sleep up product as well, Apple TV.
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:32.520]   I don't think we've seen anything of its full potential as of yet.
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:34.920]   There's some more stuff coming down the track, definitely.
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:39.360]   I think there's a little Android bias in that list.
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:40.880]   And I say that as an Android fanboy.
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:41.880]   I'm an Android.
[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:43.960]   I'm a big Android user.
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:49.720]   But I bought because my Android X is Verizon, so when I went to Paris, I used the iPhone
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:50.720]   4.
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:54.520]   I had fun because it's such a great camera in there.
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:58.800]   And I used 4-square-a-lot.
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:33:59.800]   It's a nice phone.
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:00.800]   It's a great phone.
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:03.480]   I didn't make any calls, so I don't know how the calls were.
[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:05.480]   And then I left it at the hotel.
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:09.440]   Did you really focus on the phone?
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:13.160]   You're like Johnny Techie seed.
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:14.760]   You're just--
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:20.360]   there'll be cold groves of iPhones and kindles all across Europe and Canada because a plucky
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:27.040]   man with a soup can on his head, strewing past the room 50 years ago.
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:28.760]   You know, I don't know.
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.600]   I have this habit when I leave the house.
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:32.720]   I pat the left hip.
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:33.720]   That's the wall.
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:34.720]   It right hips the keys.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:36.120]   And then I always pat my breast pocket.
[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:37.520]   That's the phone.
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:38.720]   And I don't know why I didn't.
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:42.120]   But when I-- and I'm halfway to the airport in the cab.
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:44.600]   And I don't even have to think, oh, did I put it in the bag?
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:48.720]   Did I do-- no, I knew I left it at the hotel.
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:49.720]   No, I have no.
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:53.880]   I am the guy who will take three steps away from the restaurant table and then take three
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:35:00.720]   steps back, stare intensely at the entire table and the chair because it's-- a man's
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:02.320]   got to know his limitations.
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:06.480]   Like, am I stupid enough to have not noticed that my iPhone slipped out of my pocket and
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:10.080]   is now in that crack between the seat bottom and the back?
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:12.080]   Yes, Andy, you are exactly that stupid.
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:16.760]   Why don't we just take a look back just to make sure that didn't happen?
[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:19.680]   They're mailing it to me, by the way.
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:27.120]   And I'm presuming-- you know, there's an attitude in France.
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:28.120]   I love France.
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:29.120]   I'm not knocking France.
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:30.120]   I love France.
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:31.120]   I love the food.
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:32.120]   I love the people.
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:34.160]   Everybody in Paris is very friendly.
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:38.280]   Maybe because there's such pervasive socialism there, there's not what I would call a strong
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:39.280]   work ethic.
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:41.640]   Am I wrong?
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:42.640]   Let's put it this way.
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:47.440]   It started to snow and the cabbies get in their cab, turn up the heater, fold their
[00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:50.400]   arms and start smoking and you can't get a cab.
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:51.400]   What?
[00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:52.400]   I'm not going anywhere.
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:53.400]   It's snowing.
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:54.400]   But it's snowing.
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:56.400]   I need to-- no, I'm sorry.
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.400]   I'm busy.
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:59.400]   I'm smoking.
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:04.720]   So I'm hoping that the postal service in France-- because otherwise I'm not going to get the
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:05.720]   phone till January.
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:06.720]   July.
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:07.720]   I mean, it's going to be--
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:09.200]   Well, I've never been to France.
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:10.720]   It would be unfair for me to comment.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:11.720]   I love you.
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:15.080]   And tech organizations in France would like them to fly me out there to do a talk or--
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:16.560]   You should go to the web next year.
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:19.880]   So I can defend your fine country against this slander that's been happening.
[00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:20.880]   I love France.
[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:23.880]   I've been to France every other year for the last five years.
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:27.720]   I love France, but there's some things.
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:28.720]   They just--
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:31.280]   But my next door neighbor, so I best not say too much.
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:32.280]   Yeah.
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:33.280]   They could actually come your way.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:34.280]   They had before.
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:36.240]   No, I wouldn't be the first time.
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:37.240]   Actually, they--
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:38.240]   Well, you're wrong.
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:43.080]   Yeah, relaxed or very favorable sort of working legislation.
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:44.080]   So it's very much the wrong--
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:45.080]   That's the wrong--
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:46.080]   --in favor of the workers.
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.080]   Yeah.
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:48.080]   It's a workers' paradise.
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:49.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:50.080]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:51.080]   Lots of holidays are great.
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:54.400]   You know, the terms and conditions are normally fantastic for jobs in France.
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:55.400]   Yeah.
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:56.400]   Anybody played Infinity Blade yet?
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:57.400]   Yes.
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:58.400]   Don't I run it up for a bit?
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:36:59.400]   Yeah.
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.400]   What do you think?
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:04.520]   They've sold $1.6 million worth in only five days.
[00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:06.080]   That seems pretty good.
[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:07.080]   Yeah?
[00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:08.080]   Yeah.
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:09.080]   That's how big game I bought.
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:11.800]   I did pull it up, had a go, and got through to the first level.
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:13.760]   And yeah, it's very, very impressed.
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:14.760]   Graphics are fantastic.
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:15.760]   Especially on the iPad.
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:21.160]   I don't know why a game would want to send me push notifications, but I'm going to leave
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:22.400]   that off.
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.680]   This is Unreal technology.
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:27.000]   Is this the thing that we saw the demo of that you were--
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   Exactly.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:35.280]   I'm wondering how much of it is actual interest in the game or support for the idea of someone
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:38.440]   developing a game specifically for iOS and nothing else?
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:39.440]   Right.
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:42.480]   Or just the idea of, "Gee, I've never bought a really good action game before.
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:44.560]   I've never bought an action game before.
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.560]   Everyone is saying this is going to be really awesome.
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:47.560]   Maybe I should try it."
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:48.560]   That's how I bought it.
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:49.560]   Right.
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:51.320]   Because I don't usually go for those kind of games.
[00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:52.320]   Yeah, me neither.
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:53.320]   But yeah.
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:54.320]   Well, I haven't played it yet.
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.200]   I'm just starting it right now for the first time.
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:01.400]   It's really cool because it's a slightly-- it takes something slightly complicated like
[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:06.840]   your basic Conan style fantasy sword play.
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:11.360]   And it doesn't reduce it to that stupid sort of--
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:17.600]   Well, to duck and rule to the left while raising your-- you'd have to hold down this,
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:22.040]   this, and this, tap the space bar twice and then move the mouse to the left.
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:25.760]   It's actually a very interesting control system that makes-- that's easy to work.
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:31.240]   It takes you through easily beat-upable opponents for the first three battles.
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:35.440]   And say, oh, by the way, if you want to move to the left, this way, it'll actually freeze
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:39.720]   the frame and say, now to raise your shield, you might want to do this, stroke up like this,
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:40.720]   and then--
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:42.920]   I'm getting trained here.
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:44.440]   Swipe to strike.
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:49.080]   That's the key in all of this iOS stuff is controls.
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:51.680]   Because you don't have-- if the controls are good, the game is good.
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:55.120]   And if the game is well suited to the controls, that's why, frankly, I think Angry Birds is
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:59.080]   so popular because you're just going boom, boom, boom.
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:00.480]   And that surprised me a little bit.
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:04.760]   So I always thought that the strength of iOS was going to be that you can essentially
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:08.760]   build whatever gamepad you need it to be and just simply hold it under your thumbs.
[00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:13.320]   But no, if you're clever enough as a designer, you can do a sword game in which you're just
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:17.360]   sort of tracing with your thumb the path across this person's on trails you would like your
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:21.880]   sword to make, which is very satisfying.
[00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:24.320]   It's nice to swipe is very reminiscent of fruit ninja.
[00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:28.120]   So instead of swiping through fruit, just swiping through things just inside.
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:31.480]   So really fruit ninja was preparation for this.
[00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:36.440]   Fruit doesn't reach into its pocket, give you a portrait of his baby child.
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:38.600]   Please tell them the last thing I said was I love them.
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:39.920]   You don't get that from fruit.
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:41.400]   You do get it from human.
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:43.920]   There's a very interesting one coming out in a couple of days.
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:44.920]   I think comes out.
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:48.360]   In fact, it might actually be tomorrow, the day after that's that world of goo.
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:49.920]   Oh, I love World of Goo.
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:50.920]   That's a great game.
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:54.600]   Now bring it out on the iPad and it's multi-touch, but not just one or two fingers.
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:57.760]   You can actually use four or five different fingers to pull all the different goobles
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:59.840]   out and arrange them on the screen.
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:00.840]   And that's that's you.
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:06.480]   I think tomorrow or the day after anything, the goo balls is big with me.
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:08.480]   And we have a show title.
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:09.720]   Okay, so I click start bloodline.
[00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:13.600]   I'm actually finally getting to the game after some tutorial, but it looks like there's
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:14.600]   only two moves.
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:16.640]   There's a block and a swipe, right?
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:18.200]   There's blocks, swipe.
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:19.440]   There's moving your body.
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:21.080]   I've only gotten through the first.
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:24.560]   I haven't seen any new explanations of moves yet.
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:28.640]   Might be why I tend to die later on.
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:30.480]   I tell you, graphics are spectacular.
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:34.800]   And that's really that's why this game sold is it's using the Unreal Engine and Epic's
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:36.400]   really doing a good job.
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:39.080]   Exclamation mark, horned guardian.
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:42.920]   I guess I have to beat the horned guardian.
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:44.120]   This will be this will be fun.
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:45.520]   Okay, just let's swipe him.
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:48.120]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, how do I block?
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:49.120]   How do I block?
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:50.120]   I hold that.
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:51.120]   Tap to dodge.
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:52.120]   Tap to dodge.
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:53.800]   It's still it's still training you.
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:54.800]   Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:57.200]   Enemy attacks will come from many directions.
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:58.720]   Oh, good job!
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:40:59.640]   Swiped to strike!
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:01.220]   [NON-ENGLISH SINGING]
[00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:05.200]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:09.700]   Believe you swipe upward to raise the shield.
[00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:11.000]   Ah, OK.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.020]   Oh, there, this is the block.
[00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:13.680]   Right.
[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:15.200]   Come.
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:16.200]   Woo!
[00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:18.200]   [LAUGH]
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:20.120]   I stole my old action there.
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:21.960]   Yeah, you swipes right over my head.
[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:25.200]   I'm sorry, people listening are going, what is going on?
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:27.120]   Oh, Perry's a great--
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:29.480]   This is a great show for the great, great game for radio.
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:30.960]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:32.640]   No, I can see--
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:34.120]   This is worth $5.99.
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:35.680]   Absolutely worth $5.99.
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:39.360]   You can see why they've sold so much, so many copies.
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:42.080]   I wonder if this was really part of Apple's plan
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:44.760]   all along with the pricing, because I don't get into gaming,
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:49.000]   because there's no way you can get me to spend $60 on a game.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.440]   You can barely get me to spend $25 for a movie.
[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:53.360]   Right.
[00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:54.440]   But--
[00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:55.480]   For six bucks--
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:57.920]   For six bucks, I'll definitely take risk on it.
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:59.160]   Yeah, this is great.
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:00.080]   This is great.
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:02.240]   It's a lot of fun.
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:03.920]   Yeah, I think I bought as many games.
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:06.880]   I've never ever bought as many games for either my Mac or PC
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:10.000]   than I bought for the iPhone and the iPad.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.440]   And again, not that I'm a big gamer,
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:13.640]   and not that I play them a lot, but they're just nice to have
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:15.920]   and they're nice to appreciate.
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:18.600]   Things like Cut the Rope is fantastic.
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:20.440]   Well, that was fun.
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:20.800]   You're right.
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:23.000]   It's nice when they're very easy at the end.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:27.920]   I like games where it's really easy.
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:32.080]   I'll spend six bucks if it's a game that I can't lose.
[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:33.440]   But I'm glad that it's so successful,
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:34.400]   because it's really dry.
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:36.960]   I mean, I'm sure this made back its money in the first day,
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:40.240]   1.6 million, or in the first five days.
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:44.080]   That's pretty exciting.
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:48.120]   274,000 players have currently registered the game.
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:51.840]   I guess that's where they get the $1.6 million.
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:56.240]   Now, on the iPhone, what is it like on the iPhone?
[00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:57.600]   I actually prefer it on the iPhone,
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:01.640]   because you can do just a simple two thumb sort of action
[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:02.600]   than that.
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:04.680]   I've played it briefly.
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:05.920]   Actually, this is the wrong one.
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:11.760]   This is the Star Wars Millennium Falcon Gunner game.
[00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:14.160]   But I was going to say that this is another example of a sort
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:16.720]   of game where I wouldn't spend $40 for it.
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:20.280]   But yeah, this is why I don't get much book reading done
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:21.880]   while I'm waiting for a bus.
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:24.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.880]   Die, die, die, fire bastards.
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:34.120]   Well, if you look at the list of iPad apps and the top grossing
[00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:37.800]   apps, it's pretty much all the games--
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:40.800]   Angry Birds, Plants versus Zombies.
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:43.160]   The top 10 paid apps, Angry Birds,
[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:47.360]   Doodle Jump, which my kid loves, Ski Ball.
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:49.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:54.520]   I got a share-- I was on a train to Boston yesterday,
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:55.400]   or other Sunday.
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:58.840]   And I saw the most adorable thing in the entire world.
[00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:01.920]   There was a dad with his three-year-old daughter
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:02.840]   on his lap.
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:03.560]   She's dressed up.
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:06.080]   It was rainy, so she was dressed with this colorful little rain
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:08.000]   outfit that made her look like a Christmas gift that had just
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:08.880]   been wrapped.
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:10.200]   She's sitting in his lap.
[00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:13.120]   He's holding his iPhone playing a game,
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:18.320]   and she's just tapping and playing and like, oh, look.
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:19.920]   But the bunny just hopped on.
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:23.440]   Oh, why don't you tap the tree, maybe?
[00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:24.600]   Oh, there's a squirrel.
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:25.120]   The tree.
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:26.120]   There's a squirrel.
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:28.120]   I'm like, oh, it's like it's like it's--
[00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:28.620]   Sorry.
[00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:30.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:32.280]   I'm so proud to be an apple holder.
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:32.840]   There you go.
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:34.640]   It still says what I am.
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:38.000]   Well, I have to say, I think Steve's attitude
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.800]   is informed a little bit by being a father.
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:42.880]   I mean, when he was talking about porn,
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:44.560]   he said, if you want porn, go to Android.
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:46.760]   And he said, as soon as you have kids,
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:48.640]   you're going to start caring about this stuff.
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:52.880]   Very much, he's aware of the kids.
[00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:54.600]   He does it for the kids.
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:56.920]   He's absolutely all about the kids.
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:45:01.000]   So let's see, doodle jump, skee ball, bejeweled, two plus
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:01.280]   blitz.
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:03.640]   Bejeweled blitz is fun, but you have to have a Facebook account
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:05.960]   to make that, I think, to make that worthwhile.
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:08.440]   You heard about the Smurfberry game.
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:09.440]   Yeah.
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:12.880]   The kid has spent three grand on Smurfberries.
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:14.720]   The mother--
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:16.320]   That's bad PR.
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:19.760]   Yeah, the mother said, I had no idea.
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:21.240]   It was possible.
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:24.560]   But this isn't the first time I've heard other people who
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:25.280]   kids spent--
[00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:28.600]   Paul Therod's kids spent a ton of money on fish
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:30.120]   for the aquarium.
[00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:30.600]   These are in--
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:31.680]   They're in-app purchases, yeah.
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:36.360]   Yeah, in-app purchases can be deadly for this stuff.
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:38.280]   And I wondered, when they talk about top grossing,
[00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:41.480]   do they include in-app purchases as well?
[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:43.760]   I bet they don't, because, well, of course, they would know
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:43.960]   that.
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:46.200]   Apple still gets 30%, I believe.
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:48.520]   Fruit and engine number five, cut the rope number six,
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:51.560]   all in one game box, number seven.
[00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:55.240]   The moron test, number eight.
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:59.320]   Will you pay $10 for a game that's been rated one star?
[00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:00.360]   The test.
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:02.720]   Apparently, a lot of people failed.
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:04.960]   Are you sparking up to put it on a game?
[00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:06.960]   That depends on people being idiots.
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:08.520]   I've asked, you failed.
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:09.520]   Thank you very much.
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:12.840]   I win the moron test.
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:15.480]   Plants vs. Zombies and PocketGod.
[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:18.960]   I confess I have about seven out of the top 10.
[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:22.040]   Top 10 free apps, Facebook, Angry Birds, Light Words
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:27.040]   with Friends Free, Skype, Tap Tap Revenge, the Weather
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:31.800]   Channel, Paper Toss, Bing, Bing.
[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:34.680]   It's putting Bing on their iPhone.
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:35.920]   They got all the Microsoft employees.
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:38.160]   OK, there's a boat.
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:42.200]   If you all download Bing, Rock Band Free and Talking Tomcat,
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:45.440]   the most annoying game.
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:48.160]   And yeah, I know of that because Alex Lindsey does it all.
[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:52.560]   In fact, I think it was his pick a couple of weeks ago.
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:55.200]   Top 10 grossing apps.
[00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:57.360]   What is the difference between top 10 paid apps
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:00.560]   and top 10 grossing apps?
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:02.840]   I think that includes free apps that
[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:06.120]   have in store and app purchases, I think.
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:08.960]   MLB at Bat-- that was expensive.
[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:10.080]   That's probably one of the reasons
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:10.840]   is the top grossing.
[00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:14.080]   Angry Birds, Call of Duty, Zombies, Bejeweled Blitz.
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:14.560]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:15.280]   No, no, I'm sorry.
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:16.600]   Yeah, it's going to be the amount of--
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:17.120]   Yeah, I'm sorry.
[00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:18.120]   I'm sorry.
[00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:19.120]   I'm sorry.
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:19.640]   OK, not--
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:22.960]   So top paid apps is number of sales.
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:25.320]   And top grossing is amount of money made.
[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:26.320]   Sorry.
[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:27.040]   OK.
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:28.920]   Zombie Farm-- that's a good game.
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:30.200]   Zombie Farm.
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:31.600]   Don't keep three pieces of research
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:32.640]   running at the same time, man.
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:34.400]   Because they'll start to believe they're each other.
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:36.240]   It's like, this has nothing to do with that thing
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:37.840]   you were looking into three days ago.
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:39.520]   Listen and then answer.
[00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:43.600]   The iPhone 4, is that no?
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:45.760]   Friendly, which is a great--
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:47.440]   oh, no, I'm looking at iPad only.
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:49.560]   OK, those were iPhone and iPod Touch.
[00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:52.600]   Now, top 10 paid apps for the iPad--
[00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:54.600]   Pages.
[00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:55.360]   Good reader.
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:56.440]   It's interesting.
[00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:59.200]   I am the one who said that the iPad is not a productivity
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:47:59.520]   tool.
[00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:02.560]   And yet, what are the top apps paid apps?
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:03.800]   They're all productivity.
[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:05.560]   Number three numbers.
[00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:08.760]   Finally, number four Angry Birds, then Keynote,
[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:14.640]   Glee Karaoke, Wolfram Alpha, Pinball HD, Friendly, and Starwalk.
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:18.000]   So for the iPad, a very big difference.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.920]   A lot of productivity stuff in there.
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:22.440]   It'd be interesting to know who's actually
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:23.800]   using those applications.
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:25.040]   I mean, the pages--
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:25.920]   We all bought them.
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:26.600]   We use them.
[00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:27.120]   Yeah.
[00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:28.680]   You know, the sort of things that you
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:30.920]   buy to see what they look like on the iPad.
[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:33.480]   I mean, I know I haven't done a tutorial on the iPad versions
[00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:34.880]   of those applications yet.
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:36.400]   But it's something I need to address really,
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:38.920]   because I think, in some respects--
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:40.440]   and that sounds a bit weird, but I
[00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:42.480]   find it quite hard to use, because it's
[00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:46.720]   a completely different paradigm of using your fingers.
[00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:49.360]   I need really to apply myself to understand how they work properly.
[00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:52.160]   And I think that's a barrier to a lot of people.
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:53.040]   I would actually--
[00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:54.040]   Go ahead.
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:57.520]   I had a really interesting reaction to Keynote.
[00:48:57.520 --> 00:48:59.800]   I'm at the point now where I will design--
[00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:02.960]   I prefer to actually design it in the iPad version of Keynote
[00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:05.840]   from the desktop version, because you
[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:07.840]   feel like you can just reach out onto your slide
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:09.960]   and put things exactly where you want them to go,
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:13.200]   as opposed to somebody saying, OK, that's close enough.
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:14.880]   That's kind of where I want it to go.
[00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:17.440]   If there were an easy way to put custom fonts on it,
[00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:21.480]   then I would always use it to put presentations together.
[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:24.720]   I'm still kind of addicted to my comic book fonts,
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:29.000]   but it's a big win.
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:30.880]   So according to Rovio, by the way,
[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:32.440]   and I was curious about this, because they
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:34.320]   charge for Angry Birds on the iPhone,
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:35.880]   and they give it away on Android.
[00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:41.000]   $12 million iPhones, $18 million Android,
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.680]   for a total of 30 million units.
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:45.960]   Wow.
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:48.480]   The Android version has been downloaded 5 million.
[00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:50.640]   I don't understand why they're saying, oh, I guess
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:52.720]   the number of down--
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:55.880]   I'm confused-- $30 million downloads, $12 million
[00:49:55.880 --> 00:50:00.560]   from paid, which means they're the iPhone or iPad.
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:05.160]   But the company says it makes more money in advertising.
[00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:06.640]   The ad supported one makes more money
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:08.840]   than the ones that they sell.
[00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:10.320]   Because they don't sell it for much.
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:13.320]   It's like a buck 99, right?
[00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:15.080]   I was curious which would be the better model.
[00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:16.520]   And obviously, they wanted to do an experiment.
[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:18.560]   So they said, well, let's do ad supported on Android
[00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:19.640]   and paid on iPhone.
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:21.280]   Well, there was a--
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:22.640]   I'm trying to remember where--
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:26.120]   I might have been a grouper who linked this a few days ago.
[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:29.200]   But a developer of a battleship type game
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:33.160]   decided to write a really long report about the switch
[00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:36.000]   between making-- switching it from a paid app to a free app
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.560]   within game ads, and how the difference was just like--
[00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:41.000]   it was like flipping on the money switch,
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.560]   as soon as you switched it to a free app that just simply
[00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:45.440]   makes this money another way.
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:46.680]   The other interesting part of that
[00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:50.240]   was talking about how, even though this game is now taking
[00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:52.200]   a couple of grand, three grand a month,
[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:55.280]   it was essentially-- at two or three grand a month,
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:57.280]   it was essentially supporting itself,
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:00.640]   as opposed to being a good profitable game for the company.
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:02.360]   Ah, interesting.
[00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:03.800]   Well, I'm going to talk about in just a second
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:07.760]   about a new way of making money on your game.
[00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:10.000]   Angry Birds is actually doing something really kind of surprising.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.760]   I don't know if they'll be able to do it in the US,
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:13.120]   but they are going to do it in Finland.
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:13.680]   We'll tell them about it.
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:14.880]   Tell you about that in just a second.
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:15.440]   But first, I think--
[00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:16.760]   Fins have all the good things.
[00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:18.200]   They get all the-- they get all the--
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:20.920]   this is why we can't have nice things.
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:23.080]   I want to talk a little bit about our friends at Citrix,
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:25.080]   the folks who do the great go-to meeting.
[00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:28.680]   We use it all the time for our meetings.
[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:30.600]   We have several accounts, because sometimes we'll actually
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:32.240]   have multiple meetings going on at once.
[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:33.240]   Go to meeting.
[00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:33.760]   You want to try it?
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:35.680]   You can try it free for 30 days.
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:37.320]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:39.040]   Yes, it's cross-platform.
[00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:41.560]   It even has a great iPad, a free iPad app that
[00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:43.440]   allows you to attend meetings.
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:46.320]   You have to have a Mac or a PC to start meetings.
[00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:48.080]   You'll cut costs by reducing travel.
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:49.920]   You'll improve your conference calls,
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:52.080]   your communications of the people you work with.
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:52.880]   You will work smarter.
[00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:55.240]   You will be more efficient.
[00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:58.840]   And frankly, people will stop fighting you
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:00.360]   over having conference calls with you,
[00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:01.800]   because they're more interesting.
[00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:03.320]   What happens is you start a go-to meeting.
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:04.800]   You can either send them an email with a link,
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:06.600]   or you could just-- while you're on the phone, say, hey,
[00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:07.680]   let's everybody go to go to meeting.
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:09.440]   I want you to see this.
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:13.320]   They click a link, enter a number, the meeting ID.
[00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:15.560]   And 30 seconds later, they're seeing your desktop
[00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:16.720]   on their computer.
[00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:18.240]   They can take over--
[00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:19.240]   you can give them control.
[00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:20.720]   You can see their desktop.
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:22.600]   You can let them control your computer remotely.
[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:23.560]   So it's great for training.
[00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:25.080]   Like if you have an application, you say, OK,
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:26.080]   this is how you do it.
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:26.920]   Now you try it.
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:29.040]   They can try it on your system.
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:31.160]   Of course, for sales presentations, it's fantastic.
[00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:32.880]   And I think it's useful, because you
[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:34.640]   don't have to make your clients jump through hoops.
[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:36.960]   They don't have to have the program installed ahead of time.
[00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:39.320]   It's just very quick and easy.
[00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:41.120]   Great for collaborating.
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:42.880]   I want you to try it free for 30 days.
[00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:47.040]   Visit go-to-meeting.com/MacBreak.
[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:50.240]   Easy to install, easy to use, very affordable,
[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:51.640]   and free for the first 30 days.
[00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:54.720]   Go to meeting.com/MacBreak.
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:57.360]   We thank Citrix for their support of Go to Meeting.
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:59.880]   I mean, of MacBreak Weekly with Go to Meeting.
[00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:02.720]   If you know what I mean, I certainly don't.
[00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:05.280]   If you know what I mean.
[00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:09.520]   Having sold millions of copies of--
[00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:12.600]   this is good writing from--
[00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:16.040]   actually, Sean Brownlee, ready for call to Mac Leander's website.
[00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:18.320]   Having sold millions of copies of their Fowels
[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:22.960]   versus Sows Catapult game--
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:24.840]   Angry Birds, of course.
[00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:26.800]   Rovio is experiencing such success.
[00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:28.240]   They're even starting to begrudge Apple.
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:30.720]   They're 30% off the top of in-app purchases.
[00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:31.680]   This is a big issue, right?
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:33.960]   It's because Apple takes 30% of everything.
[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:35.320]   In fact, I think it's the reason Apple--
[00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:36.480]   and then Apple's getting a little heat.
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:38.120]   Apple won't do charitable--
[00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:43.120]   won't allow charities in their applications to do donations.
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:45.400]   And I really believe that the reason is Apple doesn't want
[00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:46.880]   to waive the 30%.
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:48.600]   And they can't really say, oh, we'll
[00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:50.640]   take 30% of your charitable contribution.
[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:54.240]   So they're just saying, let's avoid the issue and not allow it.
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:55.240]   Does that make sense?
[00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:56.640]   I think that's why.
[00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:59.440]   Well, what do you do when a company like--
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:02.680]   let's say NPR or some nonprofit corporation
[00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:08.720]   wants to sell a useful app that supports what they do
[00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:10.040]   in their mission?
[00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:13.120]   And really, it is technically revenue for the company.
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:16.520]   It's not as though they're saying, if you touch this button
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:21.920]   and donate $5, we will give $4.98 to somebody who desperately
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:23.120]   needs food and shelter.
[00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:25.640]   It's more like you're supporting this company that
[00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:26.480]   does good things.
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:28.800]   But it's not like you're going to be doing something tax
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:31.000]   deductible with this donation.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   I don't think it's--
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.480]   I don't think it's more about Apple not
[00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:36.720]   wanting to share the revenue so much as they're
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:38.520]   saying right over there.
[00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:41.080]   It's like you were saying about--
[00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:43.960]   if there's a way you can safely pick up a porcupine,
[00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:46.880]   but you have to really want to pick it up.
[00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:49.720]   And I think that's what we're talking about where it's like.
[00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:51.520]   There's a way for them to make people
[00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:54.080]   able to donate to charities through an iPhone app.
[00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:57.360]   But Apple has to really want to make that happen in order
[00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:59.680]   to get everything in place to make sure it doesn't bite them
[00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:00.080]   in the middle.
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:01.160]   I wish they would do it though.
[00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:02.480]   I mean, think about--
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:04.040]   it makes it so easy to donate.
[00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:07.720]   Just think about how beneficial it would be to these nonprofits.
[00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:10.920]   If you could say, have an American Red Cross app,
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:13.920]   and donate through it, it would be fantastic.
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:15.520]   I wish they would do it.
[00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:19.720]   Anyway, Rovio says, we've got a way to bypass Apple's 30%.
[00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:23.960]   They're going to launch something called Bad Piggybank.
[00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:28.640]   In-game payment system, which will allow angry bird--
[00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:32.040]   there's a picture of Bad Piggybank, which will allow angry
[00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:35.360]   birds players--
[00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:38.000]   I don't know what you'd buy.
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:39.680]   Some games they go, this is so hard.
[00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:43.840]   If you want a solution, you could just buy it.
[00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:45.560]   Or here's a bomb you could just destroy it.
[00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:47.520]   That's what you could sell.
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:49.680]   Here's an atom bomb that you could destroy the pigs
[00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:51.560]   in this level with one stroke.
[00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:54.440]   I'd pay 99 cents on some levels just to kill those
[00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:56.800]   called during pigs.
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:59.400]   Bad Piggybank in-app purchase system
[00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:00.920]   will not use credit cards.
[00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:07.000]   It will use the phone billing to pay for it.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.400]   Some Android apps do that.
[00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:10.440]   That's quite so resonant because that's
[00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:12.080]   sort of taken Apple's model.
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:14.800]   It's so easy to buy stuff on the iTunes store
[00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:16.480]   because they have your credit card details.
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:18.200]   So it just disappears.
[00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:19.960]   That's how Windows Phone works.
[00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:22.600]   In fact, any purchase I do on the Windows Phone
[00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:26.440]   goes to AT&T or goes through AT&T.
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:28.400]   Well, I'm absolutely positive this is going to work
[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:32.200]   because Apple loves being bypassed.
[00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:34.560]   They're like, oh, we can't do anything about this.
[00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:35.400]   I guess you win this one.
[00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:36.400]   OK.
[00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:37.400]   OK.
[00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:38.960]   OK.
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:42.400]   It says-- I was like, I'll be a camera plus working for you.
[00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:45.120]   It says, bad Piggybank will first launch in Finland
[00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:48.000]   based on Elisa, the country's biggest telecom provider.
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.680]   Any in-app purchase will be out of their monthly bill
[00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:53.320]   or even purchases of other games with other countries
[00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:54.240]   and telecoms to follow.
[00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:55.600]   I can bet you you're absolutely right.
[00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:57.680]   There's one country that will not be available
[00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:01.000]   and that's the US of A.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:04.120]   I believe Don has frozen his video is freezing.
[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:06.120]   Oh, I thought he was just stunned.
[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:07.720]   Oh, he's made it close as well.
[00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:10.520]   He's meditating.
[00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:12.320]   He's like Dr. Strange.
[00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:15.680]   He's astral projecting his opinion.
[00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:17.200]   You can't believe--
[00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:18.120]   We hear you fine.
[00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:21.080]   Frankly, I hesitate to do anything about this
[00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:23.720]   because you'll get cut off in a bit.
[00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:24.640]   OK.
[00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:26.240]   Switch a video off and switch it back on again.
[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:27.800]   Let's see if that works.
[00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:29.800]   OK.
[00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:32.280]   Rovio intends to bring the bad Piggybank to other games
[00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:34.400]   and will even be offering better rates at Apple's
[00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:35.800]   traditional 70/30 split.
[00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:38.040]   Yeah, there's no way that's going to happen in the US.
[00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:39.440]   I guess they could do it in other--
[00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:40.280]   Yeah, yeah, he's moving.
[00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:40.960]   He's moving.
[00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:41.960]   Look at that.
[00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:44.280]   It's amazing.
[00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:47.680]   The amazing moving Don.
[00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:48.800]   Al Jolson, he sings.
[00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:50.040]   He dances.
[00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:52.440]   He can move.
[00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:53.120]   I don't even know.
[00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:54.400]   I guess they can get away with this
[00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:58.080]   because Apple has a looser, less control
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:57:58.960]   in the other countries.
[00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:02.240]   I don't know how they get away with it.
[00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:05.240]   Did you see Woz's white iPhone?
[00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:05.920]   Yes.
[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:08.400]   He's such a wag.
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:10.400]   He's such a wag.
[00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:14.360]   He flashed it on CNN the other day.
[00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:15.960]   He just-- that's just Woz for you.
[00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:21.280]   He actually has some plates that he glued onto his regular black
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:22.280]   eyes.
[00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:26.000]   That guy overseas who got ahold of some of the production
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.360]   run and was just selling the plates
[00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:28.920]   to do your own aftermarket upgrade.
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:29.400]   Right.
[00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:32.040]   Actually, Apple shut him down.
[00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:33.640]   After Woz got his--
[00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:36.960]   if any of you listening, if you actually own a white iPhone,
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:39.440]   how special do you feel right now that you actually
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:41.520]   have a real one and Woz had a sort of--
[00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:42.520]   Even Woz.
[00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:43.520]   --get one on the snive.
[00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:45.560]   And Woz doesn't have one.
[00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:47.880]   You're better than Woz, except for you standing
[00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:49.880]   at the industry and the money and the other than that.
[00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:50.400]   Yeah, well, yeah.
[00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:51.520]   Other than that.
[00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:53.080]   But still, other than that, you have a phone
[00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:54.440]   that he doesn't have.
[00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:56.480]   No one can take that away from you, except for Apple
[00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:57.960]   when they find out you have it, you shouldn't,
[00:58:57.960 --> 00:58:59.360]   and they can take it away from you.
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:01.080]   But you will have had it for--
[00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:02.440]   in the tournament amount of time.
[00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:04.440]   Actually, Woz is better than all of us in almost every way,
[00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:06.040]   because I probably should--
[00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:07.400]   we'll hold that for editing.
[00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:09.120]   That's-- go ahead.
[00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:11.400]   Just keep digging.
[00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:14.840]   Radio Shack had a promotion, which is over now,
[00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:16.600]   selling the iPhone for $50.
[00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:18.400]   Wow.
[00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:21.160]   Even before the promotion expired,
[00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:24.840]   they were completely sold out of their entire stock.
[00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:27.640]   Apple insider said they contacted the Radio Shack stores
[00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:30.120]   on Friday, and all but one in Tennessee
[00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:33.000]   said completely sold out of the iPhone 4.
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:37.240]   And it was just-- I mean, no surprise.
[00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:42.600]   It just shows you that demand continues high for this phone.
[00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:44.640]   Yeah, we don't see any of that over here in the UK.
[00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:46.800]   It's-- but there's still--
[00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:48.240]   everywhere is still at a premium price,
[00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:51.240]   so we don't really see any special offers anywhere like that.
[00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:51.880]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:53.960]   Actually, I bet you Radio Shack's eating it, right?
[00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:56.600]   Because I don't think Apple's officially discounting it
[00:59:56.600 --> 00:59:57.080]   in any way.
[00:59:57.080 --> 00:59:59.800]   I think Radio Shack's just eating $150.
[00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:01.960]   That's my guess, too.
[01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:02.920]   Yeah.
[01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:03.880]   There's my phone.
[01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:06.600]   I'm actually pulling up to see if there's a--
[01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:09.640]   Yeah, here we go.
[01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:10.200]   I'm sorry.
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:11.240]   It's not $50.
[01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:12.680]   It's actually just $50 off.
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:13.400]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:13.800]   You're right.
[01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:15.960]   But the iPhone 4 and the 3GS,
[01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:17.960]   but even so, a $50 discount is significant.
[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:21.480]   I'm looking at the press release that Radio Shack sent me
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:22.520]   last week about it.
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:22.760]   Right.
[01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:26.360]   It's also not only that, but 3G and 3GS handset,
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:29.400]   a trade-in credit of $75 and $125,
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:30.200]   depending on the model.
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:31.080]   They've done that before.
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:33.000]   And that's a really good way to buy an iPhone
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.120]   as if you can get that trade-in.
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:37.800]   So you really-- that would have been--
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:38.760]   Yeah, here we go.
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:42.840]   iPhone 4, 16 gigabytes, the cheapest you could have bought
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:45.400]   at 4 and this deal was $24.99.
[01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:46.120]   Holy cow.
[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:47.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:48.280]   A fairly OK deal.
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:49.560]   Holy cow.
[01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:51.640]   If you'd have to trade in an older--
[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:52.680]   3GS, right?
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:53.960]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:58.120]   That's for the 16-gig model with a trade-in of a 3GS.
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:00:58.600]   That's--
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:00:59.720]   And if you have your battery--
[01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:02.040]   your battery club card, battery of the month club card.
[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:03.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:05.000]   Back to the 3.9 volt battery.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.560]   Show of hands how many people have a Radio Shack.
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:08.600]   But yeah, I thought so, Andy.
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:11.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:13.880]   And I think it's the funk now, but yeah, I was the kid who--
[01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:14.520]   I always could.
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:16.520]   I can have my free diesel battery.
[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:17.960]   What a battery, please.
[01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:19.080]   I'm making a flashlight.
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:19.720]   Two more bucks.
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:20.680]   I can have one.
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:21.720]   I'll see you in a week.
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:25.160]   According to Mac Daily News,
[01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:28.360]   Verizon held management training for iPhone sales
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:29.560]   last week.
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:33.080]   They had iPhones in management hands for these sessions.
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:35.400]   And apparently, this I don't believe.
[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:37.640]   Apparently, but according to the source
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:39.000]   that Mac Daily News is quoting,
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.640]   these were LTE-capable iPhones.
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:45.640]   Believe or not?
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:47.960]   Well, if you know, it's--
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:50.600]   don't be so skeptical because every other time,
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:53.720]   there has been a story about how a carrier has gotten training
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:54.920]   on selling the iPhone.
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:56.120]   It's always been right on the--
[01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:56.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:57.640]   OK, it's lies.
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:59.480]   We're living in Dreamland.
[01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:00.280]   Let's continue.
[01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:02.280]   It might be true.
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:06.920]   There's more indications that a non-18Ti phone is coming.
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:08.920]   So I'm more attentive than I was,
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:12.520]   but I'm still in the camp where when I actually get contacted
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:15.320]   by an actual person who actually works for Apple
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:17.080]   or actually works for one of these characters,
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:19.800]   carriers, and actually shows me one,
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:20.680]   then I'll totally believe it.
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:25.240]   Continuing on in our fantasy series,
[01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:29.320]   formal announcement coming right after Christmas.
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:34.840]   Apparently, AT&T's final demand
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:41.000]   was that you don't tell anyone till after Christmas.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:45.080]   Verizon phone will be available immediately
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:46.200]   upon formal announcement.
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:47.960]   So what they're saying is--
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:48.840]   bye-bye, Don.
[01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:49.320]   Here he comes.
[01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:50.120]   He's coming back.
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:50.440]   I'm talking about--
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:52.440]   I guess you just turn it off every time you freeze.
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:53.640]   Yeah, I'll keep on.
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:54.440]   I'm sorry.
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:57.160]   I'm sorry.
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:59.320]   Apparently, they're going to, like, December 26th,
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:00.760]   you'll be able to buy a Verizon iPhone.
[01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:03.160]   According to this, the device has been,
[01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:05.800]   quote, "100% cooked for quite a while
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:09.640]   and is already shipping in bulk to Verizon warehouses."
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:10.600]   This is great stuff.
[01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:12.600]   I don't believe the word of it, but it's great.
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:15.080]   The Verizon iPhone is not being shipped to any third-party
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:17.560]   retailers in an effort to control leaks for
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:20.840]   Ryzen agrees to take 100% responsibility for security.
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:22.920]   That would be the case, of course, if Apple's doing this.
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:24.520]   Yeah.
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:26.200]   The new iPhone-- this is the thing I'm
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:29.960]   wondering about this, this idea of LTE.
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:32.600]   But Verizon did say we're going to roll out LTE
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:34.520]   before the end of the year in, like, 38 markets,
[01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:35.080]   something like that.
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:35.880]   I mean, the big deal.
[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:42.840]   Multi-band, backward compatibility, regular CDMA.
[01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:47.160]   Steve Jobs is said to be upset.
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:51.240]   Sorry.
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:52.920]   I don't even-- I just want to continue.
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:53.880]   That's it.
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:54.840]   That's it.
[01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:55.320]   That's right.
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:55.880]   You know what?
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:58.200]   You had a really good rumor going there, son,
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:01.400]   but you kept-- you said, no, let's spray paint a gold.
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:04.120]   No, let's put some fake diamonds on it.
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:05.880]   No, it-- no, we're almost there.
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:06.920]   Now let's sign it.
[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:07.640]   Rainwire.
[01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:08.200]   And then--
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:11.720]   Steve Jobs is said to be upset.
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:15.080]   The carriers cannot seem to get their LTE act together more
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:17.560]   quickly, so according to this rumor,
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:20.680]   Apple is helping US carriers to build it out
[01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:21.880]   more quickly.
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:25.960]   Now, Mac Daily News notes the above information
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:27.960]   is from a sole source that we believe to be credible,
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:29.640]   but should be treated as a rumor since we cannot
[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:31.320]   independently confirm the information.
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:34.040]   I think if there were phones going to Verizon warehouses,
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:35.560]   we'd hear about it now by now.
[01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:37.640]   Especially shipping.
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:39.400]   I mean, it says it's shipping in bulk, doesn't it?
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:41.400]   It sounds as though there's wagons of them turning up.
[01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:48.600]   And this is usually the time when it becomes just logistically
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:51.480]   impossible to keep the lid on a secret like this.
[01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:53.400]   And this is around the time you start seeing
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:56.440]   a really good, hard rumor that's being reported
[01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:58.760]   by the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times,
[01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:03.560]   or a good international paper where you're 40% sure that someone
[01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:06.200]   in Apple said, a rumor is going to get out.
[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:09.400]   Let's be the ones who leak the rumor just so that it's not a
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:10.840]   rumor about how much this phone sucks.
[01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:12.920]   That's a rumor about how awesome this phone is going to be.
[01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:18.440]   Just to pile on, Consumer Reports surveys its readers,
[01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:20.680]   they do a, these, I think these surveys are quite credible
[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:24.120]   because they get a lot of results and they do it for cars.
[01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:26.760]   They did this year for cell providers.
[01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:32.280]   The number one provider in the US, a small regional carrier
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:34.680]   called US Cellular, they're in 26 states.
[01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:39.640]   58,000 Consumer Reports subscribers are responding to this survey.
[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:43.080]   That to me, 58,000 gives it a lot of credibility.
[01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:50.600]   Number two Verizon, number three, I'm sorry, number two Sprint,
[01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:53.560]   number three Verizon.
[01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:57.320]   Well, it depends what you're looking at.
[01:05:57.320 --> 01:06:00.440]   If you're looking at customer service, Sprint beats Verizon,
[01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:01.560]   anybody probably.
[01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:06.520]   Actually, Sprint's usually had terrible customer service,
[01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:06.920]   haven't they?
[01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:07.880]   Maybe they're getting better.
[01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:13.080]   T-Mobile, second to last, rated lower than both Verizon
[01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:14.760]   and Sprint and overall satisfaction.
[01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:17.560]   And then finally, who's left?
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:23.960]   At the very bottom of the pit, the lowest circle of hell, AT&T.
[01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:29.160]   Of the AT&T customer survey, over half owned iPhone survey results found,
[01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:33.720]   iPhone users less satisfied than others with other smartphones with their carrier.
[01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:37.640]   Our survey, Consumer Reports really doesn't like the iPhone
[01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:39.000]   and really doesn't like AT&T.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.240]   Our survey suggests that an iPhone from Verizon Wireless,
[01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:43.880]   which is rumored, could indeed be good news for iPhone fans,
[01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:49.400]   many users tweeting reaction to the survey results on Twitter wrote surprise surprise.
[01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:52.520]   AT&T says, quote,
[01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:58.920]   "We take this seriously and we continually look for new ways to improve customer service."
[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:08.520]   Okay, so AT&T sucks.
[01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:09.400]   What's the news?
[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:10.680]   What's the news there?
[01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:14.760]   Let's a couple more stories and we're going to get to our picks of the week.
[01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:18.200]   I said I had a Mac story.
[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:19.160]   I've been saving this.
[01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:22.440]   We've had so little Mac news ever since the year.
[01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:23.800]   We did say how good the year was.
[01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:24.600]   That's a Mac story.
[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:28.840]   Apple, according to Apple Insider, is going to use Sandy Bridge.
[01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:36.040]   Future Mac book set to arrive next year will rely on Intel's forthcoming Sandy Bridge
[01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:36.760]   processor.
[01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:39.720]   That means NVIDIA's graphics processors
[01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:44.280]   will not be included in at least some models, 13 inches and under, according to a new report.
[01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:48.440]   CNETS actually got this story, citing anonymous sources.
[01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:53.480]   Screen sizes of 13 inches and under will switch to Sandy Bridge,
[01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:56.120]   which is a Intel chip with built-in graphics.
[01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:59.240]   Supposedly good graphics, I don't know.
[01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:05.160]   But I guess this would be a way of lowering the cost and lowering the power consumption
[01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:07.000]   and making a smaller device.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.600]   I think it's incredible.
[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:15.080]   It's going to be really interesting next year to see what they do with the standard MacBook
[01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:17.640]   and the MacBook Pro and how they've launched the Air.
[01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:21.160]   Because they made huge inroads into performance and portability with the Air that
[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:26.840]   really makes you think what they could actually do if they put some of these high performance chips
[01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:31.560]   in a top-end laptop that also has the solid-state drive.
[01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:36.280]   Because presumably the prices will drop down. It's going to be strange now in that I think
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:39.960]   the traditional drives will come as a built-over option and I think the standard drives will be
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:41.000]   the SSD drives.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.640]   Yeah. I think that I would agree with you on that.
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:45.960]   The Air is such a...
[01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:52.120]   Not a surprise, but such a success that I have to say it's got to influence the line.
[01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:55.560]   And SSDs is clearly what makes the difference in speed, right?
[01:08:55.560 --> 01:09:01.240]   I'd be kind of surprised if they made the SSD as standard as opposed to a built-over option.
[01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:05.640]   What if they did a small... This is kind of what I would do.
[01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:14.280]   Small, like 32 gig boot drive with the OS on it, SSD, and then a larger spinning drive as a data drive.
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:17.880]   Or even just use a hybrid drive.
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:19.320]   Oh, are there hybrids like that?
[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:25.240]   Yeah, I think a C-Get I think makes at least one drive like that,
[01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:29.240]   where it's part of it a solid-state, part of it is mechanical and it's always...
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:33.480]   And the controller is intelligently figuring out that, okay, these files are being used all the
[01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:34.840]   time, so we're going to just move them onto it.
[01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:38.600]   Right. Because SSD makes such a difference in performance.
[01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:42.920]   Oh, yeah. It's definitely... All things being equal is what you want to get, but
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:48.440]   like I said, when it first came out, it's such a premium at price to spend.
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:53.240]   And I'm not sure if I'd rather have speed or an extra 200 or 300 gigabytes
[01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:55.400]   over the storage of the same amount of price.
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:57.880]   Well, you got the choice. And I think that's why the Air is so successful.
[01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:01.080]   It's showing that there are... For some people, a very lightweight, very fast
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:07.080]   computer with small amount of storage, admittedly, is the right choice.
[01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:10.440]   And I think as we move to the cloud, I think that's one lesson we were talking before the show
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:16.680]   began about Google's Chrome OS and the CR48 laptop that they've been giving to some press people.
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:20.440]   And which neither Andy nor I are overwhelmed by.
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:30.360]   But it does show that there are some people who will accept reduced capability for reduced
[01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:33.800]   complexity, security, and are content within cloud storage.
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:37.800]   Yeah. For me, the iPad really demonstrates that.
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:43.240]   I mean, it's such a wonderful extension of my home machine and my MacBook,
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:46.040]   simply by virtue of the fact that I don't have to sync it. I don't have to do anything.
[01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:51.720]   All I have to do is connect to Dropbox. And I've got everything that I wanted to leave the house with.
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:59.960]   And now the North Point Band will play the iPad as we prepare for our picks of the week.
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:18.040]   Eat your hot out, Keith Richards. Eric Clapton, you're not God anymore.
[01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:30.920]   Look, he's got a little bell ringing thing. That's pretty cool.
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:39.320]   So that's the North Point Band. They're an iPad-only band.
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:43.080]   I wish we had a list of the apps they're using on this.
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:47.640]   There's a blog post. Slurts are bouncing away.
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:51.800]   I don't want to know where he got the hat, though. That's okay.
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:12:05.960]   The screen is an iPhone. Oh, he's playing the guitar as an iPhone.
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:10.520]   I think this is a testament to a couple of things. First of all, that multi-touch
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:17.160]   really is critical. I mean, all of these are multi-touch apps and that the sound quality is
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:25.560]   pretty damn good on these devices. See, they really made that jump where you can use iPads and
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:31.080]   iPhones as musical devices because they work as musical devices, not the same way that some bands
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:36.120]   use. Oh, we're playing this calculator as an instrument to blow your mind about technology.
[01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:42.840]   No, it's because we have an iPad. We want a bell ring keyboard and he's ready to do it.
[01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:49.000]   This ain't no Casio. That's just amazing. I wonder if people go around now caroling with their
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:56.040]   iPads. Wouldn't that be cool? The iPad also was part of the amazing race finale on Sunday night.
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:13:02.840]   Really? How so? There are no spoilers involved, but it's the every final episode of every season,
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:07.400]   the amazing race ends with one of the final challenges is that each race, each of the three
[01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:12.520]   teams has to essentially reconstruct and rebuild their memories of the entire race so far.
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:16.200]   And so they built a game show set with Bob Ubanks in Los Angeles.
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:23.160]   And essentially, that's worth watching. To essentially build, like, this route,
[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:27.880]   reconstruct this route, like it's like a game show set. Everyone had an iPad that they had to sort of
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:31.720]   have things around to figure out. Okay, no, the guy with the hat was from Belgium,
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:35.160]   the guy with the hat with the bells on it. He was from not a wheelchair.
[01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:43.240]   Hey, the chat rooms demanding that I do a story which I have ignored and I guess I will mention it
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:47.800]   just, you know, because I listened to the chat room, just like the 92nd Street. Why?
[01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:54.040]   We love our users. We love our listeners. They say, what about the fact that Apple took the
[01:13:54.040 --> 01:14:02.120]   jailbreak detection API out of iOS 4.0? What about that?
[01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:12.120]   Interesting. I let me just recap that in iOS 4.0, they put an API that allowed you to detect whether
[01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:16.440]   a phone was jailbroken. A third party app could detect whether it was running on a jailbroken
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:22.760]   phone or not. Right. Not sure why or what before, but Apple didn't use it. It's not like they
[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:28.040]   wrote an app that said we're going to brick you. I think part of it might have been because there
[01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:35.080]   really is a huge code. There is really is a huge marketplace for pirated apps. So maybe it was
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:39.400]   there so that if a guy wanted, if a developer wanted to see, am I running on it? If I'm running
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:44.600]   a jailbroken phone, don't even don't even mess with it. That's what it is. Yeah, that's exactly what
[01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:50.840]   it was for. I couldn't really turn up anybody who was using it or thought it was a good or bad idea.
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:55.320]   Again, this is another one. This is another one of those topics where I found myself not
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:59.960]   knowing very much about it and had to ask around and essentially the answer to the question,
[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:04.360]   why did they remove it? It seemed to be that I couldn't find anybody who was in any way interested
[01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:10.440]   or excited about it. And the purpose of this the purpose of this API is to make an app not
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:15.960]   work anymore. So there you go. Our picks of the week coming up and thank you,
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:22.760]   chat room for that fine suggestion. Our picks of the week coming up just a bit. Don McAllister
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:26.520]   is here from Screencasts online. He's working very hard for the holiday season, cranking out
[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:32.360]   Screencast just for you. Certainly I'm certainly I'm coming up. You want to plug?
[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:38.840]   Yeah, we've got the the Macmanium Macworld. We've got a couple of sessions at Macworld.
[01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:42.200]   I'm excited about that. You're going to be at Macworld. So we're going to cover Macworld. I know
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:46.920]   Andy, you're going to be there too. Third week, fourth week in January. It's in January again this
[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:51.640]   year, right? Yes. Was the end of January? Yeah, last week of January. We will be doing Macbreak
[01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:58.360]   Weekly from Macworld on like a Thursday though, because it's not Tuesday. So Don and Andy,
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:01.720]   I hope you will be part of that. Excellent. Yeah. Definitely.
[01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:07.880]   And so come out. We'll be with the with that. I think Alex Lindsey has a whole pixel course stage
[01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:15.560]   somewhere at Macworld. So we'll be on that stage. And then the Macmani is too late, I think to
[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:19.560]   maybe not go to insightcruises.com and see if you can get on Macmania 11.
[01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:25.400]   I noticed that was is just joined. Was is joining us. I know. Yeah, that's cool. I bought about
[01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:32.760]   each show. He's putting snow tires on the segue. I'm sure. I hope he goes on the Antarctica
[01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:35.880]   article. That's going to be really fun. So we're going, we're leaving Buenos Aires. We're
[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:39.880]   selling around Cape Horn. This is why my wife's not on it. I said, Oh, honey, it's going to be
[01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:44.760]   really great. She said, Cape Horn. I said, yeah, you know, only 50,000 ships have gone down over
[01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:50.680]   the last century. It's not that dangerous. She said, I'll see you on the other side. So she's
[01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:56.520]   going to meet us at Porto Mont and finish the trip after Cape Horn. But it sounds like, Oh, an
[01:16:56.520 --> 01:17:00.920]   amazing cruise. I know, I don't know if there's still availability, but visit insight cruises.
[01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:07.240]   And soon, watch soon because the 2012. Is it okay? Don, you think for me to mention this?
[01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:14.440]   Yeah, I think there's. It's already on the site. They're going to do a European river. I'm
[01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:17.880]   so upset. But this one's going to be very limited because it's a small little river boat.
[01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:25.560]   I've already started sucking up to Neil. This one, my wife wants to go on to
[01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:29.640]   Neil, I heard you by people. I can do house. It's helped moving your furniture.
[01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:36.680]   I'll do anything you ask, Neil. insight cruises.com, the 2012 Mac mania.
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:43.320]   This is he's never done this before. We'll be a river cruise through Europe. That's going to be
[01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:48.760]   amazing trip. And I don't know who's going to speak on that because obviously, it's not been
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:55.320]   published as a no, Neil's taking bribes now. Okay. You got three people right here.
[01:17:55.960 --> 01:18:00.040]   We're dying to go on that one. Yeah, there it is. No, that's van. I'm sorry.
[01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:05.880]   Mac mania 12 says Vancouver to San Diego. What's the river trip? That's the one after that.
[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:11.880]   That's the name of 14. Well, right. Oh, oh, this is this is this is in 2012. We have lots of time
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:18.680]   to save up. Okay. Also, two Christmases in which we can give him presents to demonstrate how much
[01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:23.880]   lots more time to bribe. So that's going to be April 1st through 8th 2012.
[01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:31.320]   Anyway, enough of that. That's not even just dream. That's something to do with you listeners.
[01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:36.680]   It happens to do with all of us. That's exactly. It'll be a lovely time. Whoever's speaking,
[01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:41.480]   we're just hoping you get to speak. He does some amazing cruises. You see how you see,
[01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:47.800]   I have the power. I can I can isn't he a great guy. He does some lovely man. So active.
[01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:52.120]   Community. The kids and the people.
[01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:58.120]   Ah, coming up our picks of the week. But right now I would love to tell you about our good friends
[01:18:58.120 --> 01:19:05.960]   at hover.com. Hover is domain management made simple. I was actually at the airport moving
[01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:10.760]   domains over to hover.com. That's how easy it was. I was doing it on my iPad. Lots of times you go
[01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:15.080]   to these sites and they barrage you with page after page of offers. You don't even know what you're
[01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:19.640]   buying or what you're clicking. All you want is a domain. I just want to register a domain.
[01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:25.560]   That's well, if it's if you need something straightforward, simple, affordable hover.com.
[01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:31.160]   In fact, go to Mac break. hover.com because you'll save on your domain registration.
[01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:38.200]   Domain transfers absolutely free. They do charge $10, but that extends the domain name for a year
[01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:44.600]   past the expiration date. So that's worth that. I mean, I do that. They also offer who is privacy
[01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:50.040]   for free. So there's no upsell there that just comes with the deal. Macbreak. hover.com.
[01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:54.040]   Great customer support to and service. They have a no hold policy for customer service calls
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:58.280]   during business hours when you call. Not only do you get a live person, they won't put you on hold.
[01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:03.160]   They will solve your problem if you have one domain registration and service very easy.
[01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:13.000]   Just a few clicks and you're done. Macbreak.h o v e r dot com.
[01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:19.080]   I think we've moved everything. I think I just wanted two sites that I'm still having trouble
[01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:23.240]   prying away from the last registrar that will be moved over there in the next couple of days.
[01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:28.040]   If you mention Macbreak, by the way, you'll get 10% off. So there's an additional deal.
[01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:34.920]   Macbreak. hover.com. Thank you, Mac. Hover.com for supporting Macbreak weekly.
[01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:42.840]   Now time for our picks of the week. Let's start with Mr. Don McAllister from ScreenCastsOnline.
[01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:47.320]   OK. Oh, my frozen again. Oh, yeah.
[01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:52.920]   You just do that all the show looking like like it's like part of a divo album cover.
[01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:57.960]   Oh, we're not men. We are Donnie. Oh, we're not men.
[01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:05.320]   Don's restarting. Oh, and one. Actually, while I'm waiting to reappear, and by the way,
[01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:09.240]   and thanks to all the Macbreak weekly with listeners who joined up to ScreenCastsOnline last time,
[01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:13.320]   I did a special coupon code. So I'll do that again this time round as well.

[01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:37.560]   In fact, I've got a couple of iOS things on this week show as well.
[01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:41.560]   So yeah, I've got the iPad, got the iPhone all working, it's back in with the
[01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:45.160]   with ScreenCaptures. So that's good. Fantastic. ScreenCastsOnline.com
[01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:50.600]   match the Macbreak and you get 50% off. That's worth absolutely worth it. A good holiday gift to you.
[01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:57.720]   Thank you. Right. My pick. It's a very simple iPhone pick, this one. And it's
[01:21:57.720 --> 01:22:06.040]   thing called onQ, it's onQ ONCUE at 1.2. And what it does, it's very clever. It's very simple,
[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:10.040]   but it's very clever because I don't know, I mean, I listen to a lot of songs in
[01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:13.880]   Shuffle Mode. And what happens when you listen to a song in Shuffle Mode is
[01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:16.840]   listen to song, it's great. The next song comes along and you're not really that,
[01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:20.200]   you know, it's not a particularly good song that you want. So you go to the next song.
[01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:23.400]   And that's not a good song. So you go to the next song. So instead of listening to a stream of
[01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:26.520]   music, you sort of fast forwarding songs all the way through and listening to a little bit,
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:31.720]   and it gets a bit of a pain. This application, what it does is it takes your iTunes library on
[01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:36.600]   your iPod library and your iPhone. And basically, while a song is playing, it shows you the next one.
[01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:38.280]   It's actually not that. That's not that. Okay.
[01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:39.640]   No, it's the one. Yeah.
[01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:41.720]   OnQ player. There it is. Yeah.
[01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:44.200]   And that's not the one either. Okay.
[01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:49.160]   OnQ 1.2, I think it's a few sets for onQ 1.2.
[01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:51.400]   All right. So ONCUE.
[01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:54.600]   ONCUE 1.2, yeah.
[01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:58.760]   Well, so this is going to, I'm glad I did that because this is going to happen to everybody who's
[01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:01.800]   looking. Yeah. By the way, the worst search in the world.
[01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:04.360]   It's not very good, is it? It never finds nothing.
[01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:10.120]   I'll dig out a link. But what happens though, why are you playing your song? You actually get
[01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:14.440]   another image at the bottom of your screen that shows you the next song in the queue.
[01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:17.960]   And then what you can do then is you can actually, while the song that you like is playing,
[01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:21.560]   you can skip through all the next songs to find out the next one that you like and put that in the
[01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:27.160]   queue. So you don't have to stop and listen to the songs. You can actually see the next songs in your
[01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:31.400]   shuffle queue and then do them that way. Another thing I like to do is if I'm listening to a
[01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:35.640]   shuffle and then a song comes on, I like and say, "Oh, I recognize that song and I want to listen
[01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:39.560]   more songs of that artist or I want to listen to that album." Currently, you have to stop the song
[01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:43.720]   and come out and go back. You just tap the song and it comes up with either the artist or the album.
[01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:47.560]   You can go straight to the artist or album while you're listening to the song and then you can just
[01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:51.320]   pick from those albums and then go back to your random shuffle queue. So it's a really, really neat
[01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:55.640]   way to manage your playlists. You can put custom playlists in there as well. But it's the shuffle
[01:23:55.640 --> 01:24:00.360]   I like to listen to things on shuffle but I like to selectively shuffle and they'll just do that.
[01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:05.000]   That's the one. Finally, thanks to Mark Bose who found me the link. I don't know how Mark found it.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:10.120]   I couldn't find it. Ankyu, one, two by poor Hadhi, P-O-U-R-H-A-D-I.
[01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:14.680]   Yeah, great, great application. In fact, yeah, I know Dan as well. I met him at
[01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:19.160]   Macworld a couple of years ago and I think it's his first iPhone app as well. It's very, very well done.
[01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:20.680]   Cool.
[01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:27.960]   Mr. Andy, you're not co, you're pick of the week. My pick is a six-pack of software. Yes, it's another
[01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:32.680]   one of those software bundles that you hear so much about on stage screen at late night television.
[01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:37.720]   This is just all software from indie developers. It's called the Indie Mac gift pack. I just got
[01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:42.840]   an email about it from a close personal friend in Daniel childhood today. You can, if you hit
[01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:52.120]   indie Mac gift pack, I-N-D-I-E Mac gift pack, P-A-C-K. It's six apps, grand total value if you're to buy
[01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:58.600]   these separately, $272 and all six of them are available for $60. Usually when I look at a package
[01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:03.480]   like this, I'm looking for are there at least $100 for the software that I love? And yep,
[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:07.960]   definitely, absolutely. The highlights of this pack for me, you get, I'm sorry, you get
[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:13.720]   delicious library too, which is a current version, which is a library like your analog
[01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:20.520]   media library organizer Acorn 2, which is a really good replacement for Photoshop. If you can't afford
[01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:26.040]   Photoshop or you want something simpler, Mars at a three, which is what 95% of the world uses
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:33.960]   to blog with radio shift from Rogamiba, Sous Chef, which is a recipe organized for
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:38.760]   cooking app and Sound Studio 4. For me, four of them are highlights Acorn 2 because-
[01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:42.600]   - Love it. - if you can't, somehow can't afford 500 bucks for Photoshop.
[01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:47.320]   This will give you the 80% of the features that most people actually use, including layers,
[01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:51.640]   including all kinds of really cool stuff. Mars at a three, if you are the sort of person who
[01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:57.240]   blogs on a regular basis, it's not just a casual thing. Like if you're a working blogger,
[01:25:57.240 --> 01:25:59.800]   it's the best offline blog you use. - That's what I use. I love it.
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:05.400]   - I mean, that's Daniel's app and it's a great app. - That's Daniel's app. That's $40 value.
[01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:11.400]   If that's come down to 10 bucks. Radio Shift, you will start listening to a lot more online
[01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:15.960]   streaming radio and download a lot more online streaming radio once you get radio shift going
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:20.440]   because it is like Tivo for streaming radio. There are all kinds of shows in the BBC.
[01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:25.560]   Every time you hear me recommend a show, like a radio drama that's available in the BBC,
[01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:30.360]   I'm not there at 2 a.m. remembering to tune into the BBC website and listen to it.
[01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:35.160]   I've looked for it on Radio Shift. Radio Shift says, "Oh yes, it charts the new
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:38.680]   dramisation of Dirk Gently. So this is the 10th of agency. Yep, but I can record that
[01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:42.360]   free automatically and save it to MP3 files and make sure it's in your iTunes library next year.
[01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:48.440]   Oh sure, I can do that. That's what I'm made for. And Sound Studio 2, which is Sound Studio 4,
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:55.000]   which is a lot like Acorn in that you might ask the question, well, why do I need an app for
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:02.840]   recording and editing audio? I've got GarageBand. Yeah, but GarageBand is like a huge £14,000
[01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:07.960]   gorilla and throws its weight around and fills up your garage and makes stinky things in your backyard.
[01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:13.240]   Sometimes you just want to record 10 minutes, edit it down to four minutes and combine things
[01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:17.960]   with multiple tracks. It's a lot easier. It's a lot faster and requires a lot fewer resources.
[01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:23.160]   So all in all, I think we've got multiple former picks of the week here. For 60 bucks,
[01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:28.520]   if you were just interested in Mars edit, yeah, maybe you shouldn't be spending extra 20 bucks
[01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:32.840]   for apps you don't need. But there will be at least three, I think, that everybody can use.
[01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:37.640]   And then when you get the extra, so you'll already be saving money on the apps you actually wanted.
[01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:40.920]   And then you'll actually find yourself, as I did when I buy previous
[01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:48.760]   app packs, you find yourself saying, "Oh, damn it. I really need to find a recipe to do this,
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:53.400]   that, the other." "Oh, well, don't I already have an app called SUSF?" Okay, we'll see how that works.
[01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:58.120]   And then it becomes one of your favourite apps ever. So I recommend the individual components
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:02.280]   of the Inimac gift pack. I checked and these the additions that you're getting in the pack are
[01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:07.320]   the current additions. So I can recommend this. Good stuff. This is the Cremdala Crem, really,
[01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:13.800]   of independent Mac software development. I have of these programs all but a couple.
[01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:20.920]   I paid full price. I love them. And let's be honest, every time there's one of these application
[01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:28.360]   packs, there's always the three superstars and then there's the, here's an app for doing
[01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:34.040]   postcards and you can choose between four fonts and you can print it on a colour printer.
[01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:37.880]   It's like, "Oh, and you thought you were going to get 25 bucks for this. I can see why you've put
[01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:43.320]   this as part of an app bundle now." But yeah, each one of these six, these are the all stars.
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:45.960]   These are the iron chefs of independent Mac software.
[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:52.600]   And as they point out in their FAQ, the sound studio for is $80. If you just bought it for $60,
[01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:56.600]   you get the other ones, you get $20 off and the other five free.
[01:28:56.600 --> 01:28:59.080]   So eight corners for 50 bucks. There are a lot of really great values.
[01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:02.920]   It really is. It's very legal to see such high quality apps.
[01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:05.720]   Inimable. It really is. Yeah. It's really cool.
[01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:06.840]   Yeah. Top tier.
[01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:11.800]   Yeah. Thank you for that tip, Andy. I'm probably just going to buy it just because I like these guys.
[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:18.920]   Support them. I mentioned before a program called ImageWell, which is a very simple
[01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:24.360]   almost feels like a desk accessory. Remember desk accessories for the Mac?
[01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:29.560]   A very simple image editor that I use. I think anybody does blog posts and is
[01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:36.600]   spending a time doing image manipulation, like putting a drop shadow in or a frame in for a blog
[01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:44.760]   post will really like ImageWell. It is 3.0 is the current version, but it's only $20.
[01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:50.120]   But the reason I bring it up, and there's a trial version, is that ImageWell 4
[01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:55.240]   is in beta right now. And you can get that for free if you want to try ImageWell. In fact,
[01:29:55.240 --> 01:30:02.280]   they say that if you support them in the beta process, you might even win the right or earn the
[01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:07.880]   right to get a free copy when it comes out. If you have ImageWell 3, ImageWell 4 will use that
[01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:12.360]   serial number as always. ImageWell upgrades are free. But this is a great little program for
[01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:17.560]   editing images for your blog post. And now myimagewell.com is the new forum site. That's where you can
[01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:23.000]   get the beta. You'd have to sign up to get the beta, but highly recommended. Well worth it.
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:27.880]   They've really done a great job. It's a very useful program. It does require snow leopard,
[01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:33.080]   because they use a lot of snow leopard features in ImageWell. That's my pick of the week.
[01:30:33.080 --> 01:30:37.320]   Tom McAllister is at Screencast's online. Don, we thank you so much for being here this week.
[01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:41.160]   Well, thanks for having me. Thanks for posting it with my occasional freezing on the video stream.
[01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:44.520]   But we got the end. You always sound good. And that's all I really care about.
[01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:49.320]   That's great. It's great. We'll look forward to seeing you in January at Macworld.
[01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:51.000]   Yeah, a couple of weeks. I'll be looking forward to it.
[01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:55.960]   Yeah, that's not far off. I think of those as your version of those slides.
[01:30:55.960 --> 01:31:00.360]   That's amazing. Andy Naco, thank you for joining us. Andy's at the Chicago Sun
[01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:04.520]   Times and also the celestial waste. Well, that's not you. That's my farm, although
[01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:09.640]   it's doing quite well. There's Andy right there. And I pushed the wrong way.
[01:31:09.640 --> 01:31:12.200]   We always respect the fact that you're a man of the land.
[01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:15.720]   Yes. I keep my hands deep within the soil.
[01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:18.120]   You don't have those soft, you know, wussy,
[01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:23.240]   Oh, no. You're the rough finger test that someone who's been spending a lot of time doing this.
[01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:32.200]   I've been pointing and clicking since 1985. Oh, my, it looks like it's timed harvest the grapes.
[01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:34.840]   And how'd that fake food get put on your virtual table?
[01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:41.720]   Never ask that. If you, if you want virtual wine, you got to pick the grapes in time.
[01:31:41.720 --> 01:31:45.400]   Andy, thank you for being here. We appreciate it.
[01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:50.280]   Thank you all for watching. Don't forget, we now, let's see, we got a couple of things to
[01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:54.840]   mention. We've got a holiday show coming up the week after Christmas. We're going to take a little
[01:31:54.840 --> 01:32:03.080]   time off. And I think we're still asking you to submit your suggestions to twit.tv/bestof.
[01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:07.480]   If there's a memory from the year 2010 that you'd like to hear again,
[01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:15.000]   best of twit.tv/bestof. Do stay tuned this afternoon. For those of you who are Paul and Storm fans
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:23.160]   or Jonathan Colton fans or John Hodgman, I'm a Mac. He's a PC though. Even though he's a PC,
[01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:29.640]   he uses a Mac. We love John. We'll join us this afternoon, 330 Pacific, 630 Eastern time at live.twitt.tv
[01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:35.800]   to record our holiday show, which will be released in time for the holidays, which means in the next
[01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:42.440]   week or so. So that's right after TNT this afternoon at live.twitt.tv. Thank you for being here. Now,
[01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:51.960]   get back to work! Great time, profer.
