[00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.460]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly to show the covers all things
[00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.460]   Macintosh.
[00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.900]   And today there's lots to talk about with us.
[00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.400]   Andy Inaco from the Chicago Sun Times
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.340]   and the Celestial Waste of Bandwidth.
[00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.840]   And Mr. Scott Born, he of the photo fame and scottborn.com.
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.140]   Hello, boys.
[00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.380]   Hey.
[00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.380]   We're mad at Andy.
[00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.080]   We're not talking to you.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.280]   Actually, we have to talk to you.
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.180]   Sneaky, sneaky, sneaky.
[00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.820]   Have my beverage.
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.020]   We have to talk to you because Alex isn't here.
[00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.260]   He's traveling.
[00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.860]   But we found out--
[00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.160]   somebody sent me a note last Friday saying,
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.900]   see what Andy did?
[00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.500]   See what Andy did?
[00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.060]   And I went to the Flickr page.
[00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.400]   And there's a picture of my studio
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.140]   taken with an iPhone 3GS.
[00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.540]   I said, how did Andy do that?
[00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.940]   He had one a week ago, but didn't tell us.
[00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.340]   You're a cagey son of a gun.
[00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.480]   Mostly I fear Apple and their minions
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.040]   and their lawyers and their lawyers' minions.
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.480]   And they all have gold robots.
[00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.980]   And they're all faster than I am.
[00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.780]   With razor sharp teeth.
[00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.320]   No, I think that that's commendable.
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.820]   In fact, you must have been one of the few.
[00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.620]   You're now in that elite strata of the pogs
[00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.160]   and the mossbergs and the bags and the leavies of the world
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.760]   who get these things before the rest of his mere mortals do.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.560]   I'm a little sad.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.400]   I used to be able to get lots of pitty drinks by saying,
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.400]   well, I'm sorry.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.800]   I don't have the new iPod.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.440]   Do I look like Walt Mossberg?
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.840]   Apparently, now you do.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.540]   So you got it.
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.640]   When?
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.640]   When did you get it?
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.540]   I got it two hours after the keynote.
[00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.540]   I had my usual one-on-one briefing with Apple,
[00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.680]   which is basically 30 minutes inside a private little room
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.320]   at West Hall in Moscone, in which I get to talk to.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.320]   In this case, usually I get great jobs.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.820]   We act because we've done this before so many times.
[00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.060]   Basically, we get--
[00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.700]   the parries and the little dances
[00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.900]   is very well choreographed.
[00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.500]   So we have a good time.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.400]   And another Apple guy and a PR guy.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.700]   And I get to basically fire off any questions that I want
[00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.440]   on any topics, knowing that there are--
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.180]   of course, I open it up to Twitter like half hour before
[00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.180]   is anybody having anything they want.
[00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.080]   And I have to basically reply 14 times, no, I'm not
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.780]   going to ask Apple why are AT&T being such jerks.
[00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.880]   There's certain things that are off limits.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.120]   No, for those who have not been in one of these briefings.
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.860]   So how confrontational do you get?
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.100]   I mean, what is your attitude going in?
[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.860]   My attitude going in is that I always
[00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.300]   come in with an agenda.
[00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.540]   There are always three or four specific things
[00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.440]   that I'm determined that I'm not going to get out the lead
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.940]   without those answers.
[00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.540]   And usually, but I've been doing this long enough
[00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.440]   that I know that there are questions that they are not
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.440]   going to answer.
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.140]   If you're going to ask them, what's
[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.880]   the data speed of the tethering going to be?
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.780]   Or are you planning to do a mechanical keyboard someday?
[00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.280]   That is an absolute non-starter.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.580]   They're not going to tell you about anything
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.580]   that they're thinking of doing or they're planning to do.
[00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.380]   Even if it's something that's absolutely obvious
[00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.480]   that they're going to do in the future.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.880]   In addition to that, I have basically my little handwritten
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:01.380]   notepad.
[00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.980]   I have pages for each different topic
[00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.560]   so that sometimes I'll have 45 minutes to an hour.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.620]   Sometimes I'll have a half hour or something.
[00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.060]   Once I even had just 20 minutes, in which case,
[00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.060]   this is why I like getting the same executives
[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.360]   and the same managers for I can say,
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.500]   OK, boys, we're going into the lightning round buckle in.
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.100]   But yeah, there's--
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.200]   Because they understand your sense of humor.
[00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.000]   Yeah, they understand.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.360]   It's easy to get by.
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.960]   It's easy to get through.
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.900]   In terms of having a few questions that I definitely
[00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.200]   want to get answered, it's usually not confrontational.
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.640]   At least it's not confrontational with me.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.240]   A friend of mine was asking me about this a few days ago.
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.240]   And I likened it to one of those games--
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.880]   one of those game shows where you're
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.380]   trying to get someone to say fruit salad,
[00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.320]   but you can't use the words watermelon, blueberries,
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.920]   or picnic.
[00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.920]   So it's not so much that the guys that are in there
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.920]   have been ordered to try to tell you
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.960]   as little as possible, it's just
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.460]   that they have specific areas that they can't talk about.
[00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.960]   So if you ask questions very specifically,
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.760]   you can get the information that you want
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.500]   without getting them to do anything that they're not
[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.800]   supposed to be able to do.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.500]   But again, if you go in there and say,
[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.200]   I know you're going to try to duck and parry,
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.200]   but I have a responsibility to my users, darn it.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.240]   And this shoe is coming off.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.440]   I'm going to throw it right at the podium,
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.340]   unless you talk turkey business.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.340]   Would you get another briefing if you did that?
[00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.840]   Would they say, let's not talk to him anymore?
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.340]   Probably not.
[00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.380]   See, this is the big issue for people who are in the trade
[00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.380]   press.
[00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.480]   It's the same issue that a beltway inside Washington
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.220]   reporter has, that your sources are very important.
[00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.320]   You can't burn them, but at the same time,
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.860]   you're supposed to be somewhat adversarial.
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.360]   Not really.
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.860]   Your purpose is to get the information
[00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.700]   that you need to get in order to serve your readers as best
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.360]   you possibly can.
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.960]   And so your readers are not served by you getting cool video
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.000]   and a cool story about how I was thrown out of apple
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.160]   bite and banned from because they didn't like the way that I
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.700]   was confronting them with all the stuff that they've been doing.
[00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.200]   And the thing is, it's not as though this apple briefing is
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.500]   the alpha and the omega of the information that I'm going to get.
[00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.540]   I have lots of sources, many of whom are just--
[00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.640]   there's a term that I use sometimes saying,
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.140]   don't worry, you're on the blacklist,
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.880]   meaning that you absolutely don't exist.
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.980]   Meaning, I don't have no idea where I've got this amazing--
[00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:16.880]   I've heard of you.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:17.880]   Yeah.
[00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:23.080]   You're not even in a professional situation.
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.080]   Am I going to reveal?
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.780]   If I'm just talking to you, or if I'm
[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.820]   talking to just a random person or the random person,
[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.120]   you don't exist.
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.260]   I was not up at this coffee shop on this date,
[00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.760]   on this time having a conversation with anybody.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:41.700]   This just-- even if I saw again George Clooney and Ben Cartwright
[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.100]   making up with each other at the coffee shop, I'm not going to say,
[00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.640]   oh my god, I just saw two guys make it out with each other.
[00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.940]   Here's a picture for TWZ.com.
[00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.300]   It's going to be no officially.
[00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.780]   I was never in this coffee shop because I can't have anybody
[00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.880]   going back to work and saying, gee, that's funny.
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.880]   You just told me that you were at this coffee shop.
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.480]   And you're not going to was at that coffee shop.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.820]   He just twittered but something he saw.
[00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:01.920]   Did you see him there?
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.920]   So you do have that deep throat sources?
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.820]   There are-- again, there are sources.
[00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.820]   There are people who are nice enough to give me information.
[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.220]   And you have to evaluate why they're giving you that information.
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.660]   And the source of that information and how you're going to use it.
[00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.860]   But once again, you always have to be very--
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.660]   even when I'm talking to Apple in an official capacity,
[00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.500]   the fact that I got a briefing and doubly, the fact that I got
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.640]   hardware two weeks in advance means that somebody at Apple
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:29.200]   said, let's give Andy an advance look at this hardware.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.500]   It'll all turn out OK.
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:34.340]   And then I go-- if I'm the very next day posting stuff on YouTube,
[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:35.880]   which I don't have--
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.080]   I've told them that I wouldn't.
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.980]   But I suppose there's nothing stopping me from doing that.
[00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.380]   That person gets in a lot of trouble.
[00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:41.580]   That person looks like an idiot.
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:42.180]   Right.
[00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.480]   And you never know with this economy that that's the reason
[00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:46.540]   why that guy got fired because for a lot of reasons,
[00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:48.080]   but also because, yeah, well, you know what?
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.980]   He's the guy responsible for trusting this idiot who
[00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:51.080]   then blabbed all over the place.
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.780]   So that's something that I take very, very seriously.
[00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:53.980]   Yeah, that seems reasonable.
[00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:55.980]   It's timely because Brad Stone has an article,
[00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:59.380]   had an article this week, Sunday or Monday.
[00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:03.900]   And the New York Times, Apple's obsession with secrecy
[00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.060]   grows stronger.
[00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:06.160]   I don't know if you saw this.
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:06.960]   And we're going to--
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:07.760]   I did see that.
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.360]   That was an incredible piece.
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.860]   Yeah, Brad's a good guy.
[00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:12.900]   We've actually had him on Twitter before.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.400]   And a very knowledgeable guy.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.600]   Apple is one of the world's coolest companies, he says.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.360]   But there is one cool company trend
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:23.340]   that was rejected, chatting with the world through blogs.
[00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:25.740]   I kind of admired them for that in some ways.
[00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.440]   And dropping tidbits of information
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.280]   about its inner workings, few companies, indeed,
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.880]   are more secretive than Apple.
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.780]   Or-- and this is what Andy was talking about--
[00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.880]   as punitive to those who dare violate the company's rules
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.920]   on keeping tight control over information.
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:42.920]   Employees have been fired for leaking news to tidbits.
[00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:44.780]   Companies have been known to spread disinformation
[00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:47.180]   to its own workers.
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:51.220]   We have heard ourselves of a story just like that.
[00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:54.120]   They make everyone super, super paranoid about security.
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.720]   Now, it seemed to me that Apple was going
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:57.860]   in the other direction a little bit.
[00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:00.200]   It was a little less paranoid, a little bit more information.
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.460]   Certainly, the rumor mills have had more information of late.
[00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.140]   He says it's getting more serious.
[00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:09.600]   And I think the Steve Jobs story might be one reason for that.
[00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.600]   I think you can't confuse their reaction
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.840]   to the Steve Jobs story, which we found out
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.200]   Steve's back at work, by the way.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.840]   I don't think you can confuse their reaction to that,
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.340]   to their overall reaction.
[00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:23.980]   They have been more forthcoming on some issues.
[00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:27.280]   And I think that's probably been done partly as a change
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.480]   with Steve not there every day.
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.020]   And probably because they realize
[00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:32.680]   that they do have some duty to the shareholders.
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.980]   And when stuff starts to go south because they're not
[00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:37.120]   responding, they've got to do something.
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.620]   But when it comes to Steve, they've gone the other way
[00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.480]   and been even more tight-lipped about it.
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.480]   And I can imagine that's because Steve has requested that.
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.720]   And if it's down to your health, I think that's the way it
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.820]   should be.
[00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.620]   I don't think anybody needs to be getting day-to-day updates
[00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:52.960]   on Steve's health problems.
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.360]   I don't think it's anybody's business.
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.260]   Well, we're going to get to that story for sure in a little bit.
[00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.900]   I do want to finish the 3GS story
[00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:04.700]   and then get to the Jobs story, which is a big story.
[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.940]   And there's more Apple news, too.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.700]   I guess we all three have a 3GS.
[00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:11.600]   By the way, space or no space?
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.000]   What have you decided?
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.840]   Is it a 3G Space S or a 3GS?
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.640]   No space.
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:19.340]   3GS?
[00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:19.940]   No space.
[00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:24.520]   Apple's PR people amended the press release
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.580]   to take the space out.
[00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:30.720]   What are your copy editors doing at the Chicago Sun times?
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.820]   I guess I'll have to send them an alert because the materials
[00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.360]   that I was given had the space in it.
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.560]   And so on that basis, I said, yes,
[00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:39.120]   if there are actually little notes in all my piece,
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:42.620]   I wrote like 10,000 words just for the Sun times.
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:45.260]   And for the first three was please note space.
[00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.800]   Because sometimes Apple usually isn't that paranoid about it.
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.200]   But there are companies who will say,
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:56.000]   "Hi, you wrote photo fix plus as photo fix plus.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.940]   You really need to capitalize both the F and the I,
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:00.380]   not just the F.
[00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:01.740]   Can you tell me when you can have that fix
[00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:03.780]   in all editions of the papers and think,
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.680]   a minute away from the apocalypse maybe?
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:07.780]   I don't know."
[00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:10.380]   That's another whole thing we could talk about,
[00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:13.380]   which is typography, weird typography.
[00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.480]   And what is our obligation to follow?
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:20.020]   When CNET was all lowercase with a pipe symbol,
[00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:21.720]   a bar between the C and the N,
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:25.460]   it was like that's almost your logo.
[00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:27.360]   Are we obligated to print it that way?
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.600]   Fortunately, I'm not a print journalist.
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:29.700]   I don't have to worry about it.
[00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:31.300]   You want to make sure it's accurate
[00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:32.700]   and just on that basis you do it.
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.360]   But that's the difference between a really, really good PR
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.200]   person and one who's maybe just not quite so experienced.
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.140]   I hadn't experienced a couple months ago
[00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:41.900]   where I was on CBS.
[00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:44.200]   And I just needed a loaner of something really--
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.280]   I won't mention any names just before you embarrass
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.440]   some people, but a loaner of something really, really,
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.140]   really cool just sort of as a prop.
[00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:52.720]   But it's a big deal to say, well, your product
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.680]   and the product's logo will be on national live television.
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:57.780]   So they're usually eager to do that.
[00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:59.720]   But for three days before the appearance,
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:00.920]   I was getting like three--
[00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.580]   can you possibly read these following two paragraphs
[00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.020]   of ad copy on the air?
[00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.220]   I could if I bumped the actual thing
[00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:10.360]   I'm supposed to be talking about.
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.660]   But again, I'm really not going to do that.
[00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:14.260]   Yeah.
[00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:14.860]   Wow.
[00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:16.360]   I mean, try to get things correct at least.
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:17.060]   Yeah.
[00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.000]   Well, I don't know.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.500]   My favorite thing about the new phone is the new phone works.
[00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:23.900]   The new phone works.
[00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:24.900]   The phone works.
[00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:26.000]   The phone part.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.340]   So was your phone--
[00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:29.440]   your old 3G was not working?
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:30.840]   No, I'm just joking because, you know,
[00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:33.400]   I always say that I'm worried about them adding all this stuff
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:36.340]   and then the phone not working because they added all this stuff.
[00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:37.540]   It actually works.
[00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:38.740]   The phone works.
[00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:40.680]   And the speaker volume is louder.
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.720]   And the call clarity is better.
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.220]   And the reception is better.
[00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:46.420]   All those things have been documented.
[00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:49.020]   Well, you know, it's funny how little attention these days
[00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:50.620]   I paid the phone.
[00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:51.520]   I understand.
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.020]   But I'm an old-fashioned guy that
[00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:55.160]   likes to actually talk on the telephone.
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.860]   Is that been--
[00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:00.700]   I guess I can't report because I've maybe made one or two calls
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.000]   since Friday.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.400]   Well, I tested it right where I'm sitting.
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.200]   And right where I'm sitting for some reason,
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:10.600]   the first gen iPhone would barely work.
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.740]   It would work 10 feet from here in any direction.
[00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:14.040]   But right here, it wouldn't.
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:17.740]   When I tried my 3GS from here, it was four or five bars,
[00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:20.180]   no problem, great reception.
[00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:23.380]   I noticed immediately that the speaker was much louder.
[00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:25.180]   Clarity, the call was much better.
[00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:27.180]   And I didn't think it was bad before,
[00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:29.020]   but it's definitely improved.
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:33.220]   So on those fronts, I was very excited.
[00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:36.160]   Any features besides the call clarity that you like?
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.620]   Well, I love the camera.
[00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:39.660]   The camera's a lot better, isn't it?
[00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:40.600]   The camera's a lot better.
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.560]   It's usable.
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.700]   There's something that a lot of people don't talk about, Leo,
[00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.100]   with this new touch focus thing.
[00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:47.500]   I don't know if they're paying attention
[00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.400]   or if they understand the significance.
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.900]   But not only were you touch--
[00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:53.840]   that doesn't just control focus.
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:57.040]   It controls white balance and exposure.
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:57.980]   Yeah, I've noticed that.
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:00.140]   So I'm able to actually shoot something
[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.880]   that I couldn't shoot before because of the issue.
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.420]   It's crazy, crazy cool.
[00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:07.980]   The fact that it does both, I promise you,
[00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:13.320]   we will see that moved into standard DSLRs sometime soon.
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.360]   It's a great feature.
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:18.160]   I've been testing that as well as the video.
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.800]   And it's amazingly quality-wise.
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:24.000]   It's just amazingly good.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:24.800]   Absolutely.
[00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:27.960]   I mean, so much of my testing of the 3GS
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.940]   when I was in San Francisco was just having fun.
[00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:32.500]   I'm walking around-- I'm spending hours and hours
[00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:36.140]   walking around San Francisco with a Nikon D80 SLR
[00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:37.240]   around my neck.
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.080]   But I cannot stop playing with the camera
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:42.480]   because just the way that that feature works.
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.420]   It sort of kind of illustrates the difference
[00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:47.120]   between the way Apple does things and the way
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:49.120]   that a lot of other companies do things.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.920]   Right with iPhone 1.0, one of my big complaints
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.320]   was the camera application.
[00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:55.920]   "Oh, thank you. You gave me one button that takes the picture."
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.620]   And that's it, the phone that I replaced it with.
[00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:00.820]   So Windows Mobile Phone, they said, "Oh, you want to--
[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:02.620]   it will do exposure compensation or do
[00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:05.260]   a whole bunch of other tricks just by looking with the settings."
[00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.800]   Apple did not give us buttons for exposure compensation.
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.360]   It just simply said, "Look, what if you just tap on the part
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.300]   of the picture that you want to be properly exposed?
[00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:13.100]   We'll do the rest."
[00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:14.800]   That's such a slick and elegant way to do it.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.440]   I can't wait till the first third-party developer comes out
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:21.840]   with an iPhone-based HDR program where I can simply take three shots.
[00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:24.840]   I've been doing HDR in my desktop just by sort of holding
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:28.240]   the camera kind of steady, but say, "Okay, here's the brightest part.
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.340]   Here's the darkest part. Here's the middle part.
[00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:32.840]   Please combine these three pictures into a really, really good,
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.780]   properly balanced and exposed image."
[00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:38.320]   If you have-- there's a product called Photomatix Pro.
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.420]   It's under $100.
[00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:42.920]   If you have that product, even if you don't get it perfect
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:47.160]   when you're hand-holding it, it will match the photos up for you
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.560]   and does a pretty good job of that.
[00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:52.160]   You normally, the best HDR procedures to work from a tripod.
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.560]   There is a way to mount the iPhone to a tripod
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.760]   if you buy some of these third-party devices,
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:57.460]   but--
[00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.060]   You saw what Alex did with it.
[00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:02.500]   Alex just went into crazy lunatic land.
[00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:08.440]   That's another conversation, but he did a typical Alex thing.
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:14.180]   He put a $9 million device onto the iPhone to make it broadcast worthy.
[00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:16.780]   The first iPhone on a steady cam mount.
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:21.680]   Yeah, but you can use something like one of these Gorilla Pods
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.780]   with a ball head attached that you can attach one of these.
[00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:27.220]   They make the iPhone holders for watching movies.
[00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:30.920]   You can screw that head onto the other head and turn it into a tripod.
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:33.660]   But even if you just hold it reasonably steady
[00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.660]   and you get this product called Photomatix Pro,
[00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:37.960]   it will do HDR and tone mapping.
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.900]   In fact, that's on my agenda this weekend to test.
[00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.700]   I think you're right, Andy.
[00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:45.000]   Somebody's going to write an application.
[00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:47.560]   That seems like that would be a simple thing to do.
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:50.000]   You do it right in the camera, right in the phone.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.700]   I think processing power is going to be required.
[00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:53.700]   I think if they just start off by saying,
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.500]   we're going to down sample it to like VGA quality
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:59.900]   or two megapixel quality just so that you don't have to keep this phone
[00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:01.340]   operating for two and a half hours
[00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:02.480]   while we crunch all the numbers.
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.680]   Is it crazy, though, to think of a 3.2 megapixel camera
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:08.480]   as being capable of HDR?
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.080]   HDR isn't about the megapixels.
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.320]   It's about the exposure balance.
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:14.260]   And once again, if I'm at some place really, really cool
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:17.560]   but I want to show my friends, my folks, my family,
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.860]   look at this awesome place with Death Valley.
[00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:21.860]   I didn't think that the sky should be that blue.
[00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:26.060]   I didn't think that there'd be so many shades of orange inside that pit
[00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:27.260]   and you send them a picture that says,
[00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:31.260]   "Oh, white sky, one uniform shade of reddish gray inside the valley."
[00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:34.060]   Yeah, well, thank you for wasting my time with that downloading.
[00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:40.060]   The problem is, though, that our eyes can see between 11 and 14 stops of light
[00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:42.760]   and our cameras can see between four and five.
[00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:46.560]   No, I understand that. But a 3 megapixel camera, it seems like...
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.160]   It's got nothing to do with that.
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.360]   I understand, I understand. But the image, you're working really hard
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.560]   on a good image that isn't going to start out being that good.
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:55.660]   Or is it?
[00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:57.060]   I see your point.
[00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:00.560]   But I think the iPhone is all about doing more than what you expect
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:03.960]   to be able to any sensible person or rational person to be able to do with this thing.
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.960]   And like I said, if someone charged 5 or 10 bucks for an HDR
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:11.360]   that seemed to take the image that I didn't expect very much out of to begin with
[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:13.560]   and made it even better, then I'd probably go for it.
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:14.660]   Yeah, I guess why not.
[00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:15.260]   Anyway.
[00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:16.260]   Well, you know, and by the way...
[00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.860]   You missed notice we've been doing that already with all those weird plugins
[00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:21.560]   for the original camera, you know?
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:26.660]   The first Canon DSLR Leo was 3.3 megapixels.
[00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:29.160]   That's the other thing. Yeah. I mean, I mean...
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.460]   And that camera was $2,000.
[00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:31.760]   Right.
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:35.660]   And I've got more than 100 photos published in books and magazines
[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:36.860]   from that camera.
[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:39.860]   So the answer to a Canon 3 megapixel camera work,
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:43.960]   yes, it can. Now granted, it's going to require decent light.
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.460]   That's going to be really the key.
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:49.160]   If you're trying to work in low light situations, dusk, dawn,
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:49.760]   then you're...
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:50.960]   How good is in your camera in here?
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:51.660]   I mean, how good is it?
[00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:52.760]   It's really good.
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:53.660]   It's really good.
[00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:56.060]   It's not professional quality, obviously, but...
[00:18:56.060 --> 00:19:00.760]   Is it as good as my 3 megapixel at point and shoot from 5 years ago?
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:01.360]   No, no.
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:01.660]   Yeah.
[00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:02.660]   I depends.
[00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:03.560]   It depends on what...
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.360]   Who made your 3 megapixel point and shoot?
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:06.160]   I had an Olympus.
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.360]   I remember my Camedia 3040.
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:09.260]   I loved that camera.
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.060]   It really depends on the sensor size.
[00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:12.060]   That's the big difference.
[00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:13.560]   And this is a small sensor, I'm sure.
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:13.760]   Yeah.
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:14.960]   Most of the point and shoots are going to beat it.
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.660]   But here's where I think the answer is, yes, it's as good.
[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:21.860]   If you're shooting in bright sunlight, then I think it's as good.
[00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:22.960]   Yeah.
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:26.060]   I mean, I have the first picture that I had on my Flickr feed
[00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:28.160]   when I was free to start talking about this stuff
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.160]   was this beautiful picture at the Palace of Fine Arts.
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.060]   But I had a...
[00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:35.560]   And people are just really bowling themselves over
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.060]   about how great this picture is.
[00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:38.560]   But even in the caption, I say,
[00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:41.860]   "This is a situation in which every camera should produce
[00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:43.360]   nothing less than a stunning picture."
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:47.060]   It's a beautiful place with lots of detail shot
[00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:50.360]   just about a half hour before sunset and it's facing West.
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:52.860]   It looks great because that's the perfect situation for both.
[00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:53.760]   Yeah, it can't go wrong.
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:54.060]   Right.
[00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:54.460]   Yeah.
[00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:55.460]   Meanwhile, I have video...
[00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:58.360]   The picture of you at the Twitcottage is very, very good.
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:19:59.960]   But I was studying the camera pretty good.
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.060]   I also have video that I wanted to...
[00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:04.160]   That I shot just a pan of the interior
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.360]   that is not really...
[00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:10.160]   The video was having problems dealing with the low light
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.160]   and had to really expand the shutter speed
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.660]   in order to get any sort of a usable image.
[00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:16.260]   So you get sort of that,
[00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.360]   "I'm in the woods being chased by a serial killer
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.060]   and I'm remembering what it was like two years ago
[00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:22.360]   when I was chased in the woods with a serial killer sort of look."
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:23.160]   Yeah.
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:23.760]   So...
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:27.560]   You know, the best camera is the one that you have with...
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:28.060]   Right.
[00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.060]   Getting the shot is key.
[00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:32.360]   So how good is this camera?
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:35.360]   You were saying any good low light performance?
[00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:37.260]   Not very good low light performance.
[00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:37.860]   Not very good.
[00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:40.060]   It is still a camera phone
[00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:42.860]   and not a camera that has a phone feature attached to it.
[00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:46.060]   We did read that it could be a 720p video camera
[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:47.660]   had Apple not hobbled it.
[00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:50.060]   Well, we don't know if they just hobbled it or if they said,
[00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:51.160]   "Look, the processor...
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.860]   We're gonna be happy telling people you can shoot eight seconds
[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:55.860]   worth of HD video for the buffer fills up."
[00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:59.160]   I mean, one of the big deals about the video camera on this is that
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:02.460]   you press start and it starts recording, you press stop
[00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:04.560]   and it stops recording, but then you press start again,
[00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:06.560]   a half a second later and it starts recording again.
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:07.460]   It's very fast.
[00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:09.860]   It doesn't lock up your phone for a minute while buffer...
[00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:10.460]   No.
[00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:11.560]   It's not the buffer processes.
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.260]   And you know, 640x40...
[00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:13.960]   That's not bad.
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:14.860]   I'm pretty happy with it.
[00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:16.260]   I've been shooting a lot of video at the beach.
[00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:16.860]   It's been great.
[00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:18.260]   You forget that we forget that it's a phone.
[00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:21.460]   I keep coming back to my Sonic Screwdriver explanation
[00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:22.960]   where the role of my...
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:25.860]   Just like a Spock's Tricorder and the Sonic Screwdriver
[00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:26.660]   and Doctor Who,
[00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:30.960]   where it shows up in every episode and it's one purpose seems to be
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:33.560]   to do whatever it needs to do to advance the scene.
[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:36.560]   You know, no matter what situation Spock is in,
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:38.960]   oh, we'll just wave the Tricorder at it and it'll figure out
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:39.960]   what the...
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:40.960]   It's magic.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.560]   Right.
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.760]   And that's the feature that I want in the iPhone.
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:44.360]   I can't...
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.460]   Sometimes I'm not carrying around a real camera with me,
[00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:50.160]   but now I have a camera and a video recorder that are good enough
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:53.160]   that I'm glad that I at least had my iPhone with me.
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:53.660]   Yeah.
[00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:55.860]   I've been taking a lot of pictures with it.
[00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:58.360]   I have to say it's been very tempting and easy to say.
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:02.160]   I think once we get the developers involved and we start getting a few new tools
[00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:05.960]   to play with it a little bit more, like to change the exposure manually
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:10.260]   or to zoom in a little bit or some of the other things
[00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:12.160]   that are no doubt going to come to this phone,
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:15.160]   that'll improve its utility overall as a camera.
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.760]   I mean, I agree with Andy.
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:19.360]   It's important to remember it's a telephone that has a camera.
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:21.560]   It's not a camera that has a telephone,
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:26.760]   but I can promise you that it will take pictures that are good enough
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:28.360]   for a lot of situations.
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:32.060]   It's not going to be broadcast quality and it's not going to be publication
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.560]   quality, but it's certainly web quality.
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.060]   You're going to see a lot of social media created with this phone.
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:37.560]   I have a feeling.
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:38.060]   Yeah.
[00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:38.560]   Yeah.
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:42.360]   What else do we like or dislike about the phone?
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:45.360]   Andy, were there any negatives?
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:47.960]   negatives.
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:50.960]   Well, I think that the cut and paste could have been a little bit better
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:53.860]   because there are times when it sort of gets in my way.
[00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:56.560]   There are times when I just want to change move the insertion point
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:57.460]   from one place to one place.
[00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:58.660]   It pops up each time, doesn't it?
[00:22:58.660 --> 00:22:59.260]   Exactly.
[00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:00.760]   I get the tool palette.
[00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:06.260]   There are a couple instances in which it was definitely the feature
[00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:10.960]   was definitely exhibiting non apple like behavior where I'm setting
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:14.760]   an email to my editor to basically test out this test out
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:17.360]   these some of these these cut and paste and these media features
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.060]   and hey, cool.
[00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:20.560]   Yes, just like in the demo, you can cut and paste photos directly
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:21.360]   from the photo feed.
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.560]   Oh, yes, multiple photos.
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:23.160]   Oh, great.
[00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.760]   I wonder if I can also cut and paste videos.
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:25.560]   Hey, what do you know?
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:26.460]   I can copy.
[00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:30.760]   I can copy of a video to and what but probably let me paste.
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:33.160]   Yes, look, I hear there's the paste button that I tap the paste
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.860]   button and nothing happens.
[00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:35.260]   Right.
[00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:39.460]   So I was expecting something like something like the tool palette
[00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.960]   not coming up or being grayed out or something like that.
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:46.660]   Otherwise, there's very few about it that I'm really negative
[00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:48.960]   about in broad strokes.
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.160]   It's exactly what I wanted to be.
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.760]   There are definitely little areas in which they could be improving
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:53.160]   things.
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:57.560]   I'm very very, very surprised that for instance, spotlight search.
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:00.560]   You can't write a plug in as a developer to make your own
[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:05.560]   data visible to spotlight, which I think is kind of a big mistake.
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:09.160]   I mean, I think I know why they didn't allow that because the
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.660]   question then becomes, okay, great.
[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:16.360]   So a task from your task manager application shows up in the spotlight
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:19.360]   search and then right in the spotlight search, you tap to open it.
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:20.460]   What happens then?
[00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:21.660]   Does that open the application?
[00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:24.360]   Does that open the document that has that data or does that focus
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:25.360]   right on the data?
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:28.860]   And if so, how do we make that happen within a spotlight framework?
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.060]   But still that was kind of a surprising omission for me.
[00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:32.660]   I do like the spotlight search.
[00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:35.560]   The ability to search the phone phone wide is great.
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:37.260]   It's not my application launcher.
[00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:41.660]   I mean, now that we have 10 pages of application icons, I mean,
[00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:43.960]   it's a long way to go when you go all the way to the end, isn't it?
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.460]   It's a long, for call.
[00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:49.060]   So you just type the, you type, you scroll it left instead of right
[00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:51.160]   and you type the first few letters of what you're looking for.
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:51.960]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.660]   I should say voice commands.
[00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:55.460]   I had the biggest trouble.
[00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.160]   They don't seem to work all that well, do they?
[00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:58.760]   Well, it works OK.
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:24:59.760]   There are two problems with it.
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:04.160]   Number one, it worked the way that you interact with it is so natural
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:08.260]   that you forget that it's waiting for a specific command that's worded
[00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:11.060]   exactly the way it expects to be worded.
[00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:14.560]   I was always saying play songs by Curtis Mayfield.
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:19.260]   Instead of play artists, instead of the lingo that you're supposed to use with it.
[00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:23.860]   Even so that said, it was difficult to use it inside my car
[00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:27.060]   because for some silly, I think a silly reason,
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:31.660]   with my car kit, which is, I bought about five or six months ago for the 3G,
[00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:37.660]   it listens through the microphone built in for input of voice commands.
[00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:40.260]   It speaks through the built-in speaker for confirmation,
[00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:43.060]   which means that there's absolutely no way I can possibly hear it inside the cab.
[00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:46.260]   It doesn't put it, it doesn't pipe it through the car stereo instead.
[00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:49.760]   It doesn't do anything really cool like if I have a Bluetooth headset
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:52.960]   or a Bluetooth hands-free kit, use that for speaking commands
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:55.860]   and receiving voice feedback.
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.660]   I just wish that it worked better.
[00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:00.360]   I've sort of adapted so that I know how to make it work.
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:06.560]   As a matter of fact, on the 3GS, I've actually created a playlist called
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:09.860]   "Ping Bop Bop" because it's a nonsense word,
[00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:11.360]   but it's absolutely like nothing else.
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:13.460]   You can't accidentally say it.
[00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:14.160]   Exactly.
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.160]   It was funny.
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:18.860]   I have a video that I haven't posted yet of me just choosing Curtis Mayfield
[00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:19.960]   no matter what I say.
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.460]   Play Pete Seager.
[00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:23.560]   Play Curtis Mayfield.
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:24.860]   Play the Beatles.
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.260]   Play Curtis Mayfield.
[00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:27.860]   Move on up as a hell of a song.
[00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:29.160]   70 Soul Funk.
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:31.860]   You can't do better than that, but it's not exactly Pete Seager, is it?
[00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:35.160]   Well, you know what's interesting because you expect it to be as good as the Google app
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.660]   because it's very much like the Google app.
[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:40.260]   But Google has all of this valuable information.
[00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:43.860]   It's been collecting over the years through the use of Google 411
[00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:45.060]   that Apple doesn't have.
[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:48.060]   And I have a feeling that that's the secret sauce.
[00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:50.960]   It makes the voice recognition work just a little bit better.
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:53.460]   I like the "Find My Phone" feature.
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:58.460]   Yeah, did you read the article about the guy who used it to try in Chicago?
[00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:03.960]   Seemingly risky maneuver, by the way, to track the phone down to kind of a sketchy neighborhood
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:09.460]   and literally zero in on the guy who had his phone and confront him and get it back.
[00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:14.060]   I'm just lucky because I can find it in my pants in the dirty clothes hamper now.
[00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:16.660]   Where's that sound coming from?
[00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:18.060]   You do have to enable mobile me.
[00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:19.360]   You have to have mobile me to do.
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:23.360]   Yeah, I did that the first day and I got mobile me and I checked it out and it was like
[00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:25.360]   you know, showed me on the GPS where it was.
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:26.560]   I said, "Okay, it's in the house.
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:27.360]   That's good."
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:28.560]   Now, where is it?
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.260]   The sound's coming from the hamper.
[00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:31.860]   Okay, it works.
[00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:38.260]   I got an interesting email though from a reader who said that he turned on the phone
[00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:43.760]   "Find My iPhone" feature and the first result that gave back was where the phone was
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:47.360]   a couple hours earlier before he turned the phone back on again.
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:50.260]   And so that got getting him really concerned about, wait a minute, is this feature just
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:52.860]   simply always on and always available to Apple?
[00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:56.360]   It's just that turning it on only makes it visible to me, the user or is there something
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:57.060]   else going on?
[00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:59.360]   And I replied back to him that, "Well, it's possible.
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:01.660]   We don't know the mechanism that it's using to find the phone.
[00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:06.160]   Maybe the first thing that mobile me does is ask the network, where was the last place
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.660]   you saw this phone before it fell off?"
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:11.860]   And of course, it's remembering the network is remembering information like that.
[00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:16.060]   But I guess it could be used to track you by some...
[00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:19.560]   Yeah, also phones can be used to track you.
[00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:20.160]   Sure.
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.760]   Yeah, I mean, that's one of the reasons.
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:25.560]   There's some reasons why I think that the complaint about a non-removable battery
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:27.960]   on the iPhone are absolutely genuine complaints.
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:31.860]   One of them is that the only way to make sure that nobody can track your phone,
[00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:33.760]   you buy your phone is to pop out the battery.
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:36.160]   Even if you have it turned off, it's not off off.
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:38.460]   It's just an extreme low power mode.
[00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:40.060]   So that's...
[00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:42.260]   What would happen if you took the sim chip out, Andy?
[00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:45.360]   Would that make it impossible to track you if you took the sim chip out?
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:47.860]   Good question.
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.660]   Because there are two sets of IDs and the phone.
[00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:53.760]   One is the phone as a network address and one of them is simply the sim car,
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:57.360]   which associates it with a specific user.
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:00.360]   So it could still tell that network device number,
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:02.860]   "X, X, X, X, X, X, X was spotted in this thing."
[00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:06.860]   Then you'd have to link that up with a subscriber who that phone was sold to.
[00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:10.460]   But I don't think that would hide you from the black helicopters.
[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:14.860]   Well, that's why I wear tin foil in my headphones.
[00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:15.960]   [laughter]
[00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:20.560]   That's why I have an iPod sleeve that's actually made with mesh copper.
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:21.960]   It's actually a Farrity cage.
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:25.560]   Usually I use it to make sure that my editors can't phone me when I don't want to be bothered.
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:31.060]   Well, I have to say, my general feeling about the phone is...
[00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:33.960]   Yes, it's a nice evolutionary upgrade,
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.960]   but I think that a lot of people sitting there,
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:38.960]   especially if you're sitting there with a 3G,
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:41.960]   probably the 3.0 upgrade is pretty good.
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:44.760]   Unless you have a compelling need for video or the better camera
[00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:46.960]   or voice commands or a compass.
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:49.360]   Now, wait a minute, I like the compass.
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:51.360]   I go get lost sometimes just so I can use it.
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:58.360]   To me, it feels like this is not the kind of upgrade that's worth waiting in line for.
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:01.160]   Now, obviously, I'm wrong on that because Apple says,
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:03.160]   "One million!"
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:07.160]   They sold very, very well over the weekend, a million handsets.
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:10.960]   Does that not make it the best-selling iPhone yet?
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:15.060]   By the way, the predicted number was 500,000.
[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:16.460]   So they did very well.
[00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:17.960]   By the way, the supply was good.
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.060]   I was able to walk into an 18-store pick one.
[00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:21.260]   I'm just curious.
[00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:22.460]   I'm just curious.
[00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:26.660]   Can we get the number of sales for the Palm pre during the same period?
[00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:27.760]   Yeah, I think we got them.
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:29.460]   I can't remember, but it was considerably less.
[00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:31.460]   I'm going to guess it weren't a million.
[00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:32.060]   Yeah.
[00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:35.260]   Although I think the pre is still a strong competitor,
[00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:37.860]   especially if you're on sprint, you want to stay with sprint.
[00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:41.460]   I'm so glad the pre is out there because that helps.
[00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:44.560]   It helps force Apple to say, "Hey, we got to keep innovating."
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:49.360]   But for anybody to look at me with any kind of straight face
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.460]   and say, "The pre is an iPhone killer.
[00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:52.960]   I'm sorry, no credibility."
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.760]   Yeah, I don't like the killer word anyway.
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.760]   I don't think anything is a killer of anybody.
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:59.660]   Unless it's iTunes, that is a killer.
[00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:01.460]   It's a killer for the music industry.
[00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:02.960]   iTunes kills everything.
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.560]   Everything it touches.
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:05.860]   Everything it touches.
[00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:09.660]   Am I going overboard when I say that?
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:12.660]   I just don't think it's such a sterling upgrade that everybody...
[00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:17.660]   I think a lot of people will be very happy just putting the free 3.0 upgrade on to their...
[00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:20.860]   Well, yes, Richard, you're buying the $99 3G.
[00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:21.660]   Think about that.
[00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:27.260]   Now, that 3.0 software on a $99 3G is probably the best smartphone on the market.
[00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:27.860]   Yeah.
[00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:29.160]   That's definitely true.
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:33.060]   I mean, there's going to be a piece running in the Sun Time soon
[00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:38.460]   about basically talking about the pre a couple weeks later and the iPhone a couple weeks later.
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:48.660]   And I still think that the 3.0 operating system and the $99 iPhone really upsets the balance of power among smartphones.
[00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:53.260]   Really now, if anybody who wants to make a smartphone buying decision,
[00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:57.360]   I tell them point blank, the first thing you do is decide that you're going to get an iPhone.
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:59.860]   Go to the Apple store, play with the iPhone for a long time,
[00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:02.360]   and then try to come up with a reason why you do not want an iPhone.
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:04.260]   And there are reasons why you would not want one.
[00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:05.760]   But the first step is...
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.160]   AT&T being the chief reason, by the way.
[00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:14.260]   No, no, lack of a keyboard would be one, lack of a really, really enterprise level male client is another.
[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:17.260]   Lack of support for really good multitasking is the third.
[00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:21.460]   Lack of freedom of choice and freedom of control for the user would be a fourth.
[00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:24.960]   Again, I don't think that the iPhone is necessarily the Jesus phone.
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:28.860]   But if there's something about the iPhone you do not like that makes it into,
[00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:30.960]   wow, this is just totally inconvenient to use.
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:34.160]   That will define what your choice should be after that.
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:39.860]   I mean, the $9 and $9 is actually probably as significant as the 3.0 upgrade.
[00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:42.160]   I mean, there are a lot of people who cannot spend 200 bucks on a phone,
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:46.260]   but now that's as cheap as a phone will get without being free with a contract.
[00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:48.760]   Yeah, no, I think you're absolutely right.
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:52.560]   And I think that I want to reassure people who say,
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:53.760]   "Oh gosh, I'm not getting the latest."
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:57.760]   In fact, you're getting 90% I think of the value of the 3GS.
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:01.260]   But when the 3G came out, I knew that I would be buying it regardless because...
[00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:03.260]   Well, we have to. I mean, we're a little bit different.
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:05.860]   Well, I mean, sometimes I have my consumer hat on,
[00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:07.560]   sometimes I have my journalist hat on.
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:11.460]   I mean, Apple is loaning me a phone that I will have for a while,
[00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:15.360]   but at some point, especially because this is a personal item that I run my business on,
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:18.860]   I will have to ethically just simply purchase one, which is what I did for the 3G.
[00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:21.960]   I mean, I had it for a month or two, and then I had to go walk in and buy my own.
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:25.060]   But I knew that I would be buying the 3G because I was a slam dunk.
[00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:30.660]   The ability to get 3G data speeds and GPS and GPS was a really, really big deal for me.
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:32.560]   It meant that it was definitely worth the upgrade.
[00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:36.560]   The 3GS is a pretty subtle difference between...
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:39.160]   in hardware between this one and the old one.
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:44.360]   For me, it would make sense simply because of the new camera, the new video features,
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:49.460]   and the extra 16 gigs of storage, which is going to become a much, much bigger deal now that...
[00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:50.560]   With video, yeah.
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:56.560]   With not only... Well, even if I were dealing with a 3G with 32 gigs, that would be a big upgrade.
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:59.360]   Simply beverage for the fact that I can get turned by turn directions
[00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:02.660]   if I download a third-party map database.
[00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:03.860]   That's a good point, yeah.
[00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:08.360]   And now that they're going to be having software that can actually enhance and expand itself,
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:11.160]   like Bookshelf software, where you buy one copy of the book,
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:14.260]   but then you can also through the same program.
[00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:17.260]   It makes it very, very easy to buy more books and more books and more books.
[00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:19.260]   I mean, if Audible came up with an app like that,
[00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:21.360]   that simply said, this is an Audible Bookshelf program.
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:22.760]   Oh, I wish they would.
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:23.860]   Oh, that would be fantastic.
[00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:26.060]   That would be... Oh, wow.
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:30.160]   Well, the one that eats for 99 bucks doesn't seem like such a bargain anymore.
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:31.060]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:31.660]   That's a good point.
[00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:35.560]   One thing that I would say, Leo, though, is that it depends on your need for speed
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:37.360]   because the phone is much faster.
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:39.460]   It's not hype. It really is faster.
[00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:44.160]   And as I said, if you're interested in the good old-fashioned telephone portion,
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:45.260]   it works better.
[00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:48.360]   I mean, there's call clarity is better, the volume is better,
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:51.060]   you know, the connectivity is better.
[00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:53.860]   So those aren't insignificant things.
[00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:57.960]   I'm with you, although I don't think the speed of 3G was so poor.
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:59.460]   No, I don't either.
[00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:01.260]   It is faster. It's definitely faster.
[00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:03.360]   But it's not like, wow, this is so fast.
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:05.460]   I can't use the 3G anymore.
[00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:06.460]   No, no, no, no.
[00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:07.560]   I agree with that totally.
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:10.160]   But if you're just... I said, it just depends on your need for speed.
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:12.760]   If you're like us and you have a need for speed,
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:14.560]   it's going to be worth the upgrade.
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:17.560]   But I do believe we've talked about it before.
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:22.060]   We haven't heard near enough about the $99 phone and the 3.0 software.
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:25.360]   Anybody that's been on the fence, if that's not enough to push them,
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:28.560]   they might as well go ahead and stand up with the other 11 people in the preline.
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:31.560]   Hey, let's talk about the upgrade of the iPod touch,
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:35.260]   because you could put 3.0 in the touch as well, although it costs you 10 bucks.
[00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:36.960]   Now, why did it go up to 10?
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:39.960]   Usually it's like an incremental of two or three dollars, isn't it?
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:41.660]   That seemed like a much bigger...
[00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:45.760]   And Apple in the past has explained that by saying, well, the accounting system,
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:48.360]   yeah, that we use requires us to charge you.
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:50.560]   So why 10?
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:51.360]   Why 10?
[00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:52.360]   They could charge a dollar.
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:54.860]   I mean, they could charge any amount to at least handle that.
[00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:55.860]   Any for that.
[00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:56.360]   Yeah.
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:59.360]   I guess they're figuring they're accounting costs.
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:04.360]   So I can see basing it on the accounting cost and in the one, two and three dollar range,
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:05.360]   that makes sense.
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:08.360]   At 10 bucks, I guess they've decided to make it a profit item.
[00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:11.560]   It is a worthwhile upgrade, do you think?
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:13.460]   Just to the iPod touch?
[00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:15.260]   I would say so.
[00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:15.960]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.160]   We take any 10 bucks.
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:18.060]   That's damn cheap.
[00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:18.760]   It's not that much.
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:20.360]   I mean, let's be honest.
[00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:21.460]   It's still...
[00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:24.360]   I mean, certainly, yeah, it's not going to stop anybody from upgrading.
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:26.360]   Oh, I can't come up with 10 bucks, man.
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:30.160]   All right, we're going to talk...
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:32.360]   If you have anything else to say about 3G, we can...
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:34.160]   GS, we can talk more about that in just a second.
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:38.160]   But since you mentioned Audible, I think it's been a good time to remind people that,
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:45.660]   in fact, one of the features of the 3GS is an improved iPod interface that lets you skip back 30 seconds,
[00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:47.360]   which is great for audio books.
[00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:50.860]   It now has a very nice scrubbing feature that when you slide your finger down,
[00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:55.660]   you can fast forward or go back in very fine mode.
[00:36:55.660 --> 00:37:00.760]   It has the 1/2 speed, the 1x, and the 2x right on the front there.
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:04.160]   So if you're listening to an audio book and you say, "I can understand this at a faster speed.
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:07.160]   I'd like to improve my comprehension," or, "I'd like to slow it down,"
[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:08.560]   so I get it more clearly.
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:09.760]   You have that capability.
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:13.960]   It just made it an even better phone, frankly, for audio books, I think.
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:17.060]   In fact, this might be the definitive audio book player at this point.
[00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:20.960]   Yeah, it has also features that I absolutely love where the third new button in the player,
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:25.160]   if you're dealing with spoken text, is that a link button that will simply let you eat.
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:27.660]   If you're listening to a podcast, for instance, that you really love,
[00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:31.460]   you can simply email a link to the podcast to whoever you want just by tapping this button.
[00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:32.460]   It'll have a link to the iPhone.
[00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:33.460]   I didn't notice that.
[00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:34.360]   That's cool.
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:40.260]   It's the button on the far left, the same level as the playback speed and the repeat the last 30 seconds button.
[00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:42.160]   Wow, I didn't notice that.
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:44.760]   It only comes up with audio books.
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:46.760]   It comes up in podcasts.
[00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:50.460]   Unfortunately, it doesn't come up in actual music tracks because you would think...
[00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:53.960]   I'm trying to remember.
[00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:57.860]   I'm enforce feeding my brain with so much information about the 3G of the past two weeks.
[00:37:57.860 --> 00:38:03.760]   I remember being a little disappointed that not all three of these new features were available in music playback
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:06.260]   because, of course, you're going to want to recommend a song to someone.
[00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:07.360]   That's better than squirting.
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:10.960]   You can link audible.com/makbreak.
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:13.960]   I want to encourage you to go there and take a look at what Audible has to offer.
[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:19.260]   If you've got a new iPhone, if you've got an iPod, even if you have a Zoom or a Kindle
[00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:23.360]   or many of the GPS devices, Audible plays on hundreds of devices.
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:24.360]   Just go to the device center.
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:26.360]   You'll see so many different devices.
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:28.060]   What a great way to listen to your books.
[00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:29.460]   I've been commuting back and forth.
[00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:33.660]   I have a commute again this week because the family is staying down at the beach.
[00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:38.060]   We rented a beach house for the week and I come into work and that means it's an hour each way.
[00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:39.860]   I'm not complaining.
[00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:40.460]   I'm listening.
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:45.960]   In fact, I got through bonk, which was I was listening to and I'm ready to start another book.
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:51.260]   In fact, I'm excited now because I get to put another book on my iPhone.
[00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:55.860]   Andy, you have a recommendation, something I might want to listen to or shall I recommend today?
[00:38:55.860 --> 00:39:00.160]   I'll definitely recommend because the other day I came across a really nice title
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:03.260]   that just came out in Audible just a few weeks ago.
[00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:05.260]   It is by Hunter S. Thompson.
[00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:06.960]   It's Songs of the Doomed.
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:09.360]   More notes on the death of the American Dream.
[00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:10.660]   I haven't read that one.
[00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:12.860]   It's awesome for two different reasons.
[00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:20.360]   Most people are familiar with fear and loathing in Las Vegas, all these real epic bad craziness
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:22.460]   sort of adventures in this voice.
[00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:27.460]   But he spent the last years of his life writing for ESPN.com and other places just writing about
[00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:30.260]   what's going on in sports and politics in the world.
[00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:33.860]   It shows you how good a writer he simply was.
[00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:38.660]   The idea of the trunk full of mexcalene that wasn't just like an act or a gimmick
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:42.960]   that he had to rely on to make this thing, to make his stories interesting.
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:45.160]   He was one hell of a journalist and one hell of a writer.
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:46.060]   He was a great writer.
[00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:46.960]   Absolutely.
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:50.260]   So this was actually, I bought this book originally in paperback and I enjoyed it.
[00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:55.460]   When I saw that it was available on an Audible, now it has two really great features about it.
[00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:59.660]   Number one, the guy reading it is appropriate for a Hunter S. Thompson book.
[00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:05.060]   I have not bought fear and loathing in Las Vegas because the announcer just doesn't match.
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:09.160]   It's like in the trunk of the car was a half liter of either.
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:11.660]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:12.660]   It's like, no, no, no.
[00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:15.660]   Well, I see there's an abridged version that Hunter S. Thompson himself reads.
[00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:18.160]   See, this is the good news and the bad news.
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:25.060]   The good news and bad news is that there is a Hunter stops and then talk about the book.
[00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:25.660]   The book.
[00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:26.660]   I got to play this.
[00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:27.760]   I got to play a little bit of this.
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:32.760]   But you're not going to get him to do more than three hours anything, obviously.
[00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:36.260]   And he gets distracted and he's talking about things that are going on like in the house.
[00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:37.060]   Oh, you're kidding.
[00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:38.060]   That's the thing going on.
[00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:44.160]   And of course, so basically you'll hear like part of Hunter S. Thompson reading and then there'll be like a very brief musical interlude.
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:46.060]   And then the professional reader will come on.
[00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:46.460]   Oh, no.
[00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:47.260]   Sounds really good.
[00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:51.760]   And he'll he'll read the actual essay and he'll read it with with in a compelling way that makes it.
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:52.560]   That's hysterical.
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:54.460]   He should be played by Johnny Depp in the movie.
[00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:55.060]   Oh, that's a.
[00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:55.160]   That's a.
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:55.660]   Stair.
[00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:57.360]   I think most people would be throwing up the.
[00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:58.060]   Here's Hunter.
[00:40:58.060 --> 00:40:58.860]   Here's Hunter reading.
[00:40:58.860 --> 00:40:59.260]   He was really.
[00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:00.460]   He's working with the dog, right?
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:03.560]   He's talking to somebody.
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:05.760]   Dog, mess it on to.
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:10.260]   That was a point of one of things.
[00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:14.860]   This is obviously more of a performance than it is a reading.
[00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:17.760]   Yes, you see, I got to get this now.
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:18.560]   This is great.
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:21.760]   I can't hold a lot of people because a lot of people are going to be like, I cannot listen to.
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:22.260]   Oh, what a.
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:29.860]   Oh, yeah, it goes for long enough that it's entertaining and then they get the professional back in it.
[00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:30.660]   Then have the.
[00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:31.560]   The announcer in here.
[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:33.060]   As a side.
[00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:37.260]   I'll recommend one of my favorite DVDs of all time is the Fair and Loth.
[00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:42.360]   In Las Vegas DVD because there is an entire audio audio commentary track of just.
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:43.760]   Oh my goodness.
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:46.860]   Just not focusing on the movie and I got to hear that.
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:54.960]   I cannot use this phrase in the show, but there is a blank blanking bastards.
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:59.360]   It's just it's not this how he ends like every third sentence and I was listening to this like during my morning.
[00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:03.460]   Constitutional's get like through the entire like two hour thing and it's for the whole rest of the day.
[00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:04.560]   I'm like, sorry.
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:05.660]   I'm back to the back of the list.
[00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:06.960]   Oh, like my pleasure.
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:11.260]   He's a good man to have on an audio track.
[00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:15.960]   Songs of the doomed more notes in the death of the American dream at performance by Hunter S.
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:17.660]   Thompson of his of his book.
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:19.660]   What a great choice, but you know, there's a lot more.
[00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:25.960]   In fact, if you go to audible.com, you'll notice they've put a link on my with my face on it that goes to my top 20.
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:31.060]   Performance is not just great books, but the top 20 best books to listen to on audible.com.
[00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:32.560]   So they're downright famous.
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:32.960]   They're there.
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:33.260]   More.
[00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:42.060]   Well, and you know, I actually went through all 350 some books that I've listened to on audible.com and and you know, it's hard to narrow it down to 20.
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:49.260]   But the ones I picked were ones that were not only great, you know, really great books, but the performance made them more enjoyable.
[00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:51.760]   For instance, the life of pie, you could read the life of pie.
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:58.160]   What a wonderful book by Jan Martell, but the reader on this brings it to life in such a great way.
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:00.360]   I did put like a chain in there.
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:02.660]   We were talking about him a couple of months ago.
[00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:03.660]   He passed away.
[00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:06.160]   John Hodgman, of course, the areas of my expertise.
[00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:10.560]   I mean, just some really wonderful books in here as well.
[00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:20.060]   If you're running short of things to listen to on audible, you know, listen to John Clay, sweet, CS Lewis is the screw tape letters is really a mind blower.
[00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:21.160]   It's all good.
[00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:22.560]   Plenty to listen to.
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:23.960]   There's 60,000 books now.
[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:26.160]   Just go to audible.com and the first one's free.
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:29.360]   If you go to audible.com/macbreak.
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:32.560]   If you haven't signed up, I don't know what you're waiting for.
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:35.760]   This is the time put it off no longer this summer.
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:39.160]   I don't bring I don't have to bring my books to the beach.
[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:40.260]   I bring audible with me.
[00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:42.860]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:43.960]   We thank you for their support.
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:56.160]   So, you know, this story about Steve Jobs, you know, I have to mention that I got an email may end of May from somebody saying, I know somebody who works at the Methodist Hospital in Memphis.
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:44:08.360]   Steve was there for a month just checked out and I didn't say anything about it because, well, partly because of Steve's very clear request to not, you know, to give him some privacy.
[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:10.460]   But also I had no corroboration.
[00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:28.660]   Well, on Friday after the markets closed, after the iPhone 3GS went on sale, the Wall Street Journal published on the front page, an unsourced, I might add, story that Jobs had in fact had a liver transplant at that hospital, well, at a hospital in Tennessee.
[00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:30.960]   I'm pretty sure I know which hospital.
[00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:43.660]   I guess there's so many things we can ask about. First of all, what do you think the backstory is on the on the journal not saying anything about its sources? It violates even its own internal policies.
[00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:45.160]   Andy Europe, Europe.
[00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:46.760]   In exchange, Rich.
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:47.360]   What do you think?
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:45:01.860]   I think it's well, it would be very, very unusual if a newspaper like the Wall Street Journal went with an unsourced source and unsourced claim that they didn't absolutely have absolutely locked, absolutely cold.
[00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:04.560]   It's funny, ironically, it had made me believe it more.
[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:05.060]   You're right.
[00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:07.860]   Because I thought, well, they wouldn't have said this if it weren't true.
[00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:11.660]   And I obviously have no insight information about how the story was done.
[00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:16.260]   But when I read it, it seemed like other stories that I'm familiar with where some.
[00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:24.960]   There's there are times when you need to get a story out and announced officially, but you cannot make an official statement or announcement.
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:28.260]   So basically you say, I will come to you with this information.
[00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:32.760]   You cannot source me, but here's all the evidence you need to make sure you know that this is actually rock solid.
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:41.560]   I mean, I can't it's it seemed it seemed to me like somebody who some it seemed to be like an official unofficial announcement.
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:43.860]   I had I have to say I thought this must be Apple.
[00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:45.660]   That's that's that's sort of again.
[00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:46.660]   That's just a guess.
[00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:52.360]   But again, the fact that the Wall Street Journal would go with saying we're not going to tell you where we got this from, but we're reporting this is though it's fact.
[00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:59.160]   I mean, it it does mean that they have this lock, not only that, but they have this from a source where they will not get in trouble if it ever comes out.
[00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:06.860]   Again, if you had gone number one shows that your class act that if somebody broke hospital rules and he and that person definitely broke one hell.
[00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:08.660]   That's a that's a felony.
[00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:09.260]   It's a felony.
[00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:15.760]   It's a hippophillany and very few newspapers would go with that sort of information for exactly that that reason.
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:18.160]   I mean, they would get they would get sued because you cannot.
[00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:28.060]   Well, they would get sued for any reason, but they would have their lawyers would tell them there is a good chance we would lose a lawsuit if Apple decided to sue that based on this information.
[00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:34.160]   That's that's not the reason why again, I tend to suspect that this is sort of an official slash unofficial release.
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:38.060]   Also, the timing, which was as favorable as could be for Apple.
[00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:44.260]   You know, I mean, they waited really to the markets closed on a triple quadruple witching day.
[00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:52.560]   They I mean, it seems like this was something that that Apple would have orchestrated figuring the story must come out at some point.
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:56.560]   And in fact, in the stock market, they had heard him a little bit on money, but not not badly.
[00:46:56.560 --> 00:47:01.060]   I don't think it heard him at all, Leo, because there was a pullback across the board on right now.
[00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:01.760]   Everybody was there.
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:02.160]   Yeah.
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:05.760]   I in fact, I don't see how this is anything but good news for Apple.
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:06.760]   Steve is back.
[00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:08.160]   He's not dead.
[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:11.360]   And in fact, he's been seen at Apple who seen yesterday at Apple, right?
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:12.360]   The R's technical.
[00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:15.560]   They admitted they admitted that he's been there since Monday.
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:17.260]   So he's working.
[00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:18.260]   Yeah.
[00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:23.160]   And in fact, a liver transplant could be a cure if he had if he had liver cancer, it could be a cure for that.
[00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:25.360]   I'm not sure what what exactly we don't know.
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:25.860]   They don't know.
[00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:26.260]   They don't know.
[00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:26.760]   We don't know.
[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:31.160]   I mean, everybody surmised that his pancreatic cancer was back.
[00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:33.760]   It's unlikely that that was the case now.
[00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:39.160]   He could have simply had liver failure due to the massive drugs you get when you get any kind of a
[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:39.260]   right.
[00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:40.860]   It could have been from the chemo or the radiation.
[00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:46.260]   Yeah, it could have absolutely nothing to do with liver cancer, although it is common from what I've I've
[00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:50.360]   been told for pancreatic cancer to metastasize to the liver.
[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:52.960]   So it's but it you know, it doesn't matter either way.
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:54.660]   He's he's got a liver transplant.
[00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:55.660]   He's back at work.
[00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:57.760]   Let's hope he does well.
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:00.660]   Yeah, I'm absolutely.
[00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:07.060]   I was surprised this is so far up on the cultural radar that Letterman had three jokes about his liver transplant
[00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:07.460]   Wow.
[00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:07.760]   Last night's.
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:08.560]   Oh, wow.
[00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:09.760]   Well, that's how people are paying attention.
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:10.960]   Now it does raise the issue.
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:15.460]   Did Apple lie in January when they said, oh, it's a hormone imbalance.
[00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:22.460]   It does accept for the fact that they could have been true that day and then the liver got worse the next day.
[00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:28.860]   Regis McKenna in this Bradstone article in the New York Times says what people don't understand is that Steve
[00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:31.560]   has always been very personal about his life.
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:34.460]   He's always kept things close to the vest since I've known him.
[00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:38.760]   McKenna was the first PR guy for Apple and only confided in a relatively few people.
[00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:43.860]   So this is not anything new for Steve Jobs or for Apple for that matter.
[00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:44.860]   Yeah.
[00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:52.760]   The question is, you know, from a corporate governance issue, whether with their laws were violated since he is their CEO.
[00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:58.460]   It is a publicly held company and given the hatred for Apple by those who are jealous of its success,
[00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:01.760]   you can bet it will be investigated at nauseum and then we'll find out.
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:02.060]   Right.
[00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:05.160]   Some some according to the time some experts are divided.
[00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:09.160]   Some believe Apple did not need to disclose because he was on a leave of absence.
[00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:13.160]   So it's an on in the end at best case, Leo.
[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:14.960]   It's an unsettled area of the law.
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:21.360]   I personally think morally the health of a CEO should be disclosed to the stockholders morally.
[00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:26.260]   I don't know that legally there's any obligation to every lawyer I've talked to gives me a different answer.
[00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:31.760]   I don't think it's a settled area of the law, but well, that's in their favor because you can argue then, you know,
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:35.860]   and I won't stop people from suing them. I'll be sued 52 times to Wednesday.
[00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:41.960]   They're already the usual crap about, oh, did Steve Jobs money buy him a liver earlier than anybody else?
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:44.760]   And, you know, it's it's it's all going to come out.
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:48.960]   You can you know, I could have written the 15 headlines we'll see around this five years ago.
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:50.460]   We know what's going to be said.
[00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:51.160]   It's routine.
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:51.860]   It's boring.
[00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:54.260]   At the end of the day, it will be investigated.
[00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:57.760]   And if there was wrongdoing, there should be action taken against them until there is.
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:49:59.060]   I'm going to give them the benefit of it out.
[00:49:59.060 --> 00:49:59.260]   Yeah.
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:02.460]   And we're hopeful that that is the end of it.
[00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:03.560]   I'm glad he's back to me.
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:07.360]   That's fast work to get back to work in two months after a liver transplant.
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:07.960]   Oh kidding.
[00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:11.960]   I mean, you can bet you can bet the average Joe wouldn't be rushing to get back.
[00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:14.560]   Yeah, just had my liver showed up and put back in.
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:16.160]   Let me see if I can get right back to work.
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:18.360]   You know, I mean, Steve doesn't need to do it for the money.
[00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:20.860]   He could he could say, I'm I'm out of here.
[00:50:20.860 --> 00:50:22.160]   I'm going to enjoy my life.
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:27.660]   Be with my family, but he loves obviously loves what he's doing and feels is important and wanted to get back to work.
[00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:32.160]   I mean, you got to wonder what does it take to slow this guy down?
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:35.660]   I mean, let's see if we can put him on a train at Rex.
[00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:36.960]   Yeah.
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:36.960]   Yeah.
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:38.160]   Well, you see, it's not exactly.
[00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:40.160]   It's not the mean, it doesn't mean these coming back to you.
[00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:44.060]   It's not exactly the case where he comes back to work and starts processing TRS reports all day.
[00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:44.460]   Yeah.
[00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:45.460]   He has a full job.
[00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:47.960]   He loves to be still working at all.
[00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:57.560]   I mean, liver transplant or no, if I had one tenth of his money, I still be doing fun things like this, but you know, work week's like last week where it's like our number 41 of
[00:50:57.560 --> 00:50:58.560]   18 hour work day.
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:50:59.560]   It might take a little easy.
[00:50:59.560 --> 00:50:59.960]   Yeah.
[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:01.260]   I could be sleeping on a beach.
[00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:01.560]   Yeah.
[00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:03.260]   Instead of a little bit easy.
[00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:06.160]   If I had Steve's be money, I'd be buying the beach.
[00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:06.560]   Dr.
[00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:13.060]   Mom, who are resident physician in the chat room, says actually most people are back from transplants within a month.
[00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:14.460]   She says two months is not.
[00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:16.160]   She says two months is not abnormal.
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:16.760]   They have a good age.
[00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:17.060]   Mom.
[00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:20.560]   Throw him out of the hospital after a day.
[00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:22.760]   So good.
[00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:26.560]   So we're glad that he's back and I hope the TPS reports go well.
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:27.660]   I hope Dr.
[00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:28.960]   Mom doesn't think poorly of me.
[00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:32.460]   But if I ever have a liver transplant, I'm going to need four or five months.
[00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:32.960]   OK.
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:33.660]   Yeah.
[00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:36.260]   That's a heavy duty transplant, I think.
[00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:38.960]   I'm kind of sorry, but that's just the way that's going to go.
[00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:43.960]   I remember talking to a physician who said heart transplant.
[00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:49.060]   Yeah, but the liver controls a lot of how you feel and functionality and so forth.
[00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:49.660]   That's a big old.
[00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:51.660]   That's a big old thing to be swapping out.
[00:51:53.260 --> 00:52:01.160]   Yeah, so there was a there was there was a joke on Twitter about like maybe someone who was already upset with Apple.
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:07.560]   So gee, that's kind of ironic that that Steve Jobs is liver is replaceable, but the battery on the new I knew Mac.
[00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:10.160]   Now that's a good line.
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:13.960]   So that was those Sean King, I believe that's Sean King right there.
[00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:17.360]   My your Mac life certainly doesn't see.
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:19.860]   It's one of those things where it's like, oh, that's sick.
[00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:20.960]   I'm forwarding that to 40.
[00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:25.360]   It certainly hasn't hurt sales of the phone, though.
[00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:27.560]   One million is fantastic.
[00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:30.860]   One million is really, really fantastic.
[00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:39.160]   Are there any other stories 12% of iPhone 3GS buyers are dumping their blackberry for the iPhone?
[00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:41.660]   According to Mac Daily News, that's an interesting story.
[00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:48.960]   Well, we saw this with the very first gen phone numbers of people switching out of Verizon and other carriers to get the iPhone.
[00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:53.160]   Every time they do something major, there's a big hit to all the competitors.
[00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:58.560]   So I am I'm still hoping that my source on the Verizon rumor is true.
[00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:05.160]   And this is a survey we should say it from Piper Jeff rave about 256 their early adopters.
[00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:07.460]   So it's not I would say statistically.
[00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:10.160]   It's not a big it's not a big sample.
[00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:16.460]   More more blackberry owners are going out of contract in the have have gone out of contract with the previous two years.
[00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:20.760]   Then did when the first iPhone came out, well, maybe you want one, but you're still in contract.
[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:21.960]   Second iPhone comes out.
[00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:23.060]   You're still one year in.
[00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:29.160]   So maybe it's so I think we're just a lot of this is just people who have been wanting to do this for a couple of years now finally have the opportunity to do so.
[00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:29.660]   Yeah.
[00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:33.060]   Last year was a 6% of blackberry users.
[00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:34.160]   I mean, but think about it.
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:38.260]   How many products of any kind sell a million of anything?
[00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:39.260]   No, it's remarkable.
[00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:47.460]   It despite AT&T now have to say AT&T did step up. They, you know, they they reduced the cost for people who had the phone for a year.
[00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:50.860]   They listened to their their outcry and the he and crying.
[00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:51.860]   That was a good thing.
[00:53:51.860 --> 00:54:02.360]   They've that Apple is offered a $30 rebate for people who were so apparently I didn't get any offer, but to some people who were subjected to long delays activating.
[00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:04.860]   My your activation went pretty quick.
[00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:09.960]   Three minutes, three minutes, and of course Andy's yours was activated when you got it.
[00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:11.860]   Yeah, mine took a little longer.
[00:54:11.860 --> 00:54:13.760]   I brought it home.
[00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:15.360]   My daughters as well.
[00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:19.760]   Actually, I got mine shipped to me and it activated right away.
[00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:23.760]   Come to think of it, but I did it in the morning then I brought we brought my daughters home and took a little bit longer.
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:25.360]   We had to turn her phone off and on.
[00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:27.560]   But anyway, it happened.
[00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:30.860]   I think it certainly went better than it did the first time around.
[00:54:30.860 --> 00:54:34.960]   Yeah, if you now you think about a million phones getting activated, that's that's quite a bit.
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:44.560]   Yeah, try to try to imagine the back end processes to be able knowing that people's expectations are that this should be instant and perfect.
[00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:48.160]   And there's you know, who cares a million people are trying to do it at once.
[00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:51.160]   I mean, the back end thought that had to go into that.
[00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:58.360]   I mean, I can't even imagine what would have to do if I had to process it just a million emails, let alone activate a million iPhones.
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:01.860]   I bought that Mophie case on your recommendation, the Mophie Air.
[00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:03.160]   Yeah, it's a nice case.
[00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:03.460]   You're right.
[00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:04.660]   It's not it's not very big.
[00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:07.260]   No, it isn't, but it's very hard to install.
[00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:08.760]   It is.
[00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:10.160]   Well, here's the thing.
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:11.760]   You know where the instructions are?
[00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:13.660]   Yeah, on the box top.
[00:55:13.660 --> 00:55:21.060]   And so I'm sitting there trying to figure out how to get the thing open and I'm pulling on it every which way and finally the top just breaks off.
[00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:23.360]   I go, oh, well, that's how you give it in.
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:27.560]   And my top broke off, although the battery part works fine.
[00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:28.960]   Oh, so you actually broke yours.
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:33.260]   I actually destroyed it in the process of installing it because I couldn't figure out to get it open.
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:36.560]   And then I got about 15 emails from people that had the same experience.
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:37.160]   Really?
[00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:42.060]   Yeah, because it's very hard to figure out how to open it and the instructions are hidden.
[00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:45.260]   It's sort of like, yeah, I will hide the instructions.
[00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:47.660]   I got a I got a manual in mind.
[00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:48.460]   It's so let me see.
[00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:53.160]   Well, maybe you maybe you got a different thing than I got, but anyway, it still works fine.
[00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:54.760]   It's just missing it too bad.
[00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:55.660]   Yeah, it's missing.
[00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:56.760]   It's convertible top.
[00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:57.560]   That's too bad.
[00:55:57.560 --> 00:55:58.160]   It's yeah.
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:00.060]   You have a you have a you have a rag top.
[00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:00.460]   That's all.
[00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:03.160]   There's like a little break right here where the thing was attached.
[00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:06.660]   But see, the thing is what matters is this pike from here down.
[00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:07.960]   So the batteries there.
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:09.460]   Yeah, it still works just fine.
[00:56:09.460 --> 00:56:11.760]   Here's what nobody's been able to answer for me.
[00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:16.660]   Who makes a case that will cover the iPhone in the mophie?
[00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:18.860]   Because all the cases just cover the iPhone.
[00:56:18.860 --> 00:56:23.860]   I mean, you want a case on top of the mophie in addition because it doesn't cover the front.
[00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:26.060]   Oh, you want to protect the front?
[00:56:26.060 --> 00:56:28.060]   You want a little panel or something over that?
[00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:28.460]   Yeah.
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:31.460]   Yeah, see, I have on my on my old iPhone.
[00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:33.960]   I've got this thing.
[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:38.560]   Yeah, I've got, you know, a mar where mar where makes that case a flip case.
[00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:39.060]   I noticed.
[00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:45.360]   Yeah, this is this is from a place in Sweden, by the way, which is the reason there's got like the Borg symbol on the front of it.
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:48.260]   I like to keep my phone unencumbered.
[00:56:48.260 --> 00:56:51.760]   I'm going to go commando with my with my phone.
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:54.460]   I just like to let that's because you're more sure footed than I am.
[00:56:54.460 --> 00:56:58.360]   Well, anyway, I'm glad to have the battery.
[00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:03.060]   I got it for going to China because I figured I might not have as many opportunities to charge the phone.
[00:57:03.060 --> 00:57:05.660]   Although the battery life, let's say it is pretty good.
[00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:06.360]   Three Gs.
[00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:06.760]   Yeah.
[00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:08.760]   It's all the worse.
[00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:09.660]   Yeah.
[00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:17.660]   Now, if you start shooting video and doing navigation and, you know, all bunch of kind of stuff like that, it'll go down.
[00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:17.960]   Yeah.
[00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:21.360]   And the juice pack comes charged, which is very nice.
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:23.160]   Yeah, I was surprised at that.
[00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:23.560]   Yeah.
[00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:25.460]   I think that's a nice feature.
[00:57:26.060 --> 00:57:28.660]   Box wave make something to cut.
[00:57:28.660 --> 00:57:31.660]   Dennis at CADCO says box wave, Scott.
[00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:32.560]   We'll cover it.
[00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:34.960]   What's that box wave?
[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:36.460]   Box wave.
[00:57:36.460 --> 00:57:36.760]   Okay.
[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:38.760]   I'm going to Google that right now box wave.
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:44.160]   So that would go over a top of the Mophia, I guess, and give you the flip top.
[00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:44.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:47.160]   They make a screen protector for the iPhone.
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:48.060]   Oh, okay.
[00:57:48.060 --> 00:57:48.560]   Yeah.
[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:50.160]   All right.
[00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:53.460]   Well, we're going to do our picks of the week unless we have any other news stories.
[00:57:53.460 --> 00:57:55.560]   I think that's two big ones to cover, certainly.
[00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:58.560]   Um, let us.
[00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:01.260]   Oh, one more, one more thing.
[00:58:01.260 --> 00:58:08.460]   Oh, Justin from PC guy and computer world magazine, Apple issues fixed for Macbook Pro SATA interface.
[00:58:08.460 --> 00:58:15.860]   Remember, there were some complaints that the SATA interface in the new Macbook Pro was slow was a 1.0 interface.
[00:58:15.860 --> 00:58:25.360]   Despite the fact that the hardware was capable of more Apple said the Macbook Pro EFI firmware update 1.7, which should be coming your way today.
[00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:32.260]   It fixes a problem reported by a small number of customers using drives based on the latest status specification with a new Macbook Pro line.
[00:58:32.260 --> 00:58:39.160]   So, uh, Apple says it hasn't shipped drives operating at the higher speed specification.
[00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:54.560]   That's why Apple wasn't aware of this, but if you do put a new drive in and you want to go faster than 1.5 gigabits per second, this firmware upgrade will fix it and get you to the 3 gigabits, the SATA 2 spec.
[00:58:55.460 --> 00:58:56.260]   Good news.
[00:58:56.260 --> 00:59:11.160]   Apple's also issued an EFI firmware update for 20 inch and 24 inch early 2009 iMacs, which fixes a problem with the ATI 4850 intermittently stop stopping, which could be bad and waking from sleep during bootcamp.
[00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:12.960]   Well, I should, I think I have one of those.
[00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:14.960]   I should download the firmware update.
[00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:16.960]   There were a lot of updates this week.
[00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:17.660]   Did you notice that?
[00:59:17.660 --> 00:59:18.560]   Mm hmm.
[00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:21.060]   They kept shipping up updates every few days.
[00:59:21.060 --> 00:59:23.260]   But you know, when I found out what?
[00:59:24.060 --> 00:59:26.760]   Apple doesn't have any updates compared to windows.
[00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:27.260]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:27.260 --> 00:59:29.760]   No, it's I had to try to help.
[00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:41.260]   I tried to help a friend who had their windows system crash and we got XP back on the drive and it said there are 78 updates available for your computer.
[00:59:41.260 --> 00:59:43.060]   Wow.
[00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:45.260]   78.
[00:59:45.260 --> 00:59:47.760]   I'm like, that's okay.
[00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:49.560]   She hasn't downloaded it in a while.
[00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:55.860]   The first 13 times we didn't get it right the first 26 times we didn't get it right the first 52 times we did it.
[00:59:55.860 --> 00:59:57.460]   They did 31 this month.
[00:59:57.460 --> 00:59:58.760]   So she must have missed a couple.
[00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:03.960]   But anyway, still, yeah, I mean, if this if this were windows podcast, we'd be saying it's not great how when they find.
[01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:04.560]   That's right.
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:05.460]   It's all spin.
[01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:08.860]   It's all supposed to Apple was the last time they did a security.
[01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:10.860]   Which is a very valid.
[01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:13.660]   Yeah, it took him a long time to do that job of fix.
[01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:18.660]   All right, we're going to get to our picks of the week in just a second with Scott and Andy and me.
[01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:24.060]   Leo, I'm Leo, the port, but first let's mention friends at Squarespace.
[01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:27.660]   Squarespace is the way to the modern way to do a website.
[01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:33.460]   And if you have not tried it yet, I want you to try it right now by going to squarespace.com.
[01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:39.560]   Use the promo code Mac break Mac break and you could try it for free.
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:42.160]   You can also get 10% off with the promo code Mac break.
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:44.360]   So we invite you to give it a shot.
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:45.760]   Now here's the deal with squarespace.
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:48.960]   It'll import all of your posts from your current blog.
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:01:00.460]   If that's what you're looking for doing, if you want to get your type pad or your word press or your blogger blog into your word, your new a squarespace, you can do it.
[01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:01.360]   But it's not.
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:04.860]   You know, I hate to say that because it sounds like it's a blog engine engine.
[01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:05.260]   It's not.
[01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:06.660]   It's really a website engine.
[01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:08.460]   You've got photo galleries.
[01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:09.360]   You've got forums.
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:12.260]   You've got form builders Google map integration.
[01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:15.060]   Amazing stats and tracking.
[01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:26.660]   Very, very cool permissions set up so that if you have multiple authors on your site, you can easily make it, you know, secure and give them permission to do what they need to do with no more.
[01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:29.460]   The cloud architecture is great.
[01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:33.060]   When you get hit by a lot of traffic, boom, it responds instantly.
[01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:35.460]   So great stability of your site.
[01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:38.460]   It just never goes down and design is so cool.
[01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:42.060]   I want you to just just, you know, create an account just to play with the design.
[01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:43.860]   You've got some great templates to start with.
[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:53.660]   But then you can adjust them just with drag and drop using Ajax or if you're a CSS pro, you get full CSS accessibility because JavaScript can be embedded as well.
[01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:56.160]   Things like discus are very easy to add.
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:58.260]   It's really powerful stuff.
[01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:00.660]   Squarespace.com/macbreak.
[01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:06.660]   They are giving away iPhones one a day through July 7th.
[01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:08.760]   So here's the deal.
[01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:12.260]   If you go to squarespace.com/iPhone, you can find it all the details.
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:18.060]   But basically in a thumbnail, just tweet with a hashtag pound squarespace.
[01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:19.760]   Add that to one of your tweets.
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:24.060]   The only need to do one, I think, and you're entered in for all the drawings.
[01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:26.260]   Squarespace.
[01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:29.560]   This, you know, the pound sign squarespace put it in one of your tweets on Twitter.
[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:37.160]   Squarespace.com/macbreak to try it and use the promo code Macbreak to save 10% off your next website.
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:39.360]   We're moving everybody.
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:40.660]   I know is moving to squarespace.
[01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:41.160]   We're moving.
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:42.360]   I think I don't know if we've done it yet.
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:44.660]   The inside Twit blog, Leoville.com.
[01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:46.860]   I want to kiss them just because you left Drupal.
[01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:48.960]   No, I'm still using Drupal.
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:49.560]   You know who did me?
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:53.260]   Well, for Twit.tv because we have so much custom back end.
[01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:57.960]   And you know why I'm really doing it because I'm waiting because Alex is going to leave Drupal and use squarespace.
[01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:01.960]   And I'm waiting for Alex to do it so I can then copy what he does.
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:04.360]   Oh, yeah, because, well, you know, they suffer.
[01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:06.760]   Alex, Alex, here's the problem.
[01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:13.560]   If you square spaces actually the worst time killer in Alex's life, because he goes, Oh, I can make the template black.
[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:14.960]   I can make the template green.
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:15.960]   Oh, I can make the template.
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:16.360]   Yeah.
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:20.860]   Then only wasted a lot of time messing around with his squarespace template.
[01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:24.160]   You're going to when you go to Twit blog, it's like every day.
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:24.860]   It's a new color.
[01:03:24.860 --> 01:03:26.860]   Yeah, every day, every hour.
[01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:29.060]   Just just go right now.
[01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:30.460]   Squarespace.com.
[01:03:30.460 --> 01:03:31.560]   Try it out.
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:32.160]   Absolutely.
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:34.860]   For you, don't even need a credit card and use Mac break when you decide to sign up.
[01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:36.260]   You're going to love it.
[01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:37.460]   Squarespace.com.
[01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:39.360]   Now it's time for our picks of the day.
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:40.560]   We will start with Mr.
[01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:46.560]   Andy and not go the voice of reason, truth, sanity and a damn fine looking fella.
[01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:49.660]   Oh, dear God, three of those four things are true.
[01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:50.560]   Then we're in big.
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:54.660]   Well, interesting interesting development.
[01:03:54.660 --> 01:04:01.860]   We're talking about PR and like relationships with the people trying to let we clue me in on things that are happening with what they're doing.
[01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:09.860]   I got an interesting series of emails, a company called Flex eBits F L E X I B I T S U W dot comet to get to the website.
[01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:19.160]   Came up the really cool tool called cameras that does solves a really frustrating problem sometimes with the way that the Mac OS deals with camera attachments.
[01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:31.060]   We all know about image capture and the it's the system's ability to simply automatically launch a special program every time that you attach a camera to, you know, always launch iPhone always on launch aperture, whatever.
[01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:35.060]   The problem is though that now we have so many different cameras for so many different purposes.
[01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:42.060]   When I attach my iPhone, I want it to all go into iPhoto when I attach my memory card from my SLR or the SLR itself.
[01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:45.860]   What I want is I want it to go into aperture and all kinds of other things.
[01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:54.060]   Now Flex eBits and you know, there's a reason why you'll see you're seeing that that Flex eBits will retune soon with cameras for free.
[01:04:54.060 --> 01:05:01.060]   Cameras is a really cool tool that lets you, it's actually a preference is pain that simply says look when this camera shows up.
[01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:06.060]   Oh, I need that because my iPhone keeps launching Lightroom and I don't want it to launch Lightroom.
[01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:13.060]   That's why for years I did not have anything hooked up to auto launch an image capture program because I did not, I just want to go in.
[01:05:13.060 --> 01:05:17.060]   I want to skip the new podcast. I want to leave. I don't want to have to wait for this whole thing to launch.
[01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:20.060]   So basically it just simply says, okay, the iPhone does this.
[01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:26.060]   I need this. My iPhone D80 goes here and unfortunately, so I got it.
[01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:29.060]   They sent me promo code. I downloaded it. I thought, wow, that really works great.
[01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:31.660]   It really is that somebody just it's just preference.
[01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:35.060]   Pain. You set it up once and then you broke the site. What happened?
[01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:40.060]   Well, no, what happened was I got an email saying that they just found out that that's going to be a built in feature with Snow Leopard.
[01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:46.060]   Oh, so rather than try to like take people for some money that they're not going to have to spend in six months, they're still there.
[01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:55.060]   They're going to be releasing a free. It's going to be completely free. According to this email, it should be probably, I think, maybe ready by the time this podcast hits.
[01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:59.060]   So I thought that by this. So we could shut that we could shut down the server a second time.
[01:05:59.060 --> 01:06:10.060]   I'm hitting it all at once. But yeah, it's a good example of one of those little utilities that all it has to do is one thing and it does it as in obtrusively and as successfully as it can possibly done.
[01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:18.060]   And like I said, I've been using it for the past two or three days and just every time every time I plug in a camera and exactly the right thing happens.
[01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:24.060]   I'm like, yeah, this would have been worth the money. Wow, that's great. I do need that because it's been driving me crazy.
[01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:31.060]   Now that it takes so much video and stills with this new camera iPhone because I have it set up when I hook up my camera.
[01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:34.060]   I want Lightroom to launch, but I don't want it to launch for the iPhone.
[01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:38.060]   And you're going to want it for the big for all those vacation. Yeah, it makes sense to do get a jump on it.
[01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:43.060]   Good. Oh, I'll get it as soon as it's available. Flexibits FLEXIBITS.com.
[01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:50.060]   Coming soon to a computer near you. Now, Mr. Scott Born, it's your turn to pick something wonderful.
[01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:55.060]   What's that? What's he doing? What are you doing?
[01:06:55.060 --> 01:07:03.060]   It's Christmas in July. What are you doing, Scott Born?
[01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:09.060]   I'm playing with my pick of the week. He's playing with his pick again.
[01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:13.060]   Our good friend, Jeff. Yes. Jeff Smith.
[01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:20.060]   From of musical fame. The Jeff Smith. G-O-F-F Smith.
[01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:26.060]   Yes. Yeah. Ringtonefeeder.com has a new product called the iPhone Alarm Pack.
[01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:29.060]   And instead of that, oh, thank God.
[01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:38.060]   Oh, thank God. Nasty alarm. These work like ringtones only when you go to set alarms instead of setting the terrible ones that are available with the phone for free,
[01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:43.060]   you can pick pretty ones like the one I just played, which is my favorite called cinematic alert.
[01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:52.060]   And they not only work on iPhones. They work. He has M4 format for iPhones,
[01:07:52.060 --> 01:08:00.060]   for Windows based phones, MP3s for the phones that need those. So basically, these will work on any smartphone,
[01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:06.060]   but they were designed to work with the iPhone. And you get a whole slew of them and you can listen to them to see if you like them.
[01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:15.060]   And he's even got a demo where he uses them. There's 25 different alarm tones. And if you want, you can also just use them as regular ringtones.
[01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:19.060]   Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. That was his phone.
[01:08:19.060 --> 01:08:25.060]   There are some regular ringtone ones that are also very, very good.
[01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:30.060]   Alarm for the future alert. Apple see. Oh, this is great. And I want to play another one for you. That's really nice.
[01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:31.060]   Yeah.
[01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:37.060]   Get on the horn with Scott and porn.
[01:08:37.060 --> 01:08:39.060]   [laughter]
[01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:46.060]   Get the straight-ups up and get some falling. So it's calling. Get on the horn with Scott.
[01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:48.060]   Get on the horn.
[01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:52.060]   Now, is that available as a special added bonus or really get that?
[01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:55.060]   That was this kind of secret one. You can't buy that.
[01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:56.060]   I love that.
[01:08:56.060 --> 01:09:00.060]   But whenever that goes off and someone's near me, they're like, "Whoa, get on the horn."
[01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:10.060]   Anyway, this guy is scary talented. Let's just face it. He is so talented. He could be doing record albums for the big guys,
[01:09:10.060 --> 01:09:17.060]   but he's doing this stuff for us. And I just really like the work that he does. I think this is a great product.
[01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:22.060]   I don't know why I was so thrilled with it, but I guess I use a lot of these alarms to remind me,
[01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:27.060]   "Oh, you got a meeting? You got a phone call?" And it's just so much more pleasant to listen to that.
[01:09:27.060 --> 01:09:28.060]   [sings]
[01:09:28.060 --> 01:09:32.060]   I'm putting them right now. I'm putting on my phone right now. I wanted this for a while.
[01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:38.060]   They go to ringtonefeeder.com. It's a few shekels. It's not expensive.
[01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:43.060]   No, although if you subscribe to the ringtones, you get like two new ringtones every month, and it's really fun.
[01:09:43.060 --> 01:09:44.060]   I think that's worth doing.
[01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:51.060]   He has ringtones starting at $1.98 a month, 1998 a year. It's nothing.
[01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:58.060]   I mean, to get all the stuff he does, and I guarantee you, he works very hard at this because this is such good.
[01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:00.060]   What was that?
[01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:03.060]   Sorry, that was me hitting ringtonefeeder.com.
[01:10:03.060 --> 01:10:04.060]   Oh, it makes noise.
[01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:07.060]   It's a man because he has an auto play that makes lots of noise.
[01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:10.060]   Can on the phone with Scott Born.
[01:10:10.060 --> 01:10:15.060]   He is a guy who did our single jingers.
[01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:16.060]   Our sings.
[01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:17.060]   They call them bull.
[01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:18.060]   Yeah.
[01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:19.060]   Yeah.
[01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:20.060]   Andy Nautical.
[01:10:20.060 --> 01:10:23.060]   He is the man behind Andy Anaco. Yes, he is.
[01:10:23.060 --> 01:10:26.060]   Andy Anaco!
[01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:28.060]   We thank him for his hard work.
[01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:30.060]   Ringtonefeeder.com.
[01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:31.060]   I am big.
[01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:32.060]   Bye!
[01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:33.060]   Thank you very much.
[01:10:33.060 --> 01:10:34.060]   Very much.
[01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:35.060]   Ringtonefeeder.com.
[01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:37.060]   That's the place you want to go for the iPhone and the alarm packets.
[01:10:37.060 --> 01:10:38.060]   They're right now for dollar.
[01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:39.060]   I can't blame him.
[01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:40.060]   You don't hate him.
[01:10:40.060 --> 01:10:44.060]   Because I am now often referred to as la la la Leo. Thanks to him.
[01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:51.060]   La Porte.
[01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:59.060]   Don't you think that's cool?
[01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:00.060]   I think it's great.
[01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:03.060]   He's really kind of got the current of the market on this stuff now.
[01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:04.060]   He's really doing great stuff.
[01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:06.060]   I think we should go and do a show in Nashville.
[01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:07.060]   That's a good idea.
[01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:09.060]   Should all fly there and do a live show.
[01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:10.060]   That's a very good idea.
[01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:11.060]   That would be so much fun.
[01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:12.060]   Yeah.
[01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:14.060]   Maybe we could do it in Elvis's old recording studio.
[01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:17.060]   I know it's not Nashville, but it's in the same state.
[01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:18.060]   Elvis Elvis?
[01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:19.060]   Elvis.
[01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:20.060]   Elvis.
[01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:21.060]   Oh!
[01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:22.060]   You get a liver transplant while you're doing it.
[01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:27.060]   I think there's some kind of law that says you are not allowed to go into Elvis's mansion
[01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:30.060]   Andy because some sort of cosmic event would take place.
[01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:32.060]   Andy is the king.
[01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:33.060]   Hey, it's Andy is the king.
[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:36.060]   Hey, it's a cosmic event involving my stealing things than some of the money eBay next week.
[01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:37.060]   You're the king, right?
[01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:39.060]   No, it has something to do with the sideburn connection.
[01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:46.060]   My favorite moment in Spinal Tap is when they are at Graceland and they're attempting to
[01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:50.060]   sing Heartbreak Hotel and they can't do it.
[01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:51.060]   They just can't do it.
[01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:52.060]   It's so funny.
[01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:53.060]   It's such a great moment.
[01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:54.060]   All right.
[01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:58.060]   Now my turn from my pick and I realize this is something we use all the time that I have
[01:11:58.060 --> 01:12:03.060]   not ever picked on Mac break weekly and I really should mention it because it's so darn useful.
[01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:08.060]   We've been trying to set up an FTP server here because we now record shows for an
[01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:13.060]   number of people including PC perspective and futures and biotech and this weekend lawn.
[01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:18.060]   They want their audio files and so we thought, oh, no problem.
[01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:19.060]   We'll just set up an FTP.
[01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:23.060]   It's proven because of all the routing issues to be kind of a pain in the butt.
[01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:26.060]   What do I just use Dropbox instead?
[01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:28.060]   Do you guys know about Dropbox?
[01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:30.060]   Yeah, I think it's a great little girl.
[01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:31.060]   We have never recommend.
[01:12:31.060 --> 01:12:33.060]   I just looked back and I thought surely we've recommended this.
[01:12:33.060 --> 01:12:34.060]   I know I've recommended this.
[01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:35.060]   I love it.
[01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:36.060]   First time I used it.
[01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:43.060]   Yeah, it's free Mac, Windows and Linux, which is very handy because you can duplicate a drop
[01:12:43.060 --> 01:12:45.060]   box across many systems.
[01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:50.060]   Many of you are using a .Mac or Mobile Me or whatever the heck it's called.
[01:12:50.060 --> 01:12:53.060]   If you just want to make files available to people, you download Dropbox.
[01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:55.060]   I haven't installed on my Mac.
[01:12:55.060 --> 01:13:00.060]   It actually adds little item to the menu bar and then I can open my Dropbox and it looks
[01:13:00.060 --> 01:13:02.060]   this way on Windows and Linux too.
[01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:03.060]   It's just a folder.
[01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:08.380]   It just seems like a regular folder except that I've shared the contents of folders within
[01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:10.180]   that folder with different people.
[01:13:10.180 --> 01:13:14.860]   I just move a file that I want to make available to them to the folder without thinking about
[01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:17.940]   it, without me doing anything, without interfering with the operation of my system.
[01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:23.300]   It slowly uploads to the central server so that people can get it.
[01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:26.260]   Now I purchased 50 gigabytes because I wanted to have more space.
[01:13:26.260 --> 01:13:27.260]   You can buy more.
[01:13:27.260 --> 01:13:28.900]   I think it starts with two gigabytes.
[01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:30.060]   You get two for free.
[01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:33.260]   But that's even two is an awful lot.
[01:13:33.260 --> 01:13:35.580]   It's so simple to use.
[01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:41.900]   You just simply copy the files into that folder and then send an email through the Dropbox
[01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:46.260]   interface saying your files are shareable and people can get it.
[01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:48.260]   It's kind of like Mobile Me.
[01:13:48.260 --> 01:13:50.860]   I guess if you have Mobile Me you don't really need this.
[01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:54.220]   I just like the fact that it works across all those different platforms and I've added
[01:13:54.220 --> 01:13:56.060]   now I have 50 gigs.
[01:13:56.060 --> 01:13:57.900]   It is better than Mobile Me for me.
[01:13:57.900 --> 01:14:01.780]   I can't remember how much it was but it's not very expensive to add capacity for this.
[01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:03.180]   Just a great little system.
[01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:04.180]   DROPBOX.
[01:14:04.180 --> 01:14:08.740]   Go to getdropbox.com to get it.
[01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:10.060]   You hadn't recommended that on the show.
[01:14:10.060 --> 01:14:11.060]   How did you, Annie?
[01:14:11.060 --> 01:14:13.060]   I'm pretty sure I did.
[01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:14.060]   You did, okay.
[01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:15.060]   I apologize if you did.
[01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:17.660]   No apologies necessary.
[01:14:17.660 --> 01:14:21.460]   I think I recommended it back when it might have been in beta or something like that.
[01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:25.700]   I was looking through the Mac break picks just to see.
[01:14:25.700 --> 01:14:31.140]   I usually do that before I make a pick because I thought for sure we've recommended this.
[01:14:31.140 --> 01:14:34.220]   I apologize if it's a duplicate but definitely a great thing to know about.
[01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:38.340]   One of the great things about picks is sometimes we each individually recommend something that
[01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:44.340]   the other person has done seven or eight months ago and you know that's that, "Oh, I have
[01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:49.380]   not accepted Dropbox into my life realizing that it has a wonderful plan for me and my
[01:14:49.380 --> 01:14:50.380]   soul, my salvation."
[01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:52.180]   So I'm coming along for the ride.
[01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:54.580]   I've been using Dropbox since you recommended it I'm sure.
[01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:57.940]   We've been using it for a long time but I just realized the other day when I was copying
[01:14:57.940 --> 01:15:01.140]   the PC perspective files over and how much easier it was than anything else that we had
[01:15:01.140 --> 01:15:05.340]   tried to set up that we've used Dropio, we've tried to do FTP and so forth.
[01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:10.100]   This is just easy because it's just there and you just drag the file there and boom,
[01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:11.660]   it's done.
[01:15:11.660 --> 01:15:13.180]   So there's our pick of the week.
[01:15:13.180 --> 01:15:15.500]   Picks of the week, all three of them.
[01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:18.300]   Once again, we wish Steve the best, Steve Jobs the best.
[01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:19.380]   We're welcoming him back.
[01:15:19.380 --> 01:15:22.420]   It's so great to have him back at Apple.
[01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:24.220]   Enjoy your new iPhones, gentlemen.
[01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:26.180]   I know I will.
[01:15:26.180 --> 01:15:31.140]   And Alex will be back next week and you know I'll be leaving for China after that, right?
[01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:32.940]   Andy, we're almost ready to go.
[01:15:32.940 --> 01:15:35.460]   I'm leaving a week earlier than I am but...
[01:15:35.460 --> 01:15:36.460]   Oh, that's right.
[01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:38.220]   So you'll be here for one more Mac break.
[01:15:38.220 --> 01:15:41.580]   I'll be here for one more Mac break and hopefully when they quarantine us we'll both be in
[01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:44.540]   the same hotel and check the check time for pretend days.
[01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:45.540]   We can do that.
[01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:48.860]   That's fine and we'll be calling in from our prison cells in beautiful...
[01:15:48.860 --> 01:15:50.860]   Not a prison cell but again.
[01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:53.220]   Guests of the country as we see.
[01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:54.220]   Yes, yes.
[01:15:54.220 --> 01:15:55.220]   All right.
[01:15:55.220 --> 01:15:56.220]   Thanks.
[01:15:56.220 --> 01:15:57.220]   I'm going to trip to Leo.
[01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:58.220]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:15:58.220 --> 01:16:01.940]   Let's plug that because I want to go on it.
[01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:05.620]   So if I plug it, maybe I can get an invitation.
[01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:10.620]   I'm not going to anywhere as exotic as China but I am going to Maui.
[01:16:10.620 --> 01:16:12.220]   The weather might be better.
[01:16:12.220 --> 01:16:19.340]   September 16th through 20, I've been invited to join the faculty leading the beautiful,
[01:16:19.340 --> 01:16:21.620]   beautiful Maui photo festival.
[01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:22.620]   It's going to be...
[01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:24.580]   I looked at the lineup for this thing.
[01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:28.540]   Dane Sanders, my buddy Rick Salmon who does the photo focus podcast with me.
[01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:34.780]   Andy Katz, Julianne Koss, Dr. Russell Brown, Eddie Tap, Jack Wreck-Nep-Res-Nep-E.
[01:16:34.780 --> 01:16:37.260]   Me and a bunch of other people are going to lead this thing.
[01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:39.420]   I was like, "How did they get such an all-star lineup?"
[01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:40.420]   And I said, "Oh, yeah.
[01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:41.420]   It's in Maui.
[01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:43.020]   It's at the Hyatt Regency Maui."
[01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:44.020]   Yeah, okay.
[01:16:44.020 --> 01:16:45.020]   But here's...
[01:16:45.020 --> 01:16:47.060]   And a lot of people are saying, "You know, that's expensive."
[01:16:47.060 --> 01:16:48.060]   Well, here's...
[01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:49.540]   I have it on the photofocus.com site.
[01:16:49.540 --> 01:16:51.140]   We have a coupon on the right sidebar.
[01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:57.140]   It gets you $200 off, which means you can get into this thing for, I don't know, $495.
[01:16:57.140 --> 01:16:58.140]   Oh, well, what?
[01:16:58.140 --> 01:16:59.140]   And it's like four days.
[01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:00.140]   Yeah, four days for $4.95.
[01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:01.140]   Wow.
[01:17:01.140 --> 01:17:05.900]   The second thing is I've been checking the flights from the West Coast.
[01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:09.900]   I found one for somebody yesterday for $3.45.
[01:17:09.900 --> 01:17:12.580]   It costs $500 to fly to St. Louis.
[01:17:12.580 --> 01:17:15.380]   It's gotten so much cheaper.
[01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:17.540]   And the rooms are expensive at this hotel.
[01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:22.940]   They're down from $3.50 a year ago to $2.60, but they're going to do a room share thing.
[01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:26.340]   And there are also other rooms on the island in the $88 range.
[01:17:26.340 --> 01:17:30.140]   So you cannot go to Maui cheaper than you can go right now.
[01:17:30.140 --> 01:17:31.740]   It's going to be a great time.
[01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:33.580]   We'd love for you to come join us.
[01:17:33.580 --> 01:17:35.220]   The faculty is amazing.
[01:17:35.220 --> 01:17:36.700]   The location is amazing.
[01:17:36.700 --> 01:17:38.420]   We're going to do all kinds of fun stuff.
[01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:41.460]   We're going to cover all aspects of photography.
[01:17:41.460 --> 01:17:45.260]   So if you want to come hang out with some of the top leaders in the field...
[01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:46.260]   Russell Brown?
[01:17:46.260 --> 01:17:47.260]   It's going to be there.
[01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:48.820]   Russell Brown, he is a hoot.
[01:17:48.820 --> 01:17:52.860]   If you've never seen him do a Photoshop presentation, he's worth the trip alone.
[01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:54.140]   Just for his picture.
[01:17:54.140 --> 01:17:56.300]   He's worth the trip.
[01:17:56.300 --> 01:18:00.580]   He's kind of like that all the time.
[01:18:00.580 --> 01:18:02.820]   No, he's really worth watching.
[01:18:02.820 --> 01:18:04.660]   What a great cast of characters.
[01:18:04.660 --> 01:18:06.180]   What a great scene.
[01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:08.220]   I mean, oh, how much fun would that be?
[01:18:08.220 --> 01:18:10.780]   Maui Photo Festival September 16 through 20.
[01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:13.220]   There's a $200 off coupon at photofocus.com.
[01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:16.700]   While they last, I don't get any kind of incentive for offering that coupon.
[01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:20.500]   I just got it for our listeners in case they want to come.
[01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:21.500]   It's going to be a ton of fun.
[01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:22.500]   That's really neat.
[01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:26.780]   It's not as exotic as China, but I have a far less chance of being arrested and detained.
[01:18:26.780 --> 01:18:31.140]   No, your worst risk there is getting sunburned.
[01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:34.980]   The Maui Photo Festival and workshops MauiPhoto Festival.com.
[01:18:34.980 --> 01:18:36.700]   That sounds like a lot of fun.
[01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:37.700]   Thank you, Leo.
[01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:38.700]   Thank you, Scott.
[01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:39.700]   Thank you, Andy and Akko.
[01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:40.700]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:41.700]   Now get back to work.
[01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:43.620]   Break time is over.
[01:18:43.620 --> 01:18:45.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:49.100]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
