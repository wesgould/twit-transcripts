[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.840]   We're going to cover, as always, every little bit of trivia,
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.960]   deeply analyzed, dissect, and deconstruct every possible move
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.240]   that Steve Jobs makes in his daily life on this show every week.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.920]   Joining me now from his brand new facilities.
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.720]   In the Massachusetts state mental instance--
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:33.720]   no, it is not--
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.880]   At his new home, it's Mr. Andy Inaka with Fios, baby.
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.360]   The awesome power of digital broadcasting, television, phone,
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.360]   internet service, in one combined package.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.860]   Right.
[00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:47.360]   Right.
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.360]   Right.
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.360]   Right.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.860]   In Fios.
[00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:49.360]   Did you do that?
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.360]   Did you get everything?
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.880]   You got the whole thing?
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.560]   Actually, I had the longest and the most frustrating, like,
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.240]   basil-faulty type of conversation with the service,
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.560]   saying, well, I don't want the phone service.
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.640]   Well, we have a variety of packages.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.680]   No, I've not had a landline in two years.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.800]   I don't want the phone service.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.360]   So you're saying that you don't want voicemail?
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.760]   Say, I don't want a phone to ring in my house ever
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.920]   for any reason.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.200]   I have had an account with Verizon on my last remaining
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.700]   landline.
[00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.160]   And the only purpose of that landline
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.240]   is so that when PR people using a 10-year-old database
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.240]   try to call that line, they get a message saying,
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.480]   don't leave me a message.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.160]   Google, for my name, send me an email.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.760]   If you're a robot, forget you even heard this.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.280]   As it turns out, though, it would actually
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.840]   have cost me more money to buy cable and internet access
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.640]   separately than to get the package that includes phone
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.880]   service.
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.800]   And I kid you not.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.640]   Obviously, I don't even know what my phone number is here
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.760]   at this house.
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.840]   So I've not given it out to anybody.
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.640]   But the guy had everything hooked up, had everything installed,
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.840]   and not 45 minutes after the system went live,
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.640]   I started getting junk phone calls through whatever two
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.120]   phones were still plugged into the kitchen here
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.040]   in the house.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.080]   I got someone who told me that the warranty on my car
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.240]   was about to expire.
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.080]   Another person who says, I see that you have over $6,000
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.120]   worth of credit card debt.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.280]   We can refinance you.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.720]   Oh, man.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.920]   It was almost like one of those movies
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.520]   where a slightly insane guy is trying to hunt down
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.200]   and kill the three adorable little rats that are inside the house.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.080]   It was like, there's another--
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.800]   Phone ringing somewhere.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.120]   There must be another phone I haven't found yet.
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.360]   Why do you--
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.360]   So you literally have no phone?
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.720]   I have an empty phone, Jax, in the house.
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.560]   But you don't--
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.800]   You've not-- in your life, you don't have phones?
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.560]   Like you don't-- you have a cell phone.
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.040]   I just-- I have the cell phone.
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.880]   I really have no need for a landline anymore.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.040]   I actually try really hard to train people not to call me.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.200]   Yeah, I agree with that.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.720]   Yeah.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.520]   Well, chiefly because, again, it's such a big problem
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.960]   with PR people that you're in these databases
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.600]   and they just don't understand that I have these things called
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.640]   deadlines.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.840]   And I know you're really, really proud of your special turn
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.940]   key software that allows any manager of what
[00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.840]   a can open bowling alley in the New England area to operate
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.440]   and run your own concession stand off of a Mac OS or Windows XP.
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.920]   You know what?
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.640]   Number one, not really the sort of thing
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.960]   I'm interested in running out about.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.480]   Number two, I'm busy.
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.040]   Leave me alone.
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.640]   Email me.
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.440]   You're supposed to be a tech PR firm.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.840]   You should understand the concept of email.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.360]   Did we hit a button with an--
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.360]   I really couldn't--
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.520]   I was just amazed that, again, the flip--
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.360]   the one-- that big lever switch, that big Frankenstein
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.520]   level, I don't have one here, but metaphorically,
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.280]   the big lever switch that activates all the services
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.800]   in the house.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.680]   And 45 minutes later, junk from junk,
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.000]   you have a phone call, started hitting me.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.080]   And I'm like, oh, for heaven.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.520]   It's pretty amazing, isn't it?
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.280]   Or I threw all that away.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.000]   So how much did you save, like a buck?
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.120]   It actually would have cost me something like $33, $35 more
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.800]   per month.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.800]   How do I bought--
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.800]   Because as a package--
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.440]   Did you get the TV service?
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.040]   I got the PVR.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.240]   I got a second unit for that room.
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.800]   I got 10 megabits down, two up.
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.720]   Is that all?
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.040]   I thought Verizon--
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.880]   if I had more than 10, too.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:25.960]   They have another option.
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.360]   They basically, I complained a little bit
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.800]   about how difficult it was for me to get things set up.
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.320]   And they upgrade me for free from 5, 2 to 10, 2.
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.800]   But it's pretty big.
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.560]   I mean, it's plenty.
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.560]   I'm not saying anything.
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.000]   In fact, this sounds great.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.640]   I mean, the only reason why--
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:46.280]   last week, I was using, believe it or not, a regular USB
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.680]   Sprint modem.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.800]   And that gives you the equivalent of bad cable modem, which
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.960]   is still plenty good for podcasting live.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.560]   I mean, I could get a T1.
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.080]   I could get all these really slick interfaces.
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.160]   But sometimes you just have to--
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.880]   it's like these people who watch Top Gear.
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.320]   And they decide, oh, you know what?
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.280]   If I hit the lottery, I would definitely
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.560]   buy Bugatti Veyron.
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.840]   Because it's exactly sort of high performance vehicle.
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:11.480]   You know what?
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.920]   It's a great high performance vehicle
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.000]   that you will drive 43 miles to stop and shop to get milk
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.640]   and back again.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:22.200]   I don't think I would use a full broadband pipe that would
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.960]   cost me $200, $300.
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.600]   Now, Scott Borne, who is also joining us,
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.920]   is back for the summer at Gig Haba.
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:29.880]   Gig Haba.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.240]   You say Gig Haba?
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.120]   Gig Haba, well, we pretend we're in Maine,
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.680]   but we're actually on the other side of the country.
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.920]   But it makes us feel better.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.040]   And you put in a T1 for this.
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.920]   I did.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.320]   I'm so tired of being screwed around by Skype.
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.880]   I mean, you know, a couple--
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.840]   you know, everybody knows that I moved
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.920]   and I got a couple of medical things out of the way.
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.680]   So there was a couple of times I couldn't be on the show.
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.240]   But the times I was ready to be on the show literally.
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.400]   Five seconds before I'm ready to get the Skype open,
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.160]   everything just craps out.
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.680]   Yeah, last week.
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.240]   Last week. So I just-- you know what?
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.720]   I was like, OK, that's it.
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.640]   T1, if that doesn't work, T3, if that doesn't work OC92,
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.280]   if that doesn't work, Massa.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.800]   Well, T1's sounding great.
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.640]   I'm glad.
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.400]   And I've really missed not being on the show with you.
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.360]   Well, we missed you.
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.760]   I'm so glad you're back.
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.200]   I have to be-- there has to be somebody for the audience
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:16.720]   to hate.
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.480]   That's my job.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.320]   I think they hate us all at this point.
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.720]   Let's say hi to-- now Alex can't be here.
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.760]   He's in the Netherlands.
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:25.880]   Unless he shows up.
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.680]   He thought he might, his triple X hotel.
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.680]   But we're not sure yet.
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.200]   We should clarify that, Leo.
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.560]   Well, should we really--
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.680]   He says he's having a sandwich of some sort,
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.360]   but I don't know what that means.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.560]   And it's a lonely sandwich.
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.960]   It's a three-star hotel.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.560]   It's three X's on the flag.
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.200]   Oh, they don't do stars.
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:43.840]   They do X's.
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.960]   All right, well, in Amsterdam, you don't know.
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.120]   Well, there are special places you can go.
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:48.720]   But we won't get into that.
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.960]   We won't get into that.
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.320]   But let's welcome somebody brand new to the Macbak weekly
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:57.000]   table and a guy who I'm a big fan of from the UK.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:57.720]   And it's amazing.
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:58.640]   Listen how good this sounds.
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:02.120]   Don McAllister of ScreenCasts Online, just listen how good
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.360]   this sounds from the UK.
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.240]   Hi, Scott.
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.520]   Hi, Don.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.400]   Hello there, Leo.
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.280]   Hi, how are you doing?
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:14.240]   Now, the amazing thing is Scott is on a T1, Andy is on a file.
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.000]   And you're in a dial-up modem, and it sounds so good.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:17.880]   It's not that bad.
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:18.400]   No, no, come on.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.320]   We do have broadband over here as well.
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:24.760]   I don't want a very cheap USB headset, so I'm quite glad
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:25.680]   that it sounds quite good.
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.880]   But yeah, we've got a decent line here.
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:28.800]   I think it's funny.
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.000]   We often get better connections internationally
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   than we do in the US on Skype.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:33.520]   Well, it was funny.
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.080]   I was doing a podcast yesterday with the Macjory.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.160]   And everyone else except for me was in the US.
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.040]   We were having horrendous Skype problems.
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:43.360]   So in the end, what we had to do is disconnect everybody.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.000]   And then I just reconnected everybody over here.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:46.760]   And it was fine.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.640]   We did have a few issues, but certainly not as much as we did
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:50.880]   when it was hosted in the US.
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:51.480]   Very strange.
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.120]   I'm sure most people know who Don is,
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:57.480]   but he does the most amazing ScreenCasts, screencastsonline.com
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:01.280]   for Macintosh people that really help you figure out how to use it.
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.960]   And we actually talked about you last week
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.600]   because you've got a very sensible model.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.960]   You give away some.
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.800]   And then if people want more, they can subscribe.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.400]   And you've actually been able to make a living doing that,
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.520]   which is really remarkable.
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.280]   Yeah, I've been doing it for, we've got it on for three years now.
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.200]   It eventually started off as a hobby podcast
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.400]   and sort of giving all the content away for free.
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.200]   And then about two and a half years ago,
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.680]   I sort of split it to both free content, but also premium content
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.080]   so that I've sort of built up a membership.
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.080]   And members to ScreenCastsonline sort of get
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.640]   high definition content and extra content as well.
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:34.080]   So sort of every other week is a free show.
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.320]   And the intervening weeks, they get the members only content.
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.040]   And yeah, it's worked out really, really well.
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.000]   I'm really so happy that I've sort of been able to carry on doing
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.440]   what I really enjoyed doing and make a living from it as well.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.320]   So it's been brilliant.
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.120]   So you're in England?
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:48.880]   Yes, yes.
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:49.720]   Where about Liverpool?
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.280]   Liverpool.
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.240]   Wow, that's cool.
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.520]   That's where the balance of the front is.
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.440]   Yeah, here we go.
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.400]   Here we go.
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.480]   How come you don't talk like that?
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:02.280]   I was related to the woman that you call for your Skype test call.
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.800]   No, I don't know where she's from.
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.000]   She's just got it.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.160]   Let the records show that I'm going to be the one person,
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.760]   the one American in this conference that will not attempt to do a UK accent.
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.040]   That's because you do such a good Russian one.
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.320]   God bless you, Andy.
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:16.320]   P.V.
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.120]   I knew that would happen.
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.760]   I was reading P.G. Woodhouse.
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.760]   He had this wonderful line about that really odd--
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:26.560]   the odd expression of combination of shame and inevitability
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.160]   that it crosses an Englishman's face whenever he's about to speak French
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.280]   to a Frenchman.
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.800]   And that really made up everything that happens
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.400]   that every time that an American tries to do a British accent,
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:39.160]   unless you're drunk and Dick Van Dyke and on the movies.
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.280]   That wasn't English.
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:45.520]   We don't know what that was an alien accent.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.280]   That was a Bailey's accent, actually.
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.360]   Murray, a movie opens.
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.600]   So are you from Liverpool originally and on?
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.240]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:54.800]   Bono, Brad.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:55.160]   Yeah.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.040]   We're very proud of our Liverpool heritage with the Beatles
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.560]   and all the things of that.
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.280]   No, so we've got a big year this year.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.680]   We're the capital of culture, the European capital of culture,
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:04.680]   this year 2008.
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:08.480]   So there's lots of events, lots of rejuvenation of the city
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:09.000]   as well.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.200]   There's been big investments in the city to rebuild the center.
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.240]   So there's lots going on.
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.800]   So yeah, it's a good place to be at the moment.
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.680]   Is it still a great shipyard capital?
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:18.840]   Many ships were built there.
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:19.680]   I know.
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.640]   I sail on quite a few, actually.
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:22.160]   That's right.
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.200]   It used to be a major port, especially for the Americas.
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:30.240]   I mean, going right the way back to the 17, 1800s.
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.920]   We don't actually build-- the building
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:34.160]   used to be on the opposite side of the Mersey, Birkenhead,
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:34.960]   and Wallissey.
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:38.680]   So I think most of the shipyards have actually closed down.
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:41.720]   But again, we're starting to get more--
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.600]   the port in itself is a big trade port.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.560]   So there's a free port down in Liverpool.
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.760]   So we get lots of trade coming in.
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.960]   But also, I think they're looking to regenerate
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.160]   the cruise ship side of things.
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.000]   So we've had a big cruise ship.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.240]   Quite a few big cruise ships come in.
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:58.360]   And also the building a new cruise port as well,
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.720]   I think, down there in Liverpool.
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.640]   So lots of things happening.
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:02.920]   Well, so good to have you.
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:03.840]   We really appreciate it.
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:07.680]   And I hope you'll make a regular stop on your tour of podcasts.
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:08.160]   Yeah.
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.840]   I'm certainly very honored to be invited.
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:10.680]   So thank you very much.
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:13.160]   We should start with Kevin Rose's story.
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:17.680]   Kevin was on the twit and sent me a top secret internal document
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:21.560]   from Apple, which I have since burned, destroyed, eradicated,
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.240]   shredded, and in every way gotten rid of.
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:26.280]   So please don't come confiscate my hardware.
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.280]   But that had-- by the way, he said it to me
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:31.560]   to kind of give me a sense of the authenticity of it.
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.560]   He said he gets a lot of information.
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.320]   Because he runs dig.
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.960]   People just send him stuff, rumors and stuff.
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.120]   It's not from people he knows.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.120]   It's not inside sources that he's maintained.
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.280]   It's just he gets his stuff in over the transom.
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.480]   And this was clearly, I would say, if it's a fake,
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:48.640]   it's a very good fake showing the new nanos.
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.800]   And it gave me some confidence that that picture, that fuzzy
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:56.600]   picture that is on KevinRose.com is actually an accurate picture.
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.240]   What do you think, guys?
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.840]   Have you seen it?
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:03.400]   I've seen it as usual, I'll believe it,
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.480]   when Steve was actually holding something up
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.040]   and people are plotting raptures.
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:12.960]   He says September 9th, you can expect it to be announced by Apple.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.840]   It looks like a regular nano with an extruded--
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.560]   it's a little-- first of all, it's a little more rounded,
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.880]   like much of the new stuff.
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.040]   And then an extruded larger screen.
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.640]   It really does look like the sort of thing that if you were
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:27.560]   at after your first week in a CGI modeling class--
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:28.600]   Yes.
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.760]   We just-- oh, no, I'll draw a flat and oval.
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.680]   And then I just simply extend that to a length.
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.480]   And then I just simply apply this texture,
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.800]   of this drawing of a nano to it.
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.760]   I mean, I don't know how that's going to be too--
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.640]   let's just use this as an exercise of just evaluating
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.080]   a prospective design.
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:47.200]   I'm not sure how much joy there's
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.680]   going to be in operating that thing.
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.280]   I remember when I first saw the new nano.
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:54.280]   Remember, we thought, oh, that can't be what it's going to look like.
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:54.640]   Yeah.
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:55.040]   I wonder if--
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:55.960]   You mean the fat nano?
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:56.560]   Yeah, the fat nano.
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:57.560]   Yeah.
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:58.720]   Well, you know, here's the thing.
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.480]   Do we really need another nano?
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:01.920]   With a bigger screen, yeah.
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.040]   I think this would be great for watching videos.
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:04.840]   Well, they got one.
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:05.920]   It's called the--
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:06.680]   You know, it's the--
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:07.160]   The touch.
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:07.680]   --touch.
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.600]   But this is somewhere between a classic.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.040]   It's bigger than the classic.
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.480]   It looks bigger anyway than the classic.
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:13.560]   I can't say for sure.
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.560]   But somewhere between the classic and the touch.
[00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:16.560]   What do you think?
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:21.160]   If the nano is bigger, then will the classic be bigger still?
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.520]   Well, it's classic, right?
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:25.080]   You can't change the classic.
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.520]   The problem I had with the nano, the proposed nano,
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:33.600]   or this allegedly fake nano, is the screen itself.
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.600]   It's rounded.
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:38.320]   So I don't know what the issue would be with blur and reflections.
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:41.200]   I mean, normally they do have a flat, smooth surface
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.640]   so that the glass virtually disappears.
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:44.440]   But it's straight away.
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:47.280]   The first thing that hit me was it's rounded.
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.880]   And you can see, even in the picture,
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.720]   the glare from the fluorescent lights a bit.
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:51.560]   Yeah, quite ugly.
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.520]   So that seems a bit weird.
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:55.320]   And also, you'd have to have it horizontal.
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:58.320]   You'd have to watch it for four, be three, or 16 by nine.
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.800]   You'd need to hold it horizontally,
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:03.320]   in which case all the controls are on a side angle.
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:07.480]   So it doesn't really-- although I was the same with the fat nano,
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:08.560]   I didn't think they were real.
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:09.120]   Me too.
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:09.600]   Me too.
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:10.320]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.920]   They just didn't look it.
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.440]   But when you see the fat nano and you hold it,
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:14.480]   you understand it.
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.520]   It might be the same for this.
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:18.920]   But that curve screen worries me slightly.
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:19.400]   Go ahead.
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.160]   I will say that it does make sense to me
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.200]   to have-- for those of you who aren't seeing the picture right now,
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:28.160]   it looks like a wide screen aspect ratio screen.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.280]   If you were holding it vertically,
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.880]   you would notice that there is about a third extra length
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:36.160]   in the length of the lists that will be in the menus.
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.840]   Holding it horizontally, you have basic HD aspect ratio.
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.120]   It looks like the sort of thing where, naturally, you're holding it
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.120]   in one hand.
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:46.360]   And the part of the nano that's being covered up by your hand
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.440]   is not part of the screen itself.
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:52.040]   You get to see this whole entire screen in front of you.
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.880]   If you're a lefty, it's good for a lefty.
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:55.320]   Well, that's what's going to say.
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.320]   I'd hope that they have some software that simply lets you
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.080]   decide whether you're holding it left or right.
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.520]   Maybe smart enough to know that it's being flipped one way
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:02.680]   or another.
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:06.000]   But yeah, I mean, I absolutely agree that, I mean,
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.680]   if this is an accurate show, I mean,
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.760]   if you're curving the screen like that,
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.280]   you are going to have glare problems.
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.080]   I don't know whether this-- it's hard to tell from the picture
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:16.880]   whether-- do you know whether that is a photograph or a CGI
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:17.360]   render?
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:20.520]   I'll tell you what I saw without giving away.
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:24.280]   I don't want to damage Kevin's sources in any way.
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:27.280]   So he sent me the document that this was part of.
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.680]   It was actually--
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:30.200]   I don't know.
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.360]   It was a very-- it could easily be.
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:33.760]   It was a longer document.
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.440]   It could easily have been faked the entire thing.
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:38.440]   But if it was, somebody put a lot of effort
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.920]   into making a very credible fake.
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.000]   And this is a picture.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.520]   It's a photograph.
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:49.080]   There were other photographs of the device in this document.
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.120]   And it's not a marketing document,
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.760]   which is one of the reasons it kind of
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:53.800]   had some more credibility.
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.760]   I mean, I've seen a lot of faked marketing documents.
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.400]   I don't even use the right fonts and so forth.
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:01.440]   But this was not a marketing document.
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.840]   So I'm going to give it some credibility just because--
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.560]   well, if it's a fake, it's a very good fake.
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:06.880]   Let's put it that way.
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.360]   And yeah, this is not a CGI.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.880]   This is a photograph.
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:12.960]   Blurry, admittedly.
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:16.600]   If you had more context, I think you'd probably agree with me.
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:19.200]   That looks pretty real.
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.280]   Yeah, the curve is an odd thing, although most of Apple's
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:22.680]   designs now have that curve, don't they?
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.600]   I mean, this is the air design.
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:26.640]   I saw another rumor with a clearly
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:30.720]   photoshopped marketing picture of a redesigned Mac
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:34.080]   Pro with kind of that air curvy look.
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:36.240]   It's funny how all these fake photos,
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:38.880]   or allegedly fake photos, are always blurry.
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:41.120]   We've got so many good cameras around these days.
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.520]   And even on the camera--
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:43.880]   if you get good light with an iPhone,
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:46.360]   it's so easy to say quite a sharp picture.
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:47.680]   But they're always blurry.
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:48.920]   Why come I have a nice show?
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:52.160]   I need the kind of free time these people have to make these.
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.400]   I mean, I'm so envious.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.560]   I just want to have that kind of free time.
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:59.360]   And I certainly wouldn't spend it making fake nano pictures.
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:03.040]   Other rumors, Kevin's passing along iPod price drop,
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:07.320]   iPod touch price drop, which makes sense with a $199 iPhone.
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:08.200]   The touch at what is it?
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:11.520]   $500 and $600 is a little pricey looking.
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.520]   And that might explain, because Apple did say
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.120]   you were going to have new announcements end
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:17.440]   of September, new product line.
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.640]   And it was a warning.
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.680]   It was saying, but they may not be as profitable,
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.920]   I guess it was the essential warning than the analysts call.
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:28.280]   And that would make sense if they drop the prices of these.
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:28.800]   And I think--
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.040]   I think we have to reduce the margins.
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:31.080]   Yeah, margins lower.
[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:31.560]   Yeah.
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.880]   I think they're going to be reducing the margins
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:37.080]   on the laptop line as well to try to get more competitive.
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.320]   Oh, that would be wonderful.
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:42.320]   Do you think they'll be a new MacBook line or an update
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.720]   on the MacBooks?
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.560]   In my opinion, we almost certainly
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:48.440]   will either see an update to the MacBook, the MacBook Pro,
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:49.680]   or the Air.
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.480]   And I keep hearing a lot about the Air.
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:54.280]   It's probably just a processor upgrade.
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:57.200]   But my Air doesn't ever need to get faster,
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.760]   because I only use it for email and web surfing.
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:01.960]   So I don't care about that.
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:05.440]   But I do think the MacBook Pro could really use a little touch
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:05.800]   up.
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.360]   An Air running pen written, I guess, would be the next--
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:11.360]   Yeah, I mean, it's slower than a MacBook.
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:14.920]   So realistically, I think that that would be a good place
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:15.840]   to start.
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.680]   They've dropped the price considerably.
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:18.560]   I'm going to make a prediction.
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:19.480]   A price drop, yes.
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.760]   But I don't think you'll see the new MacBooks,
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:24.320]   because I think judging from what we've
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:27.600]   learned from Intel at the Intel Developers Forum last week,
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.480]   the really interesting mobile parts
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:31.800]   are coming out early next year.
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.080]   So I predict it's a Macworld Expo announcement
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.720]   for the updated MacBooks with this new Nehalim processor.
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:40.160]   And I don't think you'll see an update as soon as September.
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.400]   But I do think you'll see the--
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.960]   it's pretty clear you'll see new iPods.
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.120]   If for no other reason that I bought an iPod classic
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:47.800]   two days ago.
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.240]   How much was that, Leo?
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:51.520]   $249, 480 gigs.
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:51.880]   Really?
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:53.040]   I mean, that's really--
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:56.400]   and I have to say, the new software in the classic--
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.920]   it's the first time I've really played with it,
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:00.520]   with cover flow and the way the menu goes over the cover
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:01.360]   and all that.
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:02.560]   It's just really nicely done.
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:04.600]   It's a nice product.
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:08.480]   It's pretty amazing where the pricing has gone on iPods
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.200]   and performance if you take the history all way back
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.040]   to the first one.
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:15.600]   $249 for 80 gigs.
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:18.000]   What's the $180-- what's the $160?
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:18.440]   I don't know.
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.360]   Maybe $100 more.
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.400]   I mean, that's pretty much the way they do it.
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.400]   So these things are cheaper than a touch?
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.000]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.520]   The touch really seems out of touch right now.
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.160]   Yeah.
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.640]   Also, iPod Touch 2.1 software.
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:33.000]   iPhone to get the update very soon after.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.080]   Maybe cut and paste.
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:36.080]   I would love to see that.
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:38.160]   That's kind of an interesting example
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.520]   of how subtle marketing is.
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:43.920]   If they stopped marketing the iPod Touch as an iPod
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:47.000]   and started marketing it as the Apple PDA
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.120]   and dropped the price a little bit,
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.560]   that would be a hell of a product.
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:50.920]   I keep telling people--
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:52.760]   there are a lot of people that believe it or not
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.280]   are very, very happy with their existing cell phones.
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.280]   They're not interested in getting a new phone,
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:00.840]   but they want to have those iPhone games.
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.200]   They want to have a lot of these new apps.
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.800]   And it's a hell of a Wi-Fi device
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.400]   for the amount of money you're spending.
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.080]   No, I think that I love the touch.
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.880]   In fact, absolutely.
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:10.800]   It kind of gives you a reason.
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.440]   Maybe Apple doesn't like this, but it kind of gives you
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:15.960]   a reason to say, hm, I'll keep my phone and go with the touch.
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.960]   I mean, really, they've done a nice job with it.
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.320]   Apple just sent us halfway.
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.080]   Just send us $5 in an envelope every month.
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.080]   Just a few.
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.680]   Can't check a drink.
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:28.280]   Yeah, the apps are what's so compelling about the iPhone,
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.120]   really.
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:30.080]   Are you an iPhone, Donna?
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:30.840]   Are you an iPhone user?
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.440]   I know it's a little different in the UK.
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.560]   No, yeah, I'm definitely an iPhone user.
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:38.400]   I stood in line for the 3G when it came out.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.560]   So I've actually got a collection above the iPhones,
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:44.920]   because I was over at the last new media expo last year
[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:46.160]   and picked up one in the US.
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.840]   And then I got the first gen when it came out in the UK,
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:49.480]   as well.
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:52.840]   One for use for my screencasts and one is my proper phone.
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.440]   And then I've got the 3G as well.
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:58.120]   So, yeah, we're pretty well sorted now over here
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:00.240]   with the iPhone, especially with having 3G.
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.440]   Well, I was going to ask, because people were complaining,
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.560]   especially, I think, in the UK about the 3G reception.
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:07.840]   Has it been OK for you?
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:11.040]   Well, personally, I've had a problem in that--
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:14.680]   because I'm sort of based at home, I have a home studio--
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:18.240]   the coverage maps that '02, '02 is our carrier over here,
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:22.080]   for 3G, give blanket coverage over the whole of my neighborhood.
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:22.600]   Yeah.
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:23.240]   Solid.
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.560]   Wow, fantastic.
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:27.200]   No way can I pick up a 3G signal, even if I go and stand
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.800]   outside in the garden.
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:29.720]   Edge is about the best.
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:33.080]   If I go outside indoors, I just get one or two bars.
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:34.800]   And even when I pull them up about it,
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.320]   they were very--
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:39.320]   well, the map isn't exactly 100% accurate.
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.960]   And depending on which direction the nearest cell transmitter
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.880]   is, and, oh, dear.
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:45.760]   But that's just not my personal location.
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:48.080]   Everywhere else I've been, in major cities in that,
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.960]   the 3G has been fine, not a big issue for us at all.
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:53.040]   And it was one of the main barriers that stopped people,
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:54.400]   I think, with the original first gen phone,
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:57.680]   because we've been so used to having 3G on phones.
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.480]   Quite a few people had to phone to, said,
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:00.880]   I'd love to get an iPhone, but I'm
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.840]   going to wait until they bring out a 3G one.
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:04.560]   So I think that was a big driver for people
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:06.560]   when the 3G phone came out.
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:13.920]   And so '02 is the carrier?
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.720]   Yeah, we have '02.
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:19.840]   They're the data carrier, and we have various different telecoms
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.720]   that actually sell the phone.
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:23.520]   Because we can get it from Apple, we can get it from '02,
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:26.120]   we can get it from the carphone warehouse.
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:28.320]   And they've just announced, actually, that we couldn't get
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.000]   the white one.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.640]   You could only get the white one from the Apple stores.
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.440]   But now they've started to filter through to the retail
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.560]   chains in '02 and carphone warehouse.
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:41.040]   So there's not that many white ones around,
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.480]   at least I have not seen many.
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.320]   Well, it had to happen.
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:46.920]   There is already actually the first lawsuit
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:49.880]   against Apple over 3G claims.
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:53.880]   An Alabama woman has established a class action lawsuit
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:58.120]   against Apple for saying it offers 3G connectivity,
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:01.040]   even though she's getting edge most of the time in Alabama,
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:05.520]   AT&T has good coverage, she says.
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:07.880]   So the problem is with covering with these lawsuits.
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.640]   I almost don't like to mention these lawsuits,
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:13.280]   because any company is going to get a bunch of these.
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:17.560]   And Apple's note is not immune for these lawsuits.
[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:20.080]   Well, anybody can sue anybody for anything.
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:22.240]   It doesn't mean they have a case.
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:23.920]   And in this case, she may have a case.
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.280]   Nobody knows.
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:28.040]   The key here is that if you read the details,
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:30.440]   the attorney is trying to get this class certified.
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:33.640]   And obviously, the attorneys are interested in the big settlements,
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:36.560]   because in most class actions, the only person to get paid
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:37.720]   is the attorney.
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:40.000]   And you get some kind of coupon that
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.680]   says if you stand on your left foot on Thursday,
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:45.240]   rub your head on Friday and jump through these five hoops.
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:47.280]   We'll give you 18 cents back.
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:49.760]   You know.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.680]   Magi, there was a report out recently.
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.680]   It wasn't from the guys over in Sweden
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:57.520]   who tested the 3G iPhone against the 3G phones.
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:58.440]   And it came out fine.
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.400]   I know there's been lots of speculation
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.520]   between whether or not it's the phone that's causing bad 3G
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.160]   reception or whether or not it's the actual data
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.560]   carriers themselves.
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:11.280]   And they did a test between the 3G with Sony Ericsson P1.
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.680]   And Nokia, I think it was then '73.
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:17.320]   And I found out that the Sony Ericsson was slightly better
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:18.600]   receiving signals.
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:22.000]   But really speaking between them, there wasn't that much
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:22.640]   difference really.
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.640]   So they said that the phone wasn't a problem.
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:26.280]   Interesting.
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:28.480]   Yeah, there were some people blaming the Infineon chipset
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:31.000]   on the iPhone for the bad 3G reception.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.800]   Although Jobs has said that it's a firmware upgrade
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.520]   that they can make, and they will be making it possibly
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:41.040]   even in the 2.1 software.
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.080]   Customers want to know who is Apple.
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:46.520]   This is a very complicated world.
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:47.880]   I'm channeling Steve Jobs there.
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.080]   Apologies.
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:52.080]   That kind of scared me.
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:53.800]   All of a sudden, Steve's on the call.
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:55.280]   Hi, Steve.
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:57.160]   It's like, when did we invite Steve to the cast?
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.520]   Hi, Steve.
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.680]   And is this really a good idea?
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:03.360]   Because you probably see us.
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.880]   Steve Jobs will join us in just a moment.
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:08.400]   But first, I want to talk about Drobo.
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.680]   We've got a new offer from Drobo.
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:13.200]   Drobo now has two models.
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:16.160]   They've got the original Drobo, USB Drobo at a new lower price.
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:20.720]   And this new second generation Drobo with FireWire 800
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.520]   and USB 2.0.
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:25.200]   Faster speeds, quieter and cooler operation.
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:28.440]   Drobo just gets better and better.
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:32.960]   Now, you get $25 off either Drobo right now by going to--
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:33.960]   and this is good, by the way.
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:35.000]   And I want to emphasize this.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.680]   October 31, 2008 is the end date.
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.560]   But I forgot, the last time we talked about this,
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:43.120]   that people sometimes listen to these shows many months later.
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.640]   So I've really got it.
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.960]   If you're listening now-- and the deal
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.480]   is through October-- through Halloween.
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:49.000]   How about that?
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:55.720]   Through October 31, 2008, go to Drobo, drobio.com/macbreak.
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:59.080]   I think everybody on the normal Macbreak panel
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.120]   is a Drobo user to use the Drobo.
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.200]   Don McAllister?
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:04.440]   No, I have--
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.360]   I've gone with a rate solution because obviously I'm a video guy.
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:11.320]   So I need a little bit bigger and a little bit faster
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:12.320]   for some of my video needs.
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.440]   So I've gone with a SATA RAID array.
[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.040]   But I've had good reports about the Drobo.
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:16.640]   Oh, that's fantastic.
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:19.480]   In general, I would say Drobo, people mostly use Drobo.
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.680]   Not as a backup disc, not as a live disc.
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:22.680]   And it's mostly for the speed.
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:24.680]   But it's like RAID in the sense that you can--
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:25.800]   it's actually better than RAID.
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:26.360]   You could put in--
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:27.000]   It's better, yeah.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.680]   Yeah, you could put it up to four drives.
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:30.560]   And you can mix and match.
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:33.720]   Normally, with RAID 5, the lowest common denominator,
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:36.360]   the smallest drive is the kind of the multiplier.
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:39.000]   So if you put in four drives and there's one of them is 160,
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.120]   it's like 4160s, even if there's 200s or 300s in there.
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:43.000]   Drobo doesn't do that.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.360]   Drobo adds them all up to get you the total amount
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:46.520]   of space available.
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:48.320]   Because it's redundant, you lose one drive.
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:49.000]   No problem.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:49.720]   Pop it out.
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:50.560]   Pop in a new one.
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:52.720]   You don't even have to shut the Drobo down.
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:55.200]   So it's redundant against hard drive failures.
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:56.760]   And up to 16 terabytes.
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:58.240]   These drives now, drives aren't that big yet.
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:01.120]   But I guess this might just be a 1.5 terabyte drive.
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:02.480]   Can I do a Drobo tip?
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:03.960]   Yeah.
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:07.240]   When you get Drobo open, you get the Drobo dashboard,
[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:08.440]   which you don't need.
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:10.400]   You don't need that to format the drive.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:11.920]   You can format it from the OS.
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:16.000]   But my recommendation is format it from the Drobo dashboard
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.920]   and format it for 16 terabytes, no matter how much you put in it.
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:24.640]   Because that way, when the new drives do become available,
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:26.640]   you'll be able to pop them in and recognize them.
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.840]   And you won't have to copy off all your old data.
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:30.240]   Oh, that's a good tip.
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:30.880]   Thank you.
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:32.440]   There's a Drobo user, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:35.720]   You can be $2.25 off either the original Drobo
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:40.520]   or the new second generation when you visit Drobo.com/Macbrake.
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:42.560]   We love Drobo.
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:43.560]   We're feeling droopy.
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:45.480]   Feeling droopy.
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.960]   So Steve, are you there still?
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:50.400]   You have anything to say?
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:51.360]   No, he must have--
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:53.080]   Free noisy world.
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:56.120]   Yeah, thank you, Steve.
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:57.160]   Thank you very much.
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:57.960]   I don't know.
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:59.120]   It's just random Steve.
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:00.800]   I don't know.
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:05.240]   And we're not going to get a chance to get people to remember
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:06.440]   much about us.
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:09.800]   Well, I don't know about that.
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:10.960]   I think we'll remember Steve.
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:14.200]   We should do an entire show where we have a fake conversation,
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:16.040]   the real Steve.
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:17.040]   Not the fake Steve.
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:18.640]   What about--
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.760]   Isn't making boxes.
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:23.360]   Just remember that, OK?
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.160]   I remember that speech.
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.120]   I'm not having a lot of difficulty
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:30.120]   imagining that that's actually Tom Cruise.
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:32.240]   If you look at the video, it does.
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:36.120]   Leo, Leo, we're not in the job of making boxes.
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:37.280]   People, you're glib.
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:37.800]   You're glib.
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:40.320]   Although we do that well.
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:44.800]   We do that better than almost anybody, in some cases.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:47.160]   In some cases.
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:48.880]   Your mileage may vary.
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:52.880]   I think we should hire Tom Cruise to play Steve Jobs on a podcast
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:54.520]   where we fake interviewing.
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:56.920]   I have to say, there is a similarity.
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:59.280]   And after seeing Tom Cruise's amazing performance
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:03.240]   in Tropic Thunder, where you wouldn't know it's Tom Cruise,
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:06.920]   I think he probably could do Steve Jobs pretty darn well.
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:12.960]   Maybe that's the big bio pick that's yet to be done, huh?
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:15.800]   It would be the best Mac break weekly ever.
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:16.800]   We're not--
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:18.680]   I meant for 20 bucks.
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:19.840]   I don't know what price is.
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:20.720]   I've been for 20.
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:21.960]   Well, if you all put in 20--
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:23.440]   It's a producer and you not a go.
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:26.040]   If you all put in 20, I can offer a Steve--
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:26.400]   what would it be?
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:27.480]   That'd be 100 bucks.
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:31.160]   You believe that people with passion
[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:33.040]   can change the world for the better.
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:33.760]   Thank you, Steve.
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:35.040]   I think that's true.
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:37.840]   Now, he's normally laid back, but he's really laid back there.
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:40.240]   This is like-- I don't know what this video is from,
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.680]   but yeah, it's like it's a different Steve.
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:44.600]   It's a slow Steve.
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:47.880]   And we're not going to get a chance
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:51.440]   to get people to remember much about us.
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:54.280]   No company is.
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:57.120]   And so we have to be really clear on what we want him
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.040]   to know about us.
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:30:59.240]   You know what it is?
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.440]   It's unrehearsed.
[00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:00.840]   He's actually--
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:04.120]   Now go out there and sell those water filters.
[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:06.160]   Developers, developers, developers.
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:08.000]   Only one of you is going to waste that--
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.080]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:11.320]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:15.440]   Is there somebody at Apple like the equivalent of Steve
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:17.720]   Bomber, who's really like the sales motivation guys?
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:19.120]   Is there somebody at Apple like that?
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:20.640]   Or do they not have to worry about that?
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:22.920]   Well, there's that old saying that if you don't know who
[00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:25.320]   in your organization is the Steve Bomber, you're him.
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.640]   That was in the movie "Rounders," I think.
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:30.400]   I saw that.
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:34.560]   I don't think Steve Bomber could survive under Steve Jobs,
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:36.080]   if you know what I mean.
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:36.600]   Yeah, no.
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:37.680]   Wouldn't that be a clash?
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.360]   That'd be an interesting clash to have the truth.
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:42.480]   Jewelers, definitely not that guy.
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:45.280]   I mean, he doesn't have that personality.
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.360]   How about Tim Cook?
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:49.480]   He's an ops guy, isn't he?
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:52.000]   He's a bookworm.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.240]   He's a bookworm personality.
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:59.800]   He's not-- I mean, I don't think Steve Jobs would let anybody
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:04.440]   be that aggressive other than him, because it might mess with his mojo.
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:05.880]   That's sort of what I was saying.
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:08.600]   I mean, there's not going to be another Steve Jobs at Apple,
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:09.960]   because that role is taken.
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:12.720]   And if you try to challenge--
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:15.640]   I think I get the impression that if you try to challenge Steve
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:21.080]   as another major personality at Apple, he's just going to crush you.
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:26.240]   I mean, there's a reason why the biggest design genius
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:28.800]   in this entire planet, who has designed
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:32.080]   some of the most fascinating, compelling, and influential devices
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:35.000]   ever marketed, very few people know what his name is.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.160]   Almost nobody knows what he looks like,
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:41.520]   and it's almost impossible to find an eye of interview.
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:46.560]   And I think that's because maybe even it's a legacy of keeping
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:48.440]   a low profile to ensure survivability.
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:51.720]   I've tried very hard for years to get an interview with him,
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:53.120]   and no success.
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:55.520]   I was very affable, nice guy.
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:59.360]   But they'll never offer him for an interview.
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:01.640]   Perhaps I should try with being from the UK as well, so--
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:03.600]   Yeah, I was a brit.
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:04.920]   You might have some success.
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.320]   You have sophisticated accent.
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:08.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:10.800]   The thing is with Apple, though, is it--
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:14.360]   and it irritates me some way in that there's so much importance put on Steve,
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:18.360]   in that obviously, yes, he is the linchpin and the figurehead.
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:22.480]   And there's so much worry about the share price, if he's there, or if he's not there.
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:26.680]   But the team behind him must be a phenomenal team to have executed
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:27.240]   what they've done.
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:29.520]   OK, perhaps not the last two months, say.
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:32.240]   But the products that they've brought to the table,
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:35.000]   and the way they've delivered things,
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.400]   must be a really fantastic team behind Steve Jobs.
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.320]   And it's only recently--
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:45.240]   It's only recently we've really been able to even get some of the names of the people out,
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:49.120]   and never mind really understand their personality or understand where they're coming from,
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:52.520]   or who's going to be the ascendant when Steve finally just go.
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:56.280]   I think the culture of Apple is the way it is because of Steve Jobs.
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:34:01.000]   And I don't think you get those teams to perform that way without a Steve Jobs.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.800]   And if you look, we remember back to the Sculli days,
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.520]   and remember back to--
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:07.440]   as a shareholder at that time--
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:10.000]   I'm not currently a shareholder--
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.840]   wanting Steve back was key to my thinking.
[00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:13.840]   Oh, yeah, you were right.
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:19.280]   I think that there's no doubt whatsoever that the company will not be the same when he leaves.
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:21.880]   That doesn't mean it won't be a successful company.
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:26.560]   But I don't think it'll be the same unless they find that one in a million guy
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:31.200]   who's got the ability to instill terror the way Steve Jobs.
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:34.120]   Article, a big article in Slate, I've put it in our show notes,
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:37.720]   if people want to read it by Farhad Manju, he's talking--
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:40.960]   the headline is something wrong--
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:43.760]   or sorry, I'm sorry, it's something rotten at Apple.
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:48.000]   Email problems, flaky phones and broken Macs, what's Steve Jobs to do?
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.360]   And he quotes Mike Arrington on TechCrunch saying that the Apple PCs,
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:55.280]   he's had four of them with problems in different ways.
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:59.000]   Of course, Mobile Me were familiar with the issues with that,
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.440]   at least in the first few weeks, although I'm not sure what the current issues are.
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:07.880]   Of course, this iPhone lawsuit, he brings up the fact that the 3G maybe doesn't work as well as it.
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:14.240]   Are things going bad for Apple all of a sudden, or is this just normal growing pains?
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:19.240]   Well, I think they decided to take the hit.
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:24.880]   That's what I thought initially how crazy to try and roll all this stuff out in such a short time.
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:28.000]   And why not do it week by week over a number of months?
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.720]   But looking back, honestly, it didn't think they'd--
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:35.720]   or I don't think they thought they would have as many problems as they did.
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:39.160]   But I just thought they'd take the hit, get some bad press for a couple of weeks,
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:41.320]   get everything rolled out, and then people can just carry on
[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:44.040]   rather than having it drag out over months and months and months.
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:46.120]   Perhaps it hasn't worked for them as they might,
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:50.760]   but I certainly think it was a ploy to try and take the pain over a short period
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:52.920]   rather than drag it out over a couple months.
[00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:56.760]   I got an email from Apple today saying they're paying me $30 a month
[00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:59.680]   to use Mobile Me now.
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:03.360]   They've gone from just giving me credits to now they're actually going to pay me.
[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:10.600]   I got an email from a listener, a fan, a viewer who got an email from Steve Jobs.
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.080]   Yeah.
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:15.400]   And apparently, according to the blogs, a couple of people have,
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:21.120]   if you send or have sent emails to Steve about the issues with the iPhone 3G,
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:22.360]   they get this one-line message.
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:25.520]   We're working on some bugs which affect around 2% of iPhones shipped,
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:28.640]   hope to have a software update soon.
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:29.480]   Wow.
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:32.000]   And the one I received from our viewer was differently worded,
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.200]   but as if Steve might have really written it, it's very quick.
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:39.680]   It's one line saying, "Yeah, we know, and we're working on an update."
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:42.480]   So maybe Jobs is actually scanning the email.
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:44.160]   That's kind of hard to believe.
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:47.240]   Well, I think it'd be good if they start taking that approach.
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:51.440]   I think I'm pretty impressed with the way they've owned up to the Mobile Me problems.
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:54.520]   And I think companies these days have to be more transparent,
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:59.720]   and maybe the new Apple will be that way, at least in Apple's version of it.
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:03.960]   Well, I think this really does demonstrate how smart Apple has always been
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:08.400]   in never confirming or talking about any product that hasn't shipped yet.
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:12.680]   It frustrates us to know that, you know, we know you're working on new MacBooks.
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:15.640]   Why don't you just tell us what it's going to be about and what they're going to do
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:17.160]   and what features they're going to have?
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:21.080]   We've seen here that when you tell people that you're going to have a brand new iPhone,
[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:23.360]   it's going to be released in June.
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:25.320]   Here are the features, and here's what we're promising.
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:28.960]   And then things just sort of happen, and it's not quite perfect,
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:33.760]   but now you've got your stock price riding on your ability to make this promised ship date.
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:41.040]   I mean, for all we know, Apple had firm intention of selling a tablet Mac in 1999,
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:43.400]   but it wasn't quite ready, so they gave it another four months.
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:45.840]   Then, oh, God, we have this new plan in two years.
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:46.960]   We need to make it compatible with this.
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:50.480]   Okay, let's delay it another year, which means that by and large,
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:55.040]   all these unannounced products tend to work rather well when they finally ship.
[00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:00.960]   I have to say, I think this is typical of the kind of the nattering classes
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:04.720]   to be looking for, reading the tea leaves and looking for problems and saying,
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:07.280]   oh, there's a problem in bringing their hands.
[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:10.720]   I think every computer company has, you know, goes through issues like this.
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:13.200]   Every technology company goes through issues like this.
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:15.520]   Sometimes they come in clumps, sometimes they don't.
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:16.800]   You wish they wouldn't.
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:18.160]   I think Apple's pretty resilient.
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:20.400]   I think that they're being fairly responsive.
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:22.240]   You know, giving people three more months of mobile me,
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:26.640]   which was we observed last last week is kind of like, that's the reward.
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:28.320]   That's like second prize.
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:32.800]   First prize, two months of mobile me, second prize, three months of monthly,
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:33.680]   or whatever that is.
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:39.600]   I think also, I think as well, one of the problems that they have
[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:41.120]   is they're under such scrutiny all the time.
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:44.640]   There's not many other tech companies that have this level of,
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:48.000]   you know, things being picked apart and every decision that they make
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.760]   is analyzed to the nth degree.
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:52.480]   I mean, we're all guilty of it and it's what interests us as well.
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:57.360]   So, you know, I'm not playing that down, but they are under terrific scrutiny.
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:01.760]   If Dell releases a laptop that has a few problems, no one hears about it.
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:04.480]   But, you know, the slightest little problem that Apple have,
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.640]   it's in all the tech blogs.
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:09.200]   It's, you know, mainstream press even get hold of it.
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:12.480]   Well, I also observed this isn't the first time Apple's gone through a rough patch.
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:15.200]   I mean, they had some real quality control issues several years ago.
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:16.960]   Remember the first Mac book?
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.840]   A lot of people had a lot of problems with.
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:23.600]   They fixed them after a few months, but I don't think this is unusual.
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:27.120]   This is just, you know, and they're saying now they want to make what it was at 80 million
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:30.480]   iPhones. Of course, you're going to have some of some of them are going to have problems.
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:32.560]   That's a huge number to manufacture.
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:33.680]   I don't know what it is.
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:37.280]   What might be what who might have been killed, sacrificed to Balal,
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:42.960]   then buried in that desert in California in 1861 to cause that part of Apple to be cursed.
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:47.600]   But every time they ship things that are designed to be mobile, it just has the mark,
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:49.360]   it just has this mark on it.
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:49.520]   Yeah.
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:55.120]   I mean, when you look at all the really big, really amusing disasters Apple has had,
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:56.320]   it's always with portables.
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:40:03.600]   It's with, you know, 1994 power books that will actually catch on fire and melt through
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:08.160]   the battery, the battery case, you know, and pictures being distributed of power books that
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:11.360]   are essentially rendered into slag in flight.
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:13.840]   And every two or three years, there's another story exactly like that.
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:16.960]   Maybe just the iPhone is the latest one to inherit that curse.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:22.000]   To this date, I mean, we all know the general consumer wisdom is that extended warranties
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.280]   are for suckers, but if you're buying a portable Macintosh, maybe not so much.
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:27.680]   Yeah.
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:28.560]   Good idea.
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:28.640]   Yeah.
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:32.400]   You're a big fan of Apple Care.
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:33.120]   You were the one who...
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:35.920]   I've never purchased an Apple product without it.
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:39.120]   And I've looked all the way back at the money.
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:40.400]   I'm definitely ahead on it.
[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:42.160]   You know, really?
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:46.480]   I'm definitely ahead because, you know, all it takes, you know,
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:49.760]   one service call pretty much equals an Apple Care bill.
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:55.920]   So the other thing is, it's frustrating to me, but it became evident to me that when you were
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:41:00.560]   going to, you know, back in the day when I needed to call Apple on a fairly regular basis to maintain
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:05.680]   dozens of machines in my studio, the only way, you know, if you were an Apple Care holder,
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:06.640]   they would help you.
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:09.600]   And if you weren't, well, even though you were technically within the warranty, you know,
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:11.040]   they weren't going to bust their butt for you.
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:14.480]   So it just became an easy thing to do, but on balance, I think it's worth it.
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:17.840]   We have it for all the iPhones we bought, which was a lot of Apple Care.
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:21.360]   And, you know, it's paid off when we had problems with the iPhones.
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:21.920]   We took them in.
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:22.160]   Boom.
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:22.960]   We just got a new one.
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:24.640]   There wasn't any second guessing.
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:30.400]   And, you know, but I will say this, I'm feeling pretty smug about my decision to keep my original
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.320]   iPhone and keep it at 1.4.
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:35.920]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:39.760]   I'm very happy actually with the iPhone and running 201.
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:42.960]   It's been much more reliable, much more robust.
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:46.080]   And I have installed probably 60 or 70 applications.
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:47.840]   I am, I've gone application crazy.
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:48.800]   I'm very happy.
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:53.920]   Hey, coming up, we're going to talk about a special meeting Apple is holding about video
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:55.200]   surveillance.
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:57.200]   Are they going to get in the video surveillance business?
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:58.320]   Hmm.
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:01.280]   Right now, though, I want to mention audible.com.
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:02.720]   Time for our audible pick of the week.
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:04.560]   You know, audible sponsors is show.
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:09.040]   If you want to get a free book, try Audible app by going to audible.com/macbreak.
[00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:09.680]   I'm sorry, Don.
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:11.440]   I don't think this is available in the UK.
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:13.520]   It's US only.
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:15.520]   There is Audible UK.
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:20.320]   It's just that the books, often the books we recommend are not available in the international
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:20.720]   stores.
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:24.720]   But you can buy many of these books.
[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:26.880]   And by the way, I wanted to mention something.
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:31.680]   You know, if you are buying audio books on iTunes, you've already tried Audible.
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:32.560]   That's the provider.
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:34.400]   Audible provides all the audio books on iTunes.
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:40.800]   So if you're already listening on iTunes, you know what Audible is, but I want to just
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:43.760]   remind you, it's a little bit less expensive if you subscribe at audible.com.
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:50.240]   So go to audible.com/macbreak and kind of soothe your audio book habit.
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:52.080]   But you're listening to these days, Andy and I'll go.
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:56.640]   Well, the political season has the election season has just started up.
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:43:01.360]   And I managed to start listening to a book I've been putting off.
[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:02.880]   I'm sure a lot of our listeners have heard of it.
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:04.400]   It's by Doris Kerns Goodwin.
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:08.320]   It's called "Team of Rivals, the Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln."
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:13.760]   It starts off with the nomination process for the presidential election,
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:19.440]   where you got three or four different players in the Republican Party,
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:20.960]   each five for the nomination.
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:23.840]   This guy named Seward, he has the nomination locked up.
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:28.400]   So much so that thousands of people are gathering in his hometown for this big party.
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:29.760]   Champagne has been ordered.
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:33.600]   He has already written his speech about how his resignation speech from the Senate,
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:36.960]   because he not only is absolutely a lock for the nomination,
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:40.560]   but also pretty a good bet to win the election and become president.
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:45.360]   And the first part of the book is all about how Lincoln, this backwards,
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:50.640]   not really respected by people who knew him, but not really with a great national reputation,
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:54.400]   how he managed to get the nomination and steal it from Seward.
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:55.600]   Then of course, he gets elected.
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:44:00.880]   And it's all about how he did, he wanted to assemble the greatest brain trust he could possibly
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:02.320]   assemble for his cabinet.
[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:05.600]   And holy cow, he went to the people who hated him the most,
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:11.680]   all the people he beat out for the nomination, the people who really entered into this relationship
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:17.120]   with him thinking, Seward in particular, he became Lincoln's secretary of state.
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:22.800]   And he came in thinking, oh God, this hasty, this hick, who doesn't know his butt from a hole
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:23.280]   in the ground.
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:26.160]   Now, I'm going to be, well, you know what, I bet he'll be the figurehead.
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:29.600]   They elected him because he's, you know, he's folksy and he's backwardsy, but I'll be,
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:34.720]   oh, I'll be, as a secretary of state, I'll actually control the show quickly realizing that number one,
[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:38.080]   no, he's not going to control the show because Lincoln was a lot more savvy than that.
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:44.480]   But also learning to respect and really appreciate his, why the right man got elected for the job.
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:50.640]   It becomes a story about how these people got thrown together, people of really different
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:52.720]   backgrounds and different personalities.
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:59.200]   Lincoln being the most, the most friendly outgoing, really knows people, really understands people
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:05.440]   with an inner joy with these other people who just work hard and just focused on their career.
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:09.040]   Another guy who really didn't want to be in politics, but because you really want to spend
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:13.040]   more time with his family, but you know, the party kind of pushed him into it about how they
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:17.600]   banded together, found the right person for each job and found an immense amount of respect for
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:21.360]   each other. I'm only halfway through it right now. So don't tell me how the presidency ends.
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:31.040]   But it really is. It sort of makes you, in general, you love these sort of historical
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:37.040]   biographies where it's clear, you can almost spot the actual page where the biographer said,
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:43.600]   you know what, I am no longer going to be a dispassionate, disconnected historical journalist.
[00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:49.360]   I love this guy. And this book is going to show how much I love and respect everything about him.
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:54.320]   You can see that Doris Kerns, good when you know what he, she would she would marry Lincoln.
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:59.760]   She's one of our great historians, especially presidential historians, team of rivals,
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:03.600]   the political genius of Abraham Lincoln. You know, it's funny. I think worlds have collided here
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:09.200]   because Paul Therat picked this on Windows Weekly too. So there you go. I can't wait. I just added
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:14.480]   it to my next book on Audible.com. That's by the way, one of the things you can do is you can
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:19.760]   maintain a cue they have. You can buy for a friend, suggest for a friend, add to your wish list.

[00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:45.600]   them so much for their support of Macbreak Weekly. So let's see, what was I going to talk about? Oh,
[00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:51.200]   my, this is, this is from a nine, nine, what is it, nine to five, apple nine to five,
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:55.920]   which I think is nine to five Mac. That's it. Nine to five Mac.com, which is kind of a rumor site,
[00:46:55.920 --> 00:47:00.080]   but, but they point out that their apple is hosting a meeting
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:11.600]   in September 16th talking about video surveillance of all things. Video next, an apple will be
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:15.760]   hosting a panel of industry experts will be discussing the future of video surveillance,
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:19.280]   and where video makes information technology. I don't know why apples evolved in this,
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:24.400]   except that I remember a patent about six months ago. You know, remember that patent, Scott Bourne?
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:30.960]   I do indeed. And I remember thinking at the time that, you know, this is anything related to
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:38.480]   security, you know, is going to be very, very hot. I mean, this patent was a modern,
[00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:45.040]   probably it, Don can probably attest to the fact that there are lots of public CCTV cameras in
[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:48.320]   Great Britain. Oh, yeah, it's famous, right? Yeah, we have, we have quite a few over here.
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:53.440]   Yeah, I've actually every town center is blanket covered with CCTV. So it's a bit of an issue for
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:58.640]   us over here. The, the Apple patent, as I remember, was of a monitor that looks at you,
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:02.320]   that every, every cell of the monitor was effectively a camera.
[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:09.280]   But this would be a, you know, this would be a huge business if they got into it.
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:12.080]   What is it? Is it the kind of business Apple wants to get into?
[00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:17.680]   Well, I, you know, I don't know that it's a, it's a, you know, there's an interesting idea here
[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:22.640]   that Apple has the public facing Apple that we're all familiar with, but there's a lot
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:26.160]   probably that goes on at Apple that, you know, we don't hear about that's more,
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:30.080]   you know, back-end stuff working with the educational institutions is one example,
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:34.720]   working with the government is another. I don't, I, you know, I can't imagine a company of Apple
[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:39.920]   size not wanting to play there. And plus they probably feel, you know, their chest is a little,
[00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:44.240]   a little big after, you know, some, at least some initial success with the iPhone. Everybody
[00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:48.160]   said, what the heck are you doing into the cell phone business? But yeah, that's a good point. Yeah.
[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:52.960]   I don't think there's a reason for, I mean, given the technology expertise they have,
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:57.600]   the existing product mix they have, I think it's a great fit. I hope, I hope it's true because I
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:03.360]   think it would solidify the company's position and give them access to research dollars that might
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:09.520]   end up translating into stuff we could use as consumers. Microsoft has decided to take on the
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:14.400]   Apple Switch ads, 300 million dollar campaign. We mentioned that they've picked their spokesman,
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:20.240]   any, any guesses as to. It's a lot of stuff about nothing.
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:27.120]   Yeah, exactly. 10 million dollars to Jerry Seinfeld, the comic who hasn't had a TV show on the air in
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:33.120]   10 years. And by the way, who in that TV show used Macintosh computers exclusively is going to be.
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:38.320]   That's hands down. The funniest part of all of that is on the message board. Yeah, but
[00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:42.400]   how is my side feel turning his back on the Macintosh? He's always, he's such a wonderful
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:46.880]   supporter. He never turned the damn thing on once. That's a good point. He spent time on his Macintosh
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:50.320]   than he did riding that bike that was always in the back department. That's right. Well,
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:54.720]   the really weird thing is that he was actually in the, I think, different, one of the things,
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:59.200]   different adverts where they had all the icons of Charlie Chaplin, etc. Seinfeld was actually,
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:03.520]   I think the last one in one of the, I think, different campaigns. Hey, for 10 million dollars,
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:12.320]   I'll do a Windows career. The latest, the latest ads are pretty, the latest Apple Switch.
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:17.360]   Ads are getting more and more aggressive. It's almost as if, because Microsoft hasn't come back
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:23.600]   to counter them, they just say, all right, we're going to keep going. We're going to punch
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:27.280]   them even a little bit harder. Or maybe they're getting ready for Microsoft's counter punch.
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:30.880]   I don't know. This is, this one is called Off the Air. Hello, I'm a Mac and I'm a PC.
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:34.880]   And I'm a Mac genius. And I'm here to announce that it's easier than ever to switch to a Mac.
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:37.840]   Easier. What's she talking? What's she talking? Oh, when you buy a Mac, the Apple store,
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:41.280]   Mac genius will transfer your files from your old PC to your new Mac for free.
[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:45.120]   We do all the work. Oh, no, no, no, no. My frustrated users don't need to hear about that.
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:49.120]   You see, fear of switching as the foundation of customer loyalty for PCs.
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:53.200]   So, we'll just shut this down. What are you doing, PC? Come off the air.
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:51:00.800]   I love the people's down. I got to get that curtain with the, with the, the color bars that
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:04.960]   he pulls down. That's, that's what I want. Pull that right down. I need that.
[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:10.400]   So, yeah, I mean, they're just getting, it almost seems like they're getting nastier and nastier.
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:13.760]   And everybody's wondered when's Redmond? When's Microsoft going to respond?
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:20.880]   To, but is Jerry Seinfeld the right guy? Apparently Gates will appear on some of these ads with Jerry.
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:25.040]   The weirdest, I tell you, I have to say, we talked about this on Twitter. This is the slogan,
[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:32.720]   Windows, not walls. Oh, come on. You know, they got the, they got the welcome to the social for the
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:39.200]   Zoom. They must just go to, you know, sucky slogans, r s dot com, when they, you know, when they want
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:46.080]   help. But the forex contention was this is typical monopoly behavior. They, they lose
[00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:52.880]   their ability to compete because they've been so dominant in their market that they just don't
[00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:57.280]   know how to compete anymore. They don't know how to market. They don't know how to hire an agency
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:02.480]   that can do a decent slogan. But you had to go to a J something like millions of dollars for
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:05.840]   that. No, they didn't. Right. Yeah, you have to give them the Jew though, because I mean, in the
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:10.240]   past, Microsoft have done some good videos fair enough. They've always been internal videos with
[00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:15.840]   always been, yeah, they've always been internal videos, you know, for their conferences and things.
[00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:21.040]   But, but Gates always has had a good sense of humor and has always come out fairly well,
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:24.560]   I think, in some of the spoof videos that they've put on. That's true. They do, you know, the
[00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:27.920]   internal stuff they do is excellent. Here's another one. This is,
[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:34.960]   Windows PC is sitting in a throne with like a Henry VIII robes and crown.
[00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:38.560]   That's of course, John Hodgman, who by the way, I'm hoping we're going to get on this show or
[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:42.560]   Twitter. He wants to be on the show. Oh, good. He's a fan and it would be fun to have PC
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:47.440]   on the show. He's dressed in his robes and just along in his usual, you know, slacker jeans and
[00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:52.880]   blue shirt. Hello, Mac, and I'm a PC. What is this? Well, you know, this is something of a hassle,
[00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:56.800]   but switching computers isn't even bigger hassle. So even though you might have a better operating
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:01.360]   system, I'm not worried about losing any of my subjects to you. I'm still the king.
[00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:05.760]   Well, actually, all your subjects have to do is bring their PC into an Apple store
[00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:09.360]   when they get a new Mac and then Mac changes, which is transfer their files over for free.
[00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:13.680]   Really? Yeah, make switching kind of easy. I banish you.
[00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:23.440]   I love John Hodgman. He's so funny. So, the timing of that line is what makes it. Oh, yeah.
[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:30.480]   He's a talent. I banish you. But this speaks exactly to what the Dvorak was saying. I mean,
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:34.640]   it's Apple saying, yeah, these guys have been royalty for so long. They don't, you know,
[00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:39.760]   they're not in touch with a common user. I think that's a good point. I find myself
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:44.880]   unusually agreeing with Mr. Dvorak here. I think that's an excellent point. They have been such a
[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:50.960]   monopoly and they've had such a huge market share they haven't had to care. But I think certainly,
[00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:56.480]   we see in certain market segments, they're losing the monopoly. I mean, if they ever had it, I mean,
[00:53:56.480 --> 00:54:00.880]   photography, obviously, a lot of professional photographers use Macs. We're running a poll
[00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:06.720]   over at twibphotor.com and it's just stunning how many more people use Macs than Windows.
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:11.280]   Well, you know, what's really interesting and done, I'm sure, you know, of course,
[00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:18.720]   your screencasts are all Mac focused, aren't they? But yeah, but we do podcasts for the wide range
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:25.040]   of operating systems, including a Floss open source and Windows. And nevertheless, I'd say more than
[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:30.480]   half of our audience are Mac users, whether that's because iTunes is the way most people get podcasts
[00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:37.280]   or whatever. But Apple users, even though they only represent whatever it is now 10% of the marketplace
[00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:43.440]   are very active and very involved. And remember when that was 3% of the marketplace, though?
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:45.360]   Yeah, it's already up. It's doubled more than doubled.
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:51.280]   Yeah, I mean, especially true over here, because, you know, Macs really were very few and far between.
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:51.760]   Right.
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:56.160]   Now, I think now I think we're up to 13 or 14 retail stores in the UK alone. And I think it's quite
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:55:00.720]   interesting those two adverts that you've just played, they're very much pushing now a facility
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:04.800]   that they could only do once they had the retail stores in place. And this is to actually bring
[00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:09.840]   your PC into a retail store and have your files transferred. And two, strangely, you know,
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:14.480]   two adverts are actually giving exactly the same message only in a slightly different way.
[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:17.360]   And of course, it couldn't have done that without the infrastructure that they've been building up
[00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:20.640]   and building up over the past couple of years. And they're at the point now where, you know,
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:25.040]   they can start to leverage some of the benefits of the retail stores to bring even more people in.
[00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:26.640]   Yeah, it's an excellent point.
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:30.480]   You think they ring a little bell every time somebody brings a PC and change to a Mac?
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:37.840]   No, but an angel gets its wings, I believe. So close. We're going to get to our picks of the week.
[00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:42.960]   Let's do it right now. Let's start with our picks of the week. And Don, since you were so quick to
[00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:48.800]   say, yes, I'm ready. Let's get you started with your pick of the week. It could be hardware,
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:52.080]   it could be software, it could be an iPhone application, although people are starting to say,
[00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:55.440]   we want more than just iPhone applications. What do you get for us this week?
[00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:59.920]   Right. Well, I've got tons of picks to choose from because obviously I do a screencast every
[00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:04.640]   week on the live. That's what you do. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm going to go for the last commercial one
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:09.520]   that I did, which was a couple of weeks ago now, a program called BDoX Timeline. I don't know if
[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:14.720]   you're familiar with it. No, what is it? It's a really cool Mac application. It's very beautifully
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:20.160]   put together, but it enables you to create a timeline for a presentation. So you can create
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:24.160]   your own timeline. So the reason I stumbled across this was when I did a speaking gig at the new
[00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:28.560]   Media Expo, and my session was all about how I'd sort of grown screencasts online, you know,
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:33.200]   from a hobby to a business. And so I was looking for something to sort of put down a timeline within
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:38.400]   keynotes. And I discovered this particular package. So I was so impressed, I actually did a tutorial
[00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:42.880]   on it. But the nice thing about it is you can create your own timeline, but you can also create the
[00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:48.480]   timeline in 3D. So you just press a few key presses and the sort of screen comes out and gives
[00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:52.880]   you a 3D representation of the timeline sort of looking down the timeline. And as you move through
[00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:58.240]   the presentation, sort of the little elements that you put in, sort of flip out, it's a very cool,
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:02.720]   cool thing to see. And then the nice thing is as well is you can import things like RSS feed. So
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:07.280]   if you have a blog and you want to create a timeline of your blog entries, you can import
[00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:13.680]   your RSS feeds, or you can import a calendar say. So if you have an iCal calendar that you want to
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:18.960]   put in a presentation, excuse me, you can actually import the iCal calendar directly into
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:25.360]   BDoX timeline and have this beautiful representation of your timeline. It's really cool to see. But
[00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:30.080]   a nice thing as well is you can export in high definition video. And that's the way I put it into
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:35.280]   my keynote presentation. So you generate your timeline, and then you can export a high definition
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:41.680]   movie right up to 1080p. And then you can incorporate that into your keynote presentation, and then
[00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:46.160]   add in additional keynote elements as well. So you get a really, really nice effect.
[00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:52.720]   I like the 3D effect of that program. It's really nice. It's super. But of course, go across the
[00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:58.240]   BDoX timeline website. But over on my site, there's a tutorial, a free tutorial about 40 minutes
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:02.880]   long that takes you through. It actually takes you through how I designed and built my presentation
[00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:06.800]   for the new media expo as well. So you can actually see a real life sort of implementation of how
[00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:11.360]   it all hangs together. I got to apologize. I didn't realize you were at new media expo. I would have
[00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:16.320]   loved to have you on our show. I did come down. Yeah. And well, the thing is we're given the session.
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:20.560]   Sort of that one day I was tucked away trying to finish it off. And then the next day I sort of
[00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:24.400]   came down. But obviously it was a very popular booth. You're a booth. But no, not to worry. Next
[00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:28.640]   time, perhaps. Well, yeah, there will be. And I totally apologize. And we'll see you at Macworld.
[00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:34.000]   In fact, I'm going to steal this because I've been talking with Paul Can about doing doing
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:38.400]   to it live at Macworld and perhaps doing a presentation at Macworld. And so this sounds like this would
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:45.200]   be a really good thing to jazz up a presentation. Yeah, it is great. And I'm sure Adam, the developer
[00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:48.640]   won't mind me telling you. But if you go across to my page on the website, you'll actually find
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:52.640]   that there's a money off coupon there as well, which I don't get any cut from it. But if you want
[00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:59.200]   to save yourself a few pennies, you can go and use that coupon code screencast online number 162
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:04.960]   B Docs. That's the one. Yeah. Oh, that's great. I'm gonna watch that. And then get the coupon off.
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:08.960]   And they have a two 30 day free trial too. So they do as well. Yeah, and you don't have to go
[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:12.240]   with the 3D. You can get the 2D version, which I think is slightly cheaper. But once you see the
[00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:16.880]   3D, you'll probably be sold on that. Oh, you got to get the 3D, man. You use this, Scott?
[00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:25.600]   I just started using it last week. And the thing is, the 3D allows you to cross the divide between
[00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:31.040]   context and detail. And that's the real strength of this program. When you're trying to do a timeline,
[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:36.000]   you show everything in context, you see all this stuff. But then you really don't, it's hard to
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:42.160]   gather in the detail. So in the past, these programs have simply zoomed in to show you detail,
[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:48.160]   but then you lose all the context. Because of the 3D nature of this, you're able to tilt things
[00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:54.480]   around in real time and sort of look at them at an angle. And you can still see most of the context.
[00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:57.760]   And I got to tell you, it makes me wish I had more timeline stuff to create.
[00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:03.680]   Yeah, no kidding. Well, and it looks like you not only are SS, but I see you could
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:07.440]   put your recently listened to songs and all sorts of stuff in there. It's really.
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:11.840]   Yeah, it's integrated with all sorts of different bits within the OS. So it's very clever.
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:18.160]   Very good. Very good pick. Thank you. B-Docs timeline. Scott Borne, your pick of the week.
[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:23.360]   My pick of the week would be Mapeture. Mapeture is this something to do with
[01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:30.320]   aperture? It is indeed. It's the free Mapeture plugin. Absolutely free. A zero Alex pick from me.
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:37.600]   That's rare. Ubermind is the company. And they got a new plugin called Mapeture for Aperture.
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:43.120]   And it's to help all the people involved in the crazy old geotagging game. It lets you
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:51.040]   basically work aperture with Google Maps to figure out how to geotag your photos. And you can add GPS
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:57.840]   data. It scales from anywhere from like one image to your entire library. It's got a really cool
[01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:04.320]   interface. And it works. I mean, that's the crazy thing. I mean, I took some pictures up at
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:10.080]   Mount Rainier National Park. And I knew exactly where I was. And so I went to Google Maps and
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:14.880]   picked the spot. And sure enough, that was where I was. And it gave me the latitude and the longitude.
[01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:18.560]   And it gave me a little pin thing that I can move around, drag around on the screen.
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:26.800]   It's absolutely free. Works with aperture. And it's crazy. I mean, if you're into this geotagging
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:30.960]   thing, it's a way to do it without buying something expensive to tag onto your camera.
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:35.520]   I really love geotagging. So that's cool. You want to get this thing.
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:37.200]   Yeah. First, I got to get aperture.
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:46.160]   We can work that out. It's something I can help you with. Talk to me offline.
[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:53.200]   Ubermindubrmin.com is the site. And it's absolutely free.
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:57.840]   I love it. Thank you, Scott. We're going to get to Annie's pick and my pick as well in just a second.
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:01.600]   But first, a reminder that when you so far we haven't we haven't spent any of your money.
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:06.720]   But when you do go shopping online for your Macintosh picks or whatever you're shopping for,
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:11.680]   you want to do it in a way that you feel is safe and secure. And that, of course, is with Visa.
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:14.560]   Safe, secure Visa. Those are the three words. Just keep that in mind.
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:19.840]   Say it over and over. It's your little mantra. Safe, secure, visa when you go shopping online.
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:24.480]   Visa knows you have better things to think about than online fraud. They don't want you to worry
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:28.960]   about that. That's why they want to reassure you and that why they're telling the world here.
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:35.280]   All the purchases you make with Visa are safe and secure. They do so many things to prevent,
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:40.080]   detect, and resolve online fraud, making sure that you have zero liability. You're just not
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:45.360]   liable for unauthorized purchases. You are safe. So when you shop online, bring your Visa card.
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:51.680]   That's peace of mind. Safe, secure Visa. We thank them so much for their support of Backbreak Weekly.
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:55.920]   I'm going to throw mine in. And Andy, I'm going to let you wrap it up. How about that?
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:57.840]   Okay. Okay.
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:02.800]   All righty. Will you play? Will you play some ukulele music with your pick?
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:08.160]   I don't know. I get that. That was very funny. I get that Leo.
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:13.760]   You took me a second. That was my fault. That yours. It was a solid joke. I get that.
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:19.680]   It wasn't that solid. It wasn't that funny. I remember Andy at McMania 4-5. I can't remember.
[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:22.320]   We had a talent show and he played the ukulele. You're great.
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:30.640]   I flirt with competency on occasion. I really enjoyed it. I really enjoyed it.
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:36.000]   Are you going on McMania 9 to China? I am going on the slow book to China and Japan and Korea.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.360]   Me too. I'll see you there. That's going to be so much fun.
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:43.600]   I'm me. You're going down. McAncer's going to a fight. I'm trying to.
[01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:48.000]   This is weird. The only person I got is Scott. Do you want to come? Come on, Scott Moore.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.480]   They've never invited me to any of these things, but I would go.
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:56.720]   Captain Neal's listening right now. Captain Neal Scott Moore would love to go. He's great for
[01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:01.840]   talking about aperture photography. He could do a photography show that would just blow your mind.
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:07.520]   Actually, so could you, Andy. You're really. I mean, so it's coming up. Go to insightcruises.com
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:11.760]   if you want to sign up. I'm doing. I don't know about you guys. I'm going to do the land, the
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:18.160]   one-week land tour of China the week before the cruise. I really invite everybody who wants to,
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:22.160]   anybody wants to do that too. You can find out about that insightcruises.com.
[01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:26.720]   Then we're leaving for China. We're going to Korea. We're going to Japan. It's McManian 9.
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:31.920]   It's going to be so much fun. Can you imagine the interest given the Olympics and people
[01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:38.160]   getting to see how beautiful China is? I'm so excited. My son has been my companion.
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:42.960]   Ever since my wife went on the first McManian hasn't been on since. She said too many nerds.
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:50.080]   Including the one she's married to. She says, I get this all year round. I don't need to go on a
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:55.760]   cruise for them. But no, she's just not. She's not her cup of tea. Let's just hope her printer
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:05:02.640]   keeps working. I'm still chilling in the prop of not enough hair. Why, why lady? Why, why,
[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:07.520]   just keep that in mind. So my companion on most of these geek cruises has been my son Henry.
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:11.440]   And I'm really, you know, it's been great. He's been able to travel all around the world and see
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:16.880]   so much stuff. And every single time he says, I don't want to go. So I signed him up for this
[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:20.160]   one. We're going to China, Henry. And I said, we're going to China. He said, I don't want to go.
[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:24.720]   China. Oh, that sounds far away. I don't want to go. That sounds far away. I don't want to go.
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:28.720]   But this is a lucky kid. I mean, he has been all over the world on these geek cruises. It's so much
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:35.760]   fun. Please join. Sounds far away. It is far away. Yeah, it is this time. Really, really, it is.
[01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:39.120]   How many days is this one? It's a short cruise is a six day cruise.
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:43.440]   So it's a make it's it makes it a little more affordable, but they do have land portions at the
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:48.560]   beginning and the end. In fact, there's a scientific American tour to the solar eclipse. There's a
[01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:52.560]   total solar eclipse in the region after the cruise. So if you're a solar eclipse fan, you might
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:58.640]   want to do that one. There's a short land, like a three day land portion available. These are all
[01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:02.720]   optional before the cruise. And then there's a seven day and I'm going to go in the longer seven
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:06.240]   day one. We're going to we're going to have lunch on the Great Wall of China. We're going to
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:12.000]   see the soldiers of Xi'an. I mean, I can't I was a Chinese major and I've never been to China.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.160]   So I'm just oh my god. I know. I know. Well, it was in the 70s and it was kind of hard to get there
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:22.480]   at the time. If I go, will you be my translator? Yeah, but but if all of a sudden you get ducks
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:31.120]   feet for breakfast, it's not my fault. The ma not ma. So let me let me give you my pick and then we'll
[01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:37.200]   get to Andy's pick guitar or ukulele or otherwise. You know, and this is one you all know about.
[01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:41.920]   And I presume you're all familiar with it. It's a little bit of a tough one because
[01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:46.640]   Macintosh has come with iChat, which is just really incredible. Very very good
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:52.240]   chatting program that works with Jabber and Aim. But there is a place to go that's so much
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:58.080]   even better called Adeam. Adeam is open source chat client for the Macintosh that does
[01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:05.440]   everything, not just Aim, not just Jabber and Google talk. You can you can it works with pretty
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:14.160]   much any instant messenger client in the world. It is I mean, you go AOL, Jabber, MSN, Yahoo,
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:19.440]   Mac, it'll use Bonjour networking. So it's great for an office. Something called Garu Garu,
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:24.800]   which I'm thinking is Chinese Google talk, of course, I see Q live journal. It even does kind of some
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:32.000]   off the wall stuff like Lotus same time, novel group wise, QQ and Yahoo Japan and Zephyr.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:37.040]   These these are all instant message clients that you can use within Adeam. Adeam has really,
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:42.480]   you've heard it, I know in my system because I have those great Tokyo train station. Adeam
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:48.880]   sounds, which I love so much. I play those whenever I can because I just love how they sound. I
[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:55.440]   eventually had to turn them off. Great, a theming, great, you know, really easily skinned. And the
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:08:01.520]   reason I kind of become more aware of it is because we stay we started a Twitter clone at army.twit.tv
[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:09.120]   and it supports unlike Twitter. It supports instant messaging. In fact, even better than that,
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:15.120]   it supports not only using instant messaging to post and read, but something called track where
[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:18.800]   you can say, I want to follow this subject. This, oh, there's the Tokyo train station. I want to
[01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:24.000]   follow this subject and this subject and this train's leaving trains going out of the station.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:32.640]   And I in it just it's just a great way to to use these these what do you call them open
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:36.480]   micro blogs, I guess is what you call it. So for instance, you're interested. Let's say, you know,
[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:40.880]   you're you're a Mac break fan, right? You say track Mac break, you have to sign up at
[01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:48.880]   IDETIS by I'll tell you about that in a second. You say track. Thank you track Mac break. And then
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:55.920]   anytime there's a message from that on Twitter on IDETICA or on the Twitter army about Mac break,
[01:08:55.920 --> 01:09:01.840]   I will see it in my track, which makes it very powerful. It's something I'm kind of this is
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:09.200]   something that actually was disabled on on Twitter. And it's really a shame. We've been
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:12.560]   speculating that they did it because they realized this is the way to monetize Twitter. This is
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:17.600]   the most valuable part. I'll give you an example of corporation like Comcast could use it to say
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:22.160]   anytime anybody mentions Comcast on any of these services, we'd like to know about it so that we
[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:26.880]   can respond and help them. Well, that's a value. Twitter used to do it for free. They don't do it
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:31.040]   anymore. But now you can but this thanks to this a great identify, you could do it. So
[01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:38.320]   I just I just I become an ad him has become my now my most used application all of a sudden
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:45.040]   as a way to follow a lot of stuff going on. It's really fantastic. Highly recommended.
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:50.880]   ADI UM is free is open source and is customizable, although I highly recommend
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:57.120]   highly recommend supporting them with a donation because it's just such a good product.
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:03.520]   So this tracking if you if you simply add if you need a jabber compatible client,
[01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:08.000]   which by the way, I chat is but ad him would be the good choice. Windows has them too, of course.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:17.600]   You simply add Laconica at west dot spy dot net to your client. And then once it's once
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:23.840]   become your friend, you type hello, I'm sorry, type help is probably the best thing to do. Type
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:30.480]   help and you'll get a list of commands among them, the track commands that you can use with it.
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:35.120]   And there are a lot of them actually it's down right now, but when it comes back up, type help.
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:39.600]   There it is. It's not that it's just a little slow. And so I'll show you all the things I'm tracking.
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:46.560]   I'm tracking time mentioned anybody mentions my name, anybody. Any of twit, twit army, twit live
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:52.160]   uh, so anytime anybody talks about these on any of these services, including Twitter or my service
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:56.800]   identical, it'll show up. So it's a great way to follow conversations and what's going on.
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:04.000]   Ad him. That's what I recommend. ADI UM. It is a great Mac, a chat client, and I think I must
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.520]   have for everybody who uses a Mac and I bet you anybody. I bet you I'm not telling anybody
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:11.600]   anything that you already know, but we never made it a pick and I just thought it'd be good probably
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:19.920]   to to mention it. Ad him X dot com, by the way, is the website ADIUMX dot com. That's my Mac break
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:28.160]   pick of the week. And now it's endy and not co's turn. My pick is a video pick. It's actually
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:33.920]   not a movie. It's actually cool video utility called magnet by a company called creaseed.
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:39.120]   One of those URLs that you come up with and after year 2000, if you realize that every
[01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:46.880]   intelligible word has already been bought as a URL, it's C-R-E-A-C-E-E-D dot com. It does all these,
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:53.280]   you give it a quick time video that you shot or just use your profit DVD and imagine any effect
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:12:00.720]   you would like to do that involves tracking the location of an object throughout the frame.
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:06.160]   Meaning let's say that let's say that you're doing you know you're doing a video of your kids
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:10.560]   graduation and he wins a scholarship and you think it would be funny to have that little
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:15.200]   effect where there's dollar bills, dollar signs suddenly peer over his eyes. You can do that with
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:20.240]   magnet. All you got to do is you basically in one key frame tell magnet okay here's the left eye,
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:24.480]   here's the right eye, here's the little graphic image I want you to put on top of them and then
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:30.240]   for the duration of that clip actually dynamically track where those eyes are from frame to frame
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:35.600]   to frame and it's actually very very good at that. It'll do it does even better. Obviously the
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:40.560]   more contrast there is the more things that that's that has more contrast from one pixel to another,
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:46.160]   the better it's going to do but you can preview how it's going to track that object and if it
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:51.200]   messes up in a certain location you can manually at that frame say oh actually thank you magnet but
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:55.360]   actually his eye is right here I want you to put it right there and there's a whole palette
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:59.680]   of things that you can do. If you want to have you know the if you want to do a parody of cops
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:04.400]   and you want to blur out all the faces of your friend as he's doing things that he's not going
[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:08.480]   to remember or be proud of the next day when you show him the video you can simply you know tell
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:13.120]   magnet here is this guy's face please add a blur effect over it for the duration of this clip.
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:19.200]   If your kid is doing a magic show you can have a part you can have it track the tip of a magic
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:25.360]   wand and have it shoot sparks to a particle effect around it. You can even do really simple more
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:28.960]   subtle things like let's say that you're giving let's say that you are giving a demonstration of a
[01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:33.040]   piece of technology or cooking demonstration and it's you in your kitchen just like on it you know
[01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:37.920]   with a tripod just keep the sort of boring static talk and you think well here's the point where
[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:42.400]   if this were real video production I would then have sort of a picture in picture sort of effect
[01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:46.880]   where I'm showing the spices actually combining in and the rice getting nice and you know nice
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:51.920]   and saturated with it you can simply say okay magnet I want you to superimpose this quick time
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:57.520]   video at this point embedded right here this location inside the video so you can do some really
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:04.800]   nice sophisticated effects and for God's sake it's 39 bucks it's it's it's it's stuff where I mean
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:09.360]   at that for that amount of money if you're at all interested in playing with video it's a nice
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:14.720]   toy to buy it's a nice little game to play with because you can get some pretty interesting effects
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:21.280]   right away and with this in your toolbox there are so many times when you have an idea when you're
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:25.840]   an iMovie of oh god this would be the perfect thing to do right here uh too bad iMovie has
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:30.000]   absolutely no features for special effects well then just simply export it as quick time it's
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.960]   not a plug-in for iMovie or anything like that so standalone app that simply processes quick time
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:39.520]   clips but you will have that ability and what cost you about 39 bucks it's the sort of thing that
[01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:45.440]   i've been playing with it and wasting so much time with it because i'm like you know i did i did a
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:50.800]   thing where a friend of mine who was who thinks of himself as an athlete and i just and he was he
[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:56.000]   sent me hey here's a youtube video of me playing at this turn playing this beach tournament and i'm
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:01.440]   like yeah shell that's really that's really cool and then of course i have to you know grab a picture
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:06.880]   grab his face off of another photo grab some another piece of video of actual professional
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:12.320]   pro beach volleyballers and then have his face superimpose off of the face of these people who are
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:17.920]   not 40 pounds overweight and 48 years old you know and it actually does a very good very
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:22.640]   credible job of doing that superimposition that's very cool that uh Alex has demonstrated this
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:28.240]   called motion tracking and Alex has come on the show uh many times and demonstrated high-end motion
[01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:34.240]   tracking software but uh 39 bucks and this stuff really seems like it works very well let me channel
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:41.680]   Alex for a minute and and point out to you that this does use nodal technology uh-huh because
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:48.800]   Alex likes to say those two words nodal technology yes and it's the second favorite words are nodal
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:54.000]   compositing well the funny thing is this traditionally is a very difficult thing to do and high-end
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.400]   software would be used to do this and it's amazing it's migrated down to personal computers
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:05.840]   uh it's just remarkable just remarkable so uh that is uh that is the uh the pick of the week
[01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:12.240]   from uh Andy from what does it say secret creed creed what is it uh i i know that they're going

[01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:10.120]   We do the podcast once a week.
[01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:13.280]   I'd like to mention a special deal we got going.
[01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:15.000]   It's a contest, Leo.
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.520]   And I'm giving away $100,000.
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:18.600]   What?
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.640]   $100,000 worth of photography gear, travel, et cetera.
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:25.320]   It's called the Aperture Nature Photography Workshops.
[01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:26.720]   We're going to run them every three months.
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:28.600]   Remember your little Tasmania deal?
[01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:29.080]   Yeah.

[01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:36.880]   And the difference is instead of all pros, it'll be half amateurs, half
[01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:39.280]   pros and the amateurs can't buy a seat.
[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:40.280]   They have to win it.
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:41.480]   See, that's great.
[01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:45.280]   I have to say I felt so privileged to be surrounded by all these pros.
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:48.080]   And I had that exact thought is this is the kind of thing.
[01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:50.720]   Anybody wants to get better if photography should do.
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:51.880]   Oh, that's cool.

[01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:36.880]   I'm pretty excited about it.
