[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:42.440]   punk style. Apple does! Laurie Gill from imore.com where she is a senior editor.
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.480]   Hello Laurie. I'm just having too much fun listening to you today. You are silly.
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:54.680]   We're all silly. We're punchy. Also with us Alex Lindsey's back he's
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.160]   sitting in Andy and I go see we're gonna start rotating through people because I
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.920]   don't want to have too many people on it once. Hi Alex. Good to see you. Hey how's
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:10.600]   it going? Looking here. Stellar in his 09-09 media suite. And also with us
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.160]   Renee Richie who says he wants to be Alex Lindsey when he grows up. Renee is
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.400]   a dude. I do and I want to be Laurie Gill too.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.160]   Your hair is getting almost long enough to head bang. Wow I didn't wear a hat
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.760]   today. I dare to actually have hair seen in public. We'll see how this goes. I don't
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.480]   understand because I haven't had a haircut in more than two months. Me either. And my
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.360]   hair looks like this. What did you start at zero? No my hair is growing
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.000]   sideways like Mr. Mine. You have no idea how much I had to compact it before I could come on.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.680]   I get it. It's going out. Okay. Yeah. Mr. Mine is a Pokemon character. Like I said I
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.720]   look like the illegitimate love child of Bill Clinton and Don King right now Leo is
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.000]   just one horrible thought. I think we should all celebrate our COVID cuts with
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.680]   with their badge of honor. Yeah. I was I did order. Oh man I should never. A
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.440]   flow beat. Almost. I went back on Instagram. I almost did but I did get a
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:12.200]   clipper but it had a 22 millimeter. Calm. So what is that? Oh that. So that. Yeah.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.560]   I think I'm just going to. I'm scared. I'm scared. Yeah I'm scared too. I was
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.800]   fortunate that I'm always busy so I I tend to go to Candice and have her cut
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.640]   it really short. Yeah you always get short. And then I just let it go for a
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.720]   long time. You know three or four months at a time. So I happened to be just it
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.240]   was getting really long. It would have been a disaster because like a week after
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.760]   I got my haircut. That's right with Candice. Everything got shut down. Yep.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.400]   And it would have been and you know I would have been literally in a ponytail
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.560]   by now. Don't you look animatronic if it gets too long. Like that's what I feel
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.960]   like I feel like I'll start to look like an animatronic. Yeah that's my I just
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.720]   keep on adding more. The key is just more and more hair product. I went. You know
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.720]   as you just took Candice on March 12th. Candice and as one might have gathered
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.960]   now Alex and I share a hairdresser. I went to Candice on March 12th and told
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.280]   her at the time. I said cut it so it'll last because I'm not gonna see you for
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.240]   a while. She didn't believe me. She said no no no we're gonna stay open. But and
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.760]   she said I always cut it so it'll look good as it grows out. But I don't know
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.760]   if I think she anticipated quite this. We're like you on Musk. We're opening
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.000]   regardless. We're just opening. We're just gonna stay open. Yeah how about that
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.720]   Elon Musk today has opened the Tesla plant in Fremont against the against the
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.360]   rules of the Alameda County Health Office in the state of California and
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.120]   we'll see what happens. I don't know if they think he's a genius. I just think
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.040]   he's a wellness check at this point. I think he's given Apple evidence for a
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.200]   wellness check. Term tooper is gonna rush the place and send everybody home or I
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.320]   don't know what's gonna happen. It's just drama. It's just like drama for
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.600]   drama's sake. Yeah. They'll come up with a negotiated solution like they always do
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.600]   and they would have done that behind closed doors anyway. It's just still
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.680]   in Alameda County saying I want to open. He wants to open. See this is the thing.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.840]   It's I don't think it's a good look for brands because he's saying effectively
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.520]   I don't care if my workers get sick. I need to make Teslas and I think that's
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.280]   not a good look. Well and it's hard. I think we're gonna see in my hometown or
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.400]   my where I grew up in Pennsylvania. There's a huge fight where the basically
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.400]   the governor said everyone has to stay home and the sheriff's base or the
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.400]   prosecutors basically said yeah we're not gonna enforce that. Right. I'm very
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.680]   sympathetic. I mean I want to get a haircut. I don't want to get a haircut
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.640]   and get sick and I don't want to make somebody sick because I need a haircut.
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.640]   Right. Right. I'm just saying it's gonna be I think that the next couple the
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.680]   next couple weeks in the next couple months is probably gonna we're gonna
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.560]   see a lot more tension between folks that want to get back to it and folks
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.640]   that want to stay safe. It's a it's a hard. You have billionaires who it's hard
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.080]   when you have like I don't want to pick on Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos because
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.680]   they're getting a lot of heat coming their way anyway but it's hard when you
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.320]   have billionaires who regardless of how they actually feel come off as
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.320]   incredibly callous. Yes. Towards the employees under them who can at least
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.320]   afford and you just feel like just take one percent and give them all the
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.280]   protection all the everything that they need and then have them come back just
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:06.080]   you know. I think that the hard part is is that the and this is probably not
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.320]   really Mac related but but the but the hard part is is that you have people
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.600]   who making decisions about whether people can stay in and not that are
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.360]   not really affected financially by it and then you know people who are wanting
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.640]   them to go back to work that are not really fine or they are not financially
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:24.080]   you know so you have a bunch of people who are not working. Yeah we're in the mix as
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:30.400]   well. Yeah like the Facebook's. So this is the fact that go ahead. We can move on.
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.760]   No no I'm just gonna tie it into the Apple story because Apple is gonna start
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.200]   opening. Yeah it's retail stores next week. I'm worried about that too because
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.080]   they they have like a couple cases in Korea or in and in California where one
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:47.120]   person coughed in the wrong place and you see instant butterfly effect. It's
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.440]   like suddenly 19 people have it and 37 people have it. I'm not sure why they're
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.040]   choosing the stores they're choosing. It's Idaho South Carolina Alabama and Alaska.
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.480]   I guess those are states that don't have a shelter in place ordinance in effect
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:05.880]   right now. Yeah. Yeah. There are states opening up. Go ahead Lori. Yeah. There are
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:10.160]   states opening up right now like just starting to I think Wednesday is the
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.640]   reopening date for quite a few states where they're gonna start allowing
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:18.880]   retail stores to open or restaurants to open but with limited capacity. So
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:23.720]   they're following all the rules and this speaks a little bit to what I was
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:28.920]   going to say which is we're you know almost three months into shelter in place
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:36.120]   across the country right now. And it's we are now in a position of the the
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:41.800]   economy does have to get back on track in some capacity. What does that look
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:48.200]   like because the fact is we can't just shut down the entire country. Something
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:52.040]   has to keep going and so right now there's the balance Leo that you were
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:58.480]   talking about of getting back to work reopening the economy but also protecting
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:03.240]   people that are with most vulnerable to getting sick and and causing more of
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:07.360]   us bread. What do we do? How do we do it? I just don't know if we know how to do
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:11.560]   this safely. The country seems to have done it much better than us at least like
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:16.320]   they protected the economy and low and lower the curve flatten the curve I
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:20.600]   forget the jargon but they managed to do both while we were sort of caught flat
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.800]   footed back on our heels and include Quebec Quebec was we have the worst
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.720]   situation in Canada and it doesn't seem to be getting better and they still want
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.160]   to open anyway. So a lot of other countries did it way smarter than we did
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:36.200]   and protected the economy. So I'm just so Apple I think I think not having tests
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:40.400]   really is makes it hard if you had tests if you widespread testing you could
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.480]   perhaps I guess I'm no look I know that's what other countries did right yeah you
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:48.400]   could Wuhan just found what is it nine cases and now that as a result they're
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:53.320]   testing everybody in Wuhan China 11 million people immediately. People won't
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:57.000]   wear masks yeah 80% reduction in transmission if you wear if both if
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.920]   everybody's wearing a mask and like no no masks for me suckers yeah so here's
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.560]   what Apple is gonna do they say we'll open initially with additional safety
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:09.280]   procedures including temperature checks that's what they did in China that's
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:13.120]   what they did for SARS and MERS the problem with it seems to be with the
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:18.640]   current problem COVID-19 is that there are asymptomatic carriers so that's not
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:24.200]   perfect social distancing that helps no matter what and face coverings to ensure
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:28.320]   customers employees continue to stay healthy they say face coverings I'm not
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:33.240]   clear if that means just the employees or if as some places have done they'll
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:38.040]   require that you wear a mask going into the store as well a lot of places in
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:42.880]   this area are doing that they're saying you can come in famously yeah you have
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.080]   to wear a mask if you're coming in which annoyed some people who said I'll never
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:49.380]   shop at Costco again. Did you see their tweet Leo there was a woman who put up
[00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:52.320]   this big thing saying like something like live free and don't wear masks and
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:57.120]   boy cot Costco and Costco's a social reply was we look forward to watching
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:02.680]   your documentary one day. Apple also says our new social distance protocol allows
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:06.240]   for a limited number of visitors in the store at one time that's so you can
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:10.880]   distance I don't know if you've seen this where you are but here in Petaluma the
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:16.080]   Starbucks which never closed because I guess coffee is essential has just for
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:21.320]   me on the sidewalk out front they have boxes where people are to stand so that
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:24.360]   they are standing in line six feet apart. How super markets have that? Yeah
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:28.960]   supermarkets are doing that they they're built putting up glass or plastic
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:34.080]   plexiglass barriers between the the checkers with maybe little holes for the
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:38.680]   stuff. This COVID has destroyed our like because like Apple stores were just just
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:42.760]   redesigned in a way that made them so susceptible to COVID like they took a
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:46.560]   part everything that was a normal distancing part of a retail experience
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:52.000]   and jammed everyone together around like groves and promenades and forums and
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.080]   got us all as close together and then COVID came around and goes I shouldn't have
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:00.760]   done that. Well and even if you look at the office the office design you know
[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:04.440]   the open offices have turned out to be a disaster because you can't reopen
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:09.080]   because they're all open offices so you know we're gonna see most of these
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:13.120]   companies not really bringing anyone back until 2021 you know so it's gonna be
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:16.440]   a really interesting you know process all of the things that we and the
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.960]   question is no one knows as we don't know if the tests will mean that no
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:23.720]   idea or immune. We don't know whether the tracing will really work or whether
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:28.200]   it's really effective and so that we're kind of in probably the most unknown
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:33.600]   unknown of unknowns we've had in our life. It's all a big experiment. Apple says
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:38.600]   we recommend where possible customers buy online for contactless delivery
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:44.200]   or in-store pickup. I guess the it's not an economic in this case for Apple
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.320]   they don't there's no economic incentive to open up I mean I'm sure they're
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:51.720]   losing revenue but they have a little extra you know stored away for a
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:54.680]   service. It's been hard people are getting really angry about lack of
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:57.800]   servicing like I think they must be able to get their computer fixed and picked
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:01.680]   up them. Yeah with many working and learning from home our primary focus will
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.880]   be providing service and support at the genius bar so it's for people I mean
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:10.240]   yeah imagine you're trying to work from home or your kids are trying to learn
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:16.920]   online and your laptop dies and Apple's not there to fix it. Could people people
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:20.720]   could call support and send it in though right? Yes but that's not yeah that's not
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:25.960]   as quick typically as a genius bar. Yeah that could take you know a trip that
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:29.680]   could take two hours could take a week because you have to send it in and wait
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:41.480]   for it to get sent back. In some retail situations you know I've taken my
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:45.480]   Mac in and you know and literally an hour later I walked out with it fixed so
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:50.080]   that you know having to send something in really does make you know put it at a
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.480]   disadvantage for people who can't be without there. I know a couple people who
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.880]   have something wrong with their computer or their AirPods or something
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:00.520]   like that and they're just waiting because they can't they can't afford to
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:05.440]   be without that device while you know without going to the store and having
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.760]   it just taking care of right away. Here's a picture from Australia where
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:13.240]   Apple stores opened last week of people you could see they're they're in line
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:19.960]   they've got barriers set up in the mall and then they're slowly one by one going
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:25.400]   going into the store. Every day is an iPhone launch day now. Yeah yeah. I'll
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:32.760]   tell you you know as somebody who's in a higher risk population I'm not
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:37.520]   anxious to go to a restaurant to go to a store to do any of this stuff and I
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:43.000]   wonder how much people are gonna... Ben Thompson was tweeting about going out
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.840]   for Mother's Day because Taiwan has been reopening and they did that they did
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:50.920]   the isolation the masks the contact tracing all of that stuff and they're
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:56.040]   returning to functionality without the anxiety. It's a model of currently
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:14:00.840]   zero cases in Taiwan so that's... going on for like two weeks and I think Hong Kong
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:04.920]   is going on for two weeks Vietnam is going on for 10 days two weeks. Here's
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.960]   some video. Like we know what works we just lack the will to do it. There's some
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:13.480]   video from the Australian Apple stores everybody in masks. It doesn't it
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:17.880]   doesn't feel super safe to me but maybe I'm just you know I'm a germaphobe
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:22.920]   like everybody is. The guy taking photographs. Yeah yeah you're already
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.960]   you're a celebrity just for taking your life in your hands and going. I don't
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.920]   mean to be bitter I just apologize I've just been sheltered in place for so
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:33.160]   long like the rest of us. Apple stores in Germany reopening May 11th the Idaho
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:38.120]   store opened yesterday so we're so Apple slowly reopening it's been
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:41.640]   how long not quite two months that they've been closed all over the world. It
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:46.600]   closed in April right? You begin early April? Yeah and remember that the stores
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:53.160]   in China reopened months ago months ago South Korea is opening now Australia as
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:58.680]   I mentioned Austria opening and a few states in the US and more stores will be
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:07.720]   reopening soon. Apple COO Jeff Williams says he's optimistic about Apple. You
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:11.880]   know it's funny six months ago that would have been like what yeah yeah sure
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:17.640]   Jeff I am too but it's it's it's a little different now isn't it right? Post
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:23.320]   pandemic he says optimistic he's speaking to Fox Business. I'm
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:26.120]   optimistic as you look around you see the resilience of the people working
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.080]   through this challenging time and when I take a look inside of Apple I couldn't
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:33.160]   be more encouraged during the last quarter even though these are challenging times
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:37.080]   we watch three new products. I feel great about the economy in the long
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:44.840]   haul and it's just a matter of getting from here to there. He was asked about
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:47.800]   this year's iPhone releases but Apple's never going to say anything under the
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:52.440]   best of circumstances. Our supply chains are running largely at capacity
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:56.520]   and people are continuing to work. I couldn't be prouder of the team finding
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:59.000]   new ways to get the job done. People have been really resourceful and we're
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.920]   moving the ball forward. Now one thing they're doing is they are looking at
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:08.360]   places other than China to manufacture according to the Nikkei
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:14.600]   Times Apple will produce millions of air pods in Vietnam.
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:19.480]   You know made in there's a lot of there is a lot of reasons for Apple to
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:23.240]   diversify its product line. Having all the
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:27.560]   manufacturing in China from both a health perspective, political perspective,
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:31.960]   tariff perspective, all these things it's probably better for them to
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:35.640]   get a little bit more spread out than they happen. Air pods pro will continue to be
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:38.920]   made in China but the rest of the air pods range about
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:42.920]   three to four million units. 30% of the total air classic air pods will be made
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:47.000]   in Vietnam according to sources of the Nikkei Asian
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.280]   review. The majority of the Nikkei always makes me laugh. I know.
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:55.720]   Still produced in China despite some wearable electronics devices being hit
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:01.080]   with additional tariffs. So tariffs began this and we are starting to hear of
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:05.320]   chip companies and others looking to figure out how they can move
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:09.160]   production back to the US.
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:13.080]   There's been a lot of supply chain issues and
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:16.200]   yeah there there there have been a lot of supply chain. If we look at the fact that
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:20.760]   we can't get webcams. Everybody wants webcams right now.
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:23.800]   You can't get them. That's because they're all made in China and the supply
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:28.520]   chains are arrested. A lot of people are thinking that
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:32.120]   having all their eggs in one basket is probably wasn't the best idea.
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:40.920]   Apple's going to spend about $334 million to open a new factory in Taiwan
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:46.920]   according to the economic daily news in China. Apple will use the factory to produce
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:51.000]   mini LED and micro LED displays for future devices. They're not using micro or
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.520]   mal-LED yet. No there was a rumor they were going
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:57.800]   to for the XDR display but it turned out to just be regular
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:03.320]   LEDs with a lot of mini-LED-esque technologies like reduced brightness
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:06.760]   zones incorporated but nothing properly mini-LED yet.
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:10.920]   And that's the latest rumor I think from Guo Ming Chi and John Prosser both is that
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:15.160]   that stuff is now. Instead of late this year that's been pushed back to early next year
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:20.280]   because of all the problems logistics. Yeah actually Guo Ming Chi is saying at least
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:26.760]   six mini-LED products released by the end of 2021 including 14 and 16 inch MacBook
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:33.960]   Pro models and iMac Pro a 12.9 inch iPad Pro a 10.2 inch iPad and a 7.9 inch iPad mini.
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:40.440]   What iMac is going to look so good. Yeah so tell me what is a mini-LED and what does it mean?
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:46.680]   So yeah so they're confusing because there's both mini-LED and micro-LED TVs these are the
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:52.040]   assemble them and make them on arbitrary size. But they're so big like those micro-LEDs are so
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:57.800]   big. And they're very expensive. I saw them at CES the last time I will ever be at a trade show
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:03.240]   and they look fantastic but that's not what a mini-LED is.
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:09.000]   No so the like the problem is that LCD is still a good technology for some reasons OLED is better
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.360]   in that it has deeper darker inchier blacks and also higher sustained and peak brightness levels.
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:19.960]   So it can do things like HDR that LEDs really can't get to because they have a backlight usually
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:24.920]   an LED backlight that means the blacks can never get truly black and they just can't put out enough
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:30.680]   light to make them truly truly bright. But OLED because it has so many compromises like off angle
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:35.160]   the color shift the blue pixel the blue sub pixels wear up before the other ones they have
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:40.120]   to make pen tile displays they have burn-in issues when you start to dim them they do that pulse
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:44.680]   with modulation which gives some people and the list like literally goes on and on. So as good as
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:49.560]   OLED is you have to do so much work and Apple display does their own version of that Samsung
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:53.240]   display does their version everyone has their own mitigations that everyone's been looking
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:59.960]   for technology that is as easy to use as LCD but has like the HDR potential and the XDR potential
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:04.920]   of OLED and that's what many LED starts to get us towards because they have much smaller
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:10.440]   local dimming and brightening zones so for example you don't have to light up the whole panel you
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:16.120]   can light up very specific areas of the panel which gives you those darkness levels that that OLED
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:20.760]   usually enjoys and because it's localized light you can often go brighter without the same heat
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:26.840]   issues that you get with traditional LED backlights so you can have higher brightnesses I don't think
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:33.480]   it goes quite as high as OLED that's sort of a running battle but theoretically we should be able to get
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:38.440]   screens that are almost as good as OLED without any of the issues that we all see in OLED every day.
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:46.600]   So I've seen TVs with what they call full array local dimming or fault the idea is we have many
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:54.840]   many LEDs see all LCDs have the same basic technology and and LED TVs are LCDs or screens
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:21:00.600]   or LCDs they have shutters liquid crystal shutters that open and close electronically and light is
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:05.960]   passed through them you need a backlight a preferably a pure white backlight as you can get
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:10.040]   in the early days they were fluorescence and you in the old days you'd see screens that have
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:14.040]   bright spots at the corners. Or it's getting fancier now like the new ones use blue and then they
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:17.960]   pull the blue out afterwards because the blue can be brighter without distortion like it's getting
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:25.640]   yeah and those are the filters that are in the LCD part. And OLED they're all different too
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:30.680]   like the TV sets use filters where the smaller OLEDs don't use filters they use whole different
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:39.080]   technologies it's all really different wacky stuff. So LCDs are brighter they can go up to a thousand
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:45.800]   nits and because these backlights can be brighter the issue is how well and if
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:52.680]   cost or no object you'd have as many LEDs as you needed across the whole backlight with local dimming
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:57.880]   so that you could say well that's going to be the black sky the dark sky or that's going to be
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:04.280]   we're in dark mode so turn everything down except for these that gives you it doesn't it's not as
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:09.960]   dark a dark as OLED will give you which because OLEDs are on light you're looking at directly at
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:15.400]   the at the lip pixels but it does it can make it much darker and that gives you a much broader
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:21.000]   range of brightness and darkness than other technologies. Alex have we got this right?
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:29.640]   Yep. Okay. I don't need that. I mean it goes. Alex, sorry. No but I'm excited about micro LED I
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:33.800]   just didn't know what mini LED was so I wanted to understand the distinction there it's not the
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:37.960]   same technology at all. And Apple's working on the mini they're working on the mini LEDs for the
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:41.800]   large so the problem also is that OLED has never done well on medium sized displays they've got the
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:47.880]   technology nailed Samsung nailed it a while ago phone. So yeah yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Bea we kind of
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:54.680]   kind of borrowed Samsung's process so they've got pretty good OLEDs now too. LG's been working for
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:23:01.480]   a while they have a different a different kind of OLED process it's gotten better. But I love my OLED
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:07.800]   TVs I have to say that if you can afford it and you can darken the room those are the best TVs
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:15.080]   fantastic but you say that for like a 27 in Chaimak not ideal for well for anything from like a
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:19.400]   like the reason Apple's never done a tablet like Samsung will do them in small batches but
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:23.400]   they the the continuum like one of the problems with OLED is keeping the brightness consistent
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:28.120]   across the panel and TVs are completely different they use a whole filtration system to do that
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:32.200]   T phones don't do that but the panels are small enough you can't really notice but I'm on a tablet
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.800]   you'll see areas that are slightly brighter and slightly darker because the brightness isn't
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:40.840]   consistent and those panels are super expensive because they use more phone than TV technology
[00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:45.080]   and their yields aren't that like there's just not that much OLED Apple takes so much
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:49.480]   Samsung takes so much and the fabs just aren't aren't that many still. So this is the important
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:55.480]   irony and I'm often at pains to explain to people who say why can't I use my TV as a giant monitor
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:24:01.240]   the computer monitors have higher our higher standards yes you need a better screen than you
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:05.000]   do for your TV you don't need such a good screen for your TV even though you might think yeah you're
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.920]   10 feet away yeah and I do think we're going to continue to see the scaling up of the nits
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:15.560]   you know so we're going to see that that knit number is going to keep on you know increasing
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:19.880]   from hundreds to you know low thousands I mean that's one of the competitive areas that we're
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:26.360]   going to see in these monitors so as especially as people try to highlight HDR over other things
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:30.520]   they're finding a lot more people are responding to the brighter colors than they are to more
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:35.000]   resolution so we're going to see historically the stores and you like a brighter historically
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.560]   and stories they've always cranked up the brightness on TVs because they sell better that way people
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:44.280]   like bright and a lot of people a lot of experts say you're turning your screen your computer
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:52.120]   screen up way too bright right they yeah it can be and but I think that as we get more HDR content
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:57.480]   and as that content really starts to take full advantage of that that gamut that the the
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:03.400]   dynamic display will you'll get used to it we're not we're not there right yet right now I mean
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:08.360]   I think HDR is a lot more impressive than SDR but when you start seeing screens that are at you
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:14.280]   know three three thousand four thousand nits and then you go back to SDR it's really hard it rarely
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:18.120]   hits those four thousand hits or you would be blinded well we don't see those screens they're
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:23.800]   not yeah they're but those those screens are those aren't really publicly available I mean they're
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:28.040]   they're in commercial areas there are some that are getting up to like four thousand nits um
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:34.280]   well how bright is the HDR I think it's a thousand is it 1600 or thousand 1600 somewhere in that
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:38.280]   thing it doesn't have a peak 1000 sustained it doesn't sit at that you wouldn't want it to sit
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:45.160]   at that that's specular highlights or you know that's yeah right so yeah so it's still so we're
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:51.640]   still talking about it think imagine it being four times right four times brighter you know is
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:56.040]   what what some of these uh some monomers are capable of three three four times brighter but again you
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:26:01.880]   wouldn't want it sitting in front of you four times brighter oh it just depends it's it just
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:07.000]   depends on what the content is you know that that you'll get you get you get used to it you know the
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.800]   thing is that it's a problem you get spoiled and everything can everything be so clear I mean
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:17.480]   remember we think of it as a bright bright monitor we go outside it's still a lot brighter than that
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:21.720]   you know so it's not like our eyes aren't used to seeing brighter colors it just they just respond
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:26.840]   to what that what that is um you know but if I think that when we start getting into that 2000
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:32.280]   knit and above range we will not when monitors start becoming commercially available at that level
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:37.000]   we're not going to go back to str it'll be you know literally it'll just be allot yeah the ones
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.760]   that they use are the backdrops what are the screens they use in the Mandalorian as the backdrops
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:45.160]   those must be pretty bright they're bright I don't know I actually don't know what the brightness is
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:50.120]   I'll have to I know who to ask these are those these are those they don't use real sets they use
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:54.600]   virtual sets they're not green screens they're actual screens displaying the version and they
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:59.560]   light the whole scene yeah it's really yeah it's really well and even then you know the the uh the
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:04.120]   the horsepower required to run those screens you'll see stuff in the behind the scenes where it's
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:08.280]   still just green behind them it's not and you wonder why did they use the photo picture because
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:12.280]   because the lens is too wide and it's showing too much of the screen and they don't have the
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:17.400]   computer horsepower to draw that much of the screen at one time because these are massive
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:24.360]   massive backgrounds and so it still kind of pushes the unreal engine even with a super powerful
[00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:29.160]   computer to a point where we're still on the outer limits of of what what computationally can be
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:33.800]   done but it's it's such an exciting I don't know if you've seen much of the behind the scenes that
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:38.440]   they're showing now on Disney Plus I actually resubscribed I turned as soon as Mandalorian was
[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:43.480]   over I looked at everything at Disney Plus and I was like nope and I just I just turned it off and
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:46.520]   you know like I was like I don't need anything else I was here for Mandalorian and then they
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:50.840]   brought more Mandalorian back so now there's these behind the scenes and the first one with the
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:57.320]   directors are a little fluffy but but what's really cool is seeing the the LED technology that
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:03.400]   they're using for that show is going to change everything I mean the ability to you know see the
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:08.440]   you know for the actors to feel like they're part of it for the you know they it really makes it
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:14.760]   easier to act um but she moved on a green screen isn't it yeah oh yeah yeah and and also it's just
[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:20.840]   it's just it's faster in post obviously the it looks it looks more natural I think because you're
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:24.200]   not you're getting every little hair and you know all the little bits and pieces and there's things
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:28.440]   that can happen in the foreground that would be very hard to key and so so those are all things that
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:34.200]   that make it um you know just infinitely better yeah and so it's uh so that blue I'm seeing in this
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:40.120]   is that that's not a obviously that's going to be keyed in yeah these are real these are practicals
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:46.120]   right yeah but you can see let's see if they show yeah yeah some of these like that's in these cases
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:53.160]   they're those are yeah that's CES we saw it it was amazing uh yeah they were demonstrating and of
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:58.600]   course it's can't just be a static screen it has to be slave to the camera if the camera's on a
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:05.000]   dolly shot the screen has to change perspective otherwise it looks on his podcast he was interviewing
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   some dps who were home because like all the directors photography are stuck at home trying to film
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.640]   anything they can like using their families as the actors and their neighborhoods as they said just
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:17.640]   to get commercials going and they were putting like vibe controllers on their cameras so they could
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:21.880]   do some of the motion tracking they were used to doing at the studio it was just amazing there's some
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:26.680]   there's some a guy named there's a guy on on LinkedIn and I think you can find him on Twitter
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:33.400]   named Matt Workman and he is probably cutting all of the new yeah Matt Workman is is is basically
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:39.560]   cutting the the new ground there I mean it is if you're following on Twitter and follow him on
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:45.480]   on LinkedIn but he is doing amazing things with Unreal Engine and vibe controllers for the cameras
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:50.520]   and being able to handheld shots and you know he's getting closer than anyone I've seen as far as
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:54.520]   just like being able to really put together you know movies completely inside of that
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:30:00.120]   that model so it's it's pretty amazing stuff yeah they're shooting these in just
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:05.240]   in big sound stages but it looks like they're outdoors because they could put a screen behind
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:09.720]   them that makes it look like it's outdoors and while that screen yeah while that screen is just
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:16.360]   insanely expensive to build out and to and to run it's a lot less expensive than having to go to all
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:23.000]   these locations also or location is or even CGI and if a lot faster than CGI right I mean you
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.680]   don't have to oh there's CGI in there I mean you know that's that's what's back there you know
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:31.720]   it's yeah it's yeah but it doesn't have to be the same demand I would imagine as 10 years it'll be
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:37.240]   on our phones I know it's gonna keep on my side now 10 10 years you'll you'll you'll be it'll be
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:41.160]   yeah it'll be made by you know there'll be a lego version you know it'll just uh
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:47.480]   yeah Andrew Andrew Mazapa in our chat room says per American cinematographer the Mandalorian
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:55.720]   screens are 1800 nits. So that's bright but it's not as bright as we big someday they'll be and
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:31:00.200]   we'll get microlady on our watch first Leo so but from that scale down to our watch scale and
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:02.520]   the other thing is when you're shooting it you remember you have to remember that you have to
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:05.720]   also match that with all the lighting in the foreground so you probably don't need to get
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:11.160]   past 1800 because if you ever shot in front of a monitor you know well even the monitors that
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:14.840]   you have on set there you're probably not very not set at their full brightness because
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:19.640]   you're competing with all the light that is you know the if the monitors get too bright
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:24.200]   then you can't light the person in a way that they can be properly exposed. This is so freaking
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:29.880]   cool what they're doing it's amazing it's amazing isn't it uh yeah and so I remember Babylon 5
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:35.400]   was famous because they were using amigas for doing uh their CGI effects it seems to me that
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:39.880]   these these video these TV productions these movie productions this is where the cutting edge
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:45.800]   it lives doesn't it and remember that this is all for this is not going out yeah oh that's right it
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:49.800]   wasn't an amiga it was a toaster that's right well is it a video toaster was a card you put I
[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:54.520]   had an amiga 2000 then an amiga 4000 just for a video toaster when I was younger and of course
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:32:00.760]   the broadcaster that we use today is the descendant yeah of the video you tech yeah oh that's really
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:09.640]   neat um by the way another reason to get Disney plus I just saw that January uh July 3rd
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:15.080]   oh yeah Hamilton I know I'm finally gonna get to see Hamilton for the first time.
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:20.760]   July the original cast right yeah so apparently they shot a movie of it back in the early days
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:26.280]   when the original cast was still there and they've just been holding it this whole time it was
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:31.960]   going to be released Lin-Manuel Miranda had tweeted that it will be released in 2020 and of 2021
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:38.120]   Disney just announced yesterday it's going to be released early July 3rd on Disney plus COVID
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:43.560]   miracle. I hope I can get a UHD copy of it I'm you know I I really want it.
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:49.160]   Hopefully it'll be like Dolby Vision Dolby Atmos it'll be like be like sitting in the middle of it
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:54.600]   that's what I'm hoping for. They shot the two final shows I saw Lisa Michael and I saw the
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:33:02.520]   shows about a month before the ones they shot um and that was never to be forgotten easily my
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:08.680]   best Broadway experience of all I mean just really incredible so if you get a chance to see it
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:13.480]   it will be really worth it and I tell you what I'm keeping my Disney plus subscription
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:17.160]   just for that. Well I know that I know it's not that we're gonna see it once my kids know all the
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:23.240]   words by heart to every song and so I am running all the time in the background for the next
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:27.880]   I well especially in the in the land of COVID-19 there's a chance that they might watch it once
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:31.960]   a day like I just have to I'm gonna have to like figure out we're gonna set up like you know
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:35.880]   screen time is not really screen time it's Hamilton time like how much Hamilton how much
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:40.440]   can they watch you know what's but it's an amazing that we can go from like delighting in the Mandalorian
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:44.440]   which is the latest technology to the lighting and delighting in Hamilton which is a stage play
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:49.160]   I just love that about humans. We don't it's not the technology it's what the artists do with it.
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:54.280]   Yeah that's exactly right. Hamilton had physical practical sets yeah that were incredible but
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:58.600]   they were very simple and they're very flexible they would roll things around they had a rotating
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:03.480]   stage but it was now we need it yeah those screens when do we get a hammer what we need is a
[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:08.840]   Hamilton with the big LED walls that that Mandalorian has and then we can you know take it all the way
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:14.360]   to the outer edge yeah or a Mandalorian stage play. We could all be in Hamilton.
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:21.480]   You know what it takes Broadway. Let's see here what else can I talk about oh hey big
[00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:24.920]   guy big update I'm glad you're here Alex Lindsay I don't know if you use Logic
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:32.040]   Pro but Logic Pro 10 Apple has they announced this morning revealed that they are going to do
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:39.240]   the biggest update to Logic since the original launch of Logic Pro 10 new creative tools including
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:45.560]   a new version of live loops a professional version completely redesigned sampling workflow
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:53.640]   and new beat making tools this is the single best deal in music production if you have it's very
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:59.720]   unsto like this version is very geared towards electronic dance music and hip-hop and rap and
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:03.560]   and those sorts of those sorts of workflows I think it has something a little something for
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:07.480]   everybody but it's really heavy on the drums and the loops and the samples.
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:17.560]   Change it you think or are you saying it's about this one this one this one is this update is about
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:26.760]   the Owens yeah yes it's all about the Owens uh Finis O'Connell who's uh Billy Eilish's brother
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:34.440]   and her producer and writes all her music says he's only used Logic Pro X from day one and he says
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:38.120]   I'm getting back hours I used to spend in the studio building sounds and kits
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:44.120]   so that's I guess the new engine it's really amazing like it I don't know what it's like
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:50.520]   for a traditional music person but like I was looking through it this morning um and I have no
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:54.680]   musical talent but the way they've put it together I don't know how traditional music people will
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:36:00.120]   feel about it it might be more final cut pro 10 sort of moments but like it's like you can just
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:04.520]   put these things on an iPad or on this the Mac you can tap on them you can move them you can
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:08.920]   sample and you can turn the samples into a drum kit drum kit into a drum toy you can move your
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:15.240]   stuff it's almost like finger painting with music in a way that is completely separate yet
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:20.920]   empowering compared to like traditionally like a John Williams full-scale orchestra sort of thing
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:26.920]   and it looks like and I haven't done this but it looks like uh in the apple press release they
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:34.280]   show this image of a Mac an iPhone and iPad all working together on the same logic there's a
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:40.440]   there's a logic remote that you can get for the the iPhone and the iPad and it's pretty it's pretty
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:46.200]   slick you know and so it it you know you can do it you can have a lot of different controls and
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:50.040]   what's really interesting is how seamless it how seamlessly they've connected
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:55.160]   GarageBand to logic you know my daughter started in GarageBand taking classes at the apple store
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:37:00.280]   and she's now using logic you know and it wasn't she's 10 years old no my son my son made the
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:06.440]   same transition I got him started with GarageBand when he was maybe 14 or 15 and it didn't take very
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:11.480]   long before he said I need more and and it was it's such a seamless transition he already knew how
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:18.440]   to use it in effect yeah yeah and that's been the really uh the great seamless connection for both
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:24.120]   you know GarageBand to logic as well as iMovie to to Final Cut is you have all these folks that
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:28.520]   are using one and it's not a big jump for them to just go to the next one this is the real reason
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:34.360]   you should open the apple stores to get these these lectures going again oh by the way look
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:39.800]   they are amazing it looks good on the Mac Pro don't it oh and the XDR display yeah and that's
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:45.080]   their new their new tool on the top there they combine three panels into one to make it much
[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:52.920]   more streamlined this this thing yeah this is that's the new sequencer yeah I forget it's got a very
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:58.840]   sample name now quick sampler and quick that that one's a quick sampler the bigger one is a sampler
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:06.040]   okay sampler so these are for you to design your own samples basically looks like a NASA
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:11.160]   companionship to me I wish I do have to use this stuff I just think it's so cool me too
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:18.680]   I think um you gave me an idea Leo that right now I think you can you can take the apple classes
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:24.360]   online you can do the apple store class online and I've never I've never done it because they're
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:29.720]   it's like GarageBand for example it's kind of you know it's meant for the younger people and you
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:34.600]   know I feel kind of silly showing up in this old lady who doesn't know how to use GarageBand
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:41.720]   but if I do it at home nobody has to see me yeah and I mean you're a musician if I I deeply
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:46.120]   regret not learning keyboards because at this point if same if you could play a keyboard even
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:51.880]   almost rudimentary you could there's nothing you can't do you could imagine Beethoven could have
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:56.520]   done the whole symphony on logic but it's like math Leo I bet you could do it with these new
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:39:00.520]   tools because they're not the same as traditional music and your math coding brain would take over
[00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:05.160]   and you would just know how to arrange things I want to play with it Brian Eno well I remember
[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:11.640]   when he wrote his when he wrote his music he didn't write it uh in with notes it was all done in
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:17.080]   in samples he says all mathematical it's like a spreadsheet yeah and it's definitely different
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:24.360]   than than you know just writing a song like I can sit in front of my guitar and write a song no
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:31.720]   problem but I can't sit in front of a computer and turn anything into music it's it's a little just
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:37.480]   outside of my right I don't have my understanding like I can't make the connection with with music
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:44.440]   that I do want a computer or I mean on a on a guitar and music that you you know type on keys to do it
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:49.720]   they it just doesn't make sense is this capable enough to be a full daw or is it really just a
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:55.960]   loop machine I mean is it oh no logic people all albums get built on logic yeah so so and
[00:39:55.960 --> 00:40:00.440]   and they have for for you know a long time a decade ago I was in Zimbabwe I was talking to
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:06.280]   Oliver de Kudzi who's a very prominent was was a very prominent artist in Zimbabwe and
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:12.360]   uh and I asked him what he you know where what he finished the albums on he was like logic
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:17.800]   so he builds the whole thing and the he's uh at the time he was in his I think his in his 50s and
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:22.760]   he's building him all in his home studio is building all his albums on logic and so you absolutely can do
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:28.200]   uh all of that um you know anything you want to do I mean it really has it and remember that there
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:34.920]   is a 90 day free version so you can download a 90 day trial of logic and um and then try to learn
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:40.360]   it and see if it's the thing that you want to do uh I do think that apple should do more you know
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:45.160]   in the layer in the area of training around these and really intensely because right now people
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:49.320]   can download it for 90 days and play with it don't think about how you're going to learn it before
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:53.800]   you just download it because remember that 90 day starts when you download it so um and there's
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:58.920]   some great training out there but look at how you might um structure yourself to have an hour a day
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:04.520]   or or something or an hour a week you know to uh to really dig in and there's some great logic
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:09.400]   stuff on uh LinkedIn and a couple other places that you can that you can kind of find stuff I
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:14.280]   I can't say that I'm an expert but I do most of my stuff in logic at this point so I you know if I'm
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:19.000]   doing music I'll you know throw a sample you know build opens and closes and stuff like that and
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.840]   little sweepers and I don't do anything I'm not a musician musician but if I need a quick open for
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:30.520]   a live stream or if I need some some kind of bed for something that's simple uh it's really easy
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:34.680]   once you get used to a couple of the bits and pieces to throw stuff together and uh and throw it in
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:40.520]   there and it's and it's all royalty free that's why I do it for live for live streaming for live
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:45.720]   streaming knowing how to make your own uh jingles for your opens and closes and under and and beds
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:51.080]   and everything else is really important because you don't want to cross the uh uh the uh youtube
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:56.440]   eye it's just amazing at one of the apple events they had ash fellder who does a lot of the production
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:42:01.000]   for really I'm gonna blank on all their names but people anyone who's into music these days would
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.960]   know and like Selena Gomez types um and they would like send him a voice recorder of what they
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:10.120]   wanted to do and he was in the backseat of a car with his little laptop and he starts putting the
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:14.360]   whole thing together and he does the singing and his singing becomes a choir he sings something
[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:18.120]   else and that becomes like a whole other kind of person then he gets to his mom's house puts his
[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:22.520]   macbook pro down finishes a song sends it back to where she tweaks a few things and they have a
[00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:26.840]   rough for the entire production in a few hours which he said like his whole life he was waiting for
[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:30.840]   the computers to get out of his way and just let him work and they're getting really close to getting
[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:34.840]   out of his way and just letting him take what's in his head and output it to the world the other
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:39.400]   thing that blows me away I bought this from for henry you know must have been almost 10 years ago
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:45.960]   for 200 bucks and that's it i'm still getting updates forever education is all of them for
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:52.840]   29 you get every all of the prolapse wow so uh 199 and then there's you buy you can buy loops and
[00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:57.960]   samples and other stuff right is the remote included or do you have to buy that as well i think it's
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:02.600]   you just download that on the ipad like it's free like 70 gigs of stuff that i think is free like
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:06.600]   if you want to download it all around 70 gigs of music oh man yeah you got a brace for impact when
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:10.840]   you when you when you uh download it if you hit download all it takes a while to pull all all
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:17.800]   those samples i did that i did that for henry when i gave him my laptop i put all the loops on there
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:21.880]   and uh yeah it's like you had a large hard drive you can pretty much fill a hard drive with it
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:29.080]   all right now you make me want to go out and play with it it's really cool i wish it well you know
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:35.080]   we all have a little bit more time at home i expect i mean you could do punk on it right i mean it
[00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:41.640]   doesn't it's not just all you know actually we uh my next turn neighbor and my partner and i we
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:48.520]   recorded an album last weekend on he knows logic so he did it like we we just did it wow i don't know
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:53.240]   how to do it though i just plug in my guitar play music he did all of the the mixing and stuff on it
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:58.200]   so yeah you can't do that very easily oh amazing so it so it is a full digital audio
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:06.040]   work yeah he uses a he uses a um you could punch in all that stuff that yeah yeah what happened
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:09.720]   whatever happened to pro tools and able to live and all of those are those guys
[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:15.800]   tools are still there i think oh yeah they're still there but how do they even compete now i mean
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:21.000]   those are very very expensive i guess they're still yeah and they're well embedded you know they
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:27.160]   same reason avid is still around right because people are just used to it well it's there's a lot
[00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:31.880]   of really high-end folks and i and i do think i don't know there's a lot of tools that are built
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:37.080]   into ableton live they're very driven towards live performance there's also a lot of really
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:42.040]   heavy-duty tools built into pro tools that are really designed for what people use them for and so
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:46.760]   i i think it would be hard for them for a lot of folks who are making a lot of money at this to
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:52.360]   change cycles and relearn you know something else i think that probably logic can do it
[00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:57.080]   but i think that there is a you know a lot of people are going to finish out their careers using
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:45:02.280]   what they're using and and there's and there and pro tools enabled to live are incredibly powerful
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:06.280]   and the thing is when it's in your muscle memory and you just go i punch spend with bick
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:12.920]   why don't i still use my workshop yeah yeah and and i think that uh there's also but we're working
[00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:17.400]   both with logic and pro tools in the little morning group that in the office hours that i do in the
[00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:21.560]   morning we've got a couple folks that are doing collaborative where they're literally recording
[00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:27.000]   on each other you know with each other over over the internet that you can't jam together but you
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.760]   can lay one track down for the other person and then keep on laying something to sink yeah well it's
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:37.080]   yeah you're able to you know record the next track and then hear it immediately back i mean
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:42.760]   it's literally recorded into the into the track as you're playing yeah so it's a it's um where we're
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:47.160]   getting to it's pretty pretty amazing i guess who would really be mostly challenged by this is
[00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:53.080]   things like fruity loops fl studio uh because that's really a that's a midi loop system and you've
[00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:58.680]   got that kind of with garage band almost and are they are the instruments pretty good quality on
[00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:04.760]   logic yeah yeah incredible well and there's also are they recognizable like if you use them
[00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:09.480]   and then people hear it they'll go oh yeah he made that with logic i can i heard that sample uh
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:15.960]   really you'd have a hard time um uh because you're gonna modify them you're gonna tweak some knobs
[00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:26.280]   right yeah and and the and i believe that logic uh has the uh impulse you know for you know they
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:34.680]   basically done impulse recordings for some of the locations um and so you see yes so i'm playing
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:42.920]   right now at Wembley Stadium yep which i guess i'm told is is is is is i don't know how it happens
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:47.720]   because i haven't seen it but there was an npr thing where they were talking about these and uh they
[00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:52.600]   pop a balloon you know in the location and that they it's all that listen to how it echoes everything
[00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:56.920]   they know right well i don't i feel like they're holding out on us like i feel like i feel like
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:01.560]   i'm like come on you know there's a mannequin head with some weird headphones and there's got to be
[00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:05.640]   more than just a balloon there's there's got to be more than just popping a balloon in in the cathedral
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:12.920]   but but they they uh they say that that these are um that that's what it is but i you know it's
[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:17.800]   it's an interesting thing so but you can definitely have things sound like a lot of locations and
[00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:21.080]   there's a lot of different apps they're doing that that's like one of the new things is to make
[00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:25.720]   things feel like they're in a larger or smaller um by using by using that data
[00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:32.920]   um other stories there are many we've got lots to talk about but let's let's take a break and then
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:39.480]   we will talk about those in just a second uh and he has the week off it's uh it's nothing
[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:43.160]   nothing was wrong with andi i saw people going oh my god is andi okay yeah he's fine
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:48.600]   but we have so many people on this show that we're rotating hosts that we don't ever have more
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:53.080]   than four on a panel because otherwise nobody gets a word in that choice so uh laurie gill
[00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:57.640]   who's rotated out in the past thank you for doing that i appreciate that managing editor of course
[00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:03.640]   andi more alex lindsey who rotates in and out just because that's life for alex he's very busy these
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:12.440]   days 090 dot media and don't forget his six a.m master classes on zoom those are a lot of fun
[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:16.120]   with six seven a.m it's really starts at seven i mean if you get it you can come in you can come
[00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:21.960]   in at six that's why i missed it uh because i look up and i always say it i missed it but we go
[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:26.920]   for we go usually most days we go until nine so uh nine a.m yeah so we go from seven to nine in most
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:30.680]   days like your morning show and if you want to link people are asking well how do i get the zoom
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:37.080]   link go to youtube.com/alexlindsey you can see previously recorded episodes and in the comments
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:42.120]   right underneath there there's a link to the zoom it's the same zoom every time i gotta i gotta go
[00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:47.000]   to one i really do you got to see one the same it's we had this we had this this week we've now we're
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:53.560]   now in that 250 to 300 people per per event uh range and so every every morning there's this you
[00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:59.080]   now they're not all quite concurrent so it's about 200 people at any given time uh that are that are
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:03.720]   there two hundred two hundred and ten and uh it's just an incredible conversation and really smart
[00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:08.920]   really smart folks that are in there it's not just me lecturing it is me having a conversation
[00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:13.800]   with a bunch of other folks that in many times know more than i do i'm just stirring the pot and uh
[00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:18.680]   and so we've been able to somehow collect about 1,100 people and again of of those 1,100
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:25.080]   uh over 200 are coming every day every morning to um talk about media and it's everything it's
[00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:29.800]   it's a mixture of how to do virtual events how to stream live today we're talking about back
[00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:34.440]   hauling you know video yesterday we were uh i don't even remember what we were talking about
[00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:39.000]   yesterday but it was something really good but but tomorrow we're talking about how to build how
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   to set up remotes and the next day we're talking about video scopes and so we're talking about we
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:47.720]   go through very technical things very philosophical things we're talking about just the process of
[00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:53.960]   making media and um it is the yeah just i don't i don't know what got into me to start it but it
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:59.640]   sure is a lot of fun so hopefully uh and i and we we had a huge influx of folks a couple hundred
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:07.400]   people that came in uh after last week yeah so so i you know we love having uh mac break listeners
[00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:11.720]   you can just sit in the background and not you know just be a fly in the long way you don't you
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:15.240]   don't have to be you don't have to have video at all you you you have to actually raise your zoom
[00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:18.920]   hand if you want me to read a video when you come in you can you're in the background you can still
[00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:24.760]   ask questions and you can have access to the chat but you can't uh but you we won't see you in video
[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:30.760]   unless you ask to be uh seen by in video and so you can just sit and watch um and enjoy it and it's
[00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:35.240]   uh so yeah you don't have to do anything there and you can see a bunch of examples on youtube so if
[00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:39.640]   you want to see what it looks like yeah you can go up to youtube it's about one tenth the experience
[00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:46.200]   to be on to watch it on youtube as it is to be in the what we call the pit but but the uh but um
[00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:51.160]   being in the pit is something else just because there's so much going on and then uh but but if
[00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:54.840]   you watch it on youtube you can get a sense at least with the conversation feel like Alex this is
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:51:00.840]   what you were born to do okay it really i think you found you i mean i get found your mittier
[00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:04.840]   his blood i get up i get up every morning looking forward to it i mean it's it's like my favorite
[00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:09.480]   thing to do in the morning so i i get up and i i make my little my little rice and eggs breakfast
[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:13.480]   and i and i make make my coffee and it's like five a.m you know because i have to get up and have to
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:18.760]   get all settled in and uh and so i'm all ready to go right at six uh so for two and it's six as i
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:23.000]   said people just come in we start chit chatting but we really start answering questions at seven a.m
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:27.720]   um and and we move pretty quickly thank you for doing your kids just i roll out you and pull the
[00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:34.760]   blankets over their head as if you want towards the stream boy my dad again they've gotten really good
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:39.320]   at put they peek in they peek in to see if i'm talking and and there's i think i said last week you
[00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:44.280]   know there's this if i go like this you know that that just means that i'm on air and both both my
[00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:51.160]   wife and my wife is running zooms uh for uh spirit rock meditation so she's busy too she's zoom in as
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:56.520]   well the kids the kids run the house yes there is a lot of zoom there is and then the kids are either
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:52:03.400]   using zoom or or hangouts or me uh for their classes and so there's an enormous amount of uh i had to
[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:08.760]   get a whole other video uh internet line as you're saying your ISP must hate you but you know you're
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:13.080]   doing what everybody's doing i mean i think that this is this is kind of the way it is now everybody
[00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:19.320]   wakes up and there's zoom suddenly all day long we're all we all be doing twit leo you were doing
[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:24.440]   this for a decade before anyone else got the idea man i'm glad we have a 10 gigabit symmetric from
[00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:30.120]   sonic thank you sonic yeah and that of course is rene richy uh his new youtube channel is going
[00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:39.960]   great guns youtube.com/rene richy subscribe ring the bell hit the chimes be part of the pro review
[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:46.680]   just went live oh good how do you like it it's good i spent a lot of time explaining all the
[00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:52.680]   different engineering and marketing oh good uh stuff that went into the decisions to make the
[00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:57.320]   low end version versus the high end version and which one is better for who so now some people i
[00:52:57.320 --> 00:53:01.240]   think it would be better off with the low end version i'm yeah i have the macbook here and it's
[00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:06.360]   perfectly fine for me the 2020 macbook here but now i'm glad i waited because i just saw the
[00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:11.240]   rumor there's going to be a 14 inch mac pro pro next year is that you think that's always be
[00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:15.480]   something next as always yeah it'll absolutely i think as soon as i get the mini led pipeline going
[00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:21.160]   we'll have the new 16 inch macbook pro and then you 14 inch macbook pro um we'll start the swan
[00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:26.120]   song of intel and we'll just have like or for some people the last hurrah of intel and then we'll
[00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:29.240]   look at them they'll do in other words they'll do the same thing with the 13 they did with the 15
[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:34.920]   which is bezel bezel is almost yeah the war on bezel is leo yeah the war on bezels must continue
[00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:40.040]   our show today brought to you by last pass the war on passwords must continue
[00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:45.400]   passwords whoever thought this was a good idea but now we all have hundreds of them
[00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:52.360]   we have to keep track of them and the problem is you know people do things to make it easier like
[00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:56.440]   come up with passwords that are easy to remember you know your dog's name and your birthday
[00:53:56.440 --> 00:54:01.160]   and then that's bad enough because easy to remember means easy to brute force easy to guess by the
[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:07.800]   bad guys and then they exacerbate the problem they pile error upon error by using that same bad
[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:14.280]   password on different sites but i don't blame you of course you do because what else you're gonna
[00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:20.920]   do you're going to use last pass last pass is a password manager but so much more and we've been
[00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:24.440]   using i you started using last past ten years ago it's the first thing i installed
[00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:30.600]   every new computer every new phone every loot tablets everywhere i go because it's not just my
[00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:35.160]   passwords it's also i use their secure notes to keep track of important documents like my
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:41.400]   passports and my drivers license and my social security number it's it's just it's a secure enclave
[00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:48.920]   that is only decrypted on your device only you have the keys to last pass does not everybody needs
[00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:56.360]   a secure enclave right and if you're a business as we are you also need last pass for work because
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:55:02.040]   you know your employees are doing all those bad things you did with the easy to guess passwords
[00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:08.440]   they use over and over a gun and now that you've set your employees at home that remote workforce
[00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:13.720]   as important as it is to your business can also be a security risk last pass easily makes that
[00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:20.520]   transition from in office to in-home your IT team will remain in charge there's still the gatekeepers
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:26.200]   last pass lets it keep complete control over which employees or accessing which resources no
[00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:32.120]   matter where they're working you get unified visibility over access and authentication so it's
[00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:37.240]   you know it's never a mystery who's using what when last pass ensures your employees have secure
[00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:41.640]   access to their work applications and you know it's not just passwords they do single sign on two
[00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:46.600]   twelve hundred plus single sign on apps which employees love because they're easier there's no
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:51.640]   passwords at all and you'll love because they're more secure and of course there's last passes
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:56.760]   world-class password management when you can't use single sign on here's another nice feature
[00:55:56.760 --> 00:56:02.840]   as as the employees fire all fire up zoom in their kids fire up zoom maybe the internet gets a
[00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:08.120]   little bit spotty last pass does have an offline mode for both password management and
[00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:13.640]   multi-factor authentication so no matter how bad the internet is last pass continues
[00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:19.560]   to work your team will be more productive and more secure the collaborate better
[00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:25.400]   we love the shared folder feature and last pass each department has its own folder so it's very
[00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:32.360]   easy to onboard new employees i can't tell you how important last pass is to our overall business
[00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:39.320]   and i can't tell you how often i'm asking john or or russell or somebody for access to one of our
[00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:43.960]   shared resources and they'll say it's in the last pass of course it's in the last pass
[00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:50.280]   by the way thursday we're going to do a special event i want you all to visit in the past these
[00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:54.280]   last pass events we did one in boston were you know very limited number of tickets because they
[00:56:54.280 --> 00:57:01.480]   were in person but hey now we're doing it online cyber security and identity trends unlocked i will
[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:08.200]   be hosting a panel featuring steve gipson jerry bukeld who's the seesaw at log me in and our good
[00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:14.840]   friend andrew kean who's the digital refusal he's going to bring a dose of reality to the
[00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:20.840]   conversation this coming thursday one p.m. pacific that's may fourteenth one p.m. pacific four p.m.
[00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:26.600]   eastern will be streaming it at twit.tv/live and then you'll be able to download it if you can't be
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:32.840]   around at that time on our twit events feed uh last pass has really been a great partner with us
[00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:38.440]   over the years they you know they bought the studio naming rights and we're going to continue
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:42.600]   to do these panels which is great and i love it that they're willing to do them streaming online
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:48.920]   so everybody can participate we'll be talking about the you know the future of digital identity
[00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:55.320]   for businesses and individuals it's going to be very interesting i can't wait that's twit.tv/live
[00:57:55.320 --> 00:58:03.160]   thursday may fourteenth at one p.m. pacific thank you last pass and when it's time to go home make
[00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:10.440]   sure you take last pass along with you find out more at last pass.com/twit you'll get simple security
[00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:18.120]   access across every access point with last pass if you're not using it quick go to last pass.com/twit
[00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:25.160]   and find out how last pass can help your business employees stay productive and secure last pass.com/twit
[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:31.320]   good friends of the network and of the show and we're very grateful to last pass for all the help
[00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:36.600]   they've given us it's even more appreciated now in this difficult time.
[00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:45.240]   uh let's see oh did you see the x-ray of the iPro iPad magic keyboard that's iFIST.
[00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:51.480]   yeah really cool really cool the way this works so what what do you like about the trackpad?
[00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:58.200]   so people were wondering like at first people thought that it was a like a virtual keypad like
[00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:03.560]   the macbook roll because it was uniform yeah totally uniform but it turns out they made a giant
[00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:07.560]   i don't want to call it a butterfly switch that has such negative connotations now but they created
[00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:13.320]   a switch that's basically balanced no matter which part of it you push on which is very different
[00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:18.200]   than the lever mechanisms from traditional trackpads it's it works so beautifully and it's
[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:23.400]   indistinguishable from the haptic engine i mean uh yeah but did they not use a haptic engine because
[00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:28.520]   that would have been too complex or too much weight or too why do you think they made a button too
[00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:37.400]   better or he's draining oh maybe that's a good point yeah yeah it's very cool to see the x-ray
[00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:43.000]   i just love it and how it's all wired and all put together it's well engineered well and it turns
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:49.480]   out it's not innovating anymore might buy some things yeah these are these the scissor switches
[00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:55.880]   these lines here like that those are the things that hold the key cap on i believe oh okay okay
[00:59:55.880 --> 01:00:05.160]   um the palm is going for a little and these are metal plates for for structural integrity that's
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:10.920]   part of the reasons heavy but also i think really important so you don't get a bendy i saw some
[01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:14.600]   people complaining about the taffeta that they use to cover it and i know microsoft before i
[01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:20.760]   used alcatera and there's just they're all obsessed with fabrics and like chitos get on them like they
[01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:26.520]   don't understand how messy normal humans are but i feel like this at least you can clean this when
[01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:31.000]   you need to be gorgeous i'm really i couldn't be happier i think they're i mean it has to be at
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   that price because it's really expensive but if you can afford it that is nice that is really nice
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:43.640]   um i don't the deluxe keyboard i don't want to skim over your uh macbook pro review they actually
[01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:51.640]   uh me too it's so long leave they put it on i'm more how long how long is it rinae it's like 3,500
[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:57.640]   words and 20 minutes of video wow there's a lot to say about something that i mean is it really
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:03.320]   revolutionary uh it looks like the old no so like pro the whole thing that kills me is that everyone
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:07.960]   right after the six years came out goes just give us that magic keyboard on the other we don't
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:12.760]   care don't do any other updates just give us those magic keyboards on everything and apples like
[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:16.440]   okay and they're like well where's where where are the rest of the updates we will love the
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:21.800]   group but the thing i think the thing that's mostly misunderstood is that apple has fixed has
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:26.440]   not fixed but they have price points that they want to hit and they build a device to fit that price
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:32.840]   point and the lower end macbook pro it has a it has a job to do and that is you know they want a
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:36.840]   macbook that's that's at that price point which is really hard to do with tense gen chips because
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:41.960]   they're like double or triple the price of the eighth gen chips but they also are you series chips
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:45.960]   not the y series chips that are inside the air and there are some people that just prefer the
[01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:50.840]   design or aspirationally they just consider themselves pros and they want to buy something with the
[01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:55.400]   word pro on it and it better be you know not a penny more than they want to pay for it so you
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:59.880]   have sort of and then other people are upset that the really high end one is close to the price of
[01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:05.720]   the 16 inch but you're paying for some of the portability not just all of the power for trade-offs so i
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:10.600]   mean i just meant i just explained as much as i could leo well one thing i'm going to give apple
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:17.320]   a lot of credit for uh as you probably know black hat and def con are going virtual they've been
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:24.920]   called off uh because of covid for obvious reasons but there are some already some presentations by
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:32.360]   security researchers uh that they had planned to do a black hat including thunder spy and i'm sure
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:37.000]   steve kissen will give us more information we've always known that one of the problems
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:44.600]   with thunderbolt is just like firewire before it it offers direct memory access so theoretically
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:52.280]   you could use a thunderbolt port to read ram and by doing that uh you could also read anything
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:58.280]   that's going on in memory you could even perhaps and this it turns out to be the case modify firmware
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:04.760]   or hack a machine uh i'd hover in university of technology researcher bjorn rottenberg
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:11.880]   revealed the details of a new attack he calls thunder spy now here's the bottom line i'll give
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:18.760]   you the bottom line first it affects almost all windows and linux pcs even if they have
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:25.480]   entails late security protections built in it affects zero macintosh computers
[01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:31.640]   it does kind of an evil made though right so like it is a physical they have to have physical access
[01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:37.800]   so that should re-exert you also right and it it does affect you if you're using uh parallels
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:45.240]   like so if you're running the os funny oh man yeah so i mean but it affects your running windows
[01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:50.600]   there's a mac it would affect you yes right so don't so the point is that the hardware doesn't
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:56.360]   isn't immune to it it's just the the the mac os itself is immune to it yeah um or it's not immune
[01:03:56.360 --> 01:04:00.120]   like they can get part of the way in but apple does i forget the details of it because there
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:04.920]   was some argument about whether it was completely unaffected or because like they could get the first
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:10.600]   part going but was taught by the second part of it but you're you're much safer it also explains
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:16.520]   because uh microsoft is getting some heat when they announced the new surface devices last week that
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:24.360]   there's still no thunderbolt on microsoft uh and their response was a little cagey but i think now
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:30.040]   we understand why it's a security issue on windows machines um intel created something called
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:37.080]   kernel direct memory access protection kdma which prevents the attack but because it also makes it
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:43.240]   less compatible with existing thunderbolt devices it's not on a lot of machines including del's
[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:50.200]   latest laptops well and it's also one of the like this these kinds of concerns is also when i'm
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:54.840]   going out a lot of times if i make a decision like am i really going to do heavy lifting today
[01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:59.880]   or am i going to just be writing and interacting and working on things and even keynotes or whatever
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:04.680]   i'm going to do uh and if i don't think i'm going to use do something with my laptop i often won't
[01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:08.440]   take it and it's and part of it is because it's got a bunch of data on it that i don't want to lose
[01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:11.720]   i don't want to think about i mean i back up most of it's at this point but i don't want to try to
[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:17.000]   rebuild it if i don't have to and so uh but but from a security perspective you know you want to
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.880]   think about especially when you're traveling um you know and this is in general it's just no
[01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:25.640]   matter what you're attaching to and what you're looking at and everything else your ios
[01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:32.600]   device is going to be a lot more secure than than any other piece of hardware we should also like
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:38.440]   i wouldn't give sorry we should also point out that this is not a kind of a non-trivial attack
[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:43.880]   right bird yeah this is this is someone someone is rear very very committed to your data like
[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:49.480]   this is like Daniel Craig shows up in your apartment yes this is for N-E-N-S-A to use against you or
[01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:53.800]   the CIA or the FBI to use against you the only thing i was going to add is that window like i don't
[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:57.960]   want to give Microsoft too much credit because they've been very slow to adopt USB-C and like that
[01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:02.280]   doesn't explain why they didn't adopt thunderbolt years ago um and why they're not adopting you
[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:05.880]   like it would be nice if they said yeah we know thunderbolt is an old technology we're coming
[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:11.000]   out with us before everybody else right so i like this played into their conservatism i don't think
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:16.360]   it played into their foresight maybe maybe you're right yeah it's just something that it's nice that
[01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:21.720]   Mac users don't have to worry about this and i guess that's because apple has included the i
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:26.280]   don't know if it's the intel kernel protection or what apple's done to protect it do you know
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:34.120]   i believe it's it's a it's a Mac technology that they're using okay and i feel this because i was
[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:39.960]   complaining so much about the security protections in the Mac all this week they were so annoying to
[01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:43.400]   me and even like my god because they were trying to do like level design
[01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:48.040]   games that they couldn't because they were 32-bit and they wouldn't work on caddling and i think
[01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:52.440]   ah why why can't i just use it as a computer and then thunder supply comes out and i'm like ah
[01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:59.560]   that's a mixed blessing macOS uses its own security mechanisms such as a device a whitelist
[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:08.600]   oh that's clever so you can't just randomly plug in devices into your into your device um
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:15.080]   there's other other things apple's doing um now this article in apple insider
[01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:20.760]   says the thunderbolt floss still leaves macOS devices vulnerable to some security work around
[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:26.680]   such as cloning the identity of a device on apprales peripheral whitelist to an attacker device
[01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:34.840]   so it's not perfect and as you pointed out uh Alex if you're running windows or linux on bootcamp
[01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:40.040]   you're just as just as vulnerable so the so it's a software protection built into macOS
[01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:46.520]   still thank you apple for doing doing it right it makes you wonder why i have my stuff didn't
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:52.200]   we had juice check hardware is hard yeah well there was juice check with the usbc attack i
[01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:55.400]   mean these things have ports people are going to experiment and try to get in the middle it's
[01:07:55.400 --> 01:08:01.640]   a bigger issue with a direct dma uh yes devices because they have they have really direct access to
[01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:09.720]   the memory yeah yeah uh did you uh read uh matthew panzerino's interview with craig figrid
[01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:15.800]   figridirigi or listen to the podcast that uh vatichi did with febriigi very interesting
[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:21.080]   information about the thinking that apple used the deep thinking apple used when designing
[01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:26.520]   the cursor and the pointer on the uh new mac ios 4 and i saw the argument after which i thought
[01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:29.960]   was fascinating what was the argument i didn't see that so there's two camps on this there's
[01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:34.040]   one camp that believe that apple uh really thought deeply about this and brought the
[01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:38.360]   cursor from the mac to the ipad in a way that was distinctly ipad and there's another group of
[01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:43.480]   people who believe that because of apple's abject refusal to make any sort of button affordance
[01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:47.800]   like there used to be prior to ios 7 that this was the only way they could bring it over because
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:53.400]   you can't tell what a button is any other way anymore that's a okay you're right they had to do
[01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:58.280]   it that doesn't mean it still wasn't clever it's ball yeah there can be multiple truths that
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:06.040]   use of internet it's not good at that yeah it's only because you had to yeah i still i love it that
[01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:10.600]   apple spends time thinking about this stuff and then i love it that they're they're willing to talk
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:18.440]   about the process uh involved and then by the way they did a great job it really is excellent i think
[01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:24.120]   are you using the bridge i'm like lori are using the bridge or are you using the
[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:30.520]   apple keyboard what do you i currently have the the apple magic keyboard on my ipad what do you think
[01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:37.080]   how does it compare you know i think that they're very similar i think that the keyboard on the
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:45.160]   magic keyboard from apple is it's just beyond better it's a real keyboard it's a real freaking
[01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:51.000]   keyboard yeah yeah it really is but the bridge keyboard is also a lot cheaper so
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:56.760]   there's you know there's there's things that that come in i'm you know there's advantages and
[01:09:56.760 --> 01:10:02.840]   disadvantages to either i think the bridge keyboard is a really great keyboard with a trackpad and i
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:08.680]   think if people can't afford or just don't want to spend that kind of money on a trackpad keyboard
[01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:15.480]   the bridge is definitely a great alternative but what you get with with the magic the magic
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:21.720]   keyboard for the ipad pro are the little things like that amazing cursor pointer design and
[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:28.440]   the trackpad itself feels better and works smoother in in term like in scrolling that's
[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:34.280]   something i noticed that the the magic trackpad just works better in the scrolling scheme of things so
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:41.080]   you know you've got you've got your your options out there in the world are you ready for some rumors
[01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:47.000]   prosser is added again he says your apple watch will soon be able to detect panic attacks
[01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:54.600]   yeah this is actually something that i think has been on on the rumor table for a while this is
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:59.560]   a little more specific to what the idea is which i think rene you might have been the first person
[01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:06.200]   that i heard bring it up that apple is looking into research for mental health with apple watch
[01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:10.760]   and you know panic attacks go along with that if you knew ahead of time that it was starting to
[01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:14.440]   come on you could you could do things like deep breathing and i think you could pull your car over
[01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:19.240]   exactly or at least go over yeah yeah i got a breathing session yeah which i think they'll be
[01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:24.200]   implementing wow i think that's really right so using using technology that already exists on the
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:30.520]   apple watch you don't necessarily even have to have a new model you can just you know and a program
[01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:36.120]   in the health app connected to the sensors that are already on your apple watch can help with that
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:42.280]   you know we've noticed that you seem to be breathing heavily or that you're sweating profusely or
[01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:47.000]   that your heart rate is up you're going to start getting ones what we noticed that every time you
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:53.320]   go to the casino you uh you know like so we we see that that you're it's tuesday afternoon and
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:59.880]   you're on your way in that direction we would recommend a smoothie yeah i like it i like it yeah there's
[01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:05.320]   nothing wrong with that do you feel like it's intrusive that it's not at all i think that's it's
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:12.600]   absolutely beneficial to people who might be uh starting to feel panokitax that this could be a
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:18.680]   way to help distract you from that thing that's starting to grow even whether it's using the
[01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:24.360]   breathe app or even if it's something like just you know reevaluating your thoughts at that moment
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:29.800]   and helping distract you and say okay i already know i'm starting to have a panokitax so i need
[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:35.160]   to get off track i need to start doing something else not necessarily pull over and use the breathe
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:40.520]   app but maybe just start thinking about other things to calm yourself down and i don't think
[01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:46.760]   it's intrusive i think it's wonderful and beneficial to anybody who has ever suffered from a panokitax
[01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:51.800]   you know anything that you can do to help calm that and and make it go away would be a benefit
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:58.600]   right it will be even better does not require this rumored blood oxygen uh monitoring but it
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:03.880]   will be even better if it can monitor your blood oxygen as well because uh then that's very useful
[01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:08.760]   in covid detection i bought an oximeter for my finger because it actually goes on my thumb
[01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:14.360]   uh because if you know that's an early warning sign of oncoming pneumonia if you see your blood
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:20.520]   oxygen level going below 80 or 90 or 90 percent and even outside of it is we're supposed to
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:25.720]   go ahead Renee well i was just gonna say these diseases were supposed to stop the invading
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:33.080]   aliens in world world not us you know it may have uh as in the watchmen brought us world peace
[01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:38.920]   we will all now realize we're on the same planet together there's no point in fighting we've got a
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:45.800]   bigger enemy that we can all join together and defeat or not only that were how it was happening
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:50.920]   what that our leaders i like are utopia uh
[01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:58.200]   huge aspect like the apple watch going forward because they've done a lot like the step by step
[01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:02.520]   they added like the physical coaching the activities then they added the blood you know blood rate
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:07.160]   sorry the heart rate monitors and the ecg app and the fall detection and they can start doing
[01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:12.040]   for mental health what they've done for physical health through everything through like panic
[01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:16.520]   attack detection but also through coaching or even just the ability to record your state if you
[01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:20.440]   want to share that with your therapist later the way you can record things for doctors later it
[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:25.960]   just seems like a vast territory that they can really add value if they if they
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:30.040]   can they'll experience yeah and i think that what's worked is the fact that they're not
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:35.480]   an advertising platform you know like that is what people trust apple do do this is the people are
[01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:39.720]   like yeah i think that you know they know that apple's doing everything it can there's no it doesn't
[01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:46.200]   it's it's vested interest is to keep your data you know as as secret as it can as it can
[01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:50.360]   to the point where the kubil nal and spitbit means they can't even compete at this
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:54.680]   i think it'd be hard you know if you're sharing if you're sharing the data with anybody or using
[01:14:54.680 --> 01:15:00.760]   the data to advertise to someone in any way shape or form and i think even if it's another division
[01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:04.520]   that's somewhere connected to your company i think it gets it gets pretty difficult
[01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:11.720]   yeah i i mean i already i i was a long time
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:16.600]   skeptic of the apple watch platform and i jumped on that bandwagon for the last couple of years
[01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:21.800]   we're all the time yeah and i just it just continues to become more and more important
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:26.760]   well it's like i think that if apple released a camera for instance you know the problem is is
[01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:30.600]   that i have no interest in the cameras when i when i find out that they're going to be used by the
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:36.120]   police or the use by something else you know i i'm just kind of like i don't know you know like i
[01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:41.560]   understand the value of it uh of having you know a neighborhood watch so to speak with the cameras
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:48.280]   and everything else but uh you know i i'm pretty intense on about the privacy first you know in
[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:54.520]   in a lot of those things especially especially not officially connected to outside entities and so
[01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:58.840]   so i think that um you know apple's kind of gone down that that right direction that a lot of the
[01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:05.560]   other companies have had a little more trouble with some uh credit to a company that i uh i guess
[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:13.720]   and as a disclaimer should mention i uh work for on the radio i heart media um they have a very
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:19.240]   active podcast division and konal bern who is a former head of uh stuff you should know network and
[01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:24.440]   now runs their podcast division has announced that they are going to do i think this is really cool
[01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:33.000]   uh series of podcasts for graduates may 17th will be national graduation day and these podcasts will
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:40.680]   include a lot of very famous people including Tim Cook so you can have i guess sort of Tim Cook's
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:48.280]   be at your graduation along with billem will in the gates bechie g free to pinto george lopez
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:57.560]   henry winkler john green mary j blige mike severt smoky robinson that's pretty cool and tom broca
[01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:03.320]   commencements we just find out for the class of 2020 very different this is very different than
[01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:08.840]   that service you can go online and get snat like get shankee kamio or and sing sounds on me yes yes
[01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:16.120]   it's not yeah no first of all it's free yeah um but it's also not personalized no it doesn't
[01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:22.040]   mention your name so uh thank you i'm hard for doing this i have hundred dollars to have
[01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:29.400]   tim cook just mentioned my name and a commencement speech and we currently congratulate our newest
[01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:38.840]   graduates for the job well done good morning good morning lory gill good morning good morning
[01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:44.600]   he's got to do that for virtual dub dub right like they've got to have an emoji tim cook
[01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:50.120]   cannot and say good morning good morning thank you good boy i i should point out that while this
[01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:56.200]   podcast is free it is sponsored by dorito's state farm t mobile and the 2020 census
[01:17:56.200 --> 01:18:00.440]   because if one thing i know about i heart media they know how to make money
[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:07.320]   so we don't send the census those go together those go together hand in hand no i think it's
[01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:11.880]   really great i feel so bad for uh people kids graduating from high school and college
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:17.960]   now because not only do they not get to walk do they not get that for ceremony but they're entering
[01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:22.760]   a world that is in complete collapse all around their heads but they're graduating and not making
[01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:27.640]   them redo the year that's like that's a positive that's true because when you come back this fall
[01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:32.920]   all the juniors yeah we don't know yet we don't know what you're gonna see
[01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:37.720]   it'll be like the spider-man movie when they come back from the snap and like suddenly the kids
[01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:45.960]   are all different ages oh man let's see what else disney land in china reopened yesterday
[01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:52.840]   whoo-hoo or he's going or he's on our way i know i'm heading out there right after this i don't i
[01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:58.040]   mean honestly i don't feel like i'm gonna be getting on a plane or going to a amusement park or a
[01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:02.360]   concert or even a Florida was opening their their resort right not their park but they're opening
[01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:07.400]   one of the resorts in florida and people were like just just like i just i don't know no no i'm not
[01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:16.200]   gonna tisk tisk open up if you want to but as one of the old people i'm staying home because i i don't
[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:21.640]   want to take the chance i understand i mean people need jobs they need to work people need a haircut
[01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:29.080]   um that's fine but i just i don't it seems like i just don't want to take the chance it seems like
[01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:35.640]   not fun i don't i don't have to i don't have to thank god right yeah yeah i'm the boss
[01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:44.680]   uh let's uh wrap this up with your picks of the weeks ladies and gentlemen start with the lady
[01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:52.200]   mrs laurie gill i have two picks of the weeks this week one reason is that one of them is
[01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:59.880]   shameless self promotion right on it's for a good cause so um sick burn my band we finally
[01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:05.960]   made some t-shirts that we were just starting to sell right before the the quarantine of course so
[01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:13.640]   we have a huge stock pile of shirts for sale and all of the money that is made off of this is going
[01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:20.280]   to be donated to the local punk club um that that we always get to play shows that so yeah they're
[01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:25.560]   closed of course yeah yeah they haven't made any money in a long time so you buy the shirt for
[01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:33.240]   sixteen dollars um we send it to you and all of that money goes directly to the colony slash um
[01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:39.640]   colonial cafe they have two different venues in the same same one thing so um if you if you feel
[01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:44.920]   like buying a sick burn t-shirt it's a pretty fun logo i i really like it who did that logo uh
[01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:53.320]   uh our a local artist his name is uh mat k mat shrug mat k shrug goes by a couple different names
[01:20:53.320 --> 01:21:01.080]   but mat k is it's like a duck with a head sweat band and a punk outfit flannel shirt running
[01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:08.440]   it looks it's cool i like it very nice that's quacks miss mich thrash a lot the sick burn
[01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:17.000]   mess i love that i love that quacks mich thrash a lot there so that's at uh sickburn dot bandcamp
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:22.760]   dot com and that's just the merch section of the of our band camp so but the the other thing that i
[01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:27.000]   wanted to bring up because i think this is just an absolute joy and i've been watching it or
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:33.480]   reading it every day it's called the office slack and i'm not sure who has done this but there
[01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:41.960]   is one person or one group of people or something who have literally started a slack channel as
[01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:50.360]   the employees of of dunder mifflin from the u.s. um office television oh no he's wanted to have
[01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:57.160]   michael's white jim angela ryan and kelly in my slack oh my god it's so funny you go there every
[01:21:57.160 --> 01:22:04.120]   day and it's a different episode of the office and it's it's literally just like trans transposing
[01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:10.120]   of the the tv shows but they're separated out by the different chat channels so one of them is like
[01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:16.760]   the party pant planning committee one of them is like the conference room accounting the warehouse
[01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:23.320]   and you can go into each one of those channels one of those chat rooms in in that the office slack
[01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:29.560]   and just read what's happening and it'll be just you know every hour or so something will
[01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:34.600]   someone will say something you can just keep it open with like you normally would with your
[01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:39.080]   normal slack channel and just like pop over like oh somebody said something what's going on right
[01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:46.200]   now like in the general chat channel right now um about 15 minutes ago um pambeasley and angela
[01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:52.600]   have just started talking about um sending uh sending photos or something like that oh it's
[01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:58.840]   the save the date so they're always they're always from an actual office episode yeah it's just the
[01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:03.720]   transcripts of the actual episodes it's all it is but they they make it seem like they're actually
[01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:08.120]   communicating with each other in slack it's amazing it's freaking brilliant i'm trying to
[01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:14.760]   join us right now is that make us our kids work no it's mischief dot x y z m s ch f dot x y z
[01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:20.360]   which sounds like a uh a punk art collective or something like that and so you can add if you're
[01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:25.800]   already a slack user you can add this if not you can download it's free right you just download and
[01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:30.360]   yeah it's you're just joining slack there you there's no payment you if you don't already have a slack
[01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:35.800]   account you just join slack and then you know they send you the little invitation and it goes from
[01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:43.240]   9 a.m. to 5 p.m. eastern time every day so if you try to join after hours it'll tell you it's it's
[01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:48.280]   after hours the office is closed like any off like any slack account they can turn off notifications
[01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:54.360]   at night right that's that's exactly that's exactly what you'd want i'm just i've got to quickly sign
[01:23:54.360 --> 01:24:01.320]   in and see if i can get it because i we of course use slack here and often felt like that it's really
[01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:07.400]   straight out of the office so this will be yeah so feel feel feel right at home it's kind of like
[01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:13.000]   what the office would be like if there was a such thing as slack back then when the show was
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:19.720]   on the air yeah yeah which there wasn't thank god no very nice so easy to get to
[01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:27.880]   um just uh what is the address again because i i've addressed is the office slack dot com all
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:34.840]   one word the office slack dot com the office slack very nice good yeah very clever and somebody put a
[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:41.400]   lot of work into that Alex Lindsey you're slack i mean you're a pick of the week you're slack of the
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:46.680]   week oh yeah so so i i think i might have mentioned this in a in a show earlier but i didn't make it a
[01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:52.840]   pick and i i think it's worthy of a pick watching the development of it and uh my my daughter uh you
[01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:59.320]   know she's she's learning the piano and which fits in with her uh doing logic and i wanted to make
[01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:03.960]   sure that she can't go to see her her piano teacher so i wanted to make sure that we figured out some
[01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:09.400]   way that she could keep moving forward she's got time she just doesn't have a piano teacher so i went
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:15.960]   ahead and subscribe to usion for her musician for the piano and i'm just amazed i don't even know i
[01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:21.480]   don't even understand how that works i mean it's like it is so it's she is learning so fast um you
[01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:25.960]   know on this app you know and it's 30 bucks a month so it's not like it's a it's not something you
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:30.040]   just lightly jump into i told her like if you don't use it i'm gonna turn it off you know because i'm
[01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:34.760]   not gonna keep paying that but i was paying but there's still a lot less than piano lessons well it's
[01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:39.160]   yeah and so and so the whole idea is and and what i'm hoping to do at some point is kind of merge
[01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:45.720]   the two together where the where the uh her piano teacher you know is is uh i'm not i haven't
[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:52.040]   figured out whether she's technologically ready to do it over over zoom or not uh but but the uh but
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:57.400]   right now she's able what a what musician does is it it it has you know really lets her learn how to
[01:25:57.400 --> 01:26:02.200]   use one hand then the other is look it's listening to the chords and actually telling her whether
[01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:05.960]   she's accurate or not and she can look at it in a way that's easy to learn but then she can also
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:10.360]   view it in ways that are you know that she's actually learning how to read music and you know
[01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:15.320]   she uses it all the time and she's just learning one song after another and she's 10 years old and
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:21.560]   doesn't have a now i don't think this is a replacement before people get upset on you know listening i
[01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:25.480]   don't think this is a replacement for the teacher she still needs to have someone expertly giving
[01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:30.920]   her feedback but i do think that there is an incredible power in her being able and i think that
[01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:36.440]   the the thing that i'm most interested in is this interaction that can occur in education where we
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:42.440]   have games or other things that support kids between classes and then still give them the feedback
[01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:47.320]   that they need from human teachers uh but but support them in a way that you know a lot of
[01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:51.240]   times what happens they develop bad habits or they go down the wrong path for a week and then they
[01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:55.480]   come in and they have to be kind of the teacher spends almost time correct error correcting that
[01:26:55.480 --> 01:27:00.920]   and so i think that there's a lot of opportunity there and and i'm just kind of excited uh that
[01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:06.680]   it's working so well so so anyway uh and then she seems to enjoy it and so it's you know she's playing
[01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:14.040]   all the time it's called uzician so it's uzician yeah yep and it's uh it's really slick so um so
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:22.680]   anyway so that's that's that's my my my pick for the week very cool uzician y-o-u s-i-c-i-a-n dot com yep
[01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:31.560]   and mr rene richie what about you what do you got for us so i was told by mr alix lunzi to just
[01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:37.240]   suck it up and learn motion over my stay home uh and i really want to i'm trying but you're like
[01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:41.160]   there's only so many hours in the day so in the meantime i've been using a lot of plugins and i
[01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:45.720]   know i'm sure people have picked us in the past but they keep putting out more and more stuff every
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:51.720]   day i feel like it's motion uh vfx and it's a plug-in company they make stuff for final cupro
[01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:57.800]   it's motion templates you can edit them in motion if you want to uh i've been using a lot of them just
[01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:04.680]   to do little little things like titling and transitions and there's just an incredible wealth of
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:14.200]   everything from like the latest sort of glitchy new age uh transitions to really corporate stuff
[01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:20.280]   to wedding stuff to party stuff to sort of anything you want to make your final cut
[01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:24.920]   stuff look a certain way at a certain level of polish do it but you're not good enough yet like
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:30.920]   myself to actually build it in motion they've built just so much of it for you and i will admit
[01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:36.760]   i know i know how to use motion and i still use motion because i mean like you know like i'm
[01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:41.080]   not going to do it all by myself you know like i you know they they they put tons of work into it
[01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:45.560]   and then i pay a fraction of the amount of money that it would take for my hourly for me to go work
[01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:48.920]   on it i mean they're spending days on something that's going to cost whatever it you know it's like
[01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:54.520]   50 bucks or less or you know for each any any one of these um it's it's way cheaper if i see
[01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:58.520]   something that they build that is really cool and then i like it's it's like stock photography or
[01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:04.440]   stock but it's stock photography that is animated and that you can adjust and change and and personalize
[01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:10.280]   to what you're doing it's what they're doing is um amazing really cool really cool and there's a
[01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:14.680]   lot of sales all like especially over the last few months they've had a ton of really good sales on
[01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:23.080]   too so it's it is really it's a motion uh uh stock motion what do you call them motion
[01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:27.400]   yeah and but they're not just stock like you can even if you don't know motion don't own motion
[01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:31.000]   don't want to go into much like if you do you can open them in motion and change things i've
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:35.960]   i've done that but like they also make it configurable enough that if you have no idea what motion is
[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:40.600]   you never want to open motion you can tap on something change the name of something change the colors
[01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:45.080]   turn effects on and off turn parts of them intro animations outro anime all those things
[01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:56.440]   highly customizable even just in final cut nice what's the URL motion vfx.com motion vfx.com
[01:29:56.440 --> 01:30:01.400]   i'm gonna do the same thing as you laura you gave me you gave me permission to do something a little
[01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:09.560]   self-serving we've always had a twit merch store twit.tv/store but we've added a new feature that i think
[01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:17.560]   everyone's gonna like we have now twit face masks in a variety of colors ten dollars you could show
[01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:25.400]   your loyalty proudly uh did you make these no these are not leos those will cost a lot more than
[01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:31.400]   ten dollars once the leos become available uh no i wish i could say i had these are actually quite
[01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:39.320]   nicely made the twit face masks are available at twit.tv/store i i should ask lisa i don't
[01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:44.360]   think we're taking profit off the store anymore but maybe we are but if we are it's not much
[01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:52.120]   profit are we do we make money off our face masks a little a buck or two yeah it's now you got to

[01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:07.000]   but uh unfortunately uh rights prohibited us from making tiger king masks on the twit store i
[01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:12.120]   actually think she got that at shinesty she got me one too but i'm not sure i'll be wearing the
