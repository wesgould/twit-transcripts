[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.600]   Renee Richie and Alex Lindsay will talk about Apple's quarterly
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.160]   results.
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.120]   They came out right after the show last week,
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.880]   but we've had time to chew on them and analyze them
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.800]   and tell you what it all means.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.520]   Johnny Ives does a rare interview all about the Apple Watch.
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.440]   And Andy explains why they'll never be a better Mac.
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.040]   It's all coming up next on Mac break weekly.

[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.560]   Hello, I'm back.
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.000]   And we have the full crew assembled.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.600]   Renee Richie is here.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.280]   Thank you for filling in for me.
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.320]   Was it last week that you did the show?
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.960]   Andy was last week I was the week before.
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.440]   They needed a week of recovery with Andy before you.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.240]   Andy and I go also here.
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.160]   It's great to have you back.
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.160]   I guess I'm back.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.400]   Sorry about the spell in the break room.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.880]   My second guest at Ferris.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.440]   And an emotional support.
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.680]   In studio with us, although you can never really tell
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.080]   because his cameras are always so good.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.920]   It's Alex Lindsey from the Lo Lo support.
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.520]   And we are gathered together today to celebrate
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.320]   Apple revenue of $61.1 billion.
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.720]   Turns out that the iPhone X was a horrible failure.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.560]   What?
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.760]   Renee, you can take a victory lap if you want.
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.240]   Because every time these iPhone X is not selling rumors
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.880]   came out, you said, well, well, well.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:31.760]   It's not just me.
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.800]   Tim Cook has said it.
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.320]   I mean, almost every reputable financial analyst
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.040]   from Ben Beharen to Horace Dedya, anyone who
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.440]   actually purchased-- everyone actually follows.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.000]   Apple says it's not true.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.920]   And you can't extrapolate one bit of supply chain data
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.120]   into a pattern because Apple pre-bys so much.
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.960]   Like they'll buy all the NAND flash.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.240]   Or they'll buy all the OLED displays.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.600]   And then later, they don't need any because they
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.360]   stopped the wild all of them.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.200]   Or they control their mix so carefully.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.920]   So it's just it's lunacy.
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.560]   And I did a video about it because I got super tired of
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.560]   having to do it every quarter.
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.000]   And I used that old Jim Kramer video where he says, you
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.280]   know, if you're short, on Apple and the earnings is coming up,
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.400]   what you do is you start a rumor.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.200]   And Apple publications love that story.
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.600]   So they'll do it every time.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.360]   And then you can tell your friend and they have, and all
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.000]   of a sudden, the stock goes down and you make your quarter.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.360]   I have to say, I think that that's happening an awful lot
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.880]   these days.
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.600]   Here's Tim Cook's quote from the analyst's call.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.600]   "Customers chose iPhone 10 more than any other phone each week
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.960]   in the March quarter, just as they did following its
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.240]   launch in the December quarter.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.440]   More than any other iPhone."
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.880]   So it's the best selling iPhone.
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.680]   And of course, iPhone is the best selling iPhone.
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.200]   It's the best selling iPhone.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.960]   That's the--
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.520]   In some regions, it's both.
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.680]   In some regions, it's the best selling iPhone globally.
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.680]   And in some places, it's the best selling phone.
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.480]   And in some major territories, it's number 1, 2, and 3
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.880]   selling.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.680]   What it's not is--
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.480]   Performing poorly.
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.040]   Yes.
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.240]   Well, I mean, it's on the flip side of that, it could be just
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.480]   sad to think that the other iPhones are selling even more
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.160]   poorly than the iPhone 10, which is selling horribly.
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.320]   I mean, I could say that.
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.960]   He's probably putting a brave face on for himself, as well
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.800]   as for the shareholders.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.560]   Who doesn't say that?
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.760]   It's the best March quarter ever.
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.040]   Revenue growth is strong, but of course, it's strong because
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.320]   the iPhone 10 costs--
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.920]   King's a ransom.
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:20.880]   $1.
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.040]   Revenue grew in every geographic segment.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.440]   Over 20% growth in China, which is huge.
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.680]   He says in Japan too, you know I was in Japan for the last
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.040]   couple weeks.
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.320]   Didn't see as many iPhones as you see here in the states,
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.520]   I have to say.
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.160]   But nevertheless, here in the states, it's easily the best
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.080]   selling phone, right?
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.040]   There's not even the--
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.000]   Yeah, what I thought was amazing was that there was--
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.400]   I can't find the graph right now.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.720]   I know I was looking at it somewhere.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.680]   But it was the top four where the best selling were the X
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.960]   and then the 8 and 8 plus.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:53.600]   And then the 7.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.640]   And the 7 was still above the Samsung S9, which was right
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.040]   behind it.
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.240]   But it was--
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.400]   so the fact that the 7 is a year old is still out selling
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.120]   is kind of amazing, as well.
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.120]   Apple also announced that they're going to do another
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.360]   repurchase of its shares.
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.600]   They had committed to $210 billion previously.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.920]   They're adding $100 billion to that.
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.360]   And they're repeating this money.
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.000]   And they still have lots of cash.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.760]   It's kind of remarkable.
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.800]   That made Warren Buffett happy because he has--
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.800]   according to his announcement, the Berkshire Hathaway
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.680]   Court annual meeting, he'd up to his apple share considerably
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.720]   in January.
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.960]   He's now got $4.2 billion in apple.
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.160]   And he says he wants all of it.
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.760]   He wants it all.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.480]   I'll take it all.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.640]   Thank you.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.600]   Because he is the king of buy it and hold on to it,
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.560]   investing.
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.640]   There's a real story about how people ask--
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.720]   Jeff Bezos, I think, asked him at some sort of conference,
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.960]   like, how come everybody isn't a millionaire by listening
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:00.800]   to your advice?
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.240]   And Warren Buffett said, because nobody's
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.880]   interested in getting rich slowly.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.320]   Yeah.
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.840]   Yeah.
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.800]   He's gotten very, very rich.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.800]   Very-- not very slowly, but fairly slowly.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.480]   He makes his money the old, fashioned way.
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.360]   And when you consider he was a child,
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.080]   he was growing out newspapers.
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.280]   It has been very slow.
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.200]   And it's been a slow, very continuous increase.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.640]   He said it's not a technology buy.
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.000]   Apple's not a technology buy for him.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.120]   Because they asked him, well, why didn't you buy Microsoft?
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.600]   He said, well, in the beginning, because I was stupid.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.360]   And now, because I'm friends with Bill,
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.520]   and I think it would be unseemly, why didn't you buy Google?
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.520]   He said, well, he said--
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:37.720]   or I'm sorry, Amazon.
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.960]   He said, well, Amazon's a miracle.
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.920]   And I don't buy miracles.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.480]   Right.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.160]   So he's a value investor.
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.720]   He looks for companies that are going to do well over the long term.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.760]   And so he doesn't consider it a technology play.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.120]   In fact, I think he says specifically--
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.680]   I don't buy technology stocks, but I just
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.160]   think the fundamentals of Apple are still--
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.600]   There's a new model beyond products and beyond services
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.720]   where Wall Street is looking at Apple as a cash return model.
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.640]   Well, 16% increase in the dividend payout now,
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.200]   and they're buying back all that stock.
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.080]   And that's a real easy narrative for them to understand.
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:08.560]   Yeah.
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.120]   If you look at-- of course, Jason Stell did his beautiful colorful
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.360]   graphs at sixcolors.com.
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.800]   And of course, Q2 is always a slowdown
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.840]   after the new phone comes out, and it's the same here.
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:26.600]   But if you take out these peaks of the new phone releases,
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.320]   the iPhone is doing very well.
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:35.640]   It's its best quarter ever going back all the way to 2012.
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.000]   So a very good quarter for the iPhone.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.440]   Revenue, of course, up.
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:43.640]   In fact, the revenue is the third best quarter ever.
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.880]   Pretty good.
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.880]   And of course, now Apple is doomed because they're--
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.440]   Like Google is too dependent on search,
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.080]   Apple is now too dependent on iPhone.
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.280]   Yeah.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.600]   So let's see, quarterly Mac revenue, also strong,
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.760]   but down over the last couple of quarters,
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.120]   year over year.
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.320]   Mac sales, though, down.
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.760]   Revenue was up because probably of that iMac Pro being
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:07.440]   so expensive.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.040]   But overall, sales, not a great quarter for Macintosh.
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.720]   Tim Cook did say, you know, I wasn't in town when he said it.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.520]   I'm sure you talked about it last week.
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.520]   We're not going to merge iOS and Mac OS.
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.880]   But he didn't say we're--
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.760]   we'll always make Macintosh.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.120]   I mean, I think he kind of implied that.
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:32.040]   But I don't think that him saying they're not going to merge
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.920]   means what some people think it means.
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:34.960]   There's a long way to go.
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.520]   I think-- and I think primarily Apple's need--
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.240]   there's a whole bunch of parts of their ecosystem,
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.160]   whether it's developing content that
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.720]   goes into the products.
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.320]   So that's your final cut.
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.640]   And some of the other products there, as well as Xcode
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.680]   and so on and so forth that are going to take time for Apple
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:53.880]   to--
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:54.720]   Big iOS better.
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.200]   Don't miss Mac OS.
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.840]   Well, iOS would have to be able to do those things seamlessly
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.120]   and as good as they do them on the Mac before Apple--
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.040]   But it can't.
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:02.840]   It might be able to.
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:03.680]   But I think--
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.960]   I don't-- I'm not-- I'm definitely
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.760]   don't believe that the Mac OS will be around forever.
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.800]   But I think that it going anywhere in the next three
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.200]   to five years would be unlikely.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.880]   We should mention that they're putting in
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:18.320]   blinds new, lutron automated blinds in Renee's studio.
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.880]   And that's the noise going on behind him.
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:21.840]   I apologize.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.000]   I'll mute in between seconds.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.400]   Oh, no, no, you don't have to do that.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.240]   It's not that noisy.
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.080]   People will probably hear it and wonder
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.680]   who's where it's going on.
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:29.200]   You're over--
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.280]   I'm thinking of something super interesting in that Apple
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.680]   is really uniquely positioned here
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.840]   because Microsoft wasn't successful with their phone
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.080]   products and they didn't launch their tablet products
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:38.600]   like Courier.
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.320]   So they maintain this huge legacy operating system
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.440]   in business, which is Windows and PCs.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.560]   And yeah, they're moving PCs into tablets and things.
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.080]   But the bulk of their business is still PCs.
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.920]   And when you look at Google, they're such a new company
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.920]   that they don't have this legacy computer business.
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.480]   They can go all in on phones and all in on tablets
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.400]   and Chromebooks and all these things.
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.440]   Apple is successful enough, at least profitable enough
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.320]   in computers to keep those around.
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.280]   And they're hugely profitable and mobile.
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.480]   So they're balancing both of these things.
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:09.400]   And I think if they were terribly unsuccessful in computers,
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.680]   they would have gotten away sooner.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.160]   Some investors want them to focus more on the big money
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.960]   makers probably wish they would go away sooner.
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.040]   But Apple's just their entire legacy in history
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.080]   is in those products.
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.040]   And I don't think they'll get rid of them until they
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.960]   have something to replace both.
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.480]   I don't think they'll ever merge the way that he says they
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:25.840]   won't.
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.080]   But I think at some point, technology will be advanced enough
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.440]   that we just don't need separate devices anymore.
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.000]   And at that point, it doesn't make sense to have a separate
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.280]   iPhone OS and watch OS and Mac OS.
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.840]   I'm just bothered that I don't think Apple is as excited
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:41.040]   about desktop computing as they should be and could be.
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.280]   So I don't-- I think that at this point,
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:47.200]   the Mac-- sorry, barring future evidence, which I hope
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.520]   is forthcoming, Apple has-- and Apple is content to say, OK,
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.000]   it's making some money.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.320]   It's not losing money.
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.040]   But we don't think there's enough of a future
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:59.000]   to make this sort of an investment, not just in money,
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.080]   but in time and resources and focus to consider
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.280]   what's the next level.
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.280]   How can we elevate desktop computing to the next level?
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:10.160]   I really believe that Hart and Sol, they are invested in iOS.
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.600]   And any great ideas that they have for the Mac
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:16.160]   to make it more 21st century gets parried into.
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.600]   But wouldn't that be an even better feature
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.520]   to make the iPad even more productive?
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:23.160]   So again, I'm hoping for more evidence to the contrary.
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.600]   But at this point, I would like to see Apple show some
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.640]   excitement about improving any desktop OS.
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.440]   I'll tell you what they are excited about-- service
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.640]   revenue.
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:36.640]   Look at this graph.
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.240]   I really want to see them break that up.
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.440]   That's almost meaningless to me.
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:42.040]   Well, they don't, because it is Apple music.
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.000]   It's Apple Pay.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.360]   It's obviously the app store.
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.320]   You have to think the app store has got to be a lot of it.
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:50.240]   Although, Cook did say that Apple Pay is kind of their secret
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.320]   weapon, that it's doing well.
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.960]   And Apple Music's clearly doing well.
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.840]   I don't know how much money they make on iCloud.
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.200]   Yeah, without breaking it out, we just don't know.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.080]   The big problem is this is more money, though, than iPad and
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.680]   Mac made combined.
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:07.640]   I mean, one of the issues here, though, is that Apple is
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:08.680]   making the services revenue.
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.240]   And you mentioned Apple Pay, but there's still a lot of
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.520]   countries that don't have Apple Pay that are waiting.
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.560]   In some cases, the banks are being intrangidant and it's
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.600]   hard to get it in there.
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.440]   In some cases, it sounds like they're waiting on Apple or
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.480]   they're waiting on enough banks.
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.400]   But just Apple Pay hasn't gone everywhere.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.400]   I don't think everywhere that Android Pay has gone.
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.160]   And yesterday, I'm sure we'll talk about Google I/O.
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.040]   Google I/O announced news in 127 countries.
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:30.040]   And Apple hasn't gotten it past three in, what has it, three
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:30.800]   years.
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.440]   So there's a really good services business.
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:35.560]   Apple News is a fantastic service, but most people can't
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:36.320]   get it.
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.960]   Yeah, Apple has some plans in that regard.
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.640]   We'll talk about those a little bit later.
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.360]   And I can give you my review of Google's new news product,
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.160]   which I think is quite good.
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:48.040]   It's something Apple probably will want to compete with
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.520]   directly.
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.520]   So anyway, a very good quarter, their best March quarter ever,
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.720]   and strong revenue growth.
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:59.560]   Any other tidbits that you noted?
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.120]   It's a week old news now, but it came, I presume, right
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.520]   after the show was over last week.
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.160]   So we haven't talked about that.
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.120]   Immediately after.
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:06.720]   The China story.
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.120]   The China story was the other one where, when we were
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.960]   saying Apple was doomed in China and they were falling and
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:11.760]   losing market share.
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.280]   And again, it was a good quarter for them.
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:14.880]   And maybe they're losing market share, but they're
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.920]   maintaining unit numbers and they're maintaining profit
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:17.680]   shares.
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.840]   So that was also a little bit of news that I guess was trying
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.520]   to suppress the stock and didn't work out that way.
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.800]   Look, a mystery said that one of the problems, of course,
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.560]   outside the US is that the dollar is so strong.
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:32.080]   And so that's challenging because it means their products
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:36.200]   are more expensive outside the US.
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.480]   Where they drop prices and lose margin, which then affects
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:39.600]   their numbers.
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:43.800]   But we found there is part of a market in most of these
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.800]   countries that is interested in the fact that it's harder to
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:47.800]   buy.
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:51.040]   So a lot of times I've never done it because I just don't
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.000]   have the time to deal with it.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.440]   But when I'm going to Africa, there's always a thing like,
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.920]   hey, if you can put 10 iPhones in your bag, we'll buy them all.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:01.800]   We'll buy them all at twice what you paid for them or 50%
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.560]   more than you paid for them because they can sell them
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.320]   because they're such a--
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.120]   in some of those countries, they're such a status symbol
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.440]   of having an Apple product.
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.680]   Tim said that the iPhone 10 was number one in China.
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.960]   I think what that means though, number one of all the
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.520]   iPhones, right?
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:19.160]   Yeah.
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.720]   I would have to--
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:21.680]   Yeah.
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.560]   What's interesting about that though, it's also the most
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:24.360]   expensive iPhone.
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.680]   So it's an interesting market.
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:28.040]   It's kind of an unpredictable market.
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.040]   He also, the touchpents, I'm talking about India and how
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.560]   important India was going to be.
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:34.120]   It's not clear if he meant number one iPhone because the
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:37.080]   thing is an aggregate Android is far dominant in market
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.240]   share, but not--
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:38.920]   there's so many of them.
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:39.560]   In Ag, there's something--
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:40.320]   any one of them.
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.800]   There's something to get individual--
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:44.440]   Terriers and hundreds of manufacturers.
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:44.960]   Totally.
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.800]   So iPhone 10 could outsell any other individual phone, but
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.800]   all those phones together, Android dramatically outsells
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:51.800]   iPhone.
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:52.240]   Yeah.
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:53.680]   Mac can share there as well.
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:58.120]   The Apple Watch is gaining traction in China, according
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.080]   to Tim Cook.
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.440]   Service is doing extremely well.
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.720]   So yeah, that's something--
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.360]   this is something--
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.640]   the financial folks care about more than you and me.
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:09.520]   But it's nice to see Apple has a--
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:10.760]   I think they've got a good little business.
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:11.760]   They're not going out of business.
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:12.360]   We don't have to worry.
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.920]   They've got a good little business there.
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.720]   They're going to be around for a while to come.
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.400]   Actually, it's fun in a way.
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:21.280]   We also celebrated this week the 20th anniversary of the
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:22.880]   original iMac.
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.440]   And it's fun, which was, I think, on Sunday.
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:29.320]   It's fun to think about where Apple was 20 years ago,
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:32.120]   compared to right now, 20 years--
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:35.840]   21 years ago, when Steve Jobs came back to Apple, it was
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.720]   just a few million dollars away from bankruptcy.
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:42.280]   So every chance happened in the last 21 years has been
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:43.040]   remarkable.
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:46.320]   And then shortly after, it was as if Steve had just started
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.320]   where he left off.
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.840]   He left with the Mac and came back.
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.760]   And then we're going to do the Mac again.
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.600]   And then again.
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:59.240]   Well, and he drew that famous quadrant where he said--
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.680]   because they had dozens of products at the time.
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.160]   And he said--
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.720]   and by the way, they were also selling clones when Steve
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:06.320]   came back.
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:07.720]   He killed that immediately.
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.640]   Drew the quadrant said, we're going to have professional
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.840]   consumer, portable, and desktop for products.
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.040]   That's it.
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:22.160]   And the iMac announcement was the consumer desktop, right?
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:26.520]   So here, I'll put a little bit of Steve here talking about
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:27.240]   his iMac.
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.160]   Come on in.
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:29.760]   He's bringing in a camera so he can show it off.
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.440]   You've got to see his thing in person, but I'll do the best
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:32.520]   I can with video.
[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:33.360]   This is iMac.
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.080]   The whole thing is translucent.
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.280]   You can see into it.
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:37.920]   It's so cool.
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.480]   We've got stereo--
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:42.320]   Some of that laughter is probably coming from Apple
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:45.120]   employees who watched Steve have a fit the day before,
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:48.520]   according to Walter Isaacson's biography, because he
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:49.920]   couldn't get it lit right.
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:54.240]   And he said, we're going to stay here until it looks right.
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:59.120]   He also had a fit over the button on the front of the iMac,
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:02.240]   because he had been told-- he said, John Rubenstein had told
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.880]   him, you're going to have a slot.
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:05.880]   And then instead, it had a drawer.
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:10.640]   And in fact, according to Isaacson, almost canceled the
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:13.880]   introduction of the iMac the day before, over that small
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:17.400]   point, and only went ahead when Rubenstein was able to
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:21.160]   convince him, well, next one will have a slot.
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.200]   OK, Steve, OK?
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.040]   Watch how much he loves the handle, too.
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:26.440]   We've got infrared right up here.
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.160]   We've got the CD-ROM drive right in the middle.
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.440]   We've got dual stereo headphone jacks.
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.240]   We've got the coolest mouse on the planet, right?
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.160]   OK, wait a minute.
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.280]   The worst mouse ever.
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:37.240]   No, it never is.
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.520]   It was the coolest mouse in that it did generate the
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:41.960]   frostiest reception.
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.960]   You could say it was cool.
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.480]   You just can't say it was functional, right?
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.380]   It was a third-party opportunity for other
[00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:48.920]   mouse makers.
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:49.440]   Yes.
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.760]   And that would be a good drop of ball.
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:52.240]   There you go.
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:53.040]   Come on around.
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.880]   All of the connectors are inside one beautiful little
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.600]   door here, the ethernet, the USB stuff.
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:01.840]   Around the back, we've got a really great handle here.
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:05.720]   Now, I should point out, this is a 38-pound computer.
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:08.040]   No one is going to use that handle.
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.440]   Well, no, it was just like--
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.480]   it was an echo back to the original Mac, so it's part
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.680]   of the design story there's telling.
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:17.600]   But also, there are times where you actually would like to
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.320]   move a computer from one room to the other, not because it's
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:24.240]   portable, but because, again, you're in an office and
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.600]   you're sharing or you're in a school--
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.400]   You don't need any handle, Andy.
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.320]   Well, yeah.
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.480]   If it's 32 pounds, Jim, you need to handle it.
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.400]   Johnny, I've put the handle in.
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.280]   He was actually a little nervous because this is a very
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:34.960]   expensive case.
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.440]   I think it was $60 per--
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.680]   and I put the handle in.
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:40.800]   He said he was very nervous about what Steve would say.
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:44.000]   But he said, look, we've got to put this here because it
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.280]   communicates that it's friendly and it's easy to shift
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:51.040]   around whether it's functional isn't really the point and
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:53.800]   jobs got it and loved it.
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.600]   He doesn't-- what he doesn't mention here is a
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.040]   significant missing piece.
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.880]   The back of this thing looks better than the front of the
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.480]   other guys, by the way.
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:03.440]   And then, round the side.
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:03.960]   Steve.
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:04.560]   Let's take one more--
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:04.920]   Vintage Steve.
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.560]   One more swing around it so you can see.
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:09.200]   This is what it looks like.
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.560]   And again, you've got to see one of these things in person.
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:13.240]   It was very pretty.
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:17.120]   $12.99, G3 at 233 megahertz.
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:20.560]   It had 32 megs of RAM, upgraded to 128 megs--
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.720]   not gigs, 32 megs of RAM.
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.840]   What was missing was a floppy drive.
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:27.600]   As it turned out, that might have been the biggest story of
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.160]   all of that in the Bondi Blue because people didn't make
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.640]   computers and colors back in those days.
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:35.680]   But the fact that Apple would make a PC without a floppy
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.320]   drive, now that was the courage, I think Phil Schiller was
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.160]   referring to.
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:44.000]   I was trying to think of when I stopped using floppy drives.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.920]   People were still using them at this time.
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.160]   But they put those USB ports on there.
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.320]   And the USB.
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:52.160]   Yeah, really, and the CD and said--
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.840]   and they were right in that case.
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:55.040]   Ironically, this--
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.480]   well, Mac has three headphone checks.
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.320]   I mean, I think the last time I seriously used a floppy drive
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.080]   was probably 1995.
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:03.280]   Yeah, this was 1998.
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:07.000]   So three years, it had already kind of dead for--
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.560]   No, it really wasn't.
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.200]   Well, for me.
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:09.680]   No, for me.
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:10.480]   I'm missing a trip.
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:13.040]   OK, that's because you were using files that were huge.
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:15.360]   Yeah, we were on set drives.
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:16.240]   Cyclist drives?
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:16.800]   Remember Cyclist drives?
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:17.840]   Oh, I remember those.
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:18.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:19.200]   Remember those?
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.440]   It was Bernoulli boxes.
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.760]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:25.520]   I was unpacking some of the last boxes.
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:29.080]   And I found my MO cartridges from--
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.960]   Oh, my god, magnetic optical media.
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:31.760]   Optical, yeah.
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.920]   Which were pretty damn cool when they're shining and stuff.
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:36.320]   But every time this does come up a lot,
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.560]   there's something that I like to counter,
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.480]   at least to present the other side of the argument,
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:41.600]   that people say, yes, see?
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:43.320]   And Apple was ahead of the game.
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.640]   And they've made the computer of the future,
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.480]   like, and brought it to us early.
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:51.280]   So, well, again, we forget about what an absolute colossal
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:52.360]   pain in the butt.
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:52.880]   The time.
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:54.720]   It was to own an iMac at that time.
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:58.880]   Because, again, yeah, eventually people got rid of floppies.
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:01.280]   But there were no flash drives.
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.720]   It was not-- there was no Dropbox.
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.040]   It was still very, very important to a lot of people.
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.200]   So that's why a lot of people were buying third party floppy
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:11.680]   drives that were designed to look in Bondi Blue,
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:14.200]   but Bondi Blue by other makers.
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:17.080]   USB was a brand new-- practically brand new standard.
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:20.240]   So it was really, really hard to find anything that would
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.600]   plug into it without something that would adapt
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:26.520]   to your old printers and stuff on and on and on.
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:32.120]   So make sure that that's part of the history as well.
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:34.680]   That's why I really don't like the courage story.
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:40.080]   Because, again, it's easy to be courageous when your users
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.760]   have no option but to drop the entire platform
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.720]   and switch to another operating system.
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:49.840]   It would be courageous if the iPhone were just one maker
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:52.240]   of computers that use that stuff.
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:56.320]   I could buy a phone with a headphone jack that runs iOS.
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:57.560]   That is not an iPhone.
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:59.360]   So that's why I just don't like--
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.080]   I'm not angry about it, but I don't like the word
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.560]   courageous in correction to this.
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:07.480]   And also, let's remember with the iMac,
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.800]   that they really had to make a first impression.
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.160]   They had nothing to lose.
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:16.080]   So as a quote from Steve Jobs that I hope is permanent,
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:17.680]   that look, if you're going to--
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:20.440]   there's nothing that feels worse than failing
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:23.200]   with something that you didn't believe in to begin with.
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:26.560]   And this is the iMac, I think, was the inculcation
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:29.040]   of the idea that if he's going to fail--
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:31.480]   if Apple's-- this is going to be the last Mac Apple makes,
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:33.800]   they're going to fail with a Mac that Steve Jobs and everybody
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.640]   who works with it really believes in it
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:37.960]   and really thinks it's a great machine.
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.320]   I had Firewire.
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:41.400]   I miss Firewire.
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:44.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.480]   You know, the connector story has been really
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:47.760]   choppy and ugly story.
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:52.400]   Firewire was born too soon and died too early or--
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:55.720]   No, I think that it was--
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.760]   so the rumor-- it replaced SCSI.
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:58.760]   Let's not forget.
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:00.760]   The rumor parallel ports.
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:05.480]   The rumor of both of its success for Apple and its demise
[00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:08.080]   was that Apple really pushed it really hard
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:11.200]   to get all the camera manufacturers to add the Firewire
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.160]   to their cameras, because now you can just hook it
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:16.080]   into your PC or Mac or whatever and do it.
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:20.280]   Then Apple then pushed a--
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:21.920]   because they were part of the consortium.
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:22.600]   Within two.
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:25.760]   So they pushed a royalty payment out
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:27.680]   for the PC manufacturers.
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:29.440]   And Apple paid it too, they didn't care.
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:33.840]   But the PC manufacturers wouldn't pay the royalty.
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.240]   Wouldn't pay the royalty.
[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:37.000]   And Steve Jobs knew they wouldn't pay the royalty.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.800]   And he knew that they wouldn't put it in their computers.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.640]   And what it meant was, is for years,
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.960]   the only easy way to get video into your computer
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.160]   was on a Mac--
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:46.880]   The only way to get video in was a Mac and a camera.
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.320]   So it was like, it just owned that market.
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:50.640]   He didn't care about the money.
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.600]   He just wanted to make sure that they put their feet in the butt.
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.280]   Now, in the end, that's what killed Firewire,
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.480]   because then this big market builds up.
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.280]   And then Apple decided it's going to change it,
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:01.440]   because now they're really the only ones.
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.320]   And as the camera manufacturers--
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:04.960]   Same thing happening with Thunderbolt.
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.800]   No.
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:07.240]   No, I don't--
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:08.520]   I see Thunderbolt on a lot of--
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:09.600]   It tells really--
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:10.080]   Thunderbolt's on a ball.
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:11.400]   It tells really drop the ball on it.
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:13.280]   I mean, they drop the ball on that and the DisplayPort
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:13.780]   connector.
[00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:16.120]   I think they were supposed to be three generations ahead.
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:20.440]   What they are now, they announced DisplayPort 1.3 and 1.4.
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.600]   And I don't think any of them have shipped yet.
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.880]   I don't think Thunderbolt is on schedule either.
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.240]   And that's entirely--
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:27.840]   Thunderbolt's also confusing.
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:29.120]   I think that's its biggest problem.
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.560]   Well, they said it was a benefit that it would match USB-C.
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:33.600]   But now people buy one and not know what it is.
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:34.760]   They just think it looks the same.
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:35.680]   What are the capabilities?
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:36.600]   It's the same connector.
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:37.880]   What does it do?
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:38.200]   Yeah.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.760]   And what are the cables rated for?
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:40.680]   I mean, it's--
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:42.680]   And then you have a poor Google engineer,
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.880]   let's do a review every one of them.
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:47.160]   And it's not only that, but you get situations
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:49.480]   where to save money--
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:52.960]   you might have two or three USB-C ports on a device.
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:57.120]   But one of them is basically just like a USB 3.0 port.
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:58.240]   One is a video port.
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:01.200]   One is super, super high speed that can be used for networking
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:02.560]   as opposed to--
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:04.600]   there are a lot of things I don't like about the ports on the MacBook
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:05.120]   Pro.
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:06.920]   But one of the things I absolutely respect
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:10.360]   is the idea that, nope, these are four absolutely
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:11.400]   equal top of the line.
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:12.960]   You can do anything with them ports.
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:13.960]   Yeah.
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:19.320]   I have to admit that I stayed with the 2015,
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:23.360]   as I see you have MacBook Pro.
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:26.160]   Because I wish it had Type-C Thunderbolt.
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:30.160]   But the fact that it has USB and HDMI and SD card reader.
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:31.080]   SD card, yeah.
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:31.920]   I know.
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:35.040]   That actually is a compelling thing to have those ports.
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.080]   For me, it's literally just the Mac safe.
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:39.040]   I would give up everything else.
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:40.960]   It's just-- oh, I wish it had Type-C charging.
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:43.240]   I would prefer Type-C charging because it's universal now.
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:45.160]   No, my problem is that I just travel so much.
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.800]   You're not going to lose money.
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.800]   Here's where it really becomes an issue where I look down.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:51.840]   I don't want-- is when I'm on a plane plugging
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.320]   into the little connector there.
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.760]   This pin points why it's so hard for Apple.
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.400]   And you kind of brought this up handy, too.
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.080]   As the only source of Macs, they have a problem
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.720]   because they can't make you and me happy.
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:06.920]   You want the Mac safe, I want Type-C.
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:09.680]   Macs are happy with four Thunderbolt ports.
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:14.640]   I think that if Apple had just left the right side
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:18.400]   of the computer the same and put two Cs on the other side,
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:19.920]   that's what Lenovo does.
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:22.000]   They have their traditional charger on one side
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   and the Type-C charger.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.920]   But I'm saying we've all the connectors on one side
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:28.240]   the same, Type-C on the other side as the transition laptop.
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.640]   They had done that and then done whatever they're going to do.
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:31.640]   It doesn't have any courage.
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.680]   There's no courage involved in that.
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:36.320]   I wish they'd be a little more fearful.
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:37.640]   To me, it always comes down to the keyboard.
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:39.840]   We'll talk actually a little bit about what Apple's plans are
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:42.760]   with MacBooks in just a little bit.
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:44.480]   I just thought we'd celebrate a little bit.
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:47.560]   The 20th anniversary, 20 years ago, May 6th.
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:49.560]   By the way, they announced it May 6th, 1998.
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.760]   Didn't ship it till August I think of that year.
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:55.080]   It took a while for it to come out.
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:57.840]   But we immediately, that's roughly when,
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:00.560]   it was the same timeframe as the launch of ZD TV.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:02.960]   And we immediately ran out and bought as many
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:06.640]   Bondi Blue iMacs as we could get our hands on.
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:10.480]   Really nice computer for its time.
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:15.720]   Our show today brought to you by 23 and me.
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:21.760]   Your 20th, the 23 is your 23 unique pairs of chromosomes.
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:25.400]   23 from mom, 23 from dad that make you you.
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:28.240]   Those chromosomes tell the story of who you are
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:32.560]   from your ancestry, to your inherited health traits,
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:34.800]   and 23 and me lets you read that book,
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:38.080]   your favorite book in the world, the book of you.
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.680]   I did 23 and me when they first started a few years ago,
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:41.320]   and I love it.
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:42.440]   You can get it right now.
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.760]   In fact, this is a great Mother's Day gift.
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:49.240]   75 detailed online reports about mom's genetic ancestry,
[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:53.440]   inherited traits, how her genes can influence her health.
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:55.320]   The ancestry reports are so much fun.
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.000]   I can't give it to mom this year,
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.600]   because I gave it to her for Christmas.
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:01.520]   And my sister, my whole family's done 23 and me.
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:03.120]   And it's great, because you could share the information
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:05.160]   with other family members.
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:08.880]   It's just fascinating where your people came from,
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.880]   not just over the last couple of centuries,
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:12.720]   but over tens of thousands of years.
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:16.800]   Your haplogroups, your neanderthal ancestry,
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:18.280]   what your DNA family is.
[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:19.040]   Mom will love this.
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:22.040]   You can use the DNA relative fighter tool to connect,
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:25.040]   and with new relatives.
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:26.400]   Isn't that awesome?
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.760]   And there's no blood, no needles, no visit to the doctor.
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:31.080]   You just spit into a little small saliva samples.
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.520]   All they require.
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:35.680]   And you'll get your results online within six to eight weeks.
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:39.720]   23 and me is a really exciting product.
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:40.760]   And I want you to try it,
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:42.040]   and I want you to get one for mom.
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:43.800]   Get one for mom and yourself.
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:47.120]   Now through the end of the week, through May 13th,
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.240]   you can get 20% off every kit and free gift wrap,
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.960]   20% off and free gift wrap.
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:57.720]   If you go to 23, the number 23andme.com/twit.
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:58.960]   It's a great thing to do with your family,
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:03.000]   with loved ones, children, 23andme.com/twit,
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.640]   and make it a special Mother's Day for mom.
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:11.360]   23andme.com/twit, we thank 23andme for their support.
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:12.980]   Mac, break weekly.
[00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:16.720]   - So let's talk Mac books.
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:21.120]   Supply chain rumor, but I'll give it to you.
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:23.880]   By the way, Ming Chi Quo is leaving KGI Securities.
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:26.600]   He's gonna stop giving us rumors.
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:28.400]   - No, don't just have someone else at KGI,
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:30.280]   exfiltrate that information from the supply chain.
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:31.440]   That wasn't a Ming Chi Quo thing.
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.440]   That was a KGI.
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:34.600]   - It was 'cause KGI was in the right place.
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:37.160]   - Are you suggesting that he was the Dread Pirate Roberts?
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.000]   (laughing)
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.680]   - No, I mean, it's just like, he needs,
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:44.960]   KGI needs information and the people on the supply chain
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:45.800]   need certain things.
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:46.920]   When you put those together,
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.920]   you get information from the supply chain.
[00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:51.920]   - So that's, because he says he's not gonna cover Apple
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:54.880]   anymore, he's gonna move to other spaces.
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:56.800]   - Yeah, but they still have investors and need that coverage.
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:58.240]   So I don't think it's gonna go anywhere.
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:01.240]   Digitimes, another source of regular source
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.960]   of supply chain information, somewhat less reliable,
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:06.440]   says that Apple has pushed back assembly
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:09.000]   of the new 12 inch MacBook
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.800]   into the third quarter.
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:14.920]   We were hoping to see, or 13 inch, I should say,
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:17.400]   we were hoping to see this 13 inch retina MacBook
[00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:20.680]   around WWDC time.
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:23.320]   The price was supposed to be under $1,000,
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:26.080]   maybe even as low as 8.99.
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:27.880]   The report says supply chain partners
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.280]   are now stuck with piling inventories of parts
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:33.640]   until Apple gives the go ahead.
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:34.480]   Renee?
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.840]   - I mean, this happens a couple of years ago,
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:39.840]   the Apple TV was supposed to debut at WWDC
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:42.800]   and it got pushed back till the September event,
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:44.800]   two years ago, the MacBook Pros,
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:45.760]   and you design MacBook Pro,
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.160]   was supposed to debut at WWDC
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:50.360]   and it got pushed back to the September event.
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:51.800]   And those happened.
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:54.320]   Sometimes it's software in the case of Apple TV.
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:55.360]   In the case of the MacBook Pros,
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:57.240]   I believe they were left waiting on Intel,
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:59.880]   because Intel has it to not only ship the coffee lake
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.320]   in this case, they've got to ship the quad cores,
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:04.840]   whatever the exact processors Apple needs,
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:07.440]   then Apple works with Intel to do things like PowerNAP
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:09.680]   and the other features 'cause they deeply integrate
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:13.320]   and they're integrating their own T chips now as well,
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:14.600]   which are handling some of the tasks
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:16.080]   and have to communicate with the operating system.
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:17.240]   So it takes them a little bit of time
[00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:19.640]   and if all that stuff is not on schedule,
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:21.880]   they're not gonna wait till two weeks after WWDC
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:24.120]   or six weeks after they'll just wait till the next event.
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:26.120]   So that's entirely believable to me.
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:29.360]   It probably is chips, but I have this fantasy
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:31.920]   that somebody called Tim Cook and said,
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:35.800]   "Tim, we can't sell these butterfly keys anymore.
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:37.560]   We've got to put a real keyboard on this thing."
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:38.400]   - This doesn't have it.
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.240]   This one doesn't have it.
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:41.720]   The MacBook Air has the old keyboard.
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:43.440]   - You think it will?
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.920]   - Well, if it's not a complete redesign,
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:49.040]   I mean, it depends on how aggressive they get with it.
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:50.600]   But if I want to make it $800,
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:52.400]   I don't think the problem is the MacBook
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:55.280]   is still so expensive they can't drop the price to $1000.
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:58.280]   And I mean, expensive in terms of what it costs to Apple
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:01.360]   to make those keyboards, to make those terrace drives,
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:02.680]   all the different components in there.
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:05.720]   It's an expensive machine to build for them.
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:07.320]   And the MacBook Air is not.
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:08.440]   So if they change it too much,
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:10.440]   it becomes expensive and beats the purpose.
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:11.400]   - So, okay.
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:14.120]   So I've conflated two things.
[00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:16.200]   There's a 12-inch MacBook.
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.040]   - Yes.
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:18.080]   - That's the 899 one.
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:18.920]   - Nothing.
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:19.760]   - The MacBook Nothing.
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:22.680]   - No, the MacBook Nothing is 1200 or 1500.
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:23.760]   - Okay, so it's not just me
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:25.640]   'cause nine to five Macs says the price of the new
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:27.960]   13-inch MacBook is expected to be around 899.
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:29.760]   But they're thinking, they've made a mistake.
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:32.200]   They mean the MacBook Air there.
[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.760]   That's the one that'd be less expensive.
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:34.760]   - They're talking about the Air.
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:35.600]   Yeah.
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:36.440]   - The next gen Air.
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:37.920]   - I mean, unless Apple changes the name,
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:38.840]   Apple can call it whatever they want.
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:41.280]   They could call it MacBook Edition if they want to.
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:42.600]   - It's also confusing 'cause frankly,
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:45.080]   they both feel the same niche roughly, right?
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:45.920]   The MacBook.
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:47.480]   - I think the MacBook was supposed to replace the MacBook
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:49.240]   the way the MacBook Air replaced the MacBook.
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:51.200]   But again, they just the costs have not come down.
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:54.320]   And that's a problem three years after production.
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:55.560]   - Yeah, I find it hard to believe
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:57.360]   that it wouldn't be a complete redesign.
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:59.800]   It really is a MacBook Air,
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:02.840]   it really is a monument to everything that Apple
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:04.840]   and now pretty much everybody else has walked away from
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:07.040]   in the past four years.
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:09.400]   So I'd be really surprised if it didn't have the,
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:11.400]   if it didn't have the new keyboard design.
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:14.680]   I'd be surprised, I'd be surprised,
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:17.760]   I'd be surprised if it weren't simply a MacBook Nothing,
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:20.960]   but with the cost savings of not having to make it so thin,
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:23.120]   not having to make it so small.
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:26.800]   And with some convenience features that they think
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:30.880]   that they can't delete in a $900 computer.
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:36.720]   - I'm sorry, please, I still have this fantasy.
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:40.600]   That's, that Apple, 'cause we do,
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:42.480]   I do think there is one piece of evidence
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:43.880]   that makes this not a complete fantasy,
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:47.280]   which is that these butterfly keys break
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:49.480]   and they're not reliable and they're harder to repair.
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:50.960]   - It's even worse than that,
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:53.080]   'cause we got, we got, Apple and Cider did a great job.
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:55.160]   They contacted a bunch of Apple store geniuses
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:56.600]   and a bunch of third party suppliers
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:57.880]   and they got actual numbers.
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:01.080]   And there was a spike in repairs in 2016,
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:03.200]   which looks enormous because the reliability
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.600]   of the MacBook Pro in general went way down.
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:08.760]   So the difference is bigger than it actually is,
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:12.800]   but by 2017 it was roughly in line with the previous years,
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:16.040]   but the perception problem is so bad, it's so toxic,
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:18.400]   it's such a negative sentiment that I think Apple has
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:20.280]   to address it and regardless of what you think
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:22.040]   about the mechanism, you have,
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:23.200]   I don't know what percentage of people,
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:25.040]   but people like Andy who don't just not like it,
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:26.280]   but actively hate it.
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:27.520]   And when you're a single vendor,
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:30.120]   you can't have products that a portion
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:32.320]   of your user base actively hates, it just,
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.760]   it's not sustainable.
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:34.600]   - Yeah, but that's insane.
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:37.080]   - I promise I think some people actively love it.
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:38.920]   - So you can't, yeah, but everybody
[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:41.000]   reminded the old one, I mean, that was a good middle ground.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.360]   - Nobody actually knows it.
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:44.160]   - Active, not only anybody that actively loves
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:45.560]   the butterfly keys, I think that-
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:46.400]   - Lisa does.
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:47.280]   - Oh, okay, well there you go.
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:49.000]   - I do too, Jim Dalrumpel does, but I mean,
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.760]   you can't have a divide like that.
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:53.480]   Almost everybody was okay with the previous keyboard.
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:54.960]   Nobody loved it, nobody hated it.
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:56.760]   Well, some people loved it, but nobody hated it.
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:59.680]   - No, I think that if I was traveling
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:02.800]   with the little 12 inch and I got kind of used to it,
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:03.880]   so it wasn't like a horrible thing,
[00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:06.040]   but the problem is I have like a DOS keyboard at home,
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:06.880]   with a clickety clap.
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:08.320]   - I don't know, it makes a big difference.
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:10.480]   - So my iMac, I have that, and then I go to,
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:15.480]   this laptop, it feels like you're just tapping on like a cloth,
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.800]   even with this one, and then when you go to that one,
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:19.760]   it just feels like you're talking and tapping on glass.
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.000]   And so I think there is this problem
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.680]   that if you have a real keyboard,
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:25.880]   which by the way, I would highly, I mean, I just,
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.760]   I still love the-
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:31.680]   - I would use the MacBook, I love the four factor
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:33.720]   on the MacBook, it's fantastic.
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:36.160]   And I would put up with the fact that there's only one port
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.880]   if it had a decent keyboard.
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:38.720]   - Yeah.
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:41.720]   - It's okay, I mean, people are sick and tired of it
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:44.920]   all the time, so I talk about this particular subject.
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:47.480]   All it says is that I think the MacBook is brilliant,
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:49.240]   not even despite that keyboard,
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:50.640]   but because of that keyboard,
[00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:53.280]   because the purpose of the MacBook nothing is,
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:55.360]   I'm willing to make sacrifices to have something
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:58.320]   that is so small and so light
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:00.440]   that the convenience factor is gonna trump
[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:03.360]   any inconvenience that I feel about having only one port
[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:05.720]   or having a keyboard that's sub-optimal.
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:08.200]   But it's, I would put it a little bit more strongly
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:09.240]   than a perception problem.
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:12.680]   This really is an actual problem for so many of the people
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:15.320]   who have the earlier generation keyboards.
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:17.080]   I think the jury is a little bit still out
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:19.920]   on the new keyboards, but it's,
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:21.960]   when you have Apple needs to come back
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:24.600]   and make sure that people know that
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:26.640]   if you have a problem with this keyboard,
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:29.960]   it's not gonna, and it breaks down one month
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:32.160]   after your warranty lapses,
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:36.080]   it's not gonna cost you $800 to finally have a space bar again.
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:38.080]   They should basically make an exception for this
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:40.560]   and say that if we, if it was damaged,
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:43.200]   that was due to the design of this keyboard,
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.880]   we're not necessarily going to have a recall of this,
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:47.240]   but it's on us.
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:50.680]   It's not, it's a consistent enough problem
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:52.640]   that if these aren't just flukes
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:53.600]   that people have in these problems,
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:56.360]   that is a consistent design problem.
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:59.040]   And I believe that they can afford to simply eat the cost
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:01.120]   of replacing that keyboard every time
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:02.680]   that someone says there's a failure.
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:04.440]   It wasn't because we put line,
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:06.400]   we put line juice on it and we,
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:07.600]   and the rice didn't work.
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:08.440]   It's because-
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:09.280]   - It's a good cost of it.
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:10.120]   (laughing)
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:15.120]   - So, all right, so WWDC's coming up three weeks.
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:20.560]   You think they'll be a refresh of anything at WWDC?
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:23.400]   - Last year we had the MacBook Pros
[00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:25.000]   and we had the MacBook,
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.440]   or the 12 inch MacBook,
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.240]   we had the MacBook Pros and we had the iMac.
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:31.320]   So everything got the Skylake,
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.280]   not the Skylake's way, the Kaby Lake update last year.
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:35.480]   So hopefully we have some coffee lake love this year.
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:37.720]   - All right, I think if anything we'll see
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:39.560]   at least a teaser preview of something
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:41.440]   that they will promise that we'll ship
[00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:43.640]   by the end of the year.
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:45.240]   - Many years, 20.
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:46.400]   - Exactly.
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:47.840]   I think we're gonna get to see a sneak preview
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:49.760]   of the new operating system.
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:51.360]   - Mac OS, oh, that's-
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:53.040]   - Yeah, I just like-
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:54.400]   - Well, we know we'll see that.
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.600]   And iOS 12, Mac OS, I don't know what it was.
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:58.320]   We didn't need Mac OS 11.
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:37:59.160]   - Sorry.
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:04.160]   - It's Mac OS 12.4, it's like 10.4, 13 or 14 this year, 14.
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:06.720]   - It's okay, I forget my-
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:07.560]   - They dropped the numbers,
[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:08.400]   they can never go to a left.
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:10.840]   - Exactly, now my mind goes to mountain ranges.
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:12.480]   I can't have to look it up every time.
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:14.200]   - Maybe Kregal finally get OS 10,
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:15.240]   sorry, Mac OS weed.
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:18.520]   It was just like, he's been teasing it for so many years.
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:19.440]   - All right, so that's good.
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:21.040]   That's something to wait for at WWDC.
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:21.880]   We should mention it.
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:23.400]   - I think it's also, it's worth pointing out
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:26.360]   that Apple's an incredibly number oriented company.
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:28.920]   So they have the complete data on the keyboards.
[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:30.360]   They see all the numbers,
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:32.280]   and they follow how many repairs they're doing
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.120]   on each one of them.
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:35.240]   And they did an extended replacement program
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:37.560]   for the battery on the escape key version already.
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:40.520]   And it really is internally a factor of,
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:42.400]   it hits this number, we do this program.
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:44.160]   And it's this number, we do this program.
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:46.920]   If it hits this number, then we do this program.
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:48.680]   And everything, as of last month at least,
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:50.080]   it hadn't approached those numbers.
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:52.360]   And that's why I just said it's a perception problem.
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:56.200]   Not that the issues people are having aren't bad.
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:57.400]   I had to replace the keyboard,
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:59.440]   ironically, the previous generation, Mac OS 12.4.
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:01.280]   And I had to pay, I think, 500 bucks for it.
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:04.000]   But it's an issue that is,
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.360]   that because so many people don't like it as well,
[00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:08.320]   that I think the entire thing is pick on talks again.
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:10.280]   I think Apple can't just look at the numbers.
[00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:11.680]   They have to actually look at the sentiment
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:13.160]   around that computer and make a decision
[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:15.920]   beyond just the wrong numbers in this case.
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.720]   - So there may be something.
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:19.360]   I'll say that the keyboard is not yet
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:21.520]   the equivalent of the Twiggy Drive,
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:25.440]   but it's starting to rip into the same conversational cloud.
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:26.280]   - Yeah.
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.280]   - Well, good.
[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:29.920]   Maybe there is hope.
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:32.160]   Maybe it's not just a fantasy.
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:34.760]   All I know is that I still have in storage,
[00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:37.960]   not the 2015, but the 2013 MacBook
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:41.200]   that I spilled the Diet Dr. Pepper into.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.400]   That's still in the box.
[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:46.320]   And now I'm like, maybe this is going to be like,
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:49.360]   when there was a last generation of stereo amps
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:51.800]   that used this special kind of tuner
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:53.560]   that is the best that was ever made.
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:55.880]   So maybe it's actually gonna be worth taking some place
[00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:58.120]   and having it fixed just to have the last one
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:39:59.760]   that had like really good ports
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:03.120]   and like the SD card slot and a better trackpad
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:04.800]   and a better keyboard.
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:07.280]   - If Gibson have a bunch of Palm 5s or something
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:08.280]   that's easier for you.
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:09.760]   I wonder if he still does.
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:11.520]   (laughing)
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:16.360]   So you can still get the effectively the same 2015,
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:19.000]   Apple still sells it for $2,000.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.960]   - Not the 13 inch anymore, just the 15 inch now.
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:21.800]   - Just the 15.
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:22.640]   - Yeah.
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:27.080]   I could see Apple maybe revving this
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:28.620]   and saying it's a classic.
[00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:31.180]   - And put a coffee like in here.
[00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:32.980]   - At some point though, that's an admission
[00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:35.860]   that there's a large segment of your population.
[00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:36.900]   - Well, there's a mission that there's
[00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:38.020]   because they're still selling it.
[00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:39.100]   That is an admission.
[00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:40.940]   They are still selling it.
[00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:41.940]   - Well, it's also, I mean,
[00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:42.780]   - It's also, I mean,
[00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:46.100]   - I mean, they're gonna have to still support
[00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:48.940]   the models that they were selling the previous years.
[00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:50.220]   They know that there are still people
[00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:55.260]   that are, that a certain set up is a no go in regard to ports.
[00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:56.180]   They've already got the tooling.
[00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:57.220]   They've already got the engineering.
[00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:59.060]   They cost them very little to keep selling it.
[00:40:59.060 --> 00:40:59.900]   We've seen this before,
[00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:02.540]   they'll keep like the old models still in the lineup
[00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:03.860]   just because they're at this point,
[00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:06.060]   there isn't any particularly compelling reason
[00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:08.100]   to delete a model out of the lineup.
[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:10.020]   I don't think that's an admission of Guilds
[00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:13.940]   or an admission of a lack of engineering in the new models.
[00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:16.380]   - Well, I think it's also like it's too grand for it.
[00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:18.060]   Why not still sell it?
[00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:20.300]   - I think like the overall part is that,
[00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:22.300]   you know, they admitted they made a mistake.
[00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:23.860]   They pay themselves into a thermal corner
[00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:25.460]   with the Mac Pro and they're doing a read it
[00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:26.780]   with a modular Mac Pro.
[00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:29.660]   They're gonna rebirth the MacBook Air
[00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:31.340]   because they haven't been able to get the MacBook
[00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:32.340]   to where they wanted it to get,
[00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:34.140]   at least it looks that way.
[00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:36.740]   And there you have the keyboard issues with these computers.
[00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:38.180]   And it just, you start to think
[00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:39.860]   you gotta really reset the Mac.
[00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:41.860]   It's not just resetting individual SKUs,
[00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:43.420]   but you've gotta figure out three years from now,
[00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:45.660]   five years from now what you want that product to look like
[00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:48.500]   and what range of customers you wanna service with them
[00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:50.580]   and then position it so that you have something
[00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:51.580]   for all of those customers.
[00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:52.420]   - Do you think that's happening?
[00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:54.820]   Do you think that they're doing that?
[00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:56.420]   - I think the iMac Pro was the start.
[00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:57.460]   I think the modular Mac Pro,
[00:41:57.460 --> 00:41:59.580]   if it ships in a timely fashion is a start,
[00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:01.460]   especially 'cause a Pro display,
[00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:03.020]   it's something they don't really have to do.
[00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:04.900]   I mean, I'm really happy they are doing it,
[00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:06.500]   but it's something that again draws resources
[00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:07.820]   from other things, but they believe now
[00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:10.540]   it's really important that they service the complete,
[00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:11.620]   'cause you look at the computer,
[00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:13.940]   that the display is the front of that computer.
[00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:15.260]   It's the human interface for that computer
[00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:17.700]   and they know it's now important to make that.
[00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:19.820]   And I think it's still was a mistake
[00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:21.620]   that they didn't make a higher end MacBook Pro,
[00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:23.780]   something that was the same way they made the escape key one
[00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:25.660]   on the low end, they should have made a high end one
[00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:26.900]   that had more powerful graphics,
[00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:28.380]   even if at the expense of battery life
[00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:30.420]   and had more RAM options,
[00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:33.300]   even if it wasn't low power RAM, all of those things,
[00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:36.300]   'cause that is important to the Mac community.
[00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:38.140]   And I think that's the part that they're starting to realize
[00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:39.740]   and what they're doing with their Pro team
[00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:41.060]   and working on it.
[00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:44.180]   I think they really wanted to make a higher power,
[00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:47.260]   more powerful Mac that have to use an Nvidia card.
[00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:48.100]   Sorry. - They just,
[00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:49.060]   they don't get along with Nvidia,
[00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:50.420]   'cause Nvidia wants to control everything,
[00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:52.660]   and Apple wants to control everything in their loggerheads.
[00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:54.020]   - I understand that they don't get along,
[00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:55.700]   but the ATI cards are just not the same.
[00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:56.700]   - I know. - They're just,
[00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:57.780]   they are not the same.
[00:42:57.780 --> 00:43:00.020]   - So this is really the bigger,
[00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:02.860]   not the question of whether Apple's gonna merge Mac OS
[00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:05.580]   or iOS or whether they're gonna dump the Mac.
[00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:07.420]   It's not gonna do anything at that extreme,
[00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:11.460]   but there is this kind of nibbling away at what the Mac,
[00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:13.500]   the importance of the Mac, it's not as important
[00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:14.620]   and there's this nibbling away.
[00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:16.460]   - You just feel like they're not gonna have a question.
[00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:19.700]   - I think one thing, I was talking to a startup entrepreneur
[00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:21.060]   that's doing pretty well,
[00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:23.700]   they've got 70 people working for him or whatever.
[00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:28.020]   And we were talking about coding and, or coders.
[00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:30.700]   And I think that we forget that right now,
[00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:32.420]   all of Silicon Valley, the whole world,
[00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:35.380]   is under this huge constraint called,
[00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:37.220]   they just don't have enough engineering staff.
[00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:39.980]   And so when we think about where they're putting their money,
[00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:41.780]   Apple's making most of its money in iOS,
[00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:43.220]   you know, and the phones and everything else,
[00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:45.300]   and that's where they're putting most of their engineering resources.
[00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:46.740]   So when these things all go slow,
[00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:49.020]   when something doesn't go as fast as we want it to.
[00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:50.540]   - You think it's just lack of energy.
[00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:53.100]   - They literally can't, they can't get them.
[00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:54.740]   And when they do, you know, the problem is,
[00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:58.100]   is that, you know, another person I was talking to a couple weeks ago
[00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:00.620]   was saying, you know, the problem is that you get these coders
[00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:02.220]   and they work the hours, they want to work,
[00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:03.780]   they do what they're gonna do, they show up.
[00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:04.620]   - There are other other things.
[00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:05.620]   - There's something that work really hard, he said,
[00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:07.260]   but there's a lot of them that are just kind of--
[00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:09.540]   - You need those, and they also work on the project hours,
[00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:11.100]   and there's a limited number of people.
[00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:12.980]   And they said, there's a lot of people who can write code,
[00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:14.060]   there's not a lot of people who can write--
[00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:15.500]   - Super can architect them.
[00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:17.420]   - The anti-herst those of the world, the deluxe.
[00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:19.020]   - There's another thing too,
[00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:20.900]   and a lot of those people also want to work on it.
[00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:22.140]   Like they want to make the next iPhone,
[00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:23.580]   they don't want to make the 15th Mac.
[00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:25.740]   But beyond that, there's a problem with data,
[00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:27.660]   and there was this great West Wing quote once where they said,
[00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:29.100]   "You know, I'm a pollster, I look at this data,
[00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:29.940]   I don't know what it means,
[00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:31.860]   does it mean you're not doing too much,
[00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:32.740]   or you're not doing enough?"
[00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:34.140]   And I think that's one of the problems too,
[00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:36.140]   is that Apple looked at the Macs that we're buying,
[00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:38.220]   and predominantly those Macs were not the high end Macs.
[00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:40.860]   There was so many people, Apple was going mainstream,
[00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:42.540]   the iPhone was a huge halo effect,
[00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:43.860]   more and more people were buying Macs,
[00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:44.820]   and more and more people were buying
[00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:46.540]   what would be considered mainstream Macs.
[00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:47.940]   So they started saying, well, if we make the Mac
[00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:50.020]   or Pro more like this, the mainstream audience will like it,
[00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:51.180]   more we'll sell more Macs.
[00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:52.420]   And they did, for all accounts,
[00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:53.860]   they were selling more Macs.
[00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:56.180]   But that is not the Mac that they were known for,
[00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:58.220]   that their traditional customers wanted.
[00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:00.340]   And the data told them that this would make more Macs,
[00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:02.700]   but it wouldn't make more Mac customers happy.
[00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:04.180]   And I think that's the misstep
[00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:05.900]   that they're trying to counter now.
[00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:06.740]   - Good.
[00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:10.380]   I mean, I know emotionally, I have no doubt emotionally,
[00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:13.380]   that everybody at Apple cares deeply about the Mac.
[00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:15.700]   That's not what, but there's just so many pressures
[00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:17.900]   from so many different places.
[00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:19.140]   - There's lack of engineers,
[00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:22.180]   the fact that iPhone makes so much money,
[00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:23.620]   so much more money than the Mac.
[00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:25.220]   - And you can't be a day late with iPhone,
[00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:27.820]   like you've got to think has got to shoot again.
[00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:30.380]   - There's the problem that Intel can't,
[00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:33.660]   I mean, we've just found out there's eight more specter flaws.
[00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:35.860]   I'm sure in the perfect world,
[00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:38.420]   if Apple had all the engineers it needed
[00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:41.900]   and did what it would be designing its own chips,
[00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:45.500]   making a brand new Mac with its own chips.
[00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:48.980]   And, but, you know, that may be 10 years off,
[00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:49.820]   that's a hard thing to do.
[00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:54.660]   - All I can say is that Apple had absolutely no experience
[00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:57.300]   in the luxury watch jewelry market.
[00:45:57.300 --> 00:45:58.980]   They figured out how to make and sell
[00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:01.980]   a $12,000 gold gadget watch.
[00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:05.020]   They somehow managed to create a,
[00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:07.020]   when they saw that it was important for them
[00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:09.380]   to make an inexpensive iPad,
[00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:11.300]   so they can continue to compete in education.
[00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:12.260]   And for other goals,
[00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:15.580]   they found a way to not only make a $329 iPad,
[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:20.660]   but make a $329 iPad that is competitive with the iPad Pro.
[00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:22.300]   This is a company that has proven
[00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:26.180]   that if they want to do something, it gets done.
[00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:29.500]   If they're not putting the Macintosh forward
[00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:32.660]   into making it a current product, an important product,
[00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:34.260]   it's because this is not something
[00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:36.500]   that they are highly motivated to do.
[00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:38.460]   It's not about resources, it's not about time,
[00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:39.700]   it's not about markets.
[00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:41.500]   It's this is simply not something
[00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:43.380]   that they're interested in doing.
[00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:46.580]   Unless again, we're at some sort of WWDC,
[00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:49.100]   and because of Apple not talking about something
[00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:50.820]   until it's done, they take the wraps off
[00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:53.660]   of the most kick butt Mac mini,
[00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:56.100]   or the most wonderful iMac they've ever made,
[00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:58.460]   and a retooling of Mac OS,
[00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:00.820]   that is like a breath of fresh air,
[00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:04.140]   like a butterfly coming out of a cocoon,
[00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:06.220]   that's the situation that we have,
[00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:08.380]   that I have to believe in right now.
[00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:10.780]   It's not moving forward because, again,
[00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:15.780]   this isn't a blame thing, this isn't an accusation thing.
[00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:19.260]   They are not interested in making a modern Mac.
[00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:21.660]   - I think it's a little more complicated
[00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:25.540]   only in that they have to take somebody off A to do B,
[00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:27.700]   and that's fine, but then you don't get A,
[00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:28.700]   and they make those choices.
[00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:30.380]   Like if we move these people over to the Mac,
[00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:31.740]   we don't get that iPad that's cheap,
[00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:33.300]   and right now that we'd love to make this Mac,
[00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:34.940]   but that iPad is more important to us.
[00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:36.820]   And John Ternes is working on the iMac Pro,
[00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:39.020]   so he's not working on the MacBook Air,
[00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:41.020]   and the MacBook, and the iMac Pro took this long,
[00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:42.540]   so now we have to shift them back to the iMac,
[00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:44.060]   and it's all these decisions every day,
[00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:45.300]   and it's not that they don't want to do it,
[00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:47.660]   it's just that when you have to do these five different things,
[00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:49.460]   and you can do four of them,
[00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:52.220]   Mac is always the one that seems to end up being fifth.
[00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:54.260]   - That's just an excuse.
[00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:59.060]   Again, I'm saying that they pulled everything
[00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:02.100]   into $100 iPad, yes they did.
[00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:03.460]   Did they pull people off something else
[00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:06.420]   to make sure that iOS got released on time?
[00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:08.340]   Yes they did, did they pull someone off something else
[00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:10.300]   to make sure the Apple Watch was on schedule?
[00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:11.220]   Yes they did.
[00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:12.700]   This is a company that we've just talked about,
[00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:15.660]   had the most successful quarter of their history.
[00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:18.140]   They make so much money that they're even bored
[00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:20.300]   of having money fight, even when they throw it.
[00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:23.940]   They went from $50 bills to bundles of $100 bills.
[00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:26.660]   They can make this happen if they were motivated
[00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:27.660]   to make this happen.
[00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:31.300]   They have self-driving car technology that they're building
[00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:33.740]   because they're interested in making this happen.
[00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:35.140]   - Why aren't they interested?
[00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:37.300]   - That's the case, why aren't they more interested
[00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:38.140]   in the Mac?
[00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:39.820]   - I don't know what I'm not gonna guess.
[00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:42.220]   I'm just saying that my belief, what I see,
[00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:46.260]   my belief is that again, if they were excited
[00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:48.620]   about the Mac as they were, as they are
[00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:51.140]   about all these other things, it would have happened.
[00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:52.420]   Just like the Apple Watch happened,
[00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:54.460]   just like the iPads happened,
[00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:56.420]   just like the self-driving car happened.
[00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:58.860]   All these things happened because they said screw it.
[00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:00.140]   I know we're not ready for this
[00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:02.020]   but we're gonna make it ready for it right now.
[00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:04.780]   This is too many years and too little effort,
[00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:08.300]   visible, I'm sorry, visible effort to moving the Mac forward
[00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:10.220]   to simply say, oh gosh, I know they want,
[00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:11.860]   they're really excited and they want to do this
[00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:13.460]   but they just don't have enough manpower,
[00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:15.180]   they don't have enough resources,
[00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:16.940]   they don't have enough bandwidth in their brains.
[00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:18.860]   No, they could do it if they wanted to.
[00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:21.380]   They, on some level, they've decided
[00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:23.900]   that this is not a priority of any kind for them.
[00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:25.260]   - Well, I don't know if it's a priority of any kind
[00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:26.900]   but I do think that if you look at the revenue numbers,
[00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:28.340]   it makes sense that there has been more energy
[00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:29.700]   on the things that are making more money.
[00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:31.540]   And also when you look at the long-term trajectory,
[00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:33.700]   I don't, you know, the only reason my kids
[00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:37.860]   want to have a Mac is so that they can design levels
[00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:40.780]   in Roblox and if Roblox let them do it on the iPad,
[00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:43.020]   they would never need to see a computer.
[00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:45.100]   - I would guess Roblox is working hard to make that happen.
[00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:47.060]   - I guess, I don't know, I mean, you thought it would be
[00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:47.900]   missing me.
[00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:48.740]   - 'Cause they sit there and they play the whole game
[00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:49.580]   and they spend all the time on the iPad.
[00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:51.980]   - There's other pressure on Apple.
[00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:53.900]   I know you don't want a hazard to guess Andy
[00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:55.460]   but I'll hand it a hazard to guess.
[00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:58.340]   Yesterday we saw Google announce a lot of stuff
[00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:00.580]   including a very much improved Google Assistant,
[00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:01.740]   I don't know if that's ever gonna ship,
[00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:03.380]   you know, demos always look great.
[00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:06.020]   But they're really falling behind,
[00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:08.660]   Siri's already behind Amazon Echo
[00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:11.380]   and Google seems like it's taken the race entirely.
[00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:13.300]   Oops, I wasn't talking to you Google.
[00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:15.660]   And my assistants popped up.
[00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:18.860]   Google's Android P actually borrows from the iPhone.
[00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:22.620]   They now have the gesture, the swipe side to side gesture
[00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:26.420]   that Apple pioneered in the iPhone X.
[00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:29.380]   There's a lot of pressure on the phone
[00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:30.780]   and if the phone's your bread and butter,
[00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:34.500]   you're gonna actually, I think all hands on deck.
[00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:35.420]   If there's an all hands on deck,
[00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:36.700]   it's not to save the Mac.
[00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:37.540]   - Right.
[00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:39.140]   Well, I think that, you know,
[00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:42.580]   I do think that there's probably some opinion of,
[00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:46.420]   you know, the Mac is legacy hardware.
[00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:48.140]   - I think they think it can put along.
[00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:48.980]   - No, I don't know.
[00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:49.820]   I'm gonna put along.
[00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:50.660]   - It's gonna keep putting along.
[00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:51.500]   - It's not that it's not gonna keep putting along.
[00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:52.340]   - We don't have to do much.
[00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:53.180]   - And they need it.
[00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:54.500]   You still can't write code.
[00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:55.980]   You still can't make iPhone apps without making it.
[00:50:55.980 --> 00:50:57.300]   - Put a coffee like Mac.
[00:50:57.300 --> 00:50:58.300]   - It'll keep putting along.
[00:50:58.300 --> 00:50:59.940]   - But it's not something that,
[00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:00.980]   that's not the growth market.
[00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:02.660]   And I don't think, and I don't think it will be.
[00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:04.260]   I don't think that if we look at the trajectory
[00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:06.460]   of PCs in general, you know,
[00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:09.420]   we look at my kids or look at folks that are retired
[00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:11.220]   and those two ends have just gotten rid of the Mac.
[00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:13.060]   You know, there's a handful of us that still need it.
[00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:15.300]   In fact, if I wasn't doing graphics,
[00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:16.340]   I don't know if I would use--
[00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:17.860]   - What about an iOS to,
[00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:19.140]   what about doing like Google's done?
[00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:21.620]   Which is basically with a Chromebook,
[00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:24.420]   you know, kind of made a dumb down laptop.
[00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:27.260]   What about, I feel like an iPad Pro with a keyboard
[00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:28.580]   is pretty darn close to that.
[00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:29.420]   - That's what I'm saying.
[00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:30.260]   - What about you and that?
[00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:32.540]   What about making kind of an iOS laptop?
[00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:35.340]   What about abandoning Mac OS?
[00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:38.180]   And admitting that you need to do coding,
[00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:40.540]   you need a good keyboard, you need Xcode.
[00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:41.660]   But why don't you have a--
[00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:42.500]   - I think that's where we're going.
[00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:43.420]   I mean, I think that's, you know,
[00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:45.740]   I think that there are things, you know, I think--
[00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:47.260]   - And then you can use your own processors,
[00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:48.860]   you not tie the intel.
[00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:52.620]   You know, you've got, it seems like, I don't know.
[00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:53.940]   I mean, we're trying to put ourselves
[00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:56.340]   in the mindset of Apple, and that's not an easy thing to do.
[00:51:56.340 --> 00:51:59.260]   - I mean, I think a lot of times there are,
[00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:01.500]   a lot of times in business, you have kind of three states
[00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:03.060]   that are happening in most businesses.
[00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:05.620]   There's the things that you wanna get to,
[00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:07.420]   that you're investing heavily into to get to it.
[00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:09.140]   They're the things that pay the bills today,
[00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:10.460]   and then there are things that you're,
[00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:11.420]   yeah, the kind of the caboose.
[00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:13.780]   You know, like if it fell off, it wouldn't kill you.
[00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:15.220]   And you're still doing it, you're still,
[00:52:15.220 --> 00:52:16.140]   'cause it's still making money,
[00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:17.700]   but it's not something you pay a lot of attention to.
[00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:19.380]   And I think a lot of companies just keep circling,
[00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:21.540]   that's like a big tank track of what's in front,
[00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:23.380]   and then that thing that's in front is now in the middle,
[00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:24.620]   and then the thing that was in the middle
[00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:26.020]   is now you're trying to get rid of.
[00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:29.660]   And I think for Apple, when you look at the AR, VR,
[00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:32.980]   self-driving, all that stuff is kind of out in the front,
[00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:35.540]   the iPhone's in the middle, and the Mac is in the back.
[00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:37.300]   - It's close. - Yeah.
[00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:39.300]   - And that makes sense.
[00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:40.740]   I wouldn't even say that's bad business,
[00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:42.820]   or it's just disappointing to those of us
[00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:44.660]   who like Macs and wanna use Macs.
[00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:45.820]   - Totally.
[00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:47.900]   - I'm fine, I'm fine with, I guess I don't have any
[00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:49.340]   attachment to my Mac, other than I can't,
[00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:51.340]   I don't want to use Windows.
[00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:52.660]   - I don't want to use Windows.
[00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:55.660]   - No, I'm saying I can see myself moving someday to,
[00:52:55.660 --> 00:52:57.820]   you know, iOS and not looking back on it.
[00:52:57.820 --> 00:52:59.380]   You know, I don't think I'd move, you know,
[00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:00.300]   I'm gonna have Windows machines,
[00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:01.500]   I have Linux machines, I have Linux machines.
[00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:04.620]   - Mac OS for me is really great,
[00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:06.580]   and it's the, it's the,
[00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:08.980]   BSD, the Unix under the hood, and the command line,
[00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:10.780]   and the ability to run Unix apps,
[00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:12.820]   and that's, you're not gonna have that on iOS.
[00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:16.660]   And from a, if you care about reaching out to engineers,
[00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:18.180]   and if there is an engineering shortage,
[00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:20.780]   and I have to say most engineers, I think, use Macs,
[00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:24.460]   most coders use Macs, you need to keep that group happy
[00:53:24.460 --> 00:53:26.300]   about being in the Apple fold.
[00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:27.860]   - And again, I think that's gonna take a long time
[00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:28.700]   before anything happens.
[00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:30.260]   I mean, I think we were,
[00:53:30.260 --> 00:53:31.100]   just because they're not growing in.
[00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:32.180]   - Linux is sitting out there,
[00:53:32.180 --> 00:53:34.020]   and then Linux is a decent option.
[00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:37.060]   You can get a so many different PC manufacturers,
[00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:38.700]   so many different form factors,
[00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:39.700]   very innovative stuff,
[00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:42.460]   most of them will run Linux very well.
[00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:44.460]   I do see a lot of people in the developer community
[00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:47.740]   moving to Linux, but I think that Mac OS
[00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:50.740]   is such a great development platform.
[00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:53.460]   - It just shows, it's interesting to see
[00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:55.660]   what Microsoft and Google and other companies
[00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:58.300]   are doing with the laptop form factor.
[00:53:58.300 --> 00:54:00.420]   Chromebooks are just getting more and more interesting
[00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:01.500]   every year.
[00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:02.740]   One piece of news from Google I/O
[00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:04.300]   was that by the summer,
[00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:06.380]   Chrome OS is going to support Linux apps.
[00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:08.940]   So not only does it run Chrome apps,
[00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:10.620]   if the Chrome apps are doing it for you,
[00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:12.220]   it also now runs Android apps,
[00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:16.100]   but also if you just want to download a free office suite
[00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:16.940]   or free Photoshop thing.
[00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:19.260]   - You can put Debbie in on your Chromebook
[00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:22.260]   without compromising security, by the way.
[00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:23.860]   Because it runs in basically,
[00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:25.420]   it runs in sort of an,
[00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:26.420]   not an emulation mode,
[00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:27.980]   but sort of a virtualization mode
[00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:29.980]   that sandboxes that entire environment.
[00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:31.820]   It makes it, it's put,
[00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:34.620]   just as a person who's interested in such things
[00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:36.380]   and writes about such things,
[00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:38.220]   it really has for the first time put
[00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:43.460]   a decent Chromebook on my shopping list
[00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:44.460]   for the summer,
[00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:46.900]   just because I want to see how well that works day to day.
[00:54:46.900 --> 00:54:50.100]   As a $500 laptop,
[00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:52.620]   that doesn't have anything that you wouldn't,
[00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:54.780]   that anything that you don't really need
[00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:58.940]   as just a regular Ham and Eggs type of laptop user,
[00:54:58.940 --> 00:55:00.300]   that's an intriguing move.
[00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:01.140]   - Let's talk about news
[00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:02.380]   'cause one of the things Google did do
[00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:04.100]   is roll out their new news app.
[00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:06.580]   I've been playing with it, I really like it.
[00:55:06.580 --> 00:55:07.420]   I'm not sure why,
[00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:09.500]   but it looks like both Google and Apple
[00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:10.780]   have decided that the next,
[00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:13.580]   one of the next fronts is news.
[00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:16.860]   We saw an article today that says Apple
[00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:19.780]   is building, quietly building a news operation
[00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:21.580]   and editorial news operation,
[00:55:21.580 --> 00:55:25.140]   that they bought texture,
[00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:27.220]   they've shut down texture for Windows,
[00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:28.940]   which I think is probably a precursor
[00:55:28.940 --> 00:55:30.380]   to shutting down texture entirely.
[00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:33.140]   - Well, I think that they're a sponsor, we should say.
[00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:36.100]   - Windows wasn't being updated for a long time,
[00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:37.620]   and it sounds like it was just a problem,
[00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:39.140]   child, that Apple just wasn't willing,
[00:55:39.140 --> 00:55:41.060]   we're not gonna, you either close it
[00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:43.260]   or you make it better and they didn't want to make it better.
[00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:44.820]   - They just got out of it.
[00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:47.180]   - I think though, the plan,
[00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:49.460]   which they've even, you know,
[00:55:49.460 --> 00:55:51.300]   telegraphed of rolling it in the news
[00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:53.420]   means that the app itself is probably
[00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:56.580]   on the chopping block.
[00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:58.500]   I'd like to see a strong news.
[00:55:58.500 --> 00:55:59.860]   I have to see, so you like it,
[00:55:59.860 --> 00:56:03.260]   Andrew, Andy, the Android news app,
[00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:04.460]   you've been playing with it?
[00:56:04.460 --> 00:56:05.580]   - Yeah, I like it a lot.
[00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:08.420]   I had it on my iPad mini in bed last night,
[00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:10.980]   and because Chrome is my default browser,
[00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:14.380]   it was already very, very good at,
[00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:16.900]   I like the idea of making it explicit,
[00:56:16.900 --> 00:56:18.860]   the difference between here are headlines,
[00:56:18.860 --> 00:56:21.860]   meaning that this is not being influenced whatsoever,
[00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:23.500]   but what we think you want to see.
[00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:25.140]   This is just what everyone sees.
[00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:26.940]   And then another tab that says for you,
[00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:28.460]   meaning this is stuff that is influenced
[00:56:28.460 --> 00:56:30.420]   by what we think you want to see.
[00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:34.620]   And so not only was the for you tab full of stories
[00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:37.820]   that either I'd already read by seeking them out,
[00:56:37.820 --> 00:56:40.980]   and by looking at the people that I follow my Twitter feed,
[00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:43.700]   but the headlines tab,
[00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:46.220]   I really like the fact that it was full
[00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:47.820]   of good protein.
[00:56:47.820 --> 00:56:51.700]   Not a website you've never heard of,
[00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:56.180]   whose journalism game is being paid less than its search
[00:56:56.180 --> 00:56:58.300]   engine optimization game,
[00:56:58.300 --> 00:56:59.660]   but good trusted sources,
[00:56:59.660 --> 00:57:01.860]   even stuff that I had not known about before,
[00:57:01.860 --> 00:57:03.260]   hadn't realized before,
[00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:05.340]   and it's a very, very nice interface.
[00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:08.140]   So I'm looking forward to seeing what Apple
[00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:09.620]   tends to bring for that.
[00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:12.540]   It was a really big chunk of Google's keynote yesterday
[00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:14.260]   as part of the, hey,
[00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:16.660]   we're not, yes, we're a big dragon,
[00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:19.660]   but we are the friendly dragon from how to bring your dragon.
[00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:20.740]   We're not the angry,
[00:57:20.740 --> 00:57:23.500]   set fire to 100 people dragon from Game of Thrones,
[00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:24.940]   like Facebook is.
[00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:27.660]   And so this is a role that a big company like Apple
[00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:30.380]   can play to actually do something that's very,
[00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:31.180]   very good for people.
[00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:33.740]   It serves a need that people are very concerned about,
[00:57:33.740 --> 00:57:36.340]   that is news being manipulated
[00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:38.620]   when not having any idea of the pedigree
[00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:39.580]   of what they're reading.
[00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:41.860]   And it's a place where a free app can do a lot of good.
[00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:43.500]   So I'm really excited to see what,
[00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:46.380]   knowing what Apple is doing with a lot of hands on stuff,
[00:57:46.380 --> 00:57:48.580]   a lot of hands on human brains,
[00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:49.420]   attacking the problem,
[00:57:49.420 --> 00:57:51.460]   I'm really keen to see what they show off.
[00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:53.740]   - Yeah, I mean, I knew they were hiring editorial people
[00:57:53.740 --> 00:57:55.500]   'cause of course they hired Nathan Oliver
[00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:57.820]   as child's away from us.
[00:57:57.820 --> 00:57:58.980]   And when he said, you know,
[00:57:58.980 --> 00:58:00.660]   I just got a job offer from Apple,
[00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:03.460]   I couldn't say, well, stay here.
[00:58:03.460 --> 00:58:05.820]   That's exciting.
[00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:08.580]   And he, while he can't really tell us what he's doing,
[00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:09.860]   it's clear he's in editorial.
[00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:11.660]   He's not there to make, you know,
[00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:13.820]   the next version of iOS.
[00:58:13.820 --> 00:58:15.740]   And apparently Apple's been putting it,
[00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:18.740]   there's a whole bunch of job listings for editorial types.
[00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:22.300]   I think that's really, I think that's very interesting.
[00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:27.900]   Apple news, jobs over time, spiked.
[00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:30.540]   It looks like in October of last year,
[00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:31.900]   they're back down to normal levels,
[00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:32.900]   but they do a lot of hiring.
[00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:34.540]   So I guess that's when they hired Nathan, right,
[00:58:34.540 --> 00:58:35.780]   right about there.
[00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:36.700]   - Yeah, so.
[00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:37.540]   - And a lot of it,
[00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:41.300]   it's a more complicated problem than it might originally sound
[00:58:41.300 --> 00:58:43.140]   because one of the things they have to do
[00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:45.860]   is make sure that the publishers are very, very happy
[00:58:45.860 --> 00:58:46.740]   with the product.
[00:58:46.740 --> 00:58:49.820]   Google had been getting a lot of flack
[00:58:49.820 --> 00:58:53.940]   by doing something that is a very nice feature for users
[00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:57.140]   by if you type, if you're searching for a piece of news
[00:58:57.140 --> 00:58:59.380]   in Google, in the Google search engine,
[00:58:59.380 --> 00:59:01.180]   it will not only find the relevant articles,
[00:59:01.180 --> 00:59:04.380]   but it will also summarize in one block at the very, very top.
[00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:06.780]   Oh, here's the information you probably wanted to get.
[00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:08.820]   So don't even bother clicking through to any of these links
[00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:10.500]   and visiting the Washington Post.
[00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:14.780]   So they're making a very, very hard sell to saying,
[00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:18.340]   no, it will give the user the headline
[00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:19.900]   and basically the lead,
[00:59:19.900 --> 00:59:22.820]   but then when they tap, they go to your site, your content.
[00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:25.500]   Also, we're gonna make it very, very easy for people
[00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:28.860]   within the app to simply touch one button that says subscribe
[00:59:28.860 --> 00:59:31.580]   and suddenly they're watched in post online products
[00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:32.540]   or subscriber.
[00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:34.620]   So Apple is gonna have to address that as well.
[00:59:34.620 --> 00:59:36.580]   - Yeah, credit by the way to Joshua Frulinger
[00:59:36.580 --> 00:59:40.340]   of ThinkNum.com, doing big data journalism
[00:59:40.340 --> 00:59:43.380]   'cause he's the guy who went through all of Apple's
[00:59:43.380 --> 00:59:48.300]   hiring listings to create some interesting numbers.
[00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:51.740]   - And if Apple never does a comics page,
[00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:53.380]   they need to hire Josh.
[00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:55.300]   His comic strip blog is pretty incredible.
[00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:56.300]   - Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:59:56.300 --> 00:59:58.340]   You know, awesome, awesome.
[00:59:58.340 --> 01:00:00.420]   - What else?
[01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:05.420]   USA Today reporter Jefferson Graham used the new GDPR
[01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:08.180]   to ask Apple for a data dump.
[01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:10.140]   You can do that now.
[01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:12.380]   He said it took eight days for Apple to give me the data
[01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:16.340]   it had collected on me and it wasn't very much.
[01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:19.200]   He got 243 megabytes from Google,
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:22.540]   881 megabytes with the same request from Facebook.
[01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:24.780]   Apple, it was only nine megabytes.
[01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:26.580]   He says there's not much there because Apple says
[01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:29.260]   the information is primarily kept on your device
[01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:30.540]   not its servers.
[01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:35.300]   A list of downloads, purchases and repairs, no search history.
[01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:41.900]   You know, Apple does keep the Siri requests
[01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:45.580]   but they didn't give it to him because they say
[01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:46.540]   it's anonymized.
[01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:49.940]   It's no longer personal information because we take
[01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:54.380]   your Siri request and we put a unique identifier on it
[01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:56.060]   but it's not an individual.
[01:00:56.060 --> 01:00:58.820]   It uses a random identifier to mask your identity.
[01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:00.420]   So they did not offer that back to him
[01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:01.980]   and that's the kind of stuff you would get back from
[01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:05.580]   Google is all your Google assistant requests.
[01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:07.260]   - It's just not part of it, Apple's business model.
[01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:08.580]   And in fact, part of their business model
[01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:10.740]   to not grab onto it so they can do everything they can.
[01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:12.820]   - Yeah, the company says it doesn't want your information
[01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:13.820]   and it doesn't store it.
[01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:16.460]   And so there you go now.
[01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:19.620]   - I think that's gonna be really interesting, not battle
[01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:23.180]   but basically the Coke versus Pepsi of Apple
[01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:25.420]   selling something that people really, really want
[01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:29.220]   which is that yes, if you filter most of your stuff
[01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:31.260]   through us, you're filtering it through a company
[01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:35.020]   that does not monetize your information in any way.
[01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:38.660]   We don't sell it and we work very, very hard not to keep it
[01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:42.420]   so that nothing bad can happen because it's destroyed
[01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:44.580]   or anonymized as soon as we get it.
[01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:47.180]   Versus Google story of yes, we're collecting a lot
[01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:49.740]   of information about you but look at all the really
[01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:52.260]   great services we can provide for you.
[01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:55.540]   It means that when you ask for a restaurant's
[01:01:55.540 --> 01:01:59.620]   restaurant recommendation, we can actually try to figure out
[01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:02.580]   of these seven different, you asked for a place to get
[01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:05.660]   a cheap tie within a mile of where I am right now
[01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:08.140]   but it will pick the one that it thinks that you're gonna
[01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:09.380]   like the most.
[01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:11.980]   That's the sort of stuff that the second or third time
[01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:16.660]   it delivers the goods for you and after you, again,
[01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:19.420]   you're the frog in the pot of water that's getting
[01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:21.340]   a little bit hotter, you realize that okay,
[01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:25.100]   the water's pretty warm but I'm not worried yet.
[01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:27.700]   That's, it's gonna be interesting to see how consumers
[01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:29.060]   choose between those two options.
[01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:31.740]   - It was fun to watch Google I/O yesterday because they,
[01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:36.260]   the word privacy never came up and they showed all sorts
[01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:38.780]   of stuff that Assistant can do based on what it knows
[01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:41.500]   about you and they didn't unapologetically.
[01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:43.220]   - Well, I think there's also--
[01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:44.060]   - It's all but--
[01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:44.900]   - Go ahead.
[01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:48.340]   - I just think there could be exactly what Andy's
[01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:51.100]   talking about, a huge separation in populations
[01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:53.260]   at some point where you have people who really want an
[01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:55.700]   iPhone and really wanna do that themselves and don't want
[01:02:55.700 --> 01:02:58.180]   to be private and then you have people who are willing
[01:02:58.180 --> 01:03:00.940]   to give up that data so that they have ease of use
[01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:01.980]   or lower costs.
[01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:03.980]   - So does that mean Siri will always be a second,
[01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:05.420]   a week second to Google Assistant?
[01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:06.420]   - I don't think it'll be a strong, right?
[01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:07.780]   I think it'll be almost impossible.
[01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:09.860]   There's certain things that I think would be very hard
[01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:13.540]   just from, unless Apple, I mean, literally Apple could
[01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:15.500]   catch up if they took that $100 billion they're using
[01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:19.140]   for their buyback and spend it on maps.
[01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:20.980]   You know, they might actually be able to catch up.
[01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:22.860]   I mean, because maps are still a disaster.
[01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:24.460]   You know, I mean, it's like when you actually,
[01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:25.300]   I mean, there's so many times in my--
[01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:27.060]   - Well, yesterday Google showed how they're gonna implement
[01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:29.380]   augmented reality in maps so when you're walking around,
[01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:30.620]   this is always a problem for me.
[01:03:30.620 --> 01:03:32.820]   I can never figure out if I'm headed the right way.
[01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:34.620]   Now you'll hold it up.
[01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:35.940]   - And I think they'll show the street and say,
[01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:36.780]   "Go that way."
[01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:37.940]   - I think that's gonna come on the,
[01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:39.380]   I think that'll be on iOS soon.
[01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:41.700]   I mean, you know, there's been tests.
[01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:42.900]   People have been testing.
[01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:45.660]   Yeah, I mean, that's the kind of data that
[01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:46.620]   you can throw money at.
[01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:49.300]   But I think the hard part is the kind of data you get
[01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:50.820]   when there's just so many people using it.
[01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:51.660]   You know, and--
[01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:54.660]   - Google has all this ML machine learning
[01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:55.980]   going into what they're doing.
[01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:58.660]   I suppose Apple does, but Google's really highlighting
[01:03:58.660 --> 01:03:59.860]   the fact that they're doing this.
[01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:00.900]   - They have more people doing it.
[01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:02.020]   I mean, like the thing is--
[01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:04.540]   - But they also hired the best people, right?
[01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:05.940]   - They both have really good people working for them,
[01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:06.780]   I think.
[01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:09.580]   But I think that the issue is that there's so many people
[01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:14.420]   using the Google apps that the granularity of data
[01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:16.860]   that's being fed to them on a day-to-day basis is so high
[01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:21.860]   that it's now on the iOS, I think the reports are the 60%
[01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:25.740]   of the people that have an iPhone are using the Apple Maps.
[01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:27.100]   It's just that every time I use it,
[01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:29.500]   because when I use it is because someone texts me,
[01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:30.860]   they're at their address and if you click on it,
[01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:32.220]   it automatically opens up Maps.
[01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:34.180]   And that's usually my introduction to,
[01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:35.700]   I'm gonna give it a shot again.
[01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:36.540]   - You know, and then--
[01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:37.620]   (laughing)
[01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:38.460]   - And then I end up on a dead end.
[01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:39.780]   - I like it because it goes to the watch
[01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:41.220]   and the watch will tell me turn left to right.
[01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:42.220]   - Yeah, yeah, so it's a little things for me.
[01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:43.380]   - If I'm driving, you know what I mean?
[01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:44.860]   But generally I'm still, I have to admit,
[01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:48.420]   I'm still, 'cause not every time I use it,
[01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:53.420]   but a high number of times that I use the Apple Maps,
[01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:56.580]   I end up with a dead end or I end up with some kind
[01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:57.660]   of funky turn.
[01:04:57.660 --> 01:05:00.900]   And with Google, I oftentimes, I always say,
[01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:02.420]   I don't trust the Google Girl sometimes.
[01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:04.580]   Like she'll tell me to take the Bay Bridge
[01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:05.940]   from the airport and I'll be like,
[01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:07.860]   that sounds crazy and then I'm on 19th
[01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:09.180]   in some kind of horrible traffic jam
[01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:10.940]   and then going, okay, well she was right.
[01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:13.660]   - Damn, is the car gonna be the battle front though?
[01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:15.780]   Or walking and bicycling in mass transit?
[01:05:15.780 --> 01:05:19.500]   I have to say in Japan, being able to use Google,
[01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:20.580]   you know, the Japanese subway,
[01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:21.500]   there's not a lot of English,
[01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:22.860]   you have to kind of figure it out.
[01:05:22.860 --> 01:05:24.860]   - You know what I do is I have names for everything.
[01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:25.700]   You know, so--
[01:05:25.700 --> 01:05:27.340]   - Google, the Google Maps was great.
[01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:29.540]   It told me exactly where to get off what to do.
[01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:31.900]   I mean, it really was a great companion.
[01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:33.660]   - It's not just that, it's subtle things
[01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:36.060]   like just simply identifying streets
[01:05:36.060 --> 01:05:39.940]   and identifying places because it's very,
[01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:42.300]   it's relatively on the spectrum of difficulties.
[01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:45.660]   Very, very easy to identify that there is a drug store
[01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:47.260]   right here, there is the street number.
[01:05:47.260 --> 01:05:49.220]   So here's the street, here's where the number should be.
[01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:50.420]   So it's right here.
[01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:52.700]   Very difficult to say that no, here is the entrance.
[01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:54.500]   Yes, technically it's on this street,
[01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:56.980]   but you have to go through this little backway to get there.
[01:05:56.980 --> 01:05:58.060]   And there are a lot of places,
[01:05:58.060 --> 01:06:00.860]   we always, one of my big problems is that I always think
[01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:05.180]   that my understanding of the world comes from living
[01:06:05.180 --> 01:06:08.980]   in New England specifically in America in general.
[01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:12.420]   There are places in the world where just street layouts
[01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:14.220]   just don't work that way.
[01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:16.860]   As torturous as Boston street layouts are,
[01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:18.620]   I mean, it's well, well, just documented,
[01:06:18.620 --> 01:06:20.100]   it's well well set up.
[01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:23.260]   Google is putting a lot of money into not just going
[01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:26.940]   with the mathematics here, but also how can we basically
[01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:30.860]   incorporating 3D image views, satellite image views
[01:06:30.860 --> 01:06:34.460]   to actually, now they have a look at what that street looks like.
[01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:36.500]   There are buildings there that don't really appear
[01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:37.780]   on the street plan.
[01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:40.420]   There are business and using street view to also
[01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:42.980]   just do reading to say, not only here's a picture
[01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:46.140]   associated with this numeric street address,
[01:06:46.140 --> 01:06:47.820]   but we're gonna figure out that, oh,
[01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:51.780]   that my existing, I've identified this as a barbershop
[01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:53.140]   based on the signage here.
[01:06:53.140 --> 01:06:55.020]   I'm going to basically add this to the database
[01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:56.380]   that didn't exist before.
[01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:59.060]   So it's the quality of the information,
[01:06:59.060 --> 01:07:02.420]   especially in a very, very tough and challenging environment
[01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:06.620]   that shows how deeply invested Google is in maps
[01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:09.020]   and also machine learning.
[01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:14.020]   With Cinder Pichai, you often hear, every time you hear
[01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:19.820]   a CEO talk during a keynote, there's a certain amount
[01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:22.540]   of nodding and saying, okay, this will be interesting
[01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:23.900]   if it's actually true.
[01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:28.740]   But a few years ago, when he rather bravely said that,
[01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:30.500]   no, no, no, we're saying that the Google used to be
[01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:32.620]   a search company now, we're an artificial intelligence
[01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:34.220]   machine learning company.
[01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:37.380]   And three years later, we see, no, every single thing
[01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:40.220]   that they do is leveraged by machine learning,
[01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:42.900]   by so much of what they were doing yesterday
[01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:45.900]   was actually counteracting the bad press
[01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:48.380]   that their competitors in various markets were creating.
[01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:50.860]   So they didn't actually say that we're not,
[01:07:50.860 --> 01:07:52.540]   you can trust our self-driving cars
[01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:57.540]   because we're not dabblers like a certain self,
[01:07:57.540 --> 01:08:02.460]   certain car sharing service so that we could mention,
[01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:05.500]   okay, Uber, they make a point of we've had,
[01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:09.140]   we have 6 million miles of actual road travel,
[01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:11.380]   plus something like 9 billion miles,
[01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:13.420]   they're saying of simulated road travel,
[01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:15.940]   our systems are really, really much, much smarter
[01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:18.300]   because again, we're not dabblers in this.
[01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:21.220]   So that's an interesting component to all of this.
[01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:24.820]   >> Well, yeah, and I think that the math for Google's easy,
[01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:28.140]   I mean, if you're in a car, you're not searching Google.
[01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:30.100]   So, I mean, you know-- >> So that's true,
[01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:31.820]   out of the car is the best level.
[01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:33.060]   >> Well, you know, get you looking down,
[01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:34.740]   like a self-driving car just gives you
[01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:38.180]   a lot more time to be searching, you know?
[01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:40.700]   I mean, if you think about the number of hours
[01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:43.860]   and the number of ads served up or not served up,
[01:08:43.860 --> 01:08:46.180]   it makes the Waymo really cheap.
[01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:48.340]   >> Apple is cracking down on applications
[01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:50.820]   that send location data to third parties.
[01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:54.060]   This just started happening over the last couple of days,
[01:08:54.060 --> 01:08:57.780]   a number of applications have been booted
[01:08:57.780 --> 01:08:59.940]   because there are applications in violation
[01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:02.980]   of Apple Store guidelines pertaining to transmission
[01:09:02.980 --> 01:09:07.420]   of location data to third parties.
[01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:12.420]   And so, this, once again, Apple's doubling down on privacy.
[01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:14.660]   It's very clear.
[01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:16.700]   They're also, I thought this was quite interesting.
[01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:21.700]   And this comes from somebody parsing this source code
[01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:26.300]   of the beta version of 11.4.
[01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:30.220]   I like this.
[01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:34.860]   Apparently, if you don't unlock your phone after a week,
[01:09:34.860 --> 01:09:37.060]   you no longer can use the lightning port.
[01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:41.100]   >> I'm sorry, for data, but you can see
[01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:42.500]   using for charging, subsequently.
[01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:45.780]   So this is particularly aimed at the gray key,
[01:09:45.780 --> 01:09:48.420]   law enforcement, which might have a phone
[01:09:48.420 --> 01:09:51.260]   that hasn't been accessed for a while,
[01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:55.140]   can't be, they can't suck the data out.
[01:09:55.140 --> 01:09:57.020]   >> Now, the downside of this, of course,
[01:09:57.020 --> 01:10:00.420]   is that if you had, let's say, an iPad sitting around
[01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:04.820]   for a while and then you forgot the password, you're done.
[01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:05.940]   Like, it is a brick.
[01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:06.780]   >> Right.
[01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:07.980]   >> Unless Apple's got some secret back door,
[01:10:07.980 --> 01:10:09.300]   which sounds like they're not going to,
[01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:11.500]   the issue you'll have with this is that if you,
[01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:13.140]   if it was sitting around for, you went away
[01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:15.500]   for two weeks to Japan, let's say,
[01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:16.700]   and you come back, and for some reason,
[01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:19.220]   you got the password wrong or you,
[01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:20.340]   >> Well, I have one that's a brick
[01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:21.820]   'cause I can't remember the password now.
[01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:22.740]   >> I have two that I have.
[01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:23.580]   >> What are you supposed to do?
[01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:25.340]   >> Let's take a minute and plug in the Apple store.
[01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:27.780]   Well, I bet you the Apple store could override this too.
[01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:29.460]   >> Okay, well, they're saying no,
[01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:30.900]   'cause if the Apple store could do it,
[01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:31.740]   it would still have been the green key.
[01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:36.740]   I mean, so that's the, it's not all outside to that process.
[01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:40.260]   >> Well, I'm not challenging you.
[01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:43.660]   I'm just saying, this is an area where,
[01:10:43.660 --> 01:10:47.180]   if I knew that if you don't have,
[01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:50.020]   if you yourself have completely forgotten the passcode
[01:10:50.020 --> 01:10:53.300]   to enter an iOS device, that there's a way to get it back
[01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:55.900]   that doesn't involve factory resetting it,
[01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:57.700]   then kick me to iCloud and restoring.
[01:10:57.700 --> 01:11:00.580]   I will learn something new by finding out how to do that
[01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:02.980]   'cause I'm not aware of how that can be done.
[01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:05.340]   >> To fix it?
[01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:08.500]   >> No, I'm saying, if you want to,
[01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:11.860]   a way of getting that password or that that's that
[01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:12.700]   printed back.
[01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:13.540]   >> Yeah, don't forget your password, this one is.
[01:11:13.540 --> 01:11:16.220]   >> Yeah, I mean, it's all encrypted
[01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:18.500]   and I don't know of a way to get added.
[01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:20.340]   >> The Apple store can get, I mean,
[01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:21.740]   so the problem that I have for instance,
[01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:23.300]   I have two kids that I got from iPhone.
[01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:25.260]   I got my kids, oh no, I have to prove that I own them.
[01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:26.260]   >> No, that's the problem I have.
[01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:29.460]   I have an iPad that we bought for some employee here.
[01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:31.020]   I got it back, I can't unlock it.
[01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:32.900]   I don't know where the receipt is or anything.
[01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:34.500]   >> I submit that's why it's a brick.
[01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:35.940]   >> I always buy everything at the Apple store
[01:11:35.940 --> 01:11:38.980]   because it always has my history.
[01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:40.580]   And it's all registered.
[01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:41.420]   >> We might have the history there actually.
[01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:42.900]   >> And so the problem, I never buy it anywhere.
[01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:44.980]   I don't buy any Apple products anywhere than the Apple store
[01:11:44.980 --> 01:11:46.340]   because I just know that if I go in,
[01:11:46.340 --> 01:11:48.180]   they'll immediately have it all there
[01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:49.700]   and I do all the registration by bottom.
[01:11:49.700 --> 01:11:51.020]   I bought it for my kids and my kids, of course,
[01:11:51.020 --> 01:11:52.380]   they put passwords on them so the other one
[01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:54.580]   couldn't get into them and they forgot them.
[01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:56.060]   And then they, it's always due.
[01:11:56.060 --> 01:11:58.500]   >> So that's the point of this then,
[01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:00.540]   that even Apple couldn't unlock this.
[01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:02.260]   After a week, this thing is--
[01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:04.420]   >> Yeah, it also takes Apple off the whole,
[01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:05.740]   you know, which it'll want to be.
[01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:07.260]   >> And I think that there's a,
[01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:08.780]   I think there's an argument that says,
[01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:09.860]   I think this is the beginning of this,
[01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:13.140]   I think they could say one day or, you know,
[01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:14.300]   you have to type it in.
[01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:17.420]   I can see Apple saying you have to type in your password
[01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:18.980]   or the lightning bolt doesn't work.
[01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:20.780]   I mean, I think there's a lot of kill switch--
[01:12:20.780 --> 01:12:22.540]   >> Well, no, basically, if I don't put my password in
[01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:24.220]   or if I put, if I don't put my password in,
[01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:25.340]   you can't--
[01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:26.780]   >> It's something to add.
[01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:28.340]   >> If I just handed you the kill.
[01:12:28.340 --> 01:12:30.180]   >> I would prefer that right now.
[01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:32.300]   Like I would take it, I know what my password is.
[01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:36.220]   And so my preference would be just if I don't--
[01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:37.860]   like just like when you want to go into photos,
[01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:39.180]   it says you got to-- >> It's always the issue.
[01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:42.420]   Password recovery is a vulnerability.
[01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:44.100]   So if you really want secure,
[01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:45.620]   you make sure that if you lose it,
[01:12:45.620 --> 01:12:47.060]   you lost it, you're at a lock.
[01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:49.380]   >> Right, I would love that that has to be option to just be--
[01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:53.180]   like you can't use the lightning port if it's not logged in.
[01:12:53.180 --> 01:12:55.540]   If it wasn't logged in when it was connected.
[01:12:55.540 --> 01:12:56.740]   >> I really want to highlight,
[01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:59.620]   this is one of the reasons why I absolutely love Apple.
[01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:04.820]   This is not a problem that is going to affect a lot of people.
[01:13:04.820 --> 01:13:06.980]   Okay, and this does nothing--
[01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:10.980]   excuse me, it protects the consumer.
[01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:13.940]   Even consumers that might legitimately be--
[01:13:13.940 --> 01:13:18.980]   but might be under the quite legitimate view of research--
[01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:20.900]   excuse me, investigation by the law.
[01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:25.700]   And but it essentially says that we are not on law enforcement's side.
[01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:26.540]   We are not going to simply--
[01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:29.540]   if there is a way of getting into our devices
[01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:32.260]   that bypasses all the security that we've put in
[01:13:32.260 --> 01:13:35.380]   to make sure that only appropriate authorized people can use it,
[01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:36.860]   we are going to shut that down,
[01:13:36.860 --> 01:13:40.420]   even if this is a tool that is mostly being used by law enforcement.
[01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:43.180]   And at a time when they're dealing with an administration
[01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:49.100]   that the FBI has been actively looking for ways to start this fight
[01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:53.860]   and have a court decide that encryption is not legal,
[01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:58.980]   that companies have to maintain a way of allowing law enforcement
[01:13:58.980 --> 01:14:03.140]   to any device no matter what the user has done to protect their data.
[01:14:03.140 --> 01:14:06.180]   That is a very, very-- that is real courage.
[01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:08.500]   That is very, real courage that--
[01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:12.660]   people who are advocating for all the things all the way to--
[01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:15.460]   Apple should put in a back door to every single iPhone
[01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:18.340]   and I was device that will automatically unlock the doors
[01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:20.340]   to everything to law enforcement.
[01:14:20.340 --> 01:14:24.500]   Those people might think of this as a thumb right in their eye.
[01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:27.540]   Even though, again, Apple just wants to protect the needs of consumers.
[01:14:27.540 --> 01:14:30.580]   That is, again, real bravery because if the FBI--
[01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:36.020]   we have a Congress and an administration that I don't know
[01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:37.780]   what they wouldn't do at this point.
[01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:41.940]   And so if they were to make this into an issue that we are going
[01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:46.580]   to bet the survival of your company on your ability to fight this law,
[01:14:46.580 --> 01:14:48.100]   things can be very, very itchy.
[01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:50.420]   There's no diplomacy here that Apple is offering.
[01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:52.900]   They're saying, this is our-- this is our principle.
[01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:54.500]   We are fighting for this principle.
[01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:55.140]   And guess what?
[01:14:55.140 --> 01:14:56.900]   We could fight this for 10 years.
[01:14:56.900 --> 01:14:59.060]   We believe that the government will run out of funding
[01:14:59.060 --> 01:15:01.700]   before we will run out of funding for this lawsuit.
[01:15:01.700 --> 01:15:03.460]   I have to apologize.
[01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:04.900]   I know people are saying, where's Renee?
[01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:07.860]   He's still here, but he's in the conference call right now.
[01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:10.340]   We don't want to force him to comment.
[01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:16.740]   So he is with us, but only in spirit, not in body and soul.
[01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:23.060]   Apple has announced that in starting in July, all iOS updates have been
[01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:25.940]   to the app store, have to be built with the iOS 11 SDK.
[01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:29.380]   And have to support the super retina display of the iPhone 10
[01:15:29.380 --> 01:15:31.780]   moving developers along.
[01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:32.900]   Apple's very good at this.
[01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:35.940]   It's nice if you have a monopoly.
[01:15:35.940 --> 01:15:40.900]   And finally, before we take a break, I want to point out a very good article.
[01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:45.380]   You're going to want to read Cover Story in the Houdinke magazine that just came out.
[01:15:45.380 --> 01:15:51.380]   Houdinke is a watch enthusiast website and they have a publication at Houdinke,
[01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:53.860]   H-O-D-I-N-K-W-E dot com.
[01:15:53.860 --> 01:15:55.860]   Kevin Rose is the CEO of Houdinke.
[01:15:56.340 --> 01:16:03.300]   Apple, Influence, and I've a one of the few interviews I've ever seen with Johnny.
[01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:09.700]   I've specifically talking about the watch and some very interesting stuff in here.
[01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:16.660]   Johnny I, for instance, said that Steve and he had never talked about making a watch.
[01:16:16.660 --> 01:16:20.580]   He said, as far as I know, Johnny said, Steve never even owned a watch,
[01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:26.580]   which is actually in contrary to this picture, this famous picture of Steve Jobs
[01:16:26.580 --> 01:16:29.940]   with the original iMac.
[01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:31.140]   And he's wearing a Seiko.
[01:16:31.140 --> 01:16:37.140]   In fact, the guy who wrote the article apparently was trying to bid to buy that Seiko
[01:16:37.140 --> 01:16:43.140]   and lost to somebody who bid $42,500.
[01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:48.740]   The author says forever since I fantasize it was Johnny I've done out of vidney.
[01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:53.860]   But now he says, I don't think so. Steve didn't wear a watch, correct.
[01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:56.740]   So then what exactly was the genesis of the watch project?
[01:16:56.740 --> 01:17:01.860]   The first discussions according to Johnny I've took place a few months after Steve's passing.
[01:17:01.860 --> 01:17:05.940]   It's really interesting. If you want to learn more about thinking behind the Apple watch,
[01:17:05.940 --> 01:17:13.380]   this is a fascinating article including I've's admission that for a longest time,
[01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:15.380]   they didn't want to have any buttons on the watch.
[01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:17.540]   Apple hates buttons, as you know.
[01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:22.500]   We were predisposed to thinking direct manipulation was sort of a panacea.
[01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:25.380]   But it took a modicum of courage to Johnny.
[01:17:25.380 --> 01:17:29.380]   I have to understand courage that this secondary device, the crown,
[01:17:29.380 --> 01:17:32.740]   was a fantastic solution for scrolling and making choices.
[01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:36.260]   It also allowed us to offer a second button on the device.
[01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:44.260]   So a really good article on the design process and the thinking of the Apple watch.
[01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:48.020]   So how often do you use the buttons on the watch?
[01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:50.980]   Well, I was thinking about what you're reading.
[01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:53.940]   I was like, I barely use it.
[01:17:53.940 --> 01:17:58.340]   I use the time machine sometimes to scroll.
[01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:01.540]   Unfortunately, I agree with Johnny.
[01:18:01.540 --> 01:18:02.980]   I have the idea of adding buttons.
[01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:07.140]   Something you'd want to avoid if you could.
[01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:08.900]   But that's the problem with this small thing.
[01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:11.780]   I'll tell you where I end up using the crown a lot and scrolling.
[01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:16.020]   There are a lot of applications that use it for selecting stuff.
[01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:19.540]   In fact, the Siri watch face, the new watch face that came out with the series three.
[01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:25.780]   It's a simple watch face, but if you scroll it, it has a lot of it goes on down.
[01:18:25.780 --> 01:18:28.100]   It's like a long page of a face.
[01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:30.420]   So there are reasons you might want to use it.
[01:18:30.420 --> 01:18:30.900]   So I do.
[01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:33.140]   Let me think.
[01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:35.780]   Yeah, you I press the crown to start the activities.
[01:18:35.780 --> 01:18:36.180]   Right.
[01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:40.580]   Because I guess I don't I do like my watch.
[01:18:40.580 --> 01:18:42.580]   I just don't I don't have a heavy use.
[01:18:42.580 --> 01:18:43.460]   I'm not a heavy use.
[01:18:43.460 --> 01:18:44.820]   Use it as a watch.
[01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:47.540]   Well, I tap my little I have my little interface and I tap it.
[01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:50.020]   The thing I use the more than anything else is the timer to make my tea.
[01:18:50.020 --> 01:18:54.900]   Like literally I use to trigger it by voice.
[01:18:54.900 --> 01:19:02.260]   No, I just tap on I have the timer is one of my complications or and so I just tap tap tap.
[01:19:02.260 --> 01:19:06.100]   And then I then I walk away and then I know that my tea will not be over seeped.
[01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:06.340]   Yeah.
[01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:08.980]   It's very very upsetting for me when the tea is.
[01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:18.100]   Houdinke.com cover story by Benjamin climber interview with Johnny Ive about the Apple Watch.
[01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:18.580]   Certainly.
[01:19:18.580 --> 01:19:19.780]   Well, we're three.
[01:19:19.780 --> 01:19:21.620]   Let's take a break and we can get your pics of the week.
[01:19:21.620 --> 01:19:25.700]   If you want in just a bit, we'll see for an a can join us for that.
[01:19:25.700 --> 01:19:29.380]   He may or may not be able to our show today brought to you by rocket mortgage.
[01:19:29.380 --> 01:19:34.580]   If you were about to buy a house, I doubt you're going to write a check or bring a bag of cash to
[01:19:34.580 --> 01:19:35.060]   buy the thing.
[01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:36.340]   You're probably going to get a mortgage.
[01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:38.660]   May I make him a suggestion?
[01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:40.980]   Rocket mortgage from quick and loans.
[01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:46.820]   The number one lender in the country quick and loans is also a very forward thinking,
[01:19:46.820 --> 01:19:48.900]   very modern company.
[01:19:48.900 --> 01:19:52.900]   Probably why they've been number one and customer satisfaction for eight years running
[01:19:52.900 --> 01:19:54.500]   according to JD power.
[01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:58.180]   And they realized that the mortgage experience wasn't really keeping up with the times.
[01:19:58.180 --> 01:19:59.380]   It was kind of Dickensian.
[01:19:59.380 --> 01:20:04.260]   You go to a bank ask, please, can I have some money fill out a long application?
[01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:12.820]   Facts stuff to the bank, paperwork, pay stubs, quick and loans created a client focused
[01:20:12.820 --> 01:20:14.020]   technological revolution.
[01:20:14.020 --> 01:20:17.140]   They call rocket mortgages entirely online.
[01:20:17.140 --> 01:20:20.820]   And it's completely transparent.
[01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:21.700]   It's fast.
[01:20:21.700 --> 01:20:25.860]   You'll fully understand everything that's going on and you can be confident that you're
[01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:27.860]   getting exactly the right mortgage for you.
[01:20:27.860 --> 01:20:32.100]   And I'll tell you what, for geeks like me, the idea that I could do this whole thing on my
[01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:36.980]   smartphone at an open house and within 10 minutes get loan approval, that's enough for me.
[01:20:36.980 --> 01:20:42.340]   Whether you're buying your first home or your 10th rocket mortgage is a whole new way of doing
[01:20:42.340 --> 01:20:44.020]   this that you will love.
[01:20:44.020 --> 01:20:47.700]   All you have to do is answer a few simple questions then based on income assets and credit,
[01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:51.940]   they'll analyze all the home loan options for which you qualify and you find the run.
[01:20:51.940 --> 01:20:52.980]   That's just right for you.
[01:20:52.980 --> 01:20:58.260]   You choose the term, the down payment, the rate, and you're good to go under 10 minutes.
[01:20:58.260 --> 01:21:01.460]   In most cases, rocket mortgage by quick and loans apply simply.
[01:21:02.020 --> 01:21:04.900]   Understand fully mortgage confidently.
[01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:12.740]   I don't know exactly what Ironman has to do with this, but it's on the front page.
[01:21:12.740 --> 01:21:15.460]   To get started, go to rocketmortgage.com/macbreak.
[01:21:15.460 --> 01:21:21.140]   Rocketmortgage.com/macbreak, equal housing lender, licensed in all 50 states,
[01:21:21.140 --> 01:21:23.940]   nmlsconsumeraccess.org number 30, 30.
[01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:26.420]   I guess the idea is you could be in a giant
[01:21:27.780 --> 01:21:30.660]   infinity war battle and still get alone.
[01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:32.580]   Is that the theory?
[01:21:32.580 --> 01:21:33.380]   Is that the premise?
[01:21:33.380 --> 01:21:41.140]   Renee says yes rocketmortgage.com/macbreak.
[01:21:41.140 --> 01:21:42.740]   We thank quick and loans, so they're supportive.
[01:21:42.740 --> 01:21:43.780]   Mac break weekly.
[01:21:43.780 --> 01:21:45.060]   Are you off your call, Renee?
[01:21:45.060 --> 01:21:45.540]   Yes.
[01:21:45.540 --> 01:21:46.100]   Yes.
[01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:46.580]   Yes.
[01:21:46.580 --> 01:21:48.340]   No, I am on the infinity war thing.
[01:21:48.340 --> 01:21:50.900]   I mean, you need a good mortgage if it can be an infinity war.
[01:21:50.900 --> 01:21:52.660]   It's expensive.
[01:21:52.660 --> 01:21:54.980]   It is not a cheap thing to do.
[01:21:54.980 --> 01:21:57.300]   Well, why don't you kick things off then with your pick of the week?
[01:21:57.860 --> 01:22:00.500]   So my pick of the week is a lot of fun.
[01:22:00.500 --> 01:22:02.020]   I'm going to just strap it on right now.
[01:22:02.020 --> 01:22:02.900]   It is the Oculus.
[01:22:02.900 --> 01:22:03.460]   Oh, you got it.
[01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:04.900]   Go.
[01:22:04.900 --> 01:22:05.380]   Yeah.
[01:22:05.380 --> 01:22:07.060]   This is their new standalone rift.
[01:22:07.060 --> 01:22:08.180]   Yeah.
[01:22:08.180 --> 01:22:10.740]   So I mean, I was shocked at how inexpensive it was.
[01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:11.460]   I thought that was a price.
[01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:14.180]   It was $200 US, $250, I think, for the version I got,
[01:22:14.180 --> 01:22:15.700]   which is $64 gigabytes.
[01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:18.660]   I thought that was the price for the controller or something,
[01:22:18.660 --> 01:22:19.860]   but it's for the whole thing.
[01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:21.620]   And yet there are a few compromises.
[01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:25.060]   You can turn your head side to side and you can go up and down
[01:22:25.060 --> 01:22:26.980]   and you can look through three dimensional space.
[01:22:26.980 --> 01:22:29.540]   But because there's no sort of tower sensors the way
[01:22:29.540 --> 01:22:34.420]   Avive has, and there's no sort of other directional sensors,
[01:22:34.420 --> 01:22:35.700]   you can't walk around with it.
[01:22:35.700 --> 01:22:38.500]   So it doesn't, well, you can, but it doesn't care if you walk around.
[01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:40.100]   You can walk around, but it doesn't care.
[01:22:40.100 --> 01:22:40.580]   Yeah.
[01:22:40.580 --> 01:22:41.700]   It doesn't affect the gameplay.
[01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:43.140]   So it's a little bit more passive.
[01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:45.060]   It's a little bit more consumption focused.
[01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:48.180]   But they're doing a couple of really interesting things.
[01:22:48.180 --> 01:22:50.900]   Like the way they're using the GPU to render is focused
[01:22:50.900 --> 01:22:54.500]   on putting more rendering and more pixels in the middle of the display.
[01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:56.900]   And they're using lens technology that just sort of focuses
[01:22:56.900 --> 01:22:57.780]   the density in the middle.
[01:22:57.780 --> 01:23:01.300]   So as a result, it actually looks better than the big oculus.
[01:23:01.300 --> 01:23:03.860]   Like it looks, there's almost no screen door effect.
[01:23:03.860 --> 01:23:05.860]   And I, you watch this.
[01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:07.860]   It's really cool.
[01:23:07.860 --> 01:23:08.900]   Like it's a complete con.
[01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:11.780]   It's almost like touch, you know, like those force touch things where,
[01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:14.260]   you know, you're being lied to, but you're really happy with a lie.
[01:23:14.260 --> 01:23:17.700]   And the game so far are really fun.
[01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:20.980]   Like again, they're on rails because you can't really walk around.
[01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:26.340]   But I went through the Stranger Things and the Fishing and the Undersea Exploration.
[01:23:26.340 --> 01:23:30.020]   And I watched a bunch of Netflix and Netflix is great because you really are.
[01:23:30.020 --> 01:23:31.860]   It's like being in your own private movie theater.
[01:23:31.860 --> 01:23:34.820]   You don't see anybody around you and you can move the screen forward or back.
[01:23:34.820 --> 01:23:38.580]   And you can watch just, you know, anything that Netflix has to offer.
[01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:43.780]   So it doesn't fix this like, it doesn't fix the in room social thing.
[01:23:43.780 --> 01:23:46.660]   Like all of three or four of you are wearing them all in the same room.
[01:23:46.660 --> 01:23:48.660]   You're still a bunch of people wearing visors in the same room.
[01:23:48.660 --> 01:23:50.500]   It'd be great on the plane though.
[01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:52.020]   Oh, that's the first thing I thought of.
[01:23:52.020 --> 01:23:54.500]   And then I thought like when I take it off, are they all going to be staring at me?
[01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:56.020]   Like a steward is going to be looking at me like,
[01:23:56.020 --> 01:23:56.900]   "You jerk."
[01:23:56.900 --> 01:23:59.780]   Oh, everybody in the plane is in their own personal space.
[01:23:59.780 --> 01:24:02.100]   We're in a weird headgear and things.
[01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:02.580]   That's not-
[01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:04.900]   Also, Ollie told me he wore his and the minute he took it off,
[01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:06.500]   the steward is ran out and goes, "Oh, thank God.
[01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:08.260]   I've been waiting to give you your beverage seat."
[01:24:08.260 --> 01:24:15.540]   I'm just concerned about all the pictures of me that are going to appear on Instagram
[01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:19.540]   of me, like just with my mouth slightly holding a gape with like,
[01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:21.940]   you know, bags of peanuts that have been like thrown onto my chest
[01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:23.940]   because I'm just oblivious to what's going on about me.
[01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:26.820]   But- And the controller is really well engineered.
[01:24:26.820 --> 01:24:27.860]   The whole thing is a lot of fun.
[01:24:27.860 --> 01:24:31.060]   And it's- If you've been curious about VR, but it's been too expensive,
[01:24:31.060 --> 01:24:33.540]   this is basically- You don't need a computer for this.
[01:24:33.540 --> 01:24:36.260]   There's no- There are no strings to hold you down.
[01:24:36.260 --> 01:24:37.460]   It's all self-contained.
[01:24:37.460 --> 01:24:39.620]   You don't need any of the other things.
[01:24:39.620 --> 01:24:41.380]   You don't need a smartphone in the front flaps.
[01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:42.980]   You're not wasting your smartphone battery.
[01:24:42.980 --> 01:24:45.380]   And you're not using a device that wasn't actually optimized for this.
[01:24:45.380 --> 01:24:48.340]   It's a really good way to get started to test it out to see if you like it.
[01:24:48.340 --> 01:24:49.300]   What is the battery life?
[01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:54.020]   They say four hours, but I think that's if you're actually doing a lot of gaming,
[01:24:54.020 --> 01:24:57.780]   which I've been mostly doing like experiences, like watching Netflix
[01:24:57.780 --> 01:25:00.180]   or going through undersea caves and things.
[01:25:00.180 --> 01:25:02.260]   And it's been lasting like six hours for me.
[01:25:02.260 --> 01:25:02.580]   Wow.
[01:25:02.580 --> 01:25:05.300]   It's totally unperformed.
[01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:06.500]   That's a close to close to five.
[01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:07.620]   It was at 65%.
[01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:08.580]   So I was really happy.
[01:25:08.580 --> 01:25:10.180]   I'm intrigued.
[01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:12.180]   I'm intrigued.
[01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:12.580]   Thank you.
[01:25:12.580 --> 01:25:13.540]   You have to get one Leo.
[01:25:13.540 --> 01:25:14.580]   Like you have to- Maybe I do.
[01:25:14.580 --> 01:25:17.140]   We've got one coming in for review, but I don't know.
[01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:19.940]   That sounds like something I'm- I gotta- I gotta say,
[01:25:19.940 --> 01:25:24.900]   if it's half what it's like for these- If it's half as good as what it's like
[01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:30.660]   to just to have a cardboard or the gear VR from Samsung, watching movies.
[01:25:30.660 --> 01:25:35.460]   I was skeptical at first, but I leave the software on the gear VR, for instance.
[01:25:35.460 --> 01:25:38.100]   It puts you into like an actual movie theater.
[01:25:38.100 --> 01:25:42.740]   And it's like there are movies that I've had like just ripped to like HD
[01:25:42.740 --> 01:25:45.300]   that are super wide screen that I was noticing.
[01:25:45.300 --> 01:25:49.220]   I was interacting with this movie that was made in 1972, 1973.
[01:25:49.220 --> 01:25:52.100]   The way the director clearly intended me to react to it.
[01:25:52.100 --> 01:25:53.140]   That's interesting.
[01:25:53.140 --> 01:25:57.540]   Meaning that I- There was like something happening on the left hand side of the screen.
[01:25:57.540 --> 01:26:01.140]   And in the background, there was just someone taking an app like on a bed.
[01:26:01.140 --> 01:26:05.140]   And clearly the director meant not for me to take this whole thing in my field of vision,
[01:26:05.140 --> 01:26:07.540]   but to turn my head and then- Oh wow.
[01:26:07.540 --> 01:26:08.900]   And like be to see the whole thing.
[01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:12.260]   And it became one of my favorite ways to watch a movie.
[01:26:12.260 --> 01:26:16.180]   I just got the Lawrence of Olivier super wide- Oh yeah.
[01:26:16.180 --> 01:26:17.140]   Lawrence of Olivier.
[01:26:17.140 --> 01:26:19.140]   Lawrence of Olivier.
[01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:20.980]   I'm a little jet-lagged.
[01:26:20.980 --> 01:26:22.340]   Although that would be a pretty good movie.
[01:26:22.340 --> 01:26:23.220]   Lawrence of Olivier.
[01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:26.180]   The Lawrence of Arabia was super wide screen.
[01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:30.740]   Blu-ray, but boy, I guess it's not a Netflix, so I won't be able to watch it.
[01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:33.620]   There's also one caveat in that it's owned by Facebook,
[01:26:33.620 --> 01:26:36.180]   which now just for some people, like I got some pushback from people,
[01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:37.780]   said yeah, but it's Facebook.
[01:26:37.780 --> 01:26:40.740]   And I do understand that I got my Oculus before Facebook bottom.
[01:26:40.740 --> 01:26:42.500]   And the minute they bought them, I'm like, oh, that's smart,
[01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:43.940]   because I can close your app.
[01:26:43.940 --> 01:26:46.340]   I can close your tab, but it's much harder to take a helmet off.
[01:26:46.340 --> 01:26:47.140]   Yeah.
[01:26:47.140 --> 01:26:49.380]   But I signed in with my original Oculus ID.
[01:26:49.380 --> 01:26:51.060]   You can still make an Oculus ID.
[01:26:51.060 --> 01:26:53.380]   I suppose it can, if it knows your email addresses,
[01:26:53.380 --> 01:26:55.060]   it can link those and make a shadow profile.
[01:26:55.060 --> 01:26:55.540]   I don't know.
[01:26:55.540 --> 01:26:58.820]   But the idea of Facebook on my face hasn't been that scary yet.
[01:26:58.820 --> 01:27:01.220]   Do you need to have a Facebook account?
[01:27:01.220 --> 01:27:02.420]   It's not required.
[01:27:02.420 --> 01:27:05.540]   So no, so they make it like you don't know that like you get in.
[01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:07.220]   And if you don't have an Oculus ID, like I have,
[01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:10.740]   it's a giant Facebook button, almost like they got caught
[01:27:10.740 --> 01:27:11.540]   forward doing in the EU.
[01:27:11.540 --> 01:27:13.380]   It's like a giant and tiny at the bottom.
[01:27:13.380 --> 01:27:14.820]   It says log in with Oculus.
[01:27:14.820 --> 01:27:15.460]   Oh, OK.
[01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:16.740]   Old-fashioned link text.
[01:27:16.740 --> 01:27:18.820]   Yeah, because I don't have a Facebook account anymore.
[01:27:18.820 --> 01:27:23.300]   They try to get you, but I have not done a single Facebook-y thing with it so far,
[01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:24.740]   and I'm super happy about that.
[01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:25.060]   Yeah.
[01:27:25.060 --> 01:27:27.300]   What was the code name of this device, the face hugger?
[01:27:27.300 --> 01:27:29.140]   I think it was.
[01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:32.900]   And if you really don't like Facebook,
[01:27:32.900 --> 01:27:36.900]   the Google and Lenovo have a very, very similar device that you can look at instead.
[01:27:36.900 --> 01:27:37.620]   Yeah.
[01:27:37.620 --> 01:27:40.420]   I was a little concerned that because it was so inexpensive
[01:27:40.420 --> 01:27:43.060]   that the screens just wouldn't be that good and would really not look
[01:27:43.780 --> 01:27:47.380]   as good as even a Gear VR, which is using the Samsung phone.
[01:27:47.380 --> 01:27:50.260]   They're not OLED, so they're fast-switch LCD.
[01:27:50.260 --> 01:27:53.780]   And typically, you can't use LCD because the refresh rate isn't high enough.
[01:27:53.780 --> 01:27:56.340]   But this has a really high refresh rate.
[01:27:56.340 --> 01:27:58.500]   And again, it's got these for Nerve for a little.
[01:27:58.500 --> 01:27:59.860]   I forget how to pronounce it.
[01:27:59.860 --> 01:28:02.100]   Lenses that really focus you in the middle of the night.
[01:28:02.100 --> 01:28:02.740]   For Nell.
[01:28:02.740 --> 01:28:03.700]   For Nell, that's right.
[01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:06.260]   I like for Nervefuler.
[01:28:06.260 --> 01:28:07.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:28:07.300 --> 01:28:08.500]   I'm an idiot.
[01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:08.980]   I'm an idiot.
[01:28:08.980 --> 01:28:09.940]   You can do the minuscule.
[01:28:09.940 --> 01:28:11.220]   Not for Nutter, Lindsay.
[01:28:11.220 --> 01:28:12.340]   I'm a pretty shitty runny.
[01:28:12.980 --> 01:28:15.860]   It really does make almost no screen door effects.
[01:28:15.860 --> 01:28:18.180]   Even with the resolution not being like a caper.
[01:28:18.180 --> 01:28:20.180]   And the fact that you said that intrigues me.
[01:28:20.180 --> 01:28:22.180]   And the frame rate is 60, right?
[01:28:22.180 --> 01:28:23.060]   Rather than 90.
[01:28:23.060 --> 01:28:23.460]   Yeah.
[01:28:23.460 --> 01:28:24.260]   Rather than 90.
[01:28:24.260 --> 01:28:25.380]   I think the developers can--
[01:28:25.380 --> 01:28:26.900]   There's a two choices for developers.
[01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:28.500]   They can choose how they want to handle it.
[01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:30.740]   But so far, I haven't had any problems with it.
[01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:31.140]   Oh, wow.
[01:28:31.140 --> 01:28:36.020]   Film editor for Lawrence of Arabia has just passed away at the age of 92.
[01:28:36.020 --> 01:28:39.140]   She heard that I got the widescreen and want to watch it on a helmet.
[01:28:39.140 --> 01:28:39.940]   And--
[01:28:39.940 --> 01:28:41.300]   That was it.
[01:28:41.300 --> 01:28:42.100]   That was not--
[01:28:42.100 --> 01:28:43.060]   You kids.
[01:28:43.060 --> 01:28:44.020]   I'm checking out.
[01:28:44.020 --> 01:28:46.420]   Lapart.
[01:28:46.420 --> 01:28:49.700]   Good.
[01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:50.500]   All right.
[01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:52.100]   That's a strong recommendation.
[01:28:52.100 --> 01:28:52.980]   We will have our review.
[01:28:52.980 --> 01:28:54.980]   I think in the next couple of weeks on the new screen savers.
[01:28:54.980 --> 01:28:56.180]   Andy, what's your pick of the week?
[01:28:56.180 --> 01:28:58.100]   I've got kind of a double pick.
[01:28:58.100 --> 01:29:04.580]   My pick is a movie, but it's also an excuse to plug my best and oldest friend,
[01:29:04.580 --> 01:29:05.700]   John's movie blog.
[01:29:05.700 --> 01:29:11.700]   In 2009, he set the goal of watching a movie he hasn't seen every day
[01:29:11.700 --> 01:29:13.940]   for an writing about it for an entire year.
[01:29:13.940 --> 01:29:17.860]   And he decided-- because he is such an orderly--
[01:29:17.860 --> 01:29:23.220]   My God, if he is your office manager, he's like having Jeeves, the butler running.
[01:29:23.220 --> 01:29:25.620]   He is so logistically focused.
[01:29:25.620 --> 01:29:28.980]   And he got-- well, let's have all these movies link to each other.
[01:29:28.980 --> 01:29:32.900]   So he basically came up with this list of the movies he plans to see.
[01:29:32.900 --> 01:29:36.740]   And he will only stop when he runs out of movies on his list,
[01:29:36.740 --> 01:29:39.140]   but he keeps finding new ways to link new movies to it.
[01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:44.900]   So soon, he will be up to his 3,000 movie review/sa.
[01:29:44.900 --> 01:29:50.180]   And so we go to honkysmovieyear.blogspot.com.
[01:29:50.180 --> 01:29:54.500]   I think that was his Twitter handle or whatever.
[01:29:54.500 --> 01:29:56.260]   And he felt he needed to use that.
[01:29:56.260 --> 01:29:58.820]   And I can't recommend it highly enough.
[01:29:58.820 --> 01:30:01.620]   But we've been friends since junior high.
[01:30:01.620 --> 01:30:03.940]   And he lives in the New York area.
[01:30:03.940 --> 01:30:08.660]   So whenever I'm in New York, I get a chance to have a long visit with him.
[01:30:08.660 --> 01:30:11.700]   So I got to see three of the movies that he was seeing,
[01:30:11.700 --> 01:30:12.900]   night after night after night.
[01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:14.900]   This is one of them.
[01:30:14.900 --> 01:30:17.460]   And one of the great things about this is that it's not,
[01:30:17.460 --> 01:30:19.780]   oh, I can't wait to see the new Avengers movie.
[01:30:19.780 --> 01:30:24.740]   Sometimes it's that I need a movie that will link Tuesday's movie to Thursday's movie,
[01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:27.620]   and he'll find something that has the same actor in it.
[01:30:27.620 --> 01:30:30.660]   And so he winds up having to watch a lot of random stuff.
[01:30:30.660 --> 01:30:34.100]   So the movie that we saw that he totally undersold,
[01:30:34.100 --> 01:30:37.860]   because it turned out to be one of the best movies I've seen all year.
[01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:40.900]   It's called hardcore Henry, don't joke.
[01:30:40.900 --> 01:30:44.980]   It is essentially imagine a Russian dash cam video,
[01:30:44.980 --> 01:30:47.220]   but as a feature length movie.
[01:30:47.220 --> 01:30:52.980]   It is all shot first person with GoPro cameras attached to like the characters head.
[01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:57.300]   And it is a feature length action movie,
[01:30:57.300 --> 01:31:01.700]   where it is one of the most thrilling things I have ever seen by.
[01:31:01.700 --> 01:31:04.260]   And also it doesn't try to get too heavy handed with,
[01:31:04.260 --> 01:31:05.860]   oh, it's not like the Matrix,
[01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:08.340]   or we're building a whole world here to philosophy.
[01:31:08.340 --> 01:31:13.220]   It's no, we're going to have 90 minutes where you can't catch your breath even once.
[01:31:13.220 --> 01:31:16.260]   We're going to have a story that the characterization of the story,
[01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:18.500]   it's again, it's not going to win an Academy Award,
[01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:21.940]   but the whole point is to keep you engaged and keep mysteries coming
[01:31:21.940 --> 01:31:24.900]   and then solve those mysteries for you.
[01:31:24.900 --> 01:31:30.180]   And I'll tell you that not just because of the first person point of view,
[01:31:30.180 --> 01:31:37.300]   but also because the action is so realistic that it is twice as thrilling as anything I've seen
[01:31:37.300 --> 01:31:41.780]   in a 200 or 300 millimeter, $3 million Hollywood blockbuster.
[01:31:41.780 --> 01:31:48.180]   The black widow riding a motorcycle off the top of a hotel,
[01:31:48.180 --> 01:31:51.140]   landing 300 feet onto the ground, taking off,
[01:31:51.140 --> 01:31:53.460]   and then going onto a ramp and picking up a shield.
[01:31:53.460 --> 01:31:59.060]   Isn't one tenth as interesting as watching this guy in a motorcycle side car drive.
[01:31:59.060 --> 01:32:05.620]   There you go, into a van, especially because it will not let your pulse go down for one second.
[01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:09.540]   I was 20 minutes into this movie, and I was on my iPad and I said,
[01:32:09.540 --> 01:32:12.020]   okay, going to Amazon, buying the Blu-ray.
[01:32:12.020 --> 01:32:18.180]   Because if anything, I want to see the behind the scenes shots of how they did this.
[01:32:18.180 --> 01:32:19.060]   It was amazing.
[01:32:19.060 --> 01:32:22.820]   And you'll find out that amazingly, it will cost $2 million.
[01:32:22.820 --> 01:32:26.660]   And amazingly, there were almost no injuries on set.
[01:32:26.660 --> 01:32:27.620]   That's amazing.
[01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:33.140]   Yeah, I mean, despite the fact that this is, I guess one of the things that kind of makes it
[01:32:33.140 --> 01:32:37.300]   more exciting for you as you're watching it is that this is almost entirely shot in Russia.
[01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:43.140]   And you feel as though maybe there aren't quite as many rules as you can do to like stun people
[01:32:43.140 --> 01:32:51.300]   and extras. But again, I'm not saying this is unfortunate maybe that we're talking about this
[01:32:51.300 --> 01:32:55.780]   in the same scene, the same breath that Lawrence of Arabia, it is not Lawrence of Arabia.
[01:32:55.780 --> 01:32:59.060]   But oh my God, it is such an entertaining movie.
[01:32:59.060 --> 01:33:01.700]   Yeah, I remember when it came out and I wanted to see it, I forgot.
[01:33:01.700 --> 01:33:07.300]   Now that would be great if you put that on Renee's pick and watch it on your Oculus.
[01:33:07.300 --> 01:33:08.900]   Holy cow.
[01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:11.460]   I'm wondering what that would be like.
[01:33:11.460 --> 01:33:14.420]   I think it would be terrible because you might throw up.
[01:33:14.420 --> 01:33:20.260]   Yeah, I mean, but I've read, I was so excited to find out like how they had done all the stuff.
[01:33:20.260 --> 01:33:24.980]   Because it almost, it's not presented as one continuous shot, but it could almost be.
[01:33:24.980 --> 01:33:29.860]   It's almost that kind of experience. And as they're, they didn't just like glue,
[01:33:29.860 --> 01:33:34.420]   they didn't just have the standard like where we got your Oculus on the headband or something.
[01:33:34.420 --> 01:33:37.220]   They figured out after they, after some experience, they found out that, well, no,
[01:33:37.220 --> 01:33:41.700]   that's not the right angle. You actually need to have the, you need to have the camera like
[01:33:41.700 --> 01:33:46.180]   actually mounted like at mouth or chin level to get like the first person perspective they're
[01:33:46.180 --> 01:33:51.380]   looking for. So they built this special helmet that also has like dampers on it that limits them.
[01:33:51.380 --> 01:33:55.140]   It doesn't, it stabilizes it just enough to make it a Herki jerky.
[01:33:55.140 --> 01:33:58.020]   So yes, you better believe that the first thing I'm going to try with,
[01:33:58.020 --> 01:34:04.260]   try with Gear VR or a new Oculus is, is this movie, but I am anticipating the need to
[01:34:04.260 --> 01:34:07.140]   tear the goggles off my head and run to the bathroom really quickly.
[01:34:07.140 --> 01:34:11.540]   Yeah, no kidding. Hard core Henry and honkys.
[01:34:11.540 --> 01:34:12.660]   What's it called?
[01:34:12.660 --> 01:34:13.940]   Honkysmovieyear.com again.
[01:34:13.940 --> 01:34:14.900]   Honkys movie year.
[01:34:14.900 --> 01:34:16.500]   It was going to do this for one year.
[01:34:16.500 --> 01:34:19.460]   It is now close to the 10th anniversary and is 3000.
[01:34:19.460 --> 01:34:21.620]   Now, being a hockey is not married.
[01:34:21.620 --> 01:34:23.380]   He is married.
[01:34:23.380 --> 01:34:26.420]   Oh, he's been married for like 17 years to a wonderful woman.
[01:34:26.420 --> 01:34:31.700]   She must be a movie and I for the rest of your life.
[01:34:31.700 --> 01:34:37.060]   Yeah. And it's fun because it's not, they're not, they're not all like movie reviews.
[01:34:37.060 --> 01:34:41.380]   They're basically essays on the experience of watching the movie and he writes them.
[01:34:41.380 --> 01:34:46.820]   And that's why I have another friend who is also a fan of John's, John's site.
[01:34:46.820 --> 01:34:51.940]   And he often gets angry because he will say the third man, four out of 10,
[01:34:51.940 --> 01:34:57.380]   four out of 10 for the third man compared to the Huffleham's movie, seven out of 10.
[01:34:57.380 --> 01:34:57.700]   John.
[01:34:57.700 --> 01:35:05.220]   I do like the idea though, I was browsing through it of getting ideas of movies to watch from it.
[01:35:05.220 --> 01:35:06.580]   And it gave me a bunch of great movie.
[01:35:06.580 --> 01:35:12.340]   I don't know why Turner Classic movies does not hire him to program that channel.
[01:35:12.340 --> 01:35:18.020]   Because again, he will tell you why he's doing a string of movies that all involve
[01:35:18.020 --> 01:35:23.380]   like, you know, all involve mistaken identities and a string of identity, a string that's all about
[01:35:23.380 --> 01:35:27.860]   a car that gets demolished. And sometimes it's just again, an actor that carries on from one
[01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:33.940]   to another. But this is an unbroken chain that's going on for nearly 3000. And it's like every time.
[01:35:33.940 --> 01:35:38.820]   He is an inspiration to me every time. I'm like, oh God, I don't know if I want to like write,
[01:35:38.820 --> 01:35:42.100]   write a column or something today. It's like, John has written something every,
[01:35:42.100 --> 01:35:45.620]   almost every single day for 3000 days in a row.
[01:35:45.620 --> 01:35:50.740]   Now let me ask you behind the scenes thing. Is he getting these movies on iTunes or is he getting
[01:35:50.740 --> 01:35:57.620]   DVD subscription and Netflix or how it's a combination of he subscribes to pretty much every cable
[01:35:57.620 --> 01:36:03.460]   channel. So he records a lot of stuff off of cable. Also, he's one of his previous duties.
[01:36:03.460 --> 01:36:11.860]   He used to work for like a in the animation industry. And one of his jobs was to record
[01:36:11.860 --> 01:36:16.820]   every night of television and look for commercials that involve animation and then like create a
[01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:22.020]   highlight reel that gets sent nationally to people who use this service or whatever.
[01:36:22.020 --> 01:36:25.780]   And so he's just used to doing all this and organizing it. But sometimes it's like he knows
[01:36:25.780 --> 01:36:30.820]   that he wants to see the new, he knows he wants to see the new Avengers movie. He knows that the
[01:36:30.820 --> 01:36:35.780]   release date is this. So he will adjust this, he will adjust it so that there will be a reason why
[01:36:35.780 --> 01:36:43.540]   this can work inside the link that he's been building right there. And it's he had of work or he just
[01:36:43.540 --> 01:36:49.220]   doesn't have really much to do at work. He works for you know, Bill Plimpton, the animator. Yeah.
[01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:54.740]   He is sort of like, if you know what radar O'Reilly was the 407th Summit of Mash, that is what he is.
[01:36:54.740 --> 01:37:02.580]   Plimpton's radar. It's basically he does everything that required to get that done. And he he's a
[01:37:02.580 --> 01:37:08.340]   graduate of NYU Film School. And he's basically been working in the industry, essentially helping
[01:37:08.340 --> 01:37:15.540]   directors create their businesses by doing explaining to them, no, no, no, you have to.
[01:37:15.540 --> 01:37:23.620]   A key story about John and how good he is at what he does. An actor who was
[01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:33.380]   a lead one of the lead actors on Friends wanted to like participate in one of Bill Plimpton's movies.
[01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:38.180]   And he's in the union and so like they would have to pay him a certain minimum. And so it looked
[01:37:38.180 --> 01:37:45.540]   like it couldn't happen. But John downloaded the PDF of every single rule that the screen guild had
[01:37:45.540 --> 01:37:51.380]   found a loophole that said that so long as we only use him for this amount of time, so long as we
[01:37:51.380 --> 01:37:56.580]   build him book him like this, we can pay him what we can afford to pay him. And that's how
[01:37:56.580 --> 01:38:01.860]   this Friends actor became a voice on a Bill Plimpton movie. He is the as a kid, he is the person that
[01:38:01.860 --> 01:38:06.340]   will win every board game because he's the only person who read the inside of the lid that the box
[01:38:06.340 --> 01:38:10.900]   came in. He's the only one who knows that you can do the thing that he just thought he was cheating at.
[01:38:10.900 --> 01:38:16.580]   I can't recommend another recommendation. If you if you have a business, hire John to do anything.
[01:38:16.580 --> 01:38:17.460]   He'll make it wonderful.
[01:38:18.980 --> 01:38:26.340]   Honkysmovieyear.com. And now without I see you're browsing it as well. Of course,
[01:38:26.340 --> 01:38:30.500]   that's what I was looking for movies to see. It's always a always looking for new movies to look at.
[01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:38.500]   Time for Alex Lindsay's pick of the week. So my pick of the week is a new broadcasting tool.
[01:38:38.500 --> 01:38:42.980]   And so I'm just starting to play with it. Justine Azarik has been playing with it a bit. And so
[01:38:42.980 --> 01:38:48.260]   she got me kind of she piqued my interest. And as I watch it on the iPhone, it's just worth
[01:38:49.060 --> 01:38:56.180]   watching. So anyway, so this is called caffeine.tv. And it's in prerelease. So this is kind of your
[01:38:56.180 --> 01:39:01.140]   early chance to kind of see as people start to re experiment with live streaming. Of course,
[01:39:01.140 --> 01:39:05.380]   we pay a lot of attention to live streaming. That's what we do. And so we watch what everybody
[01:39:05.380 --> 01:39:12.820]   does. And so there's interesting things like other ones musically and lively are a format that
[01:39:12.820 --> 01:39:16.980]   we watch a lot because I don't understand it. I still keep looking at it. It's so hyper.
[01:39:16.980 --> 01:39:20.900]   It's because you're not 12. I know it's but it's like they're dropping coins and they're doing
[01:39:20.900 --> 01:39:25.300]   all this other stuff. And so that kind of makes sense. This one is probably, you know,
[01:39:25.300 --> 01:39:30.020]   you can broadcast from the web, from your PC and camera and the phone. And the one that I find
[01:39:30.020 --> 01:39:35.460]   the most interesting is the PC game and camera. So when you do that, you're getting when you
[01:39:35.460 --> 01:39:42.260]   actually watch it on your phone, you get an over under of your of the videos. So what they're doing
[01:39:42.260 --> 01:39:46.260]   is they're taking two videos in and they're actually compositing them in different ways,
[01:39:46.260 --> 01:39:51.540]   depending on how if you hold your phone at vertically, you're getting kind of an over under. You see
[01:39:51.540 --> 01:39:58.340]   the person in full screen and below them, you see the game. And then if you turn it to landscape,
[01:39:58.340 --> 01:40:03.140]   it, you know, build basically builds a picture in picture for you. Anyway, it's I find it to be,
[01:40:03.140 --> 01:40:08.100]   you know, they're just experimenting with the way things, you know, the way that they're doing
[01:40:08.100 --> 01:40:14.260]   things. I think that this is probably if anything is going to start, it'd be any competitor to
[01:40:14.260 --> 01:40:21.860]   Twitch. It's most likely this is caffeine.tv. And so, you know, they've partnered with a lot of
[01:40:21.860 --> 01:40:25.780]   that. I mean, that you can do it from within these, I mean, or you can do it in on your PC with
[01:40:25.780 --> 01:40:30.260]   these games and it's taking your webcam and it's just a different way of doing it. So I guess my,
[01:40:30.260 --> 01:40:37.380]   I think it's worth, it's worth checking out. And if you're into live streaming, definitely check
[01:40:37.380 --> 01:40:43.380]   out caffeine.tv and just and even just download the app and watch it. So you'll see that composite
[01:40:43.380 --> 01:40:46.820]   there, but they're doing that for them. So they're taking some of that work away from
[01:40:46.820 --> 01:40:51.860]   kind of nice. Yeah, from the user. I mean, I want to, I'm working on some game stuff right now and I
[01:40:51.860 --> 01:40:56.420]   want to control that. But, but I think for the average user who just wants to stream and play
[01:40:56.420 --> 01:41:02.420]   games, I think that it's a great solution. It's actually started by two former Apple folks,
[01:41:02.420 --> 01:41:08.740]   Bob, Kinggren and Sam Roberts. I haven't gotten into Fortnite yet, by the way,
[01:41:08.740 --> 01:41:13.700]   Fortnite is awesome. I just get killed really fast. Well, I do too, but that's one of the great
[01:41:13.700 --> 01:41:20.180]   things about Fortnite is some random continue to watch after somebody kills you and you end up
[01:41:20.180 --> 01:41:24.340]   seeing the whole game because whoever kills them, you get to watch them and right. I really like
[01:41:24.340 --> 01:41:28.260]   the spectator mode. That's the first. You saw you can move around, you can move it so it's not
[01:41:28.260 --> 01:41:33.620]   composited together. So you have that video tool that video can be moved, you can hide it,
[01:41:33.620 --> 01:41:38.420]   you can move it. So from the user's perspective, they've separated that connection between that.
[01:41:38.420 --> 01:41:42.740]   So if you really want to see the person you can, if you want to hide them and not see them and
[01:41:42.740 --> 01:41:47.380]   just watch the game, you can. So it's an interesting. It's a couple of guys who worked at Apple for
[01:41:47.380 --> 01:41:54.260]   Apple TV, so it's cool. They have some chops. Check it out. Thank you, Alex, for being here.
[01:41:54.260 --> 01:41:59.780]   It's great to see you again. You can find Alex's work at Pixel Core or follow him on the Twitter.
[01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:06.020]   That's the best thing to do at A-L-E-X-L-I-N-D-S-A. Why? I've got more videos coming soon.
[01:42:06.020 --> 01:42:10.580]   Whatever he's up to, you can, you know, they're so good. He'll do it on the Twitter.
[01:42:10.580 --> 01:42:13.140]   I took a break because I had to rethink it because I was like, this isn't going to work.
[01:42:13.140 --> 01:42:16.900]   You know, like there was no sustainability to it. So I took a break and then we're also
[01:42:16.900 --> 01:42:21.380]   shooting some videos in the studio of just tidbits about production that.
[01:42:21.380 --> 01:42:26.260]   So your videos are like on how to do stuff like the tear down.
[01:42:26.260 --> 01:42:29.860]   The tear down is one and then the next one, the new ones are like little tips on if you're buying
[01:42:29.860 --> 01:42:35.860]   SDI cables or, you know, how to, you know, do I have audio?
[01:42:35.860 --> 01:42:37.140]   That's the bad thing.
[01:42:37.140 --> 01:42:40.500]   Here you have a nice shot. This is where I look at other people's shows and
[01:42:40.500 --> 01:42:42.100]   I have a lot of people doing their job well.
[01:42:42.100 --> 01:42:44.180]   And I circle things and talk about things.
[01:42:44.180 --> 01:42:48.020]   I love that, by the way. This is such a great show. Really enjoy it.
[01:42:48.020 --> 01:42:52.020]   It's kind of what you want. It's kind of like what you wish you could do with Alex,
[01:42:52.020 --> 01:42:53.540]   you know, just have him come and watch.
[01:42:53.540 --> 01:42:54.500]   Like a consultant.
[01:42:54.500 --> 01:42:57.380]   Yeah. There's watch stuff with you and say, you see what he's doing there?
[01:42:57.380 --> 01:42:58.980]   Yeah. Yeah. Completely.
[01:42:58.980 --> 01:43:01.460]   Tell me how horrible I am, but also tell me why.
[01:43:01.460 --> 01:43:11.700]   Al X L I N D S A Y on the Twitter, Renee Richie from i'more.com where he's working very hard,
[01:43:11.700 --> 01:43:16.660]   not only writing millions of words a week, but he's also got the great vector podcast,
[01:43:16.660 --> 01:43:20.180]   which is daily. I don't understand how he does it all, but he does.
[01:43:20.180 --> 01:43:20.980]   And you got to.
[01:43:20.980 --> 01:43:22.260]   The audio and two video now.
[01:43:22.260 --> 01:43:25.700]   Yeah. And of course, with the new Lutron blinds.
[01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:29.700]   Yeah. They just, they've sent us them, but they're not set up yet. So to try them.
[01:43:29.700 --> 01:43:35.140]   And i'more.com, of course, to find out more about what Renee's up to,
[01:43:35.140 --> 01:43:38.820]   i'more.com/vector to see the latest vector videos.
[01:43:38.820 --> 01:43:42.420]   And of course, Mr. Andy, look at this.
[01:43:42.420 --> 01:43:47.460]   This is what is, what tool do you use for this? This is awesome.
[01:43:47.460 --> 01:43:48.900]   That's the lip-syn in bed.
[01:43:48.900 --> 01:43:51.460]   Oh my God. Oh, these are individual shows.
[01:43:51.460 --> 01:43:53.940]   I thought these were chapters or something. I could jump to a check.
[01:43:53.940 --> 01:43:57.940]   No. I mean, we've, we're, uh, Jim Messendorf will help some of the editing is run into a little bit of a brick wall
[01:43:57.940 --> 01:44:00.740]   where we can have links or we can have chapters and stuff.
[01:44:00.740 --> 01:44:01.780]   Right. So we're trying to figure that out.
[01:44:01.780 --> 01:44:05.700]   Yeah, we never did it because it ends up being hardware specific or, you know,
[01:44:05.700 --> 01:44:07.380]   provider specific. And so we just,
[01:44:07.380 --> 01:44:09.780]   how are you up to 110 episodes already?
[01:44:09.780 --> 01:44:11.300]   No, it's three episodes a week.
[01:44:11.300 --> 01:44:16.900]   Between you and John, I feel like such a piece of gum off of some bed person shoe.
[01:44:16.900 --> 01:44:21.860]   Today, today on the audio podcast, I'm talking to Patrick O'Neill, who created
[01:44:21.860 --> 01:44:24.260]   Aloclip and just left the company he talks about.
[01:44:24.260 --> 01:44:26.100]   But Aloclip was like it on the video show.
[01:44:26.100 --> 01:44:29.780]   I talk about why the Apple watch is more important as a product than the iPhone.
[01:44:29.780 --> 01:44:34.180]   He's an overachiever. That's all I can say.
[01:44:34.180 --> 01:44:41.140]   Yes. Andy and Ico, you'll find him at in.co.com, I H N A T K O dot com on the Twitter.
[01:44:41.140 --> 01:44:45.380]   And anything you want to plug besides your material podcast.
[01:44:45.380 --> 01:44:51.620]   Yeah, as a matter of fact, my, uh, my piece on the Google I O key note is going to be
[01:44:51.620 --> 01:44:54.180]   on Fast Company either late today or sometime tomorrow.
[01:44:54.180 --> 01:44:59.860]   I'm also going to be on Boston Public Radio tomorrow, also talking mostly about Google I O
[01:44:59.860 --> 01:45:06.100]   and a couple other things. And hopefully I will have some big news to announce in a week or two.
[01:45:06.100 --> 01:45:10.660]   Things are still kind of forming. But when it's a thing that will have a date, then I can announce
[01:45:10.660 --> 01:45:16.340]   it, but stay tuned. That sounds ominous. I think it's for amazing for everyone.
[01:45:16.340 --> 01:45:25.220]   Or amazing. It's when everybody's finally going to pay. Oh boy, will they pay you normally we do
[01:45:25.220 --> 01:45:28.660]   this show. We're doing it a little bit differently because of a crazy week with Google I O and the
[01:45:28.660 --> 01:45:35.140]   build keynote, but we will do the show next week at its usual time, which is right after IOS today,
[01:45:35.140 --> 01:45:41.140]   11 a.m. Pacific on Tuesdays, 2 p.m. Eastern time, 1800 UTC. Stop by and watch it either in studio.
[01:45:41.140 --> 01:45:46.260]   You can email tickets at Twitter.tv. We'll put out a chair for you or you can watch on the stream.
[01:45:46.260 --> 01:45:53.220]   Twit.tv/live. If you do that, join us in the chatroom to IRC.twit.tv. But of course,
[01:45:53.220 --> 01:45:57.300]   I know you have a busy life and maybe the easiest thing would be to download an episode and watch
[01:45:57.300 --> 01:46:02.500]   it at your convenience. We will let you do that too on demand versions of everything we do available
[01:46:02.500 --> 01:46:11.460]   audio or video, audio and video at twit.tv for the show is twit.tv/mbw. Or you could just search
[01:46:11.460 --> 01:46:16.260]   for Mac Break Weekly in your favorite podcast application and you will definitely find it.
[01:46:16.260 --> 01:46:21.860]   You can make it a regular habit. Subscribe if you will. Thanks for joining us and we'll see you next
[01:46:21.860 --> 01:46:28.580]   time, but I'm afraid it is time now to get back to work because break time is over. Now let's see.
[01:46:28.580 --> 01:46:40.980]   Point that phrase. See ya. Over.
