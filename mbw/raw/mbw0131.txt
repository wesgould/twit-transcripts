[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.120]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show that covers Macintosh.
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.280]   At All Things Apple, I'm Leo Laporte and joining me
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.920]   on the show, Round the Horn.
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.480]   We've got Mr. Andy Inakko from the Celestial Waste of Banwith.
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.960]   And the Chicago Sun-Times.
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.160]   Mr. I, how are you today?
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.040]   I am 70% Nido trending towards 90% Nido,
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.600]   although the bar hasn't moved since 8 AM.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.760]   So perhaps the improvement of my day progress bar
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.320]   has gotten bricked.
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.680]   So I might have to just reset the day and start all over again.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.120]   I mean, it never ends, does it?
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.120]   It never ends.
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.480]   It never ends. Wait till you see the watchman tonight.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.880]   And then you'll go through.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.880]   I got my IMAX tickets.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.360]   I'm not sure, but I'm just hoping that they made the right editorial
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.320]   choice with Dr. Manhattan because I don't want to see a blue,
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.080]   winky, like 80 feet across on a domed screen.
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.560]   I just don't know if that's what I want to spend.
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.760]   And you might not want to go.
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.120]   And that, my friends, is Mr. Scott Born of this week
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.120]   in photography, the blog, twopphoto.com.
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.760]   And Scottborn.com.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:30.480]   And it's a new show that you're going to help us launch, Leo.
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.040]   You know, OK, I am.
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.720]   Do you think that a storage show really is what the world needs now?
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.440]   Well, come on.
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.400]   It's not just storage.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.400]   It's about backup.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.480]   It's about arc.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.080]   I think it's how to use disk drives.
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.960]   And it's going to be at my dl.me and Andy and you and I
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.440]   are going to kick off the first show.
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.840]   Andy and I are going to be on every show together.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.440]   And then we're going to have a different guest each week.
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.560]   And I thought, who here is more complaints about backup problems
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.040]   than you on your weekend, right?
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.960]   You should get Gibson on too, because he's a hard one.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.560]   Well, we definitely want Steve to come on.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.880]   So tell him to get over.
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.760]   But yeah, we're going to be doing that.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.080]   And I think we can help people.
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.320]   It's not just about storage.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.120]   It's about like, hey, how do you back up your digital life?
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.920]   Absolutely.
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.000]   Absolutely.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.840]   Also here from this hotel in the high desert, it's Mr. Alex
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.200]   Lindsay of the Pixelcore.tv.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.200]   And welcome.
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:20.880]   Hey, Alex.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:21.440]   How are you today?
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.960]   I'm doing very well.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.320]   I'm in New Mexico.
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.000]   And I've been in Taos, Santa Fe, and now Albuquerque.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.560]   Sounds like an Eagles song somehow.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.240]   Yeah, so we've been--
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.400]   I have to speak here tonight.
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.840]   I'm speaking at a user group here talking about green screen.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.560]   And so we figured we'd take the weekend
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.240]   and drive around and see a little bit of New Mexico.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.240]   Awesome.
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.880]   Well, it's beautiful.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.240]   It's great to have you all on here.
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.880]   Did you all watch "Dancing With the Stars" last night?
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:55.880]   No.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.040]   I missed it.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.800]   Andy, you're our last hope.
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.040]   I had it on DVR.
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.880]   This is exactly the reason why.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.000]   I've got $8 in singles.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.440]   I'm going to send to whoever invented the ability
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.040]   to not watch a two-hour show just to see the 10 minutes you
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.160]   actually were in "Sutancing."
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.760]   I watched live--
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.640]   well, live on tape because it was West Coast.
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.480]   The whole damn thing, including--
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.560]   I think it was an hour of "Dancing" and an hour of commercials.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.160]   I've never seen so many commercials.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.320]   They would dance to a commercial.
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.120]   Dance to a commercial.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.120]   I mean, it was incredible.
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.520]   They complain that we have one or two commercials a show.
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.200]   They ought to try watch "Dancing With the Stars."
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.440]   Oh, man.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.320]   It's really true.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.120]   I have to say, Steve--
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:43.200]   I don't know exactly how to put this.
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.640]   He said unkind things about our fellow geek.
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.880]   He came in last in terms of judges.
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.040]   Is that a big shocker?
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.280]   Well, with people like Steve O and LT there, I thought--
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.840]   and there was a cowboy who was not so hot either.
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.280]   But Steve really was--
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.080]   I don't know.
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.800]   I think that when you just sigh and say, I know,
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.440]   you give the wrong impression.
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.360]   He was that uncle at the family wedding
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.720]   that knows that it will be enjoyable if he goes up
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.320]   and dances once.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:24.400]   But it is so entertaining and so enjoyable, chiefly
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.840]   because you know how much he is enjoying being up there
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:27.720]   and dancing.
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.720]   But then he's smarter to know that, no, I'm
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.360]   not going to be the uncle that stays on the dance floor
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.800]   for the entire night and ruins the evening for everybody.
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.640]   Now, of course, he was getting lots of help
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.520]   from the producers who did an excellent job of protecting
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.440]   our friend Steve Wazdak from snipers.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.320]   They thought, if we keep him visible,
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.200]   that's exactly the opportunity that Alkina is looking for,
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.400]   to finally opt him once and for all.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.000]   So it started off badly when there's that little lineup
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.240]   like at the very, very top of the show where all the dancers
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.680]   are lined up on the dance floor.
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.400]   And from Jaga, Steve O and from some reality show
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.840]   you didn't see eight seasons ago.
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:02.720]   It's this side.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.040]   And then, Apple founder Steve Wazdak,
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.320]   and I don't know whether this is just an accident
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:08.920]   or whether they said, now, Steve, we
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.840]   want you to stand dead behind the woman.
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.400]   You couldn't see him!
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.520]   And he had to sort of duck his head around to get on camp.
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.320]   It was the funniest thing I ever saw.
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.320]   It's like, you picture, it's like, you know,
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.760]   I left my little laminated pass back the dressing room,
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.720]   but I really am supposed to be on this show.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.720]   I swear.
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.440]   I didn't just run onto the center, anything.
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.920]   Either his partner was really tall or something went wrong,
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:37.520]   or I don't know why, but boy, that was weird, wasn't it?
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.200]   Well, it was the lack of attention to why.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.920]   I realized that, you know, they're 12 people,
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.720]   and you know, it is television, and so, I mean,
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.480]   I'm lucky they'll let me on TV, like maybe once a month.
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.120]   But even so, I enjoyed Waz's appearance.
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.800]   It was typical.
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.240]   I think if you're going to choreograph a number
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.120]   where you have someone who is not a champion rodeo rider,
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.120]   and you have to get them trained up to do a two,
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.120]   like a one minute or two minute dance routine,
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.480]   it wasn't designed to be particularly tricky or athletic.
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.600]   It was more designed towards, again,
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.720]   amusing people without humiliating anybody.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.360]   And I think it mostly succeeded.
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.200]   As I said, I was very pleased with my investment
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.120]   of 23 minutes of time and fast-forwarding through everything,
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.760]   but Waz's thing, and Steve O's thing.
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.320]   We don't want to talk about Steve O's thing.
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.720]   He'll produce dapel gun.
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:29.360]   But I think I do have a standing appointment to fast-forward
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.760]   through anything that's not Waz for the next few weeks,
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.680]   and then watch Waz.
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:33.320]   It was fun.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.240]   You're allowed to-- I voted for him.
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.360]   You're allowed to vote for summaries in 13 times.
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.560]   I don't know where they came up with that number.
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.720]   So it's too--
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.760]   - Do you think about it? - Huh?
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:44.840]   - Does it cost you anything to vote?
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:45.600]   - No, it's free.
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:49.520]   You could text or call an 800 number, or even email.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:54.000]   But they do keep track of how many times you voted,
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.880]   and you could vote 13 times.
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.720]   And you can only do it for half an hour after the show,
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.280]   so it's too late to do it now.
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.680]   - Yeah, I really just don't see Steve Waz,
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.840]   and I'm losing any vote that's based on phones and email.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.840]   I just don't--
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:07.600]   - Yeah.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.960]   - Exactly, and he pointed out--
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.400]   in an interview, I did an interview with him
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.600]   a couple of weeks ago, and he pointed out--
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.840]   which I should play at some point for y'all.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.520]   He pointed out that--
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.520]   maybe I'll tell you what, I said this last week,
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.760]   I didn't do it, I will tag--
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.040]   remind me Tony to tag that interview
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.840]   onto the end of this show, so you can hear my interview
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.600]   with Steve Waznack about his experience
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.880]   on Dancing With The Stars.
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:32.320]   But he said that Mark Cuban, of all people, told him
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.200]   that even if you get the lowest vote,
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.160]   which he now has from the judges,
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.720]   if only 6% more people vote for you, you'll win.
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:44.080]   - Yeah, that's an interesting tactic, I think,
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.120]   because I don't understand--
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.560]   this is the first full episode of this show I've ever seen,
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.680]   so there are judges there who's like almost--
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.920]   they're just there to hold up little numbered placards,
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.160]   but they have absolutely no impact whatsoever,
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.360]   and no ability to influence anything.
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:02.400]   So it all comes down to who does America want to see
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.560]   come on next.
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.280]   So in many ways, someone who does a flawless performance
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.080]   and is boring as hell is not in the same league
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:13.240]   as someone who just, oh, I just, this geek,
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.760]   he's really excited and he worked really hard on this.
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.520]   I want to see what happens in three weeks' time
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.280]   when he's just been battered to hell
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.400]   by the up-out dance routines.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.240]   - I think Steve probably won't last much longer,
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.960]   but one thing he--
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.480]   - I think for sure say he was having the most fun,
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.160]   he was having the golly--
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.600]   - I think that he will go as far as the audience
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.440]   lets him go.
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.240]   - Yeah, I think that inevitably they'll go
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.080]   for the pretty people.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:41.000]   - Yeah, he's the clown and he knows he's the clown,
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.600]   and it was very cute, and yes, he did ride the segue
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.520]   around a little bit.
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:47.080]   You know, I know why you T-voted Andy
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.720]   because Summer Glau was on Big Bang Theory.
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.480]   Now that's--
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.800]   - If you get that reference, you are a major geek,
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.920]   let me tell you.
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.240]   - I know, I was, I had it on DVR
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.040]   because the Big Bang Theory was simply on Leo.
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.040]   (laughing)
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.600]   - Although I see it, it shows you how much like--
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.600]   (laughing)
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.160]   - How much respect I have for these people?
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.000]   There was a problem with the broadcast,
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.440]   at least where I was receiving it,
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.520]   where the only track in the audio mix
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.720]   that was coming through was the laugh track.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:16.520]   There was no dialogue, no sound effects, no nothing,
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.800]   just, they're just like pantomiming a scene
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:19.640]   in the apartment in the apartment.
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:20.480]   - Same, the ear.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.560]   (laughing)
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:22.880]   - Ooh, then huh.
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:23.960]   - That was funny.
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.560]   - I have so much respect for both the talent
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.360]   of the writing staff and also their full-on nerdy
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.080]   was that, oh, I know how this is gonna,
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.040]   I know how this is gonna end,
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.720]   because Wallowitz is the engineer
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.960]   and he's behind the computer
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.320]   and they're gonna do the scene at the,
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.880]   then suddenly the dialogue track is gonna come back on
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.200]   and he says, okay, you see Penny?
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.960]   If you misfire the speakers in your surround sound setup,
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.560]   the center channel with all the audio,
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.440]   while the dialogue is gonna disappear.
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.440]   So you gotta make sure, if you only wanna,
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.480]   if you don't fire this up correctly,
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.000]   all you'll hear is the laugh track.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:52.840]   - Wow.
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.400]   That sounds like a malfunction
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.680]   of major proportions, to be honest.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.760]   - Oh, it was a malfunction or something.
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.560]   But it's like, there's a point at which I'm thinking,
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:03.880]   wow, something screwed up.
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.240]   And then I'm thinking, no,
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.040]   I really think that these people are clever.
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.760]   Maybe they decided to do this funny,
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.800]   sort of like in "Madi Python" where you tune in
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.480]   and then you think that like,
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.800]   you think that your VCR screwed up
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.840]   'cause it started in the middle of some sort of a document
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.600]   to be about four, three, but no,
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.400]   they decided to start the whole show with no title credits.
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.800]   - Aw friend the beaver.
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.720]   (imitates beeping)
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.960]   So we are gonna come back there,
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.280]   some big, big stories, including a sighting,
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:32.080]   Steve Jobs sighting, some very good news for Andy
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:36.560]   and his touchscreen Mac, and more.
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:37.440]   But before we do that,
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.280]   I wanna mention our friends at audible.com.
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:42.280]   We're gonna give 'em pride a place this week.
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.940]   Usually we bury them in the back of the book
[00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:46.640]   where we do our picks of the week.
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.680]   But I wanna move 'em up front today
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:52.520]   'cause I'm a fan, audible.com, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:56.160]   it's the place to get incredible, beautiful.
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.560]   I don't wanna call 'em audio books.
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.360]   I wanna call 'em performances.
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.120]   Every word, of course, in the unabridged versions,
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:06.320]   every word of the book, including sometimes hilarity,
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:10.200]   hilarious effect, the forewords, the acknowledgments,
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.880]   the quotes in Latin, you get the whole thing,
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.080]   audible.com/macbreak, but you also get
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:19.920]   an incredible performance of some of the most beautiful books
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.840]   in the world, and I am such a fan.
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:26.720]   51,000 titles, you join today,
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.800]   you could get a book within a minute or two.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.640]   I mean, and before you go on a trip to download a book
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.120]   real quick and have it in your iPod or your iPhone
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.800]   or your Kindle or your Zoom,
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.840]   or any of the hundreds of devices supported by audible.com,
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.840]   it's just a wonderful thing.
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.840]   Andy, what are you, I'm listening to my Herman Hesse still.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.280]   I haven't, that's a long book,
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.640]   so I'm still listening to the master of the glass bead game.
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.600]   But what are you listening to these days?
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.000]   - Well, I just finished up.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.280]   This is one of those odd things.
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:56.440]   I first read, I think a previous Audible pick
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.520]   was a book called Waiter Rant, which was this,
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.360]   it's amazingly great book by this,
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:06.040]   Waiter in a high class restaurant in the New York area
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.960]   who had this really wonderful blog that got,
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.080]   turned into a book, but it wasn't like one of those
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:11.920]   cut and paste jobs.
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.480]   He wrote an entirely new content that was just fantastic.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.800]   And it sort of put me in the mind for more like food writing.
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:18.640]   So the book--
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.760]   - There's a lot of good food writing on Audible.
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:21.600]   - Exactly.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.520]   - I'm not sure how the Waiter who wrote that book
[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.960]   would react to that, because he's always talking about,
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.760]   oh God, I can always tell when someone came in here
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.800]   right after seeing like three hour marathon
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.120]   of something on the food network.
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:34.360]   Because they want me to tell them
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.600]   where we get our peppercorns from.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.840]   (laughing)
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.920]   - From the pepper store, where else?
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:43.320]   - Exactly.
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:46.680]   So a couple days ago I bought a book called
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.760]   "On Audible, Garlic and Sapphire's,
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.480]   The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise."
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.240]   And this is written by Ruth Rieschel,
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.480]   who used to be the restaurant critic
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.440]   of I believe the New York Times.
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.280]   - Yeah.
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:01.400]   - And this book is all about the process of navigating
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.280]   through the New York restaurant scene as a critic.
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:06.760]   Because she, you could tell that part of it
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.000]   was her being a good journalist.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.080]   Part of it was just her being just enjoying
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.400]   creating new characters.
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.320]   It wasn't, obviously she could not say hi.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.240]   I'm Ruth Rieschel, the lead restaurant critic
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.240]   of the New York Times.
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.480]   And I would like to come have a rest,
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.600]   I'd like to have a reservation for Saturday night
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.520]   for 7 p.m.
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:25.680]   But I insist, don't do anything special with my food.
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:28.880]   Don't, I want the same food you would give to anybody.
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:29.720]   So.
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.480]   - She's got the same challenge that you have, Andy.
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.920]   And I go when you walk into an Apple store.
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:34.920]   (laughing)
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:38.000]   - No, my challenge when I walk into Apple store
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.560]   is not quite so pathetic
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:40.920]   and hoping that someone will recognize me.
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:42.320]   - Help me please.
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:43.160]   - Hi, you being helped?
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:44.800]   Have you heard about the new iPhone yet?
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.160]   - Once it happened to me once,
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.640]   I was in a, was in a official Apple store.
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:52.640]   It was a, like a, you know, value added reseller.
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.320]   - One of those underground street Apple stores.
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.160]   - Yeah.
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:56.680]   And the guy said, wait a minute.
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:57.760]   'Cause they had my book on sale.
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.200]   He said, wait a minute.
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.640]   You're Leo Laport, but I didn't get any better treatment.
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:03.520]   - I did that.
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.400]   I didn't, well, no, I, I, I, the only difference
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.160]   when I go to an Apple store is that it is one
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.960]   of those incidences where I make sure that,
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.000]   okay, make sure you shave.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:12.840]   Make sure.
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.160]   - Just in case.
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.520]   Just in case someone's, you know,
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:16.520]   I don't want someone blocking.
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:17.720]   - Don't go in your box or shirts.
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.480]   - Yeah, look who I saw.
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.040]   - And then he asked me, do I have any,
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.040]   any deposit cans or bottles that he could take?
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:25.680]   (laughing)
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.960]   - Garlic and sapphires, a secret life.
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:28.800]   - A secret life.
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.880]   - Yeah, so, so, so the, I mean, the cool thing is
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.520]   that she would develop characters
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:35.800]   that she would use for different restaurants.
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.160]   Not only just disguises and wigs,
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.800]   but also she would just like,
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.640]   just like an acting student doing an improv drill.
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:42.920]   She would say, well, let's see.
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.960]   I'm, tonight I'm going to be Molly Hollis.
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.840]   And I've got manicured nails
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.400]   and I'm in a Marnie's Armony suit.
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.240]   - Oh, how funny.
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:52.760]   - And I'm an executive rising,
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:55.720]   but sort of stagnating at this place for about four or five years.
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.960]   I'm looking to go on my way up and I use this restaurant
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.360]   as a way to treat my, so it's, it's 'cause she,
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.200]   and she stays in that book.
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.280]   - They have a backstory.
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:04.120]   Wow.
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:07.080]   - Right, it's, and it's, I think part of,
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:09.520]   I'm glad that she like stopped being the restaurant critic
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:12.040]   'cause that way she can now start telling all these stories.
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.800]   - Let's listen to this a little bit from garlic and sapphires.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.800]   Bernadette Dunn reads Ruth Riekel.
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:22.840]   - Could be millions, but it's only June.
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:25.480]   It's three months till I even start the job.
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.160]   I'm truly stunned.
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.000]   I know, she says, wagging one of those purple fingers
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.560]   in my face.
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:34.120]   But if you first reviews in September,
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:37.440]   you've got to be eating somewhere now, don't you?
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:40.480]   There's a certain triumph in her voice as she adds.
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:43.160]   You see, there's not much we don't know about you.
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.000]   You see, it becomes a performance,
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.280]   and that's what I love about these books.
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.520]   - And it is important, there was a documentary about
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.680]   the Cirque when they were opening their new restaurant,
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:55.880]   that every good restaurant, they maintain a rat line of,
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.840]   it's almost like stocking paparazzi,
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.360]   where they have everybody's picture,
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.680]   they have everybody's likes and dislikes.
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:04.320]   And if they're not heavily disguised,
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:07.360]   at some point, any experienced waiter will spot them
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.920]   and alert and flag that table.
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.920]   So please do not spit in this carbonara.
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:15.240]   Every spit in every carbonara except for this one.
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:18.120]   - Do not spit in this carbonara.
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:20.320]   Garlic and sapphire is a secret life of a critic
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:21.160]   in disguise.
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.000]   Now how do you get this for free?
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   You go to audible.com/macbreak,
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.920]   sign up for the gold account, that's one book a month,
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.040]   and your first month's free.
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.720]   In fact, even if you decide not to stick around,
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:31.080]   you can keep the book.
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:33.040]   Yours to keep as our gift.
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.720]   - And it should mention Tom.
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.960]   - Those of you who do like to keep track of these things,
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.440]   it's not a super heavyweight,
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:41.000]   but you do get almost 11 hours for the content
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:41.840]   of this book.
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:44.480]   - So we're starting to give our reviews,
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.520]   including the number of hours you get.
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:47.520]   (laughing)
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.880]   - I get that one credit for the plan that I'm on.
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:54.960]   I get one credit and I did get the Carrie Fisher book.
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.120]   And that's like, you know what?
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.720]   I did has a take.
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.280]   'Cause I know that there are hundreds,
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.520]   if not thousands of books,
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:03.600]   that will give me an entire week of audible listening.
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.080]   Am I really gonna spend this one credit a month
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.960]   on something that will take me one round trip
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:08.840]   to see my dad?
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:10.840]   - Sometimes I do that just 'cause I want something
[00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:14.080]   that's just completely airy and light and fluffy.
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.480]   And I'm reading such a heavy book now.
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.440]   I know the net, which is like 21 hours.
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.520]   I know the next book will be five hours
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:22.480]   of celebrity gossip and hot sex.
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:24.200]   And there's nothing like hot sex
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.560]   while you're driving down the highway
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.520]   listening to a book with your kids in the backseat.
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:30.280]   Let me tell you how many times have I fast forwarded
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:31.560]   through one of those?
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:34.000]   Just as you're probably fast forwarding right now
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.520]   through Backbreak Weekly.

[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:58.480]   So as Steve Jobs sighting of today,
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:01.480]   this just in from MacRumors via Market Watch,
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:04.120]   Steve was seen making an appearance
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:07.760]   at the Disney shareholders meeting.
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.960]   No details on how he looked or how he's feeling.
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:15.040]   It's funny because just this morning I got a tip
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:19.160]   saying that Steve was in really bad shape
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:21.760]   and I decided not to go with it and I'm glad I did
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.720]   because he's apparently getting around enough
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:26.200]   to have gone his first public appearance
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:29.720]   since his medical leave in January.
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:32.520]   Disney confirmed calls out to Disney,
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.680]   confirmed Jobs appearance,
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.720]   a move to appear at Disney's shareholder meeting
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:39.600]   makes sense on a few levels for starters,
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:42.280]   Jobs is a major Disney shareholder
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:43.600]   and he can make his first appearance
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:47.160]   without the hubbub associated with an Apple event.
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:52.360]   So he was reelected by the way to continue on
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.200]   on the board of directors of Disney.
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.760]   So I think some very good news.
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:59.200]   - Yep, I thought we were gonna hear
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.240]   that he made his appearance
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:04.080]   confiscating all the plastic bags at the Apple stores.
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:06.520]   They do use a lot of plastic bags.
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:07.360]   Are they eliminated?
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:08.560]   - Did you hear their new policy?
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:10.960]   They're not allowing any more plastic bags at the Apple store.
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.200]   You don't get a bag now when you buy stuff at the Apple store.
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.560]   - Really?
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:16.720]   - Yeah, that's their attempt.
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:21.520]   That's their attempt to, quote, appear, end quote, more green.
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.840]   - What's funny is is that of all the bags that I have,
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.320]   the ones that we tend not to throw away are the Apple bags
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:27.160]   because you can get something.
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.160]   - I know.
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.080]   - They're the most recyclable.
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.120]   - So the new policies, they will help you
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:34.120]   carry stuff to your car.
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.120]   - That's nice.
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.480]   - Okay?
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.320]   That's crazy.
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.520]   - There you go, sir.
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:41.520]   One pair of iPod headphones.
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.440]   What level are you on?
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:46.040]   - I'd like to carry those to your car for you.
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.600]   - Why not just get a paper sack
[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:49.960]   as opposed to plastic bags,
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.000]   like the grocery stores in California have done.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.240]   - Yeah.
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.520]   Paper though, you can't hold a, yeah.
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.800]   One of those big, you know, they have so much packaging.
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:58.840]   I don't know why you would need,
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.760]   I guess you need a bag if you had a lot of little items, maybe.
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:05.120]   - Yeah, if you bought like an iPod, a pair of earbuds
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.120]   and an iPhone to go with that,
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:10.440]   and you could easily be inconvenient.
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:11.280]   - Right.
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:15.400]   - With all the problems we have in the world,
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:18.160]   deciding not to use plastic bags in the Apple Store,
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:19.720]   it seems like, I don't know.
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:21.080]   - Well, I mean, maybe I'm something that,
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.760]   seeing San Francisco, 'cause San Francisco is,
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:27.880]   you're not allowed to have plastic bags at a grocery store,
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.760]   which is insane because what we lined all of our trash cans
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:34.400]   with until that ruling was the plastic bags
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.720]   we got from Safeway.
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.560]   And now we go buy the plastic bags.
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:38.400]   - Yeah, buy plastic bags.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.960]   - We can put them in, but what was funny is when we moved
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.520]   to Petaluma, the first thing the person asked,
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:42.680]   would you like paper or plastic?
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:43.640]   I didn't even know what to do with that.
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.040]   I hadn't heard that for so long.
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.720]   I was like, how plastic?
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.440]   - Not only that at our local store,
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.920]   and we're in a, you know, a hippie community,
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:54.640]   but even in our local store, the fault to plastic.
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:57.600]   If you don't say, they just give you plastic, so.
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.840]   It's green plastic.
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:00.680]   - Right.
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.200]   - And that doesn't mean it's biodegradable
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.920]   or anything, it's just green in color.
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.800]   It's supposed to make you feel better.
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.680]   - No, they have a new design,
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.280]   so that it has sort of like a pre-printed,
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:12.400]   like little tuxedo, bib, and tie,
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.320]   so that when the water birds do get their necks strangled
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:16.960]   and at least they look like they're dressed well
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:17.800]   for the rest of the rest of the rest.
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.760]   - They look like they're going to a lobster restaurant.
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:22.080]   - Well, my big concern is that Jack in the box
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.480]   will move to this same model,
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.400]   and I'll have to carry each french fry out individually.
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:30.760]   - One by one.
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:32.960]   - Yeah, it is freaky.
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:36.480]   I was shopping at a store that also has a no bag policy,
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.960]   and it's like, this is awesome.
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:39.280]   I feel like I'm shoplifting.
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.560]   I'm just taking my cart full of random stuff
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.600]   all the way into the parking lot.
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:44.960]   - Yeah, it's next time. - It's kind of weird, isn't it?
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.120]   - Maybe I won't pay.
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:48.520]   Let's just see how well this system works.
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:51.360]   - Well, I know, I checked out here,
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:52.880]   or I was in Santa Fe, and I checked out,
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.160]   and it's one of those auto checkouts
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.200]   where you don't talk to anyone.
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:56.800]   And I was like, how do they know?
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:01.800]   How do they know whether I've taken the stuff out or not?
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:04.840]   I'm scanning it myself,
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:06.520]   and then I looked over and I set something down
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.360]   where the bag goes, and immediately told me,
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:09.680]   you have something else here, and I was like, wow.
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.240]   - Oh, wow.
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:13.400]   - I was like, I have no idea how this works, but--
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.880]   - There's an eye in the sky.
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.240]   - Yeah, there was something else in you.
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:17.680]   - It was like, please move the thing
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:20.520]   that you have not scanned off out of the loading area.
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.280]   And I was like, I don't even know what it is.
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.180]   Anyway, sorry.
[00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:24.020]   - That's it.
[00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:25.480]   - They use a weight there.
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:27.080]   They have a scale.
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:30.480]   - Yeah, I absolutely hate these self checkout things.
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.800]   The number of times that I've just left
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:37.720]   30, 40, $50 worth of merchandise in a pile next to checkout
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:39.840]   because not because something wouldn't scan,
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:43.680]   but because it, please move something out of the bagging area.
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:45.400]   Please move something.
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.760]   A manager is now coming.
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:47.600]   So guess what?
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:48.440]   A customer is now--
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:49.760]   - Now leaving.
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:50.720]   And you love it, Steph?
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:51.800]   You love those?
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:52.800]   - No, I love--
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:53.880]   - I love not--
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:56.080]   - I like to deal with people, that's why.
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:57.360]   - I still like to deal with lines.
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:59.440]   So there was like lines of like six people deep
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:01.040]   all the way down except for the,
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:03.000]   because people like Andy don't like to do it,
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.360]   it was empty, so I just sit there and walk, boom, boom, boom,
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.120]   I walk out, I don't have to be behind the person
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.280]   who can't find the checkbook.
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:11.320]   - I refuse to do it 'cause I figure I'm paying
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:13.200]   for that checker to be there
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.240]   and I don't wanna cost that person their job.
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:18.880]   So I stand, and I just go tell the manager,
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.480]   I go to the manager, say, look,
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:24.080]   if you don't staff this place up,
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.680]   I'm gonna ignore yourself, check out,
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.400]   and go somewhere else, give these people a job.
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.240]   - Well, I feel like--
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.080]   - I know what's gonna happen.
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:30.920]   - It's gonna be like--
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.160]   - There's gonna be a sets of sets of trucks
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:34.720]   at the loading dock and actually be humping out cans
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:36.040]   of Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.000]   and stocking the shelves ourselves.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:38.840]   It's like--
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:40.480]   - That's what's coming, isn't it?
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:42.280]   - And they have that in Minnesota,
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:45.040]   have these grocery stores where you have to bag everything
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:47.080]   and do all this stuff, and I'm like,
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.200]   don't give them any ideas.
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.920]   - That's how it was in the old days
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.680]   when we were at the co-ops.
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.160]   Remember that when you were wearing sandals
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:56.600]   and had the long hair and you'd have to put in
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:00.480]   a few hours each week just to unload stuff?
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.360]   - I know what's gonna happen, it's gonna be like fast track
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:03.840]   where it starts off with a couple
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:04.920]   and then it's gonna end up with,
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:07.240]   there's two places where you can talk to a person
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:10.480]   and long lines and six or eight openings
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.440]   with the auto checkout, and I'll be happy.
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.160]   - The banks already like that.
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:18.600]   If you actually go to a teller in a bank, they'll charge you.
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.680]   - Well, I canceled my Bank of America account
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:23.000]   'cause I walked in and there were 80 people working there
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.200]   and I asked a question, she said,
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.240]   "You have to walk over there and pick up the telephone
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.080]   and call somebody."
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:28.400]   (laughing)
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:29.240]   - That's ridiculous.
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.520]   - I said, "No, what I have to do is walk up to the counter
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.240]   and say, give me all my money out of the bank, please."
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.280]   - It's really ridiculous.
[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:37.640]   - Oh, it's insane.
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.880]   - Well, for me the issue was that I haven't been in a bank
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:43.520]   so long, we had to transfer some money while I was here
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.800]   and I was literally, we walked in, I realized
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:46.960]   I hadn't been there for four or five years,
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:48.600]   I didn't even know what to say to the teller.
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:50.400]   Like I was like, so what do I do now?
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.160]   - I don't, you know, who are you and what?
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.320]   - Pick up that white phone.
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:55.680]   (laughing)
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:58.280]   You can't talk to me, sir, you'll have to call me.
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:00.080]   - I asked him, "I would have been, okay,
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:00.920]   that's what they do now."
[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:01.760]   - Much better, yes.
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:04.520]   - I got to, what do you guys do here, play P-knuckle?
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:05.520]   (laughing)
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:08.720]   I mean, you know, they were refused to wait on me.
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.280]   - That's interesting.
[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:12.440]   They said you got to, that requires you to use
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:13.280]   a telephone on one.
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:15.840]   - I think you actually accomplished something, Scott,
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.280]   because now when I, I'm a Bank of America customer,
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:21.880]   when I go in, there's a greeter now, like at Walmart.
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.600]   And the greeter directs you and will say,
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:27.880]   well, what's your banking task today?
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:29.480]   - And then she says, "Pick up the phone."
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.960]   - No, no, there's managers, she'll just,
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.640]   she'll shut you over to the manager area
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.000]   or shut you over to the teller area,
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.160]   and she was actually pretty good.
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:38.360]   And then she can do some stuff too,
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:39.680]   she'll bring you over to,
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.560]   so maybe they're listening to you, Scott.
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:42.400]   You might, you might show that.
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:45.320]   - Well, they listen too late, 'cause all my mood is gone.
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:46.680]   - Now that they're taking government money,
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:49.160]   they're gonna have to start paying more attention.
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.280]   - By the way, we're following, as we speak,
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:56.280]   we're live, it's 1148 Pacific on Tuesday as we record this.
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.600]   So we're following the Disney meeting.
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:01.480]   You know, it began as our show began.
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:04.720]   So it's right now the webcast is audio only,
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:07.640]   so nobody can tell how Steve's looking,
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:10.800]   but a shareholder did wish jobs well with his health.
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:11.960]   The shareholder then went on to say
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:14.680]   he was worried about contingency plans
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:17.520]   if something should happen in the apples of Sam's team.
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:19.280]   - I'm seeing something here from multiple sources
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:22.400]   saying that MarketWatch is retracting their story,
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:24.200]   that Steve is not at the Disney meeting.
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:26.240]   - Oh, jeez, Louise.
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:29.840]   This is what happens when you jump on the mic.
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:32.360]   - Don't believe me, believe the internet.
[00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:34.760]   - Well, I believe CBS, or not CBS anymore,
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:35.960]   are they, they're down Jones?
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:37.360]   - I believe MarketWatch.
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:42.360]   - Well, you see, this is the problem with being live, Leo.
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.680]   - Yeah, it was easier when we were taped,
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.360]   we could clean up our mistakes.
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:48.360]   - Oh, we could still clean up our mistakes.
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.200]   - Okay.
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.160]   (dog barking)
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:53.040]   And then story number two,
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:56.720]   I know Andy and Akko's gonna be jumping up and down
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:00.080]   over this one, and we get this by the way from
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:05.320]   a Chinese source, it's a pretty well connected source.
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:06.760]   They've been right in the past.
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:09.900]   It's a Chinese or Taiwanese electronics magazine.
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:14.000]   And they say that Apple has put in order
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.680]   for touch screens,
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:22.640]   and with WinkTech, which is apparently
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:26.080]   a manufacturer of the touch screens.
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:30.520]   And now Dow Jones Newswire, another trusted source,
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:34.120]   says Apple's indeed planning to launch a netbook computer
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:37.560]   with a touch screen as soon as the second half of this year.
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:41.760]   They cite two people close to the situation as sources.
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:42.960]   According to the Newswire,
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.480]   the mini laptop computers will likely have monitor screens
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.820]   that are between 9.7 and 10 inches.
[00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:51.040]   This is what you were looking for.
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:55.160]   In fact, this is what Andy and Alex Lindsey have both predicted.
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:57.160]   - Yeah, what I wanna know though is,
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:58.560]   can they make something like that?
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:00.600]   I never believed that they would make anything
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:04.480]   resembling a netbook because that's not their philosophy.
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:05.600]   What I'm wondering though is,
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:08.680]   can they build the device that they're meant to build
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.400]   at anywhere near the price of a netbook?
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:11.920]   Can they sell this?
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.960]   - I think it's gonna be $7.99.
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:15.400]   - I'm not sure if they can,
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.800]   I think they would have to do it for less than $500
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:20.400]   to really compete with that kind of a market.
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.040]   And I agree with you, Alex.
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:23.560]   I'd be very surprised to see them
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:25.360]   make that kind of a price point.
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:27.280]   - I think it'll be $6.99, $7.99,
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:28.120]   somewhere in that range,
[00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:30.280]   they're not gonna try to compete with that market.
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:32.640]   I bet you that Apple is going to approach it
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:34.560]   as a completely new market segment.
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:35.840]   And I think they'll be successful at it.
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:38.200]   I know I'll be, I don't, at least one,
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:39.040]   the moment it comes down.
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:40.360]   - What would be the most likely date
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:41.520]   for something like this?
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:47.440]   - I would guess a rollout date sometime in September.
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:50.920]   It does sound like a holiday sort of offering
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:54.160]   as opposed to a get this in time for school sort of offering.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:57.240]   Unless it is, unless it's something that can be used
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:59.080]   in the place of a MacBook.
[00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:02.720]   - Wait, they go over, if they go over 500 bucks,
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:04.280]   it's gonna be a hard sell.
[00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:06.040]   - Yeah. - And you know they're going to.
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:08.320]   - I think they're right, but that's a tough sell.
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:11.840]   - I mean, they sold more than $500 when it came out.
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:13.680]   And they had lines around the block.
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:15.640]   I mean, they're only talking about,
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.520]   $7.99 is only whatever, $100 or $200 more
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.080]   than the iPhone when it first came out.
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:23.520]   And it's gonna be a lot more of a computer.
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:26.720]   - I predict it'll be, it'll follow the iPhone's price curve.
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.600]   'Cause the first people that want one of these
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:30.680]   are people that are, you know,
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:32.600]   sitting there salivating for one.
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:34.400]   - They're gonna, us.
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.520]   - Andy, Andy and Alex and I,
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:38.560]   and you are gonna buy one regardless of the price.
[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:39.400]   - Regardless of price.
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:41.040]   - And they know that, so they'll sell them
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.520]   for a couple months at that price,
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:43.640]   and then they'll lower the price,
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:44.480]   and then everybody'll go,
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:45.960]   - Wait a minute, I paid too much.
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:48.040]   - And then they'll say, well, don't buy things first.
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.360]   (laughing)
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.200]   - No, you're right.
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:54.560]   - We're offering them on the Andy Scott Leo
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:56.560]   and Alex scholarship plan,
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:59.080]   where we will each contribute $200
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:02.160]   above the normal purchase price to help subsidize
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:03.000]   the purchase price.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.800]   - I bought two kindles on that plan.
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:08.600]   I bought, I just bought a Mac Pro,
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:12.080]   which is close to $5,000, this new Mac Pro.
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.000]   Outrageous, you know, I mean.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   - Well, no, it's outrageous.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   This is my new 17-inch MacBook Pro laptop cost
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.320]   nearly $5,000.
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:20.680]   - I played, is it really?
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:22.080]   Was it that much?
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.680]   - Yeah, because I bought the app Ram.
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:25.120]   I didn't wanna take a chance.
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:27.200]   So I got the one with eight gigs,
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.200]   and it was $1,200 for the extra Ram,
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.760]   and then I got the fastest processor.
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:31.600]   Blah, blah, blah.
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:34.800]   - That was, which the WITAC and the AppleCare
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.240]   was almost five grand.
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.800]   - What do you think of it?
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:38.840]   - I love it.
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:40.720]   It's a couple of crazy things.
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:42.440]   Number one, you don't, you know,
[00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:43.640]   they talk about a new screen.
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:44.640]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:48.760]   Well, I sat it next to my most current 15-inch
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:51.320]   MacBook Pro screen that wasn't of this technology
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:52.920]   and was just flat out blown away
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:56.040]   by how much sharper, brighter, clearer it is.
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:59.080]   I mean, it's, you don't need measurement tools to notice
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:00.240]   that this is just killer.
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:01.320]   It's an incredible screen.
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:03.920]   The best laptop screen I've ever seen by far.
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:06.560]   And the other thing that's weird about it is it's not heavy.
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:10.560]   I mean, it doesn't feel any heavier on my lap than the 15,
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:14.560]   which I think is a testimony to how small they made this thing
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:16.040]   for a 17-inch.
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:17.280]   It definitely is fast.
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:19.600]   I haven't had any of the problems I've heard people talk
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:21.040]   about in the forums.
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:24.680]   I'm running at 100% of the time on the fastest graphics.
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:27.400]   - People are saying the '9600 has some rendering issues
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:29.560]   on some MacBooks.
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:30.800]   - I haven't had a single problem,
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:32.880]   and I'm the guy that always gets the one that's got a problem.
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:33.920]   Now maybe it's still coming
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:35.280]   'cause I've only had it for a week,
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:38.320]   but so far its performance has been amazing
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:39.840]   and running everything the way I do,
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:43.000]   which is top power, full tilt, no, you know,
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.320]   no resting or sleeping or anything, you know,
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:49.600]   loudest volume, highest brightness on the screen,
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:52.520]   about four hours and 12 minutes in my first test.
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:56.640]   - I played with one on Sunday.
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:59.720]   Brian Shaler was in the studio and brought one in.
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:03.160]   And I was really impressed and you're right, Scott.
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:05.240]   I was surprised at how light it felt.
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:09.240]   That unibody, I think that unibody does really well,
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:14.040]   even for, you know, especially for a big guy, a 17-inch guy.
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:15.880]   Boy, that was a smart move, the unibody,
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:17.320]   on the 13, 15, and the 17.
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:19.080]   Just fantastic.
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:22.280]   - I'm going to, in my main private office,
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:25.480]   I'm going to substitute that with a 24-inch
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:27.520]   cinema display for my current configuration,
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:30.200]   which is a top of the line 24-inch iMac
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:32.720]   and give that a try because then I get two screens
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:33.720]   out of the deal.
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:37.080]   But I think it's faster than my top of the line 24-inch
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:38.960]   iMac one generation back.
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.400]   - Yeah.
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:43.080]   I'm going to do, I guess we'll do an unboxing tomorrow
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:45.240]   of the Mac Pro is supposed to come tomorrow.
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:47.680]   - Did you get it loaded?
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:50.400]   - Mmm, not really, no.
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:51.240]   - You're not?
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:53.880]   - Yeah, I started to sound like Jerry Lewis, no.
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:58.880]   We got the middle tier processor that I think was 266
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:03.560]   instead of the 2.2 and not the 2.9,
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:06.720]   'cause it was like, it was a million dollars
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:08.560]   for the top of the line.
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:10.480]   - One of our guys, the office is getting one for his house
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:12.840]   and he went crazy.
[00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:13.800]   It was like $8,000.
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:16.760]   - Yeah, this was five grand for the middle processor.
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:19.600]   I didn't get extra RAM 'cause I'm unlike you, Scott,
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:21.280]   I'm not buying an Apple RAM at that price.
[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:23.280]   So it comes with six gigs, which is,
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:24.760]   I think a lot to any way to start with.
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:26.120]   And if we need more, by the way,
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.680]   on those Nahalums, you want to add in threes.
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:33.360]   So it comes with three sticks of two.
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:37.480]   For unaccountable reasons, they do offer a level
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:39.200]   that is two, as a pair of sticks,
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:40.360]   and that you shouldn't really do that.
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:42.200]   That's not going to get you the fastest RAM.
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:44.800]   So the next one up is really 12.
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:48.840]   - Well, we did order the Mac Pro yesterday,
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:51.520]   fully configured, it's $12,900.
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:52.520]   - Holy.
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:54.560]   - Yeah, I didn't upgrade the video card.
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:57.040]   I didn't upgrade the hard drive.
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.520]   Actually, I might have upgraded the video card,
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:34:59.400]   I can't remember.
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:03.240]   But yeah, I mean, it's still very, very expensive.
[00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:04.600]   We'll see if it's worth it.
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:05.840]   - Now it looks like the big jump.
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:08.880]   There was an article in Mac rumors.
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:11.080]   Did you see this with some benchmarks?
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:12.200]   - Oh, they already have it.
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:14.800]   - And it looks like the big jump that they saw
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:18.080]   in performance was actually the two, nine, three times eight.
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:19.160]   - Oh no.
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:21.320]   - Which was-- - The one I didn't get.
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:22.520]   - That's the one we did, yes.
[00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:23.800]   - Sittably faster.
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:26.240]   I mean, we're talking, you know, 50%,
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:28.280]   or 40% faster, I think.
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:33.280]   From the middle of the road, the 2.26,
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:36.600]   was only marginally faster than the 2.26.
[00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:41.560]   I mean, the 2.26 is only marginally faster than the 2.66.
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:43.440]   Now this was using Cinebench benchmarks.
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:46.000]   So this is really going to be much very focused on
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:46.840]   multi-threaded.
[00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:48.360]   - Why would it be so much faster?
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:50.480]   I mean, there must be another difference
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:53.280]   between the 2.66 and the 2.93 then.
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:54.920]   I mean, that's only 300 megahertz jump.
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:57.840]   - It has more, it has more El-cash memory, doesn't it?
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:58.960]   - Oh, should have paid more attention.
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:00.240]   It was a lot more expensive.
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:01.240]   It's 1400 bucks more expensive.
[00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:04.000]   - It is a lot more expensive for such a small jump,
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   which I was, I was reticent to do it,
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.160]   but I thought, you know, if we're going to replace the one
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:10.920]   we got, which is pretty recently, might as well go full bore.
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.760]   - Not much of a difference on the single render.
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:14.120]   It's really on the multi-render
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:16.360]   that it really makes a big difference.
[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:18.280]   - Yeah, no, it's the big, yeah, the big jump.
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:19.960]   - Multi-threaded stuff.
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:21.560]   - Yeah, if you have multi-threaded or something that knows,
[00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:23.400]   and some cinebenches from Maxon,
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:26.120]   and they really know how to take full advantage
[00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:27.280]   of a lot of these 3D companies,
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:29.520]   whether it's Maxon or Luxology or any of these other ones,
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:30.880]   really know how to take full advantage
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:33.240]   of multi-threading and RAM usage.
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:35.280]   And so of course, they're going to see the biggest benefit.
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:36.760]   - They didn't, I'm looking at the graph.
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:38.560]   They did not test the one I bought.
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:43.560]   They only tested the low end, 2.26 and the high end 2.93.
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:48.200]   And then the 2.66 they tested was the older Zions,
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:49.040]   not the ISAs.
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:51.120]   - So yours might be somewhere in between now.
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:54.120]   - Mine, I hope, I parade a God, is somewhere,
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:55.080]   it's somewhere more linear.
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:57.240]   - If it's not, you can still send it back.
[00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:59.080]   You don't, you have a 10-day return privilege,
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:36:59.920]   you're forcing it.
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:01.000]   - I don't, you know.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:01.840]   - I'm not doing anything.
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:03.680]   - You just walk in there and tell them you're Leo Laporte,
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:04.720]   they'll give you a new one.
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:05.920]   - Do you know who I am?
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:06.840]   Do you know who I am?
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:10.360]   - The benchmarks really do make the point though,
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.080]   that we were making last episode,
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:13.720]   and we've made several times now,
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:17.160]   that if it only makes sense if you're doing something
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:19.520]   that is really multi-core aware,
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:21.800]   it's multi-threaded, otherwise you're not gonna benefit
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:24.200]   because the clock speeds are slower.
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:27.320]   So you, you know, what's in a badge of course,
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:28.560]   takes advantage of every core.
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:30.440]   I'm sorry, I just put my hand in front of your face, Scott,
[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:31.560]   you don't mind that.
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:33.440]   - And it probably can only improve things.
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:35.280]   - I have to be aware now because we have,
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:38.320]   we have the Skype-asaurus, for those of you who watch,
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.880]   you got it tuned, if you've not watched us do this live,
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:44.320]   we do it live Tuesdays at 2 p.m. Eastern,
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:45.880]   that's 11 a.m. Pacific.
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:49.720]   And now thanks to Colleen's amazing, Skype-asaurus.
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:51.200]   You can see these.
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:52.960]   - I kept hearing you say Skype-asaurus,
[00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:55.080]   and I was like, what the heck is that?
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:58.520]   - We built, so okay, for $1,000,
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:02.160]   compared to the $5,000 for the 16 core,
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:07.160]   we built four mini ITX PCs running Windows Vista,
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:13.520]   or maybe Windows, yeah I think it's Windows 7.
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:14.880]   They're running on the Atom processor,
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:18.280]   but the dual core Atom processor, the 330.
[00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:21.960]   So that's eight cores, two gigs of memory in each,
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:26.520]   and then we built a, we have a four 17 inch screens
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:31.360]   on a Visa mount, so your Skype-asaurus is,
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:33.000]   it's loud, this thing is loud,
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.840]   I don't know if you can hear it roaring in the background,
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:37.200]   but and then it has four 17 inch monitors,
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:39.000]   so we can see all three of you.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.640]   - Now you realize Microsoft, as we speak,
[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:45.040]   is building a commercial that makes fun of the fact
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:48.560]   that MacPray Weekly utilizes Windows technology.
[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:49.600]   You get that though.
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:50.920]   - You know, that's not--
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:53.520]   - I'll be damned if I'm buying four mini Mac minis
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:54.920]   to do this, which is the cheapest Mac--
[00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:56.600]   - You're so cheap sometimes.
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:39:00.000]   - Yeah, cheap, four Mac minis would have cost me
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.360]   more than twice as much.
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:04.840]   - Listen, if I had your money, I'd throw mine away.
[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:07.320]   (laughing)
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:08.160]   And by the way--
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:10.080]   - And I think that your house on trash data
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:11.000]   could be a pressure.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.680]   - And by the way, here's what I say when people say that,
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:16.520]   I say, well I didn't want to waste a Mac,
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:18.720]   I just running Skype, you know.
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:19.560]   - That's not--
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:21.240]   - It's not doing anything else, it's just--
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:22.560]   - The little Mac would be like,
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:25.200]   I can't believe they're using me this way.
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:27.560]   - This is such a waste of my life.
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:29.680]   - Hey, man, it's so convenient.
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:31.040]   - If we're gonna have, it's Skype,
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:32.760]   if it's gonna crash anyway, we may as well use
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:33.600]   the crash the other way.
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:34.440]   - Exactly.
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:35.840]   - We're not wasted on this stable machine.
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:37.440]   - Exactly.
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:39.320]   - Hey, Skype-asaurus, we can sort of has
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:41.880]   a dinosaur-sounding name, so when we do crash,
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:43.720]   we can say it was the end of the dinosaur.
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:45.800]   - It was, they would meteorite it.
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:48.000]   No, it's been up and down,
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.720]   it's a pretty clue-ge setup right now
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:53.160]   'cause I have to actually crawl underneath the desk
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:55.720]   and patch stuff and it's pretty nutty, but--
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:57.400]   - I just want to know how come we weren't working
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:59.880]   on trying to build it five minutes before the show
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:00.720]   is our usual work.
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:01.560]   - I did.
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:03.200]   - I was, but well, I did, you just didn't see it.
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:06.640]   I came in an hour early and I was going like this
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:07.720]   and it is--
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:10.560]   - It's usually, we only make major equipment changes
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:11.600]   right before a show.
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:12.440]   - I know.
[00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:13.280]   - We don't ever do it now.
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:15.240]   - I actually made Steve Gilmore suffer the pain
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:17.840]   on Saturday, that's when I first put it in.
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:18.680]   And so--
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:20.360]   - I don't know how I missed that, but I'm glad.
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:22.880]   - Oh yeah, it was painful, it was painful.
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:25.480]   But hey, it works.
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:27.560]   And I even have the, there's four screens
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:28.400]   and there's only three of you,
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:29.960]   so I even have Woz in the fourth screen
[00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:31.800]   as if he maybe is there.
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:33.120]   Just watching over this.
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:38.600]   - Let's find out how many cool users we have.
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:40.400]   If they have faces that we recognize,
[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:44.320]   please just record yourself for one minute looking at your webcam.
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:46.360]   - I can put a loop up.
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:47.200]   - Yeah.
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:49.160]   - You could just be looping in the screen for--
[00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:51.240]   - We could get Sinbad up there, he likes to show.
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:54.560]   - Let's go for like Dale Earnhardt Jr.
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:59.560]   Let's go for each jettison dancing on the stars contestant.
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:02.360]   We'll be like, well, they'll have a guest appearance
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:04.520]   on the lower left.
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:07.880]   Oh my God, you have to buy five more screens
[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:09.680]   and then we could do Hollywood squares.
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:11.320]   - Well, you know this.
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:12.920]   You know the sneeze listens.
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:15.840]   The sneeze is listening right now.
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:18.280]   Who is the sneeze?
[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:19.440]   - Okay, you know who the sneeze is.
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:21.880]   Steve, the guy who writes for Big Bang Theory.
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:23.080]   - Oh, that's right, sorry.
[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:27.280]   - We have a fan who writes for Big Bang Theory.
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:28.120]   And he--
[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:28.920]   - Do you think that we could get him
[00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:30.640]   to help us get Summerglow on the show?
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:33.240]   'Cause I would fly to Petaluma for that show.
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:34.120]   - I mentioned Summerglow.
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:35.320]   You know who you all know who she is.
[00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:37.560]   You do if you watch the show "Serenity"
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:39.720]   or the movie "Firefly" or it's vice versa.
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:41.000]   Watch the show "Firefly."
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:41.840]   Or is it, I can--
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:44.600]   - I'm thinking of building a movie just around her.
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:45.520]   She's funding it, of course.
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:50.040]   - She was the young martial artist weapon,
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:52.200]   you know, that had been traumatized.
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:54.880]   What did she do on Big Bang Theory, Andy?
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:56.520]   Did you see have you seen it yet?
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:58.120]   - Well, what happened?
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:00.600]   - Oh, you just saw them laughing at her.
[00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:03.720]   - No, no, no, it was just like the before the title read.
[00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:04.560]   - Oh, okay.
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:08.240]   - So they're writing the train from all the way down
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:11.800]   to San Francisco for conference to hear a paper being read
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:14.440]   by Nobel Prize winner Dr. Smoot,
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:16.920]   relatives of the, what, I can't remember that he was
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:20.120]   the actual legendary Smoot that smooted the Smoot Bridge.
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:22.160]   I might tell you that was just, that was his dad.
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:25.240]   But anyway, legendary scientist.
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:29.040]   And so they noticed that the lovely is actually sharing
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:31.640]   that same car on Amblader himself.
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:36.640]   And Wallowitz is like trying to figure out
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:41.880]   how to come in and what sort of line to use.
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:45.360]   Like, gee, spring must be over because summer just came in.
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:47.720]   Okay, spring must be over because summer just go,
[00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:48.720]   spring must be over.
[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:53.720]   So the B story turns out to be,
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:55.960]   turns out to this thing where, oh goodness,
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:43:00.960]   I will never remember the Indian character.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.600]   - Yeah, the Indian guy.
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:04.600]   - Oh goodness, I'm embarrassing myself.
[00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:05.440]   I don't remember his name.
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:07.080]   So basically it turns into like they're sort of like
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:09.680]   squaring off because each one wants to like hit on her.
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:13.080]   And they're each like having like, you know,
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:17.320]   moderates levels of success and abject humiliating failure.
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:18.320]   - Awesome.
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:19.360]   I gotta watch it.
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:20.880]   I gotta T-vote and--
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:22.520]   - And another one of those things where I'm like,
[00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:25.320]   do you know, so you piece it together that the long
[00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:29.480]   conversation that Sheldon was having was in trying to
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:31.480]   convince the rest of that, no, we shouldn't fly down.
[00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:32.680]   We should take the train.
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:35.080]   And this is a conversation I have had my friends with
[00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:38.080]   every single time we're about to go from Boston to New York
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:39.720]   or Boston to Philadelphia.
[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:41.880]   It's like, no, no, we'll take Amtrak because it'll be
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:43.840]   the Northeast limited and we'll have the,
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:45.320]   we'll be going through like the shoreline.
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:46.720]   It'll be falling, it'll look really crazy.
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:47.560]   - Summer go out.
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:48.640]   - And it might be there.
[00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:49.480]   - Exactly.
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:51.560]   - And, but now I'm really kind of sad
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:54.640]   'cause I watched after I watched two hours of dancing
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:58.120]   with the stars, they had that new show Castle on
[00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:01.040]   which stars, what's his name from Serenity?
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:02.960]   You know, the hero, the lead.
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:04.720]   You never remember his name either.
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:05.640]   - Nathan.
[00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:07.000]   - Captain, Nathan some.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.560]   Anyway, it's, oh, it's a drag, it's awful.
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:11.400]   - Rajee. - Rajee.
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:15.400]   - Did you know Summer Glau is on the new Terminator too
[00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:16.240]   on TV?
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:18.080]   - Oh, that's appropriate.
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:19.920]   - Yeah, she's been, she's one of the robots.
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:22.880]   - Did this turn into, when did this turn into TV talk?
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:24.640]   Was Scott and he started it?
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:25.960]   - Ever since you started it?
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:27.920]   - It was a lot of my favorite TV show.
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:30.120]   It's a TV talk with Scott, Andy and Leo.
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:32.320]   And Alex is just sitting there going,
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:33.960]   "I don't really watch TV that much."
[00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:35.280]   - I don't own a TV.
[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:36.400]   I don't own a TV.
[00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:40.040]   - I own a TV, I just, you know, I kind of lost it.
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:42.080]   - I have the TV, but I'm back to,
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:45.160]   I mean, I still watch Discovery Channel.
[00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:46.000]   - Hey, let's take a break.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.880]   I mentioned the folks at Drobo.
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:49.200]   I know you love them, Scott.
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:51.720]   You guys doing a whole show about storage.
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:54.040]   You gotta love Drobo and backup.
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:55.880]   - I take it. - We do, we do.
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:56.720]   - We do.
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:59.320]   - We've given away three Drobo's this month so far.
[00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:00.320]   - I noticed that.
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:01.800]   So you mentioned one on the show,
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:03.600]   you were gonna give away a Drobo.
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:05.960]   What was it, to somebody who made a video?
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:07.760]   - You did a massive ship of us.
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:09.240]   And it was hilarious.
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:10.400]   It was hilarious.
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:11.400]   - We should do that.
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:14.960]   - I sent you a link to it.
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:16.560]   - But I mean, we should pull it off of his page
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:18.600]   so we don't kill his bandwidth.
[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:20.600]   - Well, yeah, that's true.
[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:22.680]   But it's really funny.
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:25.200]   And so I gave, that was the first one.
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.040]   And then I just gave away randomly one
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:28.280]   to one of my Twitter followers.
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:30.400]   And then yesterday we gave away one
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:33.240]   to somebody who wrote an essay about why they needed it.
[00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:35.200]   That's up at twitphoto.com today.
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:37.360]   And then I think I'm feeling droopy enough
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:39.000]   that tomorrow or the next day I'm just gonna
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.280]   randomly give another Twitter listener one.
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:44.000]   And I got four more after that to give away at least.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.360]   - Well, should we play this Drobo guys?
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:49.800]   Drobo winners, I'll tell you what, we'll save it.
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:51.440]   I'm gonna play it for you in a little bit.
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:53.640]   But first, let's mention the good folks at
[00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:58.640]   DROBO who sponsor this S-H-O-W.
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:01.680]   Drobo.com/Macbreak is the place to go
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:04.600]   for the award winning Drobo,
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:06.840]   the intelligent automated storage device
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:08.160]   for your digital storage needs.
[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:10.920]   You know we all use and love Drobo.
[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:12.080]   You put up to four drives,
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:13.720]   and everybody's loading them up with four drives
[00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:17.680]   into it turns it into a single massive USB
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:19.920]   or firewire storage unit.
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:22.320]   So you never run out because if you start getting low
[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:23.520]   you just pop in another drive.
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:26.480]   The drives don't have to match in size or manufacture.
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:28.200]   Drobo is smart enough to add them all up,
[00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:29.520]   make it all work.
[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:31.560]   Redundant, so if one drive fails,
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:32.760]   you can even use junky drives,
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:35.120]   you know maybe don't have a lot left in them
[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:36.400]   'cause one drive fails, no problem,
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:37.880]   you pop it out, you put a new one in,
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:39.480]   you don't lose a bit.
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:43.960]   Now the current Drobo is the Firewire 800 USB 2.0 Drobo
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:47.160]   fast, twice as fast as the first generation.
[00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:49.320]   Expandable, you can get up to 16 terabytes.
[00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:51.680]   Someday they will come out with four terabyte drives
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:54.840]   probably sooner than later and then you'll be able to load it up.
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:56.560]   And we've got two different offerings.
[00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:59.560]   We've got the $50 discount of course by going to
[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:02.560]   Drobo.com/Macbreak, save you $50,
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:06.320]   but I want to also mention the 15% discount
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:07.760]   on the four terabyte package.
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:10.480]   If you don't have a bunch of drives lying around,
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:12.480]   go to DroboStore.com
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:17.440]   and use the code MBW849.
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:21.080]   MBW849.
[00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:25.600]   And that'll get you $150 off the four terabyte model.
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:29.760]   - It comes to 849 bucks for a Drobo and four drives
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:32.560]   which by the way is what I paid for my original four drives
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:33.560]   from my first Drobo.
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:35.280]   - Oh that's interesting.
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:36.520]   - Yeah. - That's interesting.
[00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:38.320]   That's why it's 849 then.
[00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:39.480]   - Yes, yes.
[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:41.960]   - Very smart people thought that out, Leo.
[00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:43.480]   - I didn't get it, I just thought oh maybe--
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:45.680]   - I can't fool Leo boy, he's right on dumb.
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:48.200]   - Maybe it's serialized, maybe it's some magic number.
[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:50.640]   Maybe it means something in--
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:54.640]   - It's 849 shackle, that's how much you pay.
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:59.640]   - Code MBW849 to save 150 bucks on the new four terabyte
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:02.840]   package, a second generation Drobo loaded with four
[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:05.560]   Western digital Creek power drives.
[00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:09.080]   That's at DroboStore.com, offer good through March 31st, 2009.
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:11.240]   And of course you can always get the $50 off
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:13.680]   just by going to Drobo.com/Macbreak
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:15.560]   if you've got drives lying around.
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:17.000]   We thank them all for their support.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.240]   We just love the Drobo and we appreciate how much
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:23.440]   they've done not just for our show, but for podcasts everywhere.
[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:27.040]   - Put all of your stuff on a Drobo.
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:32.040]   - That's what everybody says, DroboStore.com code MBW849.
[00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:37.240]   Before we move to our Mac picks of the week,
[00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:39.680]   does anybody have any other stories?
[00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:42.960]   I just, I don't know if I got all the stories of anything.
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:45.960]   Apparently jobs is not at the--
[00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:48.200]   - She's Louise.
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:50.800]   - Maybe I should have gone with that tip that I had.
[00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:52.960]   You know, I don't want to be a vulture.
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:53.760]   I don't want to be that guy.
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:55.240]   I don't want to be that guy.
[00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:57.960]   I'm just not going to talk about it.
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:01.680]   Here it is, Mac Break Weekly at the Oscars.
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:02.680]   - Enjoy.
[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:04.240]   Go ahead, everyone answer that phone.
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:07.140]   (laughing)
[00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:08.560]   I'm just, I'm working here.
[00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:11.320]   It's okay, go ahead Scott.
[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:13.120]   (laughing)
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:15.760]   - You Rivera, ladies and gentlemen, do not have a cell phone
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:16.680]   during your performance, Bob.
[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:19.000]   - The Gdubvara is on stage.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.160]   - Good evening.
[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:21.600]   I am Steve Jobs.
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:23.640]   - And I am Steve Wasey out.
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:26.000]   - We are pleased to announce the films selected
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.200]   as the best picture nominees for the first annual 2009
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:32.800]   Mac Break Weekly Oscars, are, the curious case of--
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:34.160]   - La, La, La, Leo.
[00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:35.160]   - La Porte.
[00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:36.000]   - Dramatic.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.080]   - It's my mind.
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:37.920]   (laughing)
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:40.920]   - I'm just coming with a big ditty ditty ditty ditty ditty.
[00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:41.760]   - Oh, look out.
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:42.600]   This is America.
[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:44.440]   - It's time for the B&D Room.
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:46.360]   - Here are more of the split.
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:49.000]   - Why do each things ranking demographic?
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.400]   - You have to see the video of this.
[00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:52.240]   - Larry.
[00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:53.600]   - It's on YouTube.
[00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:55.440]   - You're really built there, Leo.
[00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:57.400]   You're not just trim your cut.
[00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:58.640]   - Ooh, yeah.
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:49:59.800]   - Some things last.
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:03.120]   - It's done all done with CG.
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:05.080]   It's a heavy puppetry involved there.
[00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:06.560]   - Lindsey Nixon starring--
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:08.880]   ♪ Alex Lindsey ♪
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:10.040]   (laughing)
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:10.880]   - Oh man.
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:14.640]   - The American people need a conviction.
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:17.080]   I'd like to give Richard Nixon the trial he never had.
[00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:18.840]   - After Obama came in, they killed the funding
[00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:21.120]   for the Head Explodeau Death Ray Project.
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:23.240]   And so apparently this was the collector
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:25.040]   and mitter-array from it, I got a reaction.
[00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:26.360]   (laughing)
[00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:27.200]   - What is it?
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:28.040]   - Who's that?
[00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:28.880]   - Eddie?
[00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:30.720]   - I'm saying that when the president does it--
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:33.320]   - So then finally we go to the playground
[00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:35.560]   and we ask the kids, is it cool?
[00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:36.880]   - Scott born millionaire.
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:37.720]   Starring.
[00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:39.400]   - The Spoo dulce in town, the W&AP.
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:41.200]   Stereo 93 coming at you with the live ones.
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.040]   It's the Scott Borch.
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:42.880]   - Scott Borch!
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:45.160]   (laughing)
[00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:48.160]   - I'm a special investigator from the police department.
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:49.600]   We have a no-come-away.
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:51.240]   But it's not hot enough.
[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:53.640]   (laughing)
[00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:54.640]   - You look music.
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:51:00.480]   - It's a unsafe hooker.
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:01.320]   - Oh stop.
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:02.960]   (laughing)
[00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:05.160]   - I'm sorry, I was asleep and I heard the word hooker.
[00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:07.360]   - Yeah, I get what I'm all excited about.
[00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:09.440]   (laughing)
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:12.960]   (upbeat music)
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:16.960]   - And finally, the writer starring Andy Anatko.
[00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:18.680]   (laughing)
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:20.680]   Andy Anatko.
[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:22.680]   (upbeat music)
[00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:24.160]   Andy Anatko.
[00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:26.680]   (laughing)
[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:28.680]   Andy Anatko.
[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:30.680]   (upbeat music)
[00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:32.680]   Andy Anatko.
[00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:34.480]   (upbeat music)
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:36.000]   - How'd it with me to say I'm in Cisco?
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.560]   (laughing)
[00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:39.000]   - I'm sorry, the--
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.240]   - I thought I was being,
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:42.080]   that was like the Oscar though, being played off.
[00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:43.400]   (laughing)
[00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:45.600]   - That was awesome.
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:47.640]   That was really, really awesome.
[00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:49.640]   That's, his name is in carbonate.
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:50.560]   (laughing)
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:53.960]   And so you gave him a Drobo for that.
[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:55.280]   - He got a Drobo for that.
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:57.560]   We got the Oscars, he got the Drobo.
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:51:58.560]   - And I guess--
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:51:59.920]   - I mean, don't think it was worth it.
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:00.760]   - Oh.
[00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:03.320]   - I mean, it must have taken a long time.
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:05.360]   I was surprised at how, I mean, we got,
[00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:08.440]   we got dozens of them sent in that were high caliber
[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:10.360]   and dozens that weren't so high caliber,
[00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:13.520]   but you know, it was a lot of work and commitment
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:15.160]   from people and I thought, man, this guy,
[00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:16.520]   he deserved the Drobo, so he got it.
[00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:17.360]   - Oh, he sure did.
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:18.440]   - Wow.
[00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:19.280]   And it was very funny.
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:20.640]   I mean, I laughed, you know,
[00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:22.360]   here I am being made fun of and I'm laughing
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:23.200]   at so hard I'm crying.
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:24.640]   - It's a corn millionaire.
[00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:25.480]   (laughing)
[00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:26.320]   - It was great.
[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:28.360]   It was very clever, I thought.
[00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:31.080]   - It was funnier than, and just the way he did it
[00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:32.960]   and what about it, I thought it was quite clever.
[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:34.720]   - You can see it on YouTube,
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:39.720]   if you search for in-carbonate, I-N-C-A-R-B-O-N-A-T-E.
[00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:41.520]   Nice job.
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:45.000]   Are you ready for our picks of the week, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.880]   I guess, you know, I should probably play those jingles.
[00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:49.560]   I mean, let's start with...
[00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:52.600]   ♪ Alex Lindsay ♪
[00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:57.560]   - Okay, so I was traveling, as I already said,
[00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:00.960]   and one of the issues with trying to use GPS,
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:04.960]   so I had this, I was almost gonna get a GPS unit
[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:07.400]   for my car, you know, just one of the ones you bought,
[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:10.720]   you rent with the car, but it was $11 a day.
[00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:12.440]   And I was like, oh, I don't know if I really wanna spend it.
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:13.280]   I have it on my iPhone.
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:15.400]   Well, the problem in New Mexico is that
[00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:17.440]   evidently 3G hasn't really made it here,
[00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:21.520]   and connectivity between many of the cities
[00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:24.760]   isn't really what, you know, for at least AT&T,
[00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:26.480]   isn't really what it was, is cracked up to be.
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:28.520]   So what happens is, is the phone can tell you
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:30.480]   exactly where you are,
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:32.000]   but it doesn't really know where that is.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.280]   You know, so it's like a blank screen, like, you know,
[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:36.120]   - Here's where you are and it's nowhere.
[00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:37.040]   - So you get a little blue dot,
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:38.800]   that literally has little thing going,
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:41.320]   and a blank screen, like you are where you are.
[00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:42.640]   - That's pretty useless.
[00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:45.360]   - Now, there is a solution, which I downloaded,
[00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:46.680]   and haven't had a chance to really test,
[00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:48.760]   because in the past it's all worked,
[00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:50.200]   and it's called GMAP.
[00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:53.280]   So GMAP is on the iPhone, and it's a big download.
[00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:54.280]   I don't remember how big it was,
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:56.120]   six or 700 megabytes or something,
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:57.880]   but what it is, is it's all the maps.
[00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:01.320]   So all the maps are local on your iPhone,
[00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:03.640]   and then it uses that GPS information
[00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:04.920]   to put you on the map.
[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:08.600]   So when you are, and the reason I bought it was specifically
[00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:09.480]   'cause I was driving up the one,
[00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:10.400]   and had the same problem,
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:11.920]   was like, I never want this to happen again.
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:14.800]   So I bought this, and I think it's $50.
[00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:16.560]   I mean, it's not cheap.
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:21.000]   And it is, you know, I downloaded it over a long period
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.040]   of time, and loaded it up, took a big chunk,
[00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:25.720]   but it is so worth it when your map isn't working.
[00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:28.400]   So if you have problems with that map turning on and off,
[00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:32.400]   GMAP allows you to, it's not as smooth, in my opinion,
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:37.400]   as the Google Maps, but it was a big deal
[00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:41.800]   when I was trying to figure out what roads to go up and down,
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:42.960]   and so on and so forth.
[00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:45.720]   And I was constantly losing connection in Taos,
[00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:49.240]   in the area around Taos, north of Taos, especially,
[00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:53.720]   and also in the areas just outside of Santa Fe.
[00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:57.040]   And so all of these areas, I just wouldn't know where I was,
[00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:59.320]   and I don't know really how to have an existence outside,
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:00.720]   without a GPS anymore.
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:03.720]   If I don't know where I am, I just don't know where I am.
[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:07.480]   So it's called GMAP, and it's available on the iPhone,
[00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:09.360]   and I believe it's $50.49.
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:11.360]   - Boy, that's expensive for an iPhone app.
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:13.480]   - Yeah, but it's all the maps.
[00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:15.360]   - And you don't have to be cracked.
[00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:18.360]   - No, no, this is just built in.
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:19.760]   Now I don't think it does any kind of,
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:21.200]   I think it stays within the rules
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:23.080]   and doesn't do a turn by turn.
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:25.240]   And as I said, it's a little more clunky
[00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:26.520]   than what you get with the,
[00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:28.240]   if you have a great connection all the time,
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:30.880]   I don't know if this makes as much of a difference.
[00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:33.640]   But if you are, it's very, you know,
[00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:35.320]   I've had a lot of these traveling
[00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:37.520]   where I suddenly lose my connection.
[00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:39.400]   And this will happen even in Sonoma County
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:41.120]   on the way to the beach.
[00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:43.240]   You know, all these other, these areas will get dropouts,
[00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:44.640]   and suddenly, you know, you know where you are,
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:45.960]   but you don't know where that is.
[00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:50.960]   And the GPS is working, but the connection isn't.
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:55.320]   And so if that becomes an issue for some of our listeners
[00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:58.080]   and viewers, GMAP is the solution.
[00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:00.480]   - It looks like it's 20 bucks, but for the West,
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:01.640]   and then 20 bucks for the East.
[00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:02.680]   So you get to--
[00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:03.600]   - I think I bought it all.
[00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:04.600]   So I think that's why I was thinking.
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:05.440]   - Yeah, so that's not so bad.
[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:07.960]   - In the price of prop, I think I may have paid more than,
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:08.800]   more than that.
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:09.640]   - Yeah, it's twice.
[00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:11.080]   So if you're only gonna use the West as 20 bucks,
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:14.200]   now this is, so this is the first GPS for,
[00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:15.080]   but it doesn't turn by turn.
[00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:16.520]   - But now for the wilds, I'm sitting on my iPhone
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:17.800]   for quite some time.
[00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:19.760]   And, and, 'cause it was always working.
[00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:20.680]   And when it dropped out,
[00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:22.040]   I was like, well, this is a chance to test it.
[00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:23.280]   And it worked well.
[00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:24.200]   - Yeah.
[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:25.240]   And what about Google Maps?
[00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:26.640]   So I guess that's the point is,
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:29.120]   if you're not connected, you can't use Google Maps.
[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:30.160]   - Right, that's been my big complaint,
[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:31.720]   is that Google Maps is great.
[00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:33.960]   In fact, it is smoother than GMAPs.
[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:36.080]   I mean, you know, as far as telling me where you're at,
[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:37.360]   what you're doing, so on and so forth.
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:39.400]   It is actually a better Google Maps.
[00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:42.200]   If you always have a connection, this is never an issue.
[00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:43.840]   I would just stick with Google Maps.
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:46.960]   But if you are, 'cause it's awesome.
[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:49.000]   But if you get into these areas where dropouts,
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:50.520]   or you're afraid there's dropouts,
[00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:52.200]   it's a great insurance policy to make sure.
[00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:54.040]   If you really are using your iPhone
[00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:58.280]   as your only GPS unit, and you're on road trip.
[00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:02.760]   - From X-Road Company Limited, GMAP US East,
[00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:04.760]   and West for 20 bucks.
[00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:09.280]   Each, the pick of Mr. Alex Lindsey.
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:10.600]   And now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:12.240]   - Shut the world!
[00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:13.240]   (laughing)
[00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:14.600]   - I just love doing that.
[00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:15.920]   (laughing)
[00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:17.080]   - You're probably gonna talk about what
[00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:18.160]   that reminds me of the private space.
[00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:19.160]   - It's probably not 95.
[00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:20.000]   - I know, yeah.
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:20.840]   - People as they have to do,
[00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:22.880]   and they have to do it to you.
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:26.520]   - We call those full sings back in the radio days.
[00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:28.160]   - That's a full sing.
[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:30.080]   - I can play the full sing.
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:34.040]   - I'm sorry, I do have a question for Scott and Leo.
[00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:35.840]   It's almost like those like little,
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:36.840]   and we're back in the virtual,
[00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:37.760]   no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:39.840]   That never leaves your brain, does it?
[00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:42.920]   You just push a little button and it just comes out.
[00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:44.160]   It's always giving us so often.
[00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:46.920]   - How many years were you a DJ, Scott?
[00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:50.240]   - I was on air six years every day,
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:52.840]   and then I've done on air stuff on enough
[00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:54.480]   for another 20 years.
[00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:57.120]   - Yeah, got my license on 76.
[00:57:57.120 --> 00:58:00.880]   Was a DJ until 87, so that's 11 years.
[00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:03.000]   I was stuck like this, and then--
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.920]   - Now did you get a class three, did you get a class three?
[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:06.760]   Did you get a class three?
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:08.640]   - I only got a third class ticket.
[00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:10.120]   I couldn't get a first class ticket.
[00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:12.160]   I didn't want to learn the Morse code.
[00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:13.400]   - But did you have to take out,
[00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:15.360]   did you have to pass element nine?
[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:16.680]   - Ah. - Do you remember element?
[00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:17.960]   - I think so. - Did you have to pass
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:19.240]   the logs portion of the test?
[00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:21.400]   - Yeah, I did all that stuff, yeah.
[00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:22.360]   - See now, you know what they do?
[00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:23.560]   They send in a friggin' postcard.
[00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:25.160]   - It's a postcard, you don't need to do nothing.
[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:28.600]   Kids today, I tell ya, I remember very well
[00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:33.560]   taking the train to New York City from New Haven,
[00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:36.600]   'cause that's where I was, to go to the FCC offices
[00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:38.200]   to take this test, and you had to study
[00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:40.600]   the how to calculate antenna power
[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:43.000]   and all sorts of weird stuff.
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.600]   - At the time, I took the test in Fort Worth, Texas,
[00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:48.560]   and I was the youngest person to pass the class three.
[00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:50.360]   - How old were you?
[00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:52.280]   - I was, I can't say.
[00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:53.280]   (laughs)
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:55.200]   - You were younger than you ought to have been.
[00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:56.760]   - I was younger than I ought to have been.
[00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:58.120]   - Wow. - I'll just put it like that.
[00:58:58.120 --> 00:58:59.440]   But anyway, my life--
[00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:02.320]   - Some people lie about their age again in a movie.
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:05.000]   Some people lie about their age again in the service.
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.040]   You lied about your age to become a DJ.
[00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:10.040]   - Yeah, I really wanted to work at the radio station
[00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:12.560]   all my life and I got to. - That's cool.
[00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:17.560]   - The pick I have for this week is an iPhone app called Wear.
[00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:19.120]   - Huh?
[00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:23.480]   - It's called Wear, and it uses the location-based services
[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:25.600]   to AF, this is sort of, you know,
[00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:28.720]   I'm piggyback and a little bit off of Alex's pick.
[00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:31.640]   This uses the location-based services
[00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:34.200]   to find out where you are, and then to help you quickly
[00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:37.600]   identify what's near you in the way of things like
[00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:41.840]   movie theaters, gas stations, Starbucks,
[00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:43.640]   and being here in Gig Harbor today,
[00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:46.440]   I noticed there are something like 7,212 Starbucks
[00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:47.640]   within a while with me.
[00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:51.560]   You can find out, you know, just amazing stuff,
[00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:53.360]   like where's the closest zip car?
[00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:56.480]   It's really very, very well thought out.
[00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:58.720]   I have to confess, they sent it to me
[00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:00.600]   and I don't know how much it costs to buy, but--
[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:03.000]   - I will tell you, it's free.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.240]   - Well, there you go.
[01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:06.640]   And I'm using it quite frequently,
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:08.360]   helps you figure out what's near you.
[01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:10.400]   And, you know, obviously when I'm in one of my cars,
[01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:14.680]   I have a GPS, but I don't always happen to be in my car.
[01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:17.200]   So if I'm in a strange city where I'm walking around
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:20.440]   or taking taxis or if I'm just hanging out here
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:23.320]   and I'm like, "Hey, where's the nearest Starbucks?"
[01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:26.920]   I can just, you know, look it up right here, there it is.
[01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:28.680]   And I don't know, I just, you know,
[01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:30.800]   most of these iPhone apps I play with them a few minutes
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:32.840]   and I forget about them, but I really like this one.
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:33.680]   - I do too. - It's called Wear.
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:34.760]   - Yeah, I've been using it for some time.
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:36.440]   I like it a lot.
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:37.280]   - Where you go?
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:38.480]   - And it's free.
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:41.080]   - And the sequel to this is gonna be called There.
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:44.280]   - Or who, what, why and when?
[01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:49.160]   - Now it's time for Mr. Let's see,
[01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:51.600]   Annie Naco would be next.
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:54.080]   Let me press his button.
[01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:56.040]   - Andy Naco.
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:58.280]   - Ha ha ha ha ha.
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:00:59.120]   - Oh baby.
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:00:59.960]   - Oh baby.
[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:01.840]   - I love when you impressed those buttons, baby.
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:07.200]   - Well, had a bit of adventure a few days ago.
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:10.000]   I could wait no longer.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.000]   And so I hackintoshed a Del Mini 9.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.200]   - Oh, aren't you a bad boy?
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:16.920]   - I'm feeling so naughty.
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:21.160]   I feel like I'm aside in my, my powers as a consumer
[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:24.360]   and purchaser of copper-out material to abandon twist
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:26.640]   that copper-out material to whatever needs,
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:29.040]   have not been fathom by the copper-out materialism.
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:33.240]   So as a lot of people have heard about,
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:37.960]   there are tons of these dirt cheap $300, $400,
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.320]   Windows netbooks.
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:42.640]   They're based on architectures that are really quite suitable
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.840]   towards running Mac OS X.
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:49.840]   And last year was the first time that I got Mac OS X
[01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:54.720]   running on an Intel-based Windows computer.
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:57.520]   And it was, I never really wrote about it.
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:59.240]   I think I talked about it once or twice,
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:03.040]   but I really didn't take it seriously because at that time,
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:04.840]   which was maybe January or February,
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:10.280]   it's what I like to call a bar bet hack or a bar bet trick,
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:13.560]   where if you're in the bar and someone bets you five bucks,
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:17.840]   you cannot get Mac OS X running on this Lenovo notebook.
[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:19.400]   You know what, you can come back next week
[01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:23.520]   and press a button and it will show the Mac OS running
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:26.880]   and you can double click on the Safari icon
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:28.680]   and sort of like take hold your breath
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:30.640]   and it will actually run.
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:32.760]   And of course it will run really, really slowly
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:35.320]   and you had to boot off of a USB disk.
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:37.240]   And plus you actually had to go inside
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:39.160]   and make a couple hardware changes.
[01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:42.200]   And even so you get a kernel panic every three seconds
[01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:44.240]   and it's just, but again, you'll collect your five bucks
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:46.840]   because you did technically get Mac OS X running
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:48.400]   on this machine.
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:51.160]   But things have changed in the past year
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:52.680]   and I decided to give it a try.
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:56.160]   If you select a netbook that is known to work
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:58.560]   extremely well with Mac OS X,
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:01.640]   and that means that the built-in hardware
[01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:04.520]   like the internal Wi-Fi car, the internal networking car,
[01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:07.200]   the internal webcam, all that sort of stuff,
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:10.440]   either is supported directly by Mac OS X
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:15.440]   or there's a large enough community of people
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:17.920]   who are hacking this machine
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:19.960]   so that they can write the drivers for you
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:21.360]   and release them for free
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:22.800]   and give you the utilities you need
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:24.320]   and give you the instructions you need.
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:28.960]   You can very, without terrible difficulty,
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:33.280]   adapt some of these machines to run Mac OS X extremely well.
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:36.840]   The Dell's Mini 9, which is one of the tiniest netbooks
[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:38.760]   you will ever see in your life,
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:43.040]   is one of these machines that happens to work very, very well.
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:48.040]   And costs anywhere from $2.99 to like 400 bucks.
[01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:51.560]   It's teensy, teensy, tiny.
[01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:56.560]   It comes with a eight gigabyte internal SSD.
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:00.920]   And so here's my big meat hook to see it.
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:02.440]   I'm not holding up to the camera right now
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:03.880]   so you can see exactly how tiny it is.
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:04.720]   It's not.
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:07.080]   - And you can see it's still running OS X.
[01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:09.800]   - And it is running OS X, not just that,
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:14.800]   but it is running it at a very, very respectable clip.
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:15.640]   Let me just see.
[01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:16.480]   - Did you add more memory to it
[01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:18.320]   'cause it comes with one gig of RAM?
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:20.040]   - It comes with one gigabyte of RAM.
[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:22.280]   What you're looking at right now is you're looking
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:27.120]   at it streaming Star Wars Episode 3.
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:28.640]   - You know, if you're gonna buy a copyright,
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:29.720]   just go for it.
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:30.560]   - Exactly.
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:31.720]   Well, now you're in this too
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:34.920]   'cause you're illegally rebroadcasting the show content.
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:37.200]   And of course, this is the screen.
[01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:40.400]   The streaming here, it's making it look choppy,
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:43.720]   but believe me, like right here in my office,
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:47.680]   it is as perfect as it would be in any iMac
[01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:48.960]   and any other machine.
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:52.760]   Now, the Dell Mini 9 is an unusual choice 'cause again,
[01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:56.480]   I happened to have gotten my hands on an eight gigabyte model.
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:59.920]   And I had a jump through considerable hoops
[01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:03.640]   to get Mac, Maca was 10.5.6 running on it
[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:06.480]   because any standard install,
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:08.200]   it will just not install
[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:10.240]   because you just don't have enough space.
[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:11.600]   - Did you use EFI X?
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:12.440]   How did you?
[01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:17.600]   - I used the Dell, what's it called?
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:19.560]   If you go to mydelmini.com,
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:21.640]   it has all the instructions you need.
[01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:25.360]   I use the Dell if I, what's that I think?
[01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:28.280]   I'm mumbling because I don't have my notes in front of me.
[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:29.560]   But I basically use instructions
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:31.960]   that were locatable just about anywhere.
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:34.840]   Again, mydelmini.com is the forums,
[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:37.880]   has the forums that you want to check this out.
[01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:41.400]   If I had the 16 gig internal drive,
[01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:44.960]   which is by maybe 50 bucks more on the Dell store
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:46.160]   and definitely worth the money,
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:47.360]   I could have just installed it
[01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:49.520]   without really having to mess around with it at all
[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:50.360]   and getting it running.
[01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:52.480]   I would still want to slim it down to make some room.
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:55.200]   But amongst the many cool things about the Mini 9
[01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:58.640]   is that it also has a built in SDHC slot.
[01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:01.720]   So I find that even on this eight gig machine,
[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:04.600]   when I was done, I had about a gig and a half of free space,
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:08.360]   which given that I'm treating this as a netbook
[01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:10.400]   and not a Mac book is plenty of space.
[01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:13.520]   I have enough space for Skype, my word processor,
[01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:17.680]   my sling box software, even running Safari
[01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:19.760]   and my word processor and iChat,
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:22.840]   I still have, and with page and stuff to memory,
[01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:25.280]   I still have more than a gigabyte left
[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:28.560]   and I'm using the card slot pretty much for storage.
[01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:30.440]   Or you can just attach an external hard drive,
[01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:33.120]   boot off the hard drive and have a 320 gig,
[01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:36.040]   having to have 320 gigs of storage.
[01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:38.480]   But I really do need to underscore the fact
[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:41.840]   that once the installation was done,
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:44.120]   there it is a no compromises,
[01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:48.080]   absolutely fully functional Mac OS 10 running machine.
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:49.920]   - You can run updates.
[01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:54.320]   It runs, I updated from 10.5.2 to 10.5.6
[01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:55.520]   just by using the built in,
[01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:56.560]   just by going to the Apple menu
[01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:58.040]   and saying check for updates.
[01:06:58.040 --> 01:06:58.880]   - Awesome.
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:06:59.720]   - And impressed me the most,
[01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:02.240]   because it wasn't the first netbook that I tried,
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:04.520]   but impressed me the most about the Dell was.
[01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:08.480]   We all know that after you open up a brand new Macintosh
[01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:10.360]   and launches that application says,
[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:11.720]   we'll come in, be on smooth,
[01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:12.880]   and smooth, and then,
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:15.960]   and then we're ready to start it
[01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:18.120]   and create a new account and fill in all these forms
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:19.040]   and register.
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:21.360]   And of course that application launches.
[01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:23.280]   And without, and at this point,
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:25.280]   I was only halfway through the process
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:28.640]   of hacking this machine to run Mac OS 10.
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:30.240]   There are still many steps left to go
[01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:32.440]   to make it fully compatible with everything.
[01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:33.520]   But even then,
[01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:37.120]   this, the Apple standard welcome to Macintosh
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:39.000]   created a new account procedure.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.920]   It found my wifi connected to the internet.
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:43.080]   When it created the account,
[01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:45.200]   it said, oh, now it's time to take a picture with the webcam
[01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:47.000]   and it activated the built in webcam
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.200]   and took a picture with the webcam.
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:51.560]   So even when I was halfway through,
[01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:52.800]   it looked incredibly encouraging.
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:54.200]   When I was completely done,
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:56.600]   over the past couple of days,
[01:07:56.600 --> 01:08:00.160]   I've been using it in that sort of test mode.
[01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:01.760]   You know, mentally that mode where I'm saying,
[01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:03.280]   okay, let's see what this can do.
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:04.280]   And I'm gonna keep working on this
[01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:05.640]   because if it's gonna crash,
[01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:07.920]   I wanna make it crash the next two or three days.
[01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:10.720]   But before, before 10 minutes have passed,
[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:13.440]   I stopped thinking that I'm looking at a hacked device.
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:15.720]   I just think that I'm just in my usual work mode
[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:19.040]   of using the Mac OS X environment.
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:21.320]   So I do have a bunch of caveats.
[01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:22.400]   I don't want people to think
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:25.120]   that this is a replacement for Macintosh
[01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:27.120]   or this is in any way a competition.
[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:31.920]   This solution is an alternative to buying a real Mac
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:33.760]   because this isn't a real Mac.
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:35.280]   The hard, obviously the hardware is different.
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:37.200]   The keyboard, the keys aren't where they should,
[01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:38.840]   a lot of the keys aren't where they should be
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:41.160]   because it's just a different keyboard layout.
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:44.440]   Also, if you're looking at this as an alternative
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:46.160]   to purchasing a MacBook,
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:49.560]   realize that a MacBook has a full-size screen
[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:51.680]   and a full-size keyboard, a hard drive,
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:53.960]   all kinds of extra hardware goodies
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:57.000]   and costs you a minimum of $999.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.720]   To get that sort of functionality in the Windows world,
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:02.840]   you start off by buying a $600 notebook.
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:04.240]   If you wanna get, that's, again,
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:06.280]   let level of features, comfort and performance.
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:09.960]   Then you have to go out and buy a copy of Leopard.
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:12.120]   That's gonna cost you another hundred bucks.
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:14.480]   You're getting very, very close to the purchase price
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:19.040]   of a MacBook by the time you're all done.
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:20.720]   And the most important thing is that,
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:24.280]   remember that Apple's coming out with 10.6
[01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:26.200]   sometime in the next few months.
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:28.920]   And it's possible that this machine that I have right now
[01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:30.960]   that I'm so happy with will not work
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:32.720]   if I update it to 10.6.
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:34.760]   And I might be stuck with 10.5.6
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:36.600]   for the rest of the life of the device.
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:38.240]   So I'm not sure that if I'm not sure
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:40.520]   that I would be willing to spend more than $300
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:41.760]   on a device like this,
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:46.240]   my basic conclusion about the whole hack-and-toshing thing
[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:49.760]   is that if there is a type of device
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:52.280]   that Apple is not interested in making,
[01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:54.440]   such as a netbook, something that's small enough
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:57.200]   to fit in a purse, small enough to fit in the back pocket
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:59.680]   of my tactical pants, something that's cheap,
[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:02.000]   something you can take with you when you really can't
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.800]   motivate yourself to take your full MacBook Pro with you,
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:08.560]   then it becomes a very attractive solution.
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:10.720]   But again, it is certainly not a replacement
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:12.520]   for going out to the Apple Store
[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:13.800]   and buying a real Macintosh,
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:15.440]   because it is not a real Macintosh.
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:18.640]   It is a real computer running the real macOS 10,
[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:20.360]   but there's a, I do think there's a world of difference
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:22.760]   between that and saying this is a real Macintosh.
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:26.280]   - You know, I bought an MSI Wind
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:28.120]   because it and the Dell Mini were the two
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:29.600]   that were the easiest to hack-and-tosh
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:33.040]   according to, I guess it was Boeing Boeing,
[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:36.120]   that, or Breton Wood Gadgets that published that table.
[01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:37.560]   And did the same thing.
[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:40.440]   And you know, I took it off, first of all,
[01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:42.160]   because it's illegal and I edited it in public
[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:43.560]   and I didn't really want to get in trouble.
[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:44.960]   But also, 'cause it didn't feel right.
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:46.520]   It just felt like a Windows machine
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:48.080]   with a Mac on top of it.
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:49.640]   And I want to use a Mac.
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:51.360]   It's like, I don't know why, it just didn't feel right.
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:54.120]   Are you gonna keep running the hack-and-tosh software?
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:56.560]   - Well, I'm gonna keep it at least 'til I've got
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:11:00.400]   a big conference in Boulder coming up in a few weeks.
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:01.960]   And I'm definitely gonna keep it up through then
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:05.880]   because, like I said, normally I'm in a position
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:08.960]   where I just really desperately need a tiny
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:11.040]   notebook computer that's perfect for that.
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:13.520]   Every time I'm at a trade show, I'm in a position
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:16.560]   where I need to just file a story to a website
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:18.280]   or I need to edit something quickly.
[01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:20.360]   And I'm like, I'm in the hotel room, I'm thinking,
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:23.680]   I'm really gonna take this MacBook with me all day long
[01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:25.600]   and carry it through eight or nine hours
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:28.800]   of walking around just because I definitely needed
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:30.320]   for one half hour's worth of work
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:33.000]   and I might need it for something else later on.
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.120]   On that basis, a Dell Mini 9 is
[01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:37.400]   and it is a very, very good thing for me to have.
[01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:39.400]   And if Apple made something like the Dell Mini 9
[01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:44.000]   for less than $500, I would definitely be buying it.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.560]   So, again, I do just putting Windows 7 on it
[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:48.960]   and using it as a Windows machine.
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:51.800]   Yeah, that works fine too, but I want actual Mac software.
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:52.640]   - Yeah, I don't blame it.
[01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:55.040]   - If Scrivener is my word processor
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:56.960]   and if it were available for Windows,
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:59.160]   that would change the playing field a lot.
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:02.400]   - Tony, who edits this show, Tony Wang,
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:05.080]   carries a Dell Mini around
[01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:08.000]   with a certain other operating system on it.
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.640]   - But I'm very interested in how to do this
[01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:12.360]   with that that you can update it.
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:13.840]   That's the new process.
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:18.600]   - Well, again, as far as all the infrastructure is concerned,
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:20.480]   this is just another machine running macOS.
[01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:22.960]   So, I've never had a problem doing software updates
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:24.240]   on any basis.
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:28.720]   And it should also be pointed out that earlier solutions
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:31.520]   to hack and tauching a Windows machine involved,
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:34.760]   torrenting down an illegal copy of macOS 10
[01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:36.640]   has been hacked and spent expanded
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:38.160]   in order to work on this hardware.
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:40.800]   This is a little bit more like bootcamp
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:44.960]   where you have to provide your own copy of the operating system,
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:46.880]   whether that's, and usually that will mean
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:48.480]   go down to the Apple Store, spend 100 bucks
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:50.760]   and walk out with a DVD that has the software on it.
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:53.760]   The only thing that's, the things that are illegal about it,
[01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:57.440]   well, and it's illegal on the basis of we're gonna need,
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:59.600]   we're gonna have to have a court decide this,
[01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:02.760]   is that when you click through that introduction stuff
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:04.960]   that says, here's your terms of use,
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:05.800]   you agree to all this?
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:06.640]   Yes, I do.
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:08.240]   You have agreed to not do this.
[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:10.160]   You have agreed to not try to run the software
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:12.280]   on anything that Apple has not created.
[01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:14.360]   And Apple on that on a couple other bases
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:19.360]   has made the, taken the position that this sort of procedure
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:22.440]   violates the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
[01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:25.960]   So, as a result, and also again,
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:28.080]   I'm trying to figure out how to write about this.
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:30.920]   I'm certainly not gonna be providing step-by-step plans
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:34.040]   because it's, in terms of difficulty,
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:39.040]   it's easier than assembling an IKEA bookcase.
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:44.520]   But, sorry, it's harder than assembling an IKEA bookcase.
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:48.040]   It is not quite as hard as replacing your car stereo.
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:49.680]   It is not the sort of thing we're a consumer
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:52.320]   who would otherwise wanna walk into an Apple Store
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:55.880]   and buy a $500 sub-subnote book would say,
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:57.360]   "Oh, I'll just do this instead."
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:58.800]   Because there are a lot of steps.
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:00.360]   They have to be done in order.
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:04.640]   You have to have the right things on hand to do those steps.
[01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:07.520]   And when inevitably things go wrong,
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:09.680]   you have to have enough of a technical background
[01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:12.680]   to understand how to get your way around it.
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:15.440]   When I, like I said, it's unusual to try to install the OS
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:16.880]   on the eight gigabyte version of this,
[01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:19.280]   but again, that's what I happen to have on hand.
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:21.960]   And I've located instructions on how to install it
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:23.200]   on an eight gigabyte machine,
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:25.080]   and I try to follow those and they didn't work.
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:27.600]   So, I finally had to say, "Okay, this is the point
[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:30.200]   "during Apollo 13 where Gary Sinise is in the simulator
[01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:32.280]   "and they can't figure out how to turn on
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:36.440]   "to the flight computer without flying the spacecraft."
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:38.560]   And Solly says, "Let's throw up everything we know.
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:41.360]   "Let's, instead of trying to just simply change
[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:43.480]   "the sequences of things, let's try something brand new."
[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:45.880]   And I did try something brand new, and that was what worked.
[01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:47.280]   - Cool.
[01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:50.280]   Yeah, I think it's a, it raises, it's really a news story.
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:53.080]   It raises an issue for Apple because if it's easy
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:55.760]   to hackintosh, which apparently is,
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:59.040]   I mean, they can ignore it as long as it's a tough thing to do.
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:00.400]   But as it gets easier and easier,
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:02.280]   it becomes a bigger and bigger issue for Apple.
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:05.200]   - I don't know how easy or stable it's ever gonna become.
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:06.320]   I mean, I'm thinking of doing one
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:08.600]   just because I want a little word processor.
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:10.680]   You know, and I'm not even sure if I need to hack it,
[01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:12.760]   to be honest, I could just use a PC end of things.
[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:14.320]   But I've been thinking of hacking one just
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:15.920]   so I have this little kind of,
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:17.640]   a little thing that I can carry on the bus
[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:19.600]   that is just a little smaller that is, you know,
[01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:24.680]   just easier to manage when I know I'm not doing anything heavy.
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:26.480]   For that, I probably don't need to upgrade it
[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:27.800]   for the next two or three years.
[01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:29.200]   I mean, I write articles,
[01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:31.000]   I write all my articles and text at it.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.200]   So, you know, I think that,
[01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:38.440]   that's kind of the only process that I'm thinking about.
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:39.880]   - That's why I think Windows 7 actually
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:43.440]   is a pretty good choice on a wind or a Del Mini.
[01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:46.200]   It's clean, I mean, it's simple
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:49.840]   and it runs very well in two gigabytes of RAM.
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:51.320]   And you know--
[01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:53.080]   - Yeah, and so, but I, you know, and I just--
[01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:54.080]   - Of course, if you have to have Scribner,
[01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:55.680]   I understand why you'd wanna do that.
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:56.840]   - Yeah, well, they--
[01:15:56.840 --> 01:15:58.920]   - I like the environment that I like.
[01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:02.640]   And whenever I'm in Windows, it's not a terrible,
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:04.600]   unusable operating system, it's just that,
[01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:06.840]   I have to like, okay, God, I have to use the start menu
[01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:08.240]   and oh, God, I have to--
[01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:10.600]   And the mouse doesn't track the way that I expect it to
[01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:13.520]   and oh, God, I can't just simply tab between Windows.
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:14.720]   Again, given that--
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:15.720]   - I have the same thing.
[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:17.640]   That's one reason I'm thinking of hacking it is just
[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:21.080]   'cause I definitely wouldn't be--
[01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:24.160]   Just as a person who uses this technology myself,
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:26.280]   I'm not talking about it as an advocate for anything.
[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:28.240]   But as someone who uses this stuff myself,
[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:31.120]   this would be a non-starter if not for the fact that
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:33.120]   once it's all set up, it works perfectly
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:36.560]   without any exceptions and without any limitations.
[01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:40.040]   The only limitation is that the Apple key
[01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:42.040]   remaps to the Alt key, which on this machine
[01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:43.080]   is kind of tiny.
[01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:46.040]   I also don't like the fact that they put the--
[01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:48.560]   They made this a very, very type of--
[01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:50.840]   It's a very, very typeable keyboard.
[01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:53.360]   I think the key caps are actually almost full-sized.
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:54.760]   They're just sort of scrunched together
[01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:57.200]   and the layout, they had to change it to get it all to fit
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:58.880]   onto one keyboard layout.
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:01.680]   And unfortunately, they put the quote and the double quote key
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:03.080]   like next to the space bar.
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:07.800]   So every time I type isn't, I always hit the return key
[01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:09.520]   'cause the enter key 'cause that's where it's supposed
[01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:11.120]   to be on a real keyboard and I have to sort of
[01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:13.280]   remap things mentally, interrupting.
[01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:15.320]   - I've posted a lot of tweets accidentally
[01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:16.280]   for that very reason.
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:19.280]   I keep hitting enter when I'm meant to hit a posture.
[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:21.880]   - So I just wanna make sure I'm very clear about this.
[01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:24.080]   I'm not saying that this is in any way a replacement
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:27.520]   for Macintosh, I'm not saying in any way that if you need
[01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:29.520]   a Mac that you should consider this instead
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:31.560]   'cause I think you'll be disappointed by it.
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:34.760]   But like I said, if like me, there is a hole
[01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:37.360]   in your work and personal life that is exactly--
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:38.640]   - That is not a hole.
[01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:40.120]   - That is not this big.
[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:41.840]   It is actually this big.
[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:45.120]   Until Apple is willing to sell me something that's this big,
[01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:47.440]   the DelmentE9 is the best solution.
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:49.400]   - I've got a free pick for you in just a second.
[01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:52.200]   I'm gonna give you, but I do wanna,
[01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:56.160]   and also a breaking story, if this is true,
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:58.880]   and it's from Engadget, but if this is true,
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:02.400]   shame on Apple.
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:05.800]   It looks like Apple has rejected an update
[01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:09.760]   of a very popular application in the iPhone store
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:11.400]   for the really the dumbest of reasons,
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:12.600]   but we'll talk about that in just a second.
[01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:16.000]   First I wanna mention our friends that go to meeting,
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.640]   go to meeting is the way to do online meetings.
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:20.200]   I mean, it's just, it's simply the best way
[01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:21.560]   to do online meetings.
[01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:22.840]   If you wanna try it for free,
[01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:25.080]   it works on a Mac now, as well as PCs.
[01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:29.160]   You can just go to gotomeeting.com/macbreak.
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:31.240]   Now there are other meeting solutions.
[01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:34.120]   Most of them run Windows only, I might add.
[01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:35.000]   Go to meetings the best.
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.280]   It's been the best on Windows for years,
[01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:38.080]   and now it's available on Mac.
[01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:41.520]   You can have a Mac meeting with PC users and vice versa.
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:42.760]   I like that.
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:44.760]   Meeting members can be anywhere in the world.
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:46.200]   You get free voice over the internet,
[01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:48.640]   and free voice conferencing built in.
[01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:50.360]   Setup sees, you just take a couple of minutes to do.
[01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:53.880]   It's completely secure, and you pay one low rate a month
[01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:56.160]   for as many meetings as you want, as often as you want.
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:59.480]   It's much more affordable than a lot of the other choices.
[01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:02.320]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:05.160]   You'll save time and money traveling.
[01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:07.520]   You'll get more done, you'll close more deals.
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:08.360]   It's just great.
[01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:09.600]   You're talking to somebody on the phone,
[01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:11.920]   and you say, "I wanna show you this."
[01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:14.360]   I'm using Scrivener here, and I wanna show you
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:16.480]   the side by side, and they say,
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:17.400]   "Well, I don't have Scriven."
[01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:19.000]   You say, "Well, go to gotomeeting.com."
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.280]   Here's the meeting ID.
[01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:22.560]   They log in, now they're seeing your computer,
[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:24.760]   your Scrivener, not only can you show them,
[01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:27.160]   not only can you work together on a Scrivener document,
[01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:28.960]   you could say, "Okay, now you take control."
[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:30.720]   You can, if you've never used Scrivener,
[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:33.280]   you should try it, and they can try it.
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:35.240]   I mean, this is flexibility, this is awesome.
[01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:37.880]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:39.200]   Give it a try, I know you're gonna like it,
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:41.000]   but thank you so much for supporting.
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:46.000]   Macbreak, weekly, gotomeeting.com/macbreak.
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.560]   It's time for my jingle.
[01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:50.960]   Where's my jingle?
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:52.560]   Where's my jingle when I need it?
[01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:54.120]   I guess I don't get a jingle today.
[01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:55.800]   First, let me give you the story.
[01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:58.120]   Just broke on in gadget.
[01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:00.720]   Apple has rejected Tweety, you know, I love Tweety.
[01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:03.480]   I use Tweety to Twitter from the iPhone.
[01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:06.280]   I think the universe has kind of converged
[01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:10.360]   on this as the best iPhone application for Twitter.
[01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:12.880]   1.3 has been waiting in the wings.
[01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:15.600]   Apple has now rejected the update.
[01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:20.600]   Get this, because it has a Twitter search trend view,
[01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:22.440]   which is one of the reasons I like it.
[01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:23.400]   You press, by the way, Andy,
[01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:26.120]   I can, you're featured in this illustration.
[01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:29.280]   One of your tweets is,
[01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:32.920]   I see your smiling face there on the Tweety screen.
[01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:34.640]   So this Tweety trends thing is great.
[01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:35.640]   I press this button all the time
[01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:38.320]   to see what people are talking about on Twitter.
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:39.600]   There's a problem.
[01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:42.360]   Sometimes people say bad words on Twitter.
[01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:46.920]   So the Tweety trend occasionally will show a bad word.
[01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:51.160]   Apple has decided in its infinite wisdom
[01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:53.520]   that this bad word that it's showing
[01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:58.160]   is somehow a flaw in Tweety
[01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:01.200]   and have banned it for offensive language.
[01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:04.120]   Now I look right now on the bad words
[01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:06.480]   and Chuck Norris and Watchmen and E-Tech
[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:08.960]   and South by Southwestern on the top four.
[01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:10.000]   I don't see any bad words,
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:11.040]   but you don't, you could imagine.
[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:13.080]   It's not fairly, it's fairly frequently
[01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:15.520]   that bad words will trend up,
[01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:17.080]   a hashtag or something.
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:21.200]   But it's kind of hard to believe that Apple would reject it.
[01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:24.480]   Not because of a bad word written into the program,
[01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:25.640]   but because the program itself
[01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:27.480]   would expose bad words used on Twitter.
[01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:29.440]   That's going just a little bit far.
[01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:34.480]   I always wanted to know exactly how they go through
[01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:35.440]   all these apps.
[01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:37.720]   I'm wondering if they don't actually just subcontract it
[01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:38.720]   out to somebody who's just given them.
[01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:41.120]   They saw it and said, "Oh, it's a bad word."
[01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:42.560]   Yeah, I mean, it's sort of like,
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:43.920]   do they just simply have a clipboard
[01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:45.560]   of just automatic rejections
[01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:47.320]   and they're not here to actually apply thought
[01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:50.280]   because they are subcontractors doing a job for Apple
[01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:51.640]   and Apple has given them guidelines.
[01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:53.200]   The big problem is there's no,
[01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:55.480]   is there a clear appeal process for this?
[01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:58.760]   You know, what do you do if you get rejected, you know?
[01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:00.280]   Anyway, we love Tweety.
[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:02.240]   I hope that was my pick,
[01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:05.040]   I think some time ago for Twitter application,
[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:07.760]   I hope they can get 1.3 out.
[01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:10.200]   I just want to say Alex, I agree with you,
[01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:11.800]   but the one thing I want to point out is
[01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:14.040]   you've seen the kind of email we get.
[01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:16.120]   If we say the word nude,
[01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:16.960]   I know.
[01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:19.480]   Hundreds of people threaten us and say we're going to hell
[01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:22.280]   and pitchfork should be put in our bodies.
[01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:24.120]   I mean, there are all kinds of fanatics out there
[01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:25.720]   so I can understand, you know,
[01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:28.120]   maybe Apple's trying to insulate themselves from this
[01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:31.480]   because, you know, sometimes, you know,
[01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:34.200]   it seems to me like if we had Justine on here
[01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:35.960]   wearing a burka somebody would complain.
[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:37.720]   (laughs)
[01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:39.520]   They'd be complaining to bring a burka
[01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:40.800]   but that's pretty awesome.
[01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:41.640]   Yeah.
[01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:43.520]   Well, I was thinking about it for a minute.
[01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:44.920]   So maybe Justine and a burka would be
[01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:45.760]   a bit of a bit of a--
[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:48.640]   I could see the skin around her nose too much flesh.
[01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:49.720]   It's still hot.
[01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:51.280]   (laughs)
[01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:53.040]   It's still pretty hot though.
[01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:53.800]   So here's my pick.
[01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:56.680]   This is a freebie and I found it,
[01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:57.720]   thanks to Friend Feed.
[01:22:57.720 --> 01:22:59.240]   Friend Feed has rooms now
[01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:01.320]   and one of their rooms is an Apple room
[01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:02.160]   and somebody said,
[01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:03.480]   "All right, I'm buying a new Mac, my first Mac.
[01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:04.840]   "What application should I have?"
[01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:07.680]   And I always read those conversations
[01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:08.520]   'cause I'm always interested
[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:10.440]   well what's some cool applications
[01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:11.280]   that I don't know about.
[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:14.280]   You know, you get the usual suspects
[01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:15.600]   but this one I'd never heard of,
[01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:18.280]   it's called App Trap.
[01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:19.400]   Ever hear this one?
[01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:21.760]   It solves kind of a problem.
[01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:25.560]   It's an un-installer but done right.
[01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:26.840]   It's free, it's open source.
[01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:28.480]   You download it from the website
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:31.840]   which is kind of a weird URL, it's a Swedish URL
[01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:34.560]   and I'm not gonna have to refer you to the show notes
[01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:35.720]   'cause I don't even, I can't,
[01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:37.080]   it's such a weird URL.
[01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:38.200]   I can't even pronounce it.
[01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:42.200]   It looks like Konstok van Legasaka.se.
[01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:46.360]   But the good news is you can Google APP-TRAP
[01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:48.200]   and you'll find another word you're not supposed to say,
[01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:49.040]   Leo.
[01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:50.480]   Oh my God, what have I said?
[01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:51.480]   Ups, cut off.
[01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:54.640]   That's a nice thing to say to your friend sister.
[01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:55.880]   (laughing)
[01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:56.720]   I probably did.
[01:23:56.720 --> 01:23:57.840]   I'm probably just in my new problem.
[01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:01.040]   What it does is it adds a very, very simple
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:02.400]   system preference pane.
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:03.880]   There's only a couple of settings.
[01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:05.920]   One is to start it, one is to stop it
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:09.240]   and one is to automatically start it on login.
[01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:11.080]   Here's what it does, it's so cool.
[01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:14.120]   When you drag an application to the trash
[01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:17.160]   and application to the trash and then you say empty trash,
[01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:21.200]   APP-TRAP will say, ah, well you are emptying
[01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:26.680]   an application, would you like me to get rid of
[01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:30.400]   the rest of the files that belong to that application?
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:34.520]   So it goes out and it searches for all the other stuff
[01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:36.480]   that that application might have installed,
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:38.600]   keeps track of it and deletes it
[01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:39.880]   when you delete the application.
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:42.920]   One of the beauties of the Mac in the early days was
[01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:44.920]   an application just sat in its own folder.
[01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:46.440]   If you wanted the unlike Windows,
[01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:47.880]   if you wanted to uninstall an application,
[01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:50.520]   you drag that folder to the trash and you're done.
[01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:52.480]   Well, nowadays in the OS 10 days,
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:56.160]   unfortunately applications do tend to install stuff
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:57.480]   into system folders and so forth.
[01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:00.440]   APP-TRAP does a very nice job of finding it
[01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:02.560]   and deleting it all.
[01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:03.880]   And it's, there's another one.
[01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:06.440]   I want to use with that Leo called APP-Zapper
[01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:07.800]   'cause I found that none of these
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:09.200]   actually work on everything.
[01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:12.000]   No, APP-Zapper is not free though, it's commercial.
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.640]   And all the people like APP-Zapper.
[01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:14.480]   Yeah.
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:15.480]   If you get two or three of them together,
[01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:17.000]   you can probably get everything.
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.280]   I don't know, I'd hate for them to fight over it.
[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:22.040]   By the way, somebody tells me that that word,
[01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:28.240]   Kunstok-Valingasaka means art and normal things in Swedish.
[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:30.240]   Sure it does.
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:31.960]   (laughing)
[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:33.680]   It makes it even doubly filthy.
[01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:35.840]   (laughing)
[01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:38.240]   Yes, but he is in Martian.
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:39.840]   In Martian, it means.
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:41.440]   (laughing)
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:43.880]   So APP-Zapper, yes, is another very good choice,
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:44.720]   but not free.
[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:45.560]   This one is absolutely free.
[01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:47.360]   APP-TRAP, I tried it on a few applications
[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:49.200]   at a very nice job, but you're right.
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:51.720]   You know, probably nothing does a perfect job.
[01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:53.400]   So having a couple of them is a good idea.
[01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:55.760]   Well, and I think that a lot of applications,
[01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:57.640]   and I think that I almost think this should be
[01:25:57.640 --> 01:25:59.000]   a standard or consider it a standard,
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:00.840]   a lot of applications will come with an uninstaller
[01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:02.040]   and I keep those around.
[01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:03.800]   A lot of them, we forget what they come.
[01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:05.800]   You know, you get it and you throw it onto your computer
[01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:08.360]   and you forget, oh, there was this little icon over there
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:09.280]   that said uninstaller,
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:11.720]   'cause that is gonna be your best bet
[01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:13.080]   to remove everything.
[01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:15.040]   It's designed for the application.
[01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:17.440]   And so when you see that,
[01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:19.600]   I have a little folder in my documents folder
[01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:22.080]   that all of it is, the uninstallers and the uninstallers,
[01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:23.320]   and I just throw them in there.
[01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:26.200]   And I don't, rather than having to go back and look for it,
[01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:28.560]   I just kind of throw, they're very small
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:31.200]   and you can always just simply click on those
[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:33.200]   for the applications that come with those
[01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:34.960]   and really people should always.
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:37.520]   In a way, this might be a place that Windows has an advantage
[01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:40.960]   because from day one, Windows did all sorts of nasty things
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:42.520]   to a lot of different locations.
[01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:45.480]   So it was kind of de-rigger that a Windows application
[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:48.040]   would come with an uninstaller, they almost all do.
[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:49.960]   And when you go to the uninstall,
[01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:51.480]   the add/remove programs and Windows,
[01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:52.360]   that's really all you're doing
[01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:54.160]   is you're invoking the uninstaller.
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:57.520]   So Windows does it, kind of saves it for you automatically
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:26:59.840]   as part of the installation process, 'cause they had to.
[01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:01.680]   We never had to before, so now we have to do
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:04.320]   all these third party solutions on the Macintosh.
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:05.760]   And people have mentioned AppZapper,
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:08.040]   there's also CleanApp, AppDelete,
[01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:10.480]   there are a few of these that do the same thing.
[01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:11.920]   But I-- - I want them all.
[01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:13.880]   - Yeah, I guess it would be all right to have them all.
[01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:16.760]   You just have to run them sequentially.
[01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:18.560]   Careful not to run them all at once.
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:20.320]   - Well, no, see what you do is you make copies
[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:23.200]   of everything and then you drag each one individually
[01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:25.600]   to each of them, I think.
[01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:27.000]   That's what happens, and that's actually
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:30.120]   what happens is kind of a problem on the Windows side
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:34.400]   is that you'll get the uninstaller makes a log
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:36.280]   which the uninstaller uses to remove stuff,
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:38.720]   but if anything is damaged, it gets messed up
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:40.800]   and you can't uninstall at all.
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:43.640]   And so frequently, I tell people on the radio show,
[01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:45.720]   yeah, you have to reinstall the application
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:47.040]   in order to uninstall it.
[01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:50.880]   That makes sense, that's Windows, right there.
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:52.160]   That says it all.
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:53.720]   You gotta reinstall that install.
[01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:56.440]   Hey everybody, thank you all for being here.
[01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:58.120]   This has been a fun show.
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:27:59.600]   I hope you got to watch the video
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:02.120]   'cause you can see our shining faces here
[01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:03.920]   on our Skypeosaurus.
[01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:06.040]   If not, tune in next Tuesday at 11 a.m.
[01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:09.120]   Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern time, Mac break weekly.
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:11.160]   Of course, you subscribed to the show
[01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:12.280]   and now that we've got video,
[01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:14.520]   we'll probably get to work on making a video version
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:16.960]   of the show available, but you can certainly get the audio
[01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:20.240]   at our website, twit.tv.
[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:23.600]   But if you wanna get it every day, every week automatically,
[01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:25.640]   just subscribe to it and iTunes.
[01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:27.800]   If you do a search for Mac break weekly,
[01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:28.840]   actually search for Mac break
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:30.400]   'cause there's a whole bunch of shows,
[01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:33.400]   including many of Alex's shows named Mac break.
[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:36.240]   And those are mostly video on the iTunes store,
[01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:37.760]   you'll find it.
[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:39.600]   Alex Lindsey is at pixelcore.com.
[01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:42.480]   Pixelcore.tv is the site for the podcasts.
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:43.640]   And we've got--
[01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:47.160]   - By the way, last week we got a Mac break dev running again.
[01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:48.000]   - Yay.
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.280]   - And now, Sagoion is sharing his love.
[01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:51.760]   So if you wanna see how to automate stuff,
[01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:54.800]   you definitely wanna check out Mac break dev
[01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:57.200]   in the iTunes store or on pixelcore.tv.
[01:28:57.200 --> 01:28:58.040]   - Thank you, Alex.
[01:28:58.040 --> 01:28:58.960]   Great to talk to you.
[01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:02.400]   - Scott Born Millionaire can be seen
[01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:04.400]   in better movie theaters everywhere.
[01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:06.000]   Scott Born is the--
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.680]   - What a player, what a player.
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:10.200]   - He's the host in the style of the show.
[01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:11.840]   Just say Jai Ho for us, will you?
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:12.680]   Jai Ho.
[01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:13.520]   - Jai.
[01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:16.960]   - Scottborn.com is at the best place now to go.
[01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:18.280]   Scottborn.com.
[01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:20.600]   - The collector of all the things.
[01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:22.080]   - Or Scott Born on Twitter.
[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:23.360]   - Very good.
[01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:26.240]   - Andy Inaco is just Inaco on Twitter.
[01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:29.200]   - He's the Inaco.
[01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:33.000]   - Yes, I'm very well insulated against people pretending
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.080]   to be me because they can't spell my last name.
[01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:36.840]   (laughing)
[01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:39.920]   So I have no need to ever become the real Andy Inaco.
[01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:42.120]   - He's also a writer for the Chicago Sun Times
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:44.880]   and the host at this celestial waste of bandwidth,
[01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:46.800]   C-W-O-B.com.
[01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:49.720]   Thanks Andy, thanks Scott, thanks Alex.
[01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:51.600]   Another Mac break is broke.
[01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:54.180]   (upbeat music)
[01:29:54.180 --> 01:29:56.760]   (upbeat music)
[01:29:56.760 --> 01:29:59.340]   (upbeat music)
[01:29:59.340 --> 01:30:01.920]   (upbeat music)
[01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:04.600]   (upbeat music)
[01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:07.280]   (upbeat music)
[01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:09.860]   (upbeat music)
[01:30:09.860 --> 01:30:12.440]   (upbeat music)
