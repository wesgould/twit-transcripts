[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, our weekly look at the
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   news and views in the Mac world joining me right now.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Scott Born from iLifeZone, Merlin Man from 43Folders.com.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   I'm Leo LaPorte and we're ringing up anand right now from anand tech.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   It's good to see you guys once again.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Glad to be here.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Alex is taking the day off.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Alex has taken the day off.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   I think he's in Detroit.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   He's in the Moda City.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   So he gets around.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   So we'll get him back next week.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   The reason we're calling anand right now is we want to talk to him
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   about a recent article in anand tech.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Later this year, Intel's going to release a new processor,
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Clovertown.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   It's a Xeon Core, but it's quad core.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   That is four processors in one die.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   And this is the thing that's most interesting.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   It will be pin compatible.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Pin compatible with the current Core 2 chips.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Anand runs one of the greatest enthusiast sites out there.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   We've loved for a long time had you on the screensavers before.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   You must have had a couple of Clovertowns just lying around.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Yeah, we kind of, every now and then we get that kind of stuff laying around.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   It's not out yet.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   No, no, not yet.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   It'll be out Q4 is officially all Intel saying.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   So you have a way ahead of time.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Yeah, we actually had, we were playing with quad core back in June.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   So it's been ready for a very long time.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   It's just that now that we're getting closer to launch,
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   we're able to talk about it a little more.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   It's a little bit, I have to say, it's a little bit unusual for Intel
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   to do such a big ship upgrade and make it pin compatible.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   It usually seems like they want you to buy a new motherboard
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   if you're going to do something like this.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Yeah, that's definitely true on the desktop side.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   On the server side, the enterprise guys don't always go for that.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Interesting.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   So you'll see, it's obviously a big selling point for a lot of AMD platforms in the past.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   And it just, the time wouldn't work out and that on top of the fact
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   that a lot of the enterprise guys aren't okay with revamping their designs.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Right.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   It's what the market will bear.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   What the market will bear, I guess.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   So the Clovertown in each die has four CPUs.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   It's like a core two quad.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   So the way it's actually organized is it's two, if you look at it,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   if you take a single woodcrash, if you put two woodcrash die on the same package,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   that's what a Clovertown is.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Wow.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   And that means each of the two has its own dedicated cache and so forth.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Yes, yeah, it's literally like you took two woodcrash and put them on the same package.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   So the Mac Pro that they're shipping right now has two woodcrash, which is essentially a quad.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   You thought, let's see what happens if we drop a Clovertown into a Mac Pro.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Well, yeah, because that's, you know, in the past one of the problems with kind of upgrading any of the Macs
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   is that not enough people really sell the processor upgrades and the few people that do those things are super expensive.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Well, they offer a daughter board. I mean, it's rare that you could just plug it right in.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Yeah, so, you know, we have this Intel-based Mac and that's one of the major benefits of a PC in that you can go to like a new ag or someplace like that
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   and get a mass-produced processor that's fairly cheap whenever you want to upgrade.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   And so, hey, I wanted to test to see if we could just drop in any woodcrash in there and it worked just fine.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   And then the more interesting thing is, well, when Quad-Core comes out, if you buy a Mac Pro today,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   you can be sorry that you didn't wait the extra whatever through your four months.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   And the answer is no. You can, it looks like you can just drop one in.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   I have to tell you, after reading your article, I immediately bought a Mac Pro because that was kind of, that was, well, seriously, that was a selling point.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   It's like, well, great. If I ever need more headroom, I can get it.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   So you dropped them in and OS, you didn't have to modify OS X or anything.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   It just saw all eight processors?
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Yep. OS X is obviously was designed from the ground up to be a multiprocessor aware OS.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   It detected them, if you saw the screenshots in the article, it detected them as Core 2 Duo processors, but all eight cores worked.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   I ran benchmarks, I can't talk about performance, but it was definitely faster.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   As one would expect, in fact, you said you had a hard time maxing the things out.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Yeah, I mean, if you run something that is heavily multi-threaded and very CPU intensive,
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   so things like 3D Studio Max under Windows or Cinebench, any of those kinds of things,
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   you've got no problems stressing all eight cores and you'll see a noticeable performance increase.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   But any of our kind of...
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Real world.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Yeah, and the thing is, if your real world applications happen to be very well multi-threaded
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   and very processor intensive, then it's not a problem.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   The fact of the matter is that our Mac benchmarking suite is just very early on in its progression.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Well, a lot of the people who use Pro apps on the Mac will have, in fact, very highly threaded, very processor intensive apps.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   So I think that that makes sense. It seems like something that would be very valuable.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   One thing you point out is that the clock speed right now in Clovertown is a little lower than the fastest clock speeds on the wood crest.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Yeah, and it's been reported online, for example, if you look at the desktop cores,
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   it's looking like 2.660 to your hearth will be the fastest quad core Kent field,
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   whereas the fastest Core 2 Duo, rather than 2.93 right now.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   So you're looking at basically one clock speed down from the Macs, maybe two, it depends.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   And so there is going to be a trade-off. If you don't have a lot of very, very CPU intensive applications that you're running constantly,
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   you may actually be better off getting a pair of faster woodcrests rather than a pair of slower Clovertown.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   That's one we'll just have to wait and see when you get your benchmarks out and people try this.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   And now that you've done it, I'm sure others will.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Although, there are not as many people who have access to these chips.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   I mean, you guys seem to have some very good access to Intel stuff.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Yeah, you'll probably start seeing them. I know before Core 2 Duo launched, you can actually buy some on eBay.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   So I wouldn't be too surprised to see some of these things start appearing on eBay as well.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   I figure by this time next year, I'll have upgraded the Mac Pro to Clovertown.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   And I'll have eight processors, and I can really boast.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Yeah, I'm not sure what Apple strategy is going to be, because it's, like I said,
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   it's not something that you can easily quantify in terms of performance.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   Right. I think it just reassures people that there's somewhere to go.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   That's very exciting.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   You definitely do.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   One thing we noticed, though, was that you definitely start to run into I/O bottlenecks once you have eight cores.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Sure.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Any kind of multitasking you're doing with it.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   Obviously, our test bed only had a single SATA drive.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   So that's one area where RAID would definitely benefit.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   And a good RAID, not a BIOS RAID, but some real hardware RAID.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Well, I thank you for your time, Anand. It's great to talk to you again.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   And Anand Tech is, of course, a place to go.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   Your source for hardware analysis and news, and I'm glad to see you doing more Mac news.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   That's great.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Thank you, sir. It's good talking to you, isn't it?
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Great to talk to you. Take care, Anand.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   You too.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Thanks. Bye-bye.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   What do you think, guys?
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   You know, I wasn't joking.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   That was the thing that put me over the top and buying a Mac Pro.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   Maybe that's kind of nutty on my part, but it was just nice.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   It kind of reassuring.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   You wasn't my recommendation, Leo, that you relied on to buy the Mac Pro?
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   Well, that too.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   No, I think you told me that I didn't need more than an iMac, right?
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   No, I'm the one that said you needed the Mac Pro.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Alex is the one that said you needed the iMac.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   I just need bragging rights, and now I got it.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   And if anybody...
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   I'm glad to see that you're going to have eight processors,
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   and that's really going to make text edits fly for you.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   Yeah, there's really no advantage.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   Although, if you use make, and you do a little -f9,
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   boy, those things compile fast.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   Well, I'm sitting here looking at this screenshot.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   It looks like he took this right out of activity monitor,
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   looking at all these.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   And boy, I'm just thinking FFmpegX.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   So it seems like you're ripping capabilities can potentially go through the roof.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Well, but as he pointed out where you start to really see it now,
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   you're going to see the bottlenecks in terms of throughput on the hard drive,
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   throughput from the optical drives, even probably memory bottlenecks as well.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   You would ask him about the fact that OS 10 seems like straight out of the box
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   is ready for this.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   I mean, do you have a sense of how much this would affect other components?
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Is this going to put any kind of an extra drag on other pieces?
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   I mean, is this a lot of heat?
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   Well, that's one of the reasons these are slower clock speeds.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   I mean, these chips are a lot cooler.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   One of the reasons actually I upgraded the Mac Pro is because my dual G5,
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   you can hear it.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   You can probably hear it.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   It's labor.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   And the thing that has what, nine fans in it?
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   And on a hot day, it gets pretty loud in here.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   And so for a studio, I'm sure Scott, you probably have the same reasons for a studio,
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   a cooler, quieter machine is very desirable.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   Now, yeah, you go, "Wait, wait, core," suddenly you might lose all the advantage you had.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   I don't know.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   We switched to MacBook Pros for studio stuff, and they're just plenty fast enough.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   And they're quiet.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Though they're whisper quiet.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   Right, because they're laptops, yeah.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   Yeah, I don't hear anything from my MacBook Pro,
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   despite all the rumors of wines and moving and everything else.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   Mine is quiet, and that's exactly what we use.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   And I do think this is very interesting, but, you know,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   faster computers make for lazy programmers, Leo.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   That's why it's kind of a vicious circle is, you know, you get more RAM, more hard drive
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   space, more processor.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   Eventually, you get no gain because everybody's just, you know, right in sloppy.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   I want to predict that within six months you're going to need these, all eight of these.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   Of course.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   Just to run word.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   That's my prediction.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   I used to write 6502 code into 4K a space.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   We do a system walkthrough, and you had to justify every line.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   And so now the guy's, he says, "Oh, the eight-year-olds got four gigs.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   Don't worry about it."
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   That's true.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   That's true.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   Our good friend, Steve Gibson, still writes an assembler language,
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   and this stuff is like less than 100K.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   I don't know why.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   He doesn't have to.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   Because it's cool.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   Because he can.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   So we talked, and we've talked now, I think this will be the third Mac break weekly in a
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   row.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   We've talked about the iPod phone.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   The Economist had a very interesting article this week talking about the, and pretty much
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   echoing what we've said along the difficulty in getting into the phone business.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   But they had an interesting thought that maybe Apple could become an MVNO.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   What's that, Merlin?
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   Yeah, that's a new term to me.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   But it's a, let's say, in this economist article, they're saying that this is basically
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   the way where you, to quote them, you're leasing network capacity.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   So you're kind of going to be your own provider.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   Disney did this, I think they are doing it right now.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   That's right.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   They said they're doing a free SPN and it has not been a breakaway success.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   But you know, it's so funny.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   I mean, like with the iPods, you know, you can go out and buy a little commodity iPod
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   for, gosh, I don't know, they're going to be given away in Cheerios boxes pretty soon.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   And, and obviously you have the iTunes offering that's associated with that that works so well
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   with it.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   It's just interesting to think about the way the model seems to work right now is you've
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   got a provider like Sprint or Verizon, whoever.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   And in some cases, they're just giving these phones away.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   And so how do you, how do you change the equation for that?
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   Is, is Steve going to be willing to partner up with, with some outside company and trust
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   that?
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   It seems like Apple's got a couple of choices.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   Either they charge 800 bucks for the phone, which is often what you would pay if you
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   bought a phone without getting a wireless plan.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   Does he, does he, you know, bite the bullet and allow Motorola or somebody else to kind
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   of dictate what that phone looks like and get a rocker?
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   Or does he go to a phone company, a Sprint or a singular, a T-Mobile and say, okay,
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   we'll work with you, but, you know, you got to give us final say.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   Or is there a fourth option?
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   Maybe, you know, hey, he's the number one Disney shareholder.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   He certainly has a close up on what Disney is doing as a MVNO.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   Maybe he'll, he'll choose that.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   Scott Blan.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   I don't, I don't see them, I don't see them partnering with somebody externally.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   I can't see it.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   I can't see it.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   I can't see it.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   Because what that means is, I mean, that's along the lines of, again, let's go back to
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   it.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.400]   You know, they're selling these, you know, the DRM files, the AC files, but you can put
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:14.400]   MP3s on there.
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.400]   Dido here.
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.840]   They don't want anybody to say, well, you can't buy an iPhone because you have a contract
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.000]   with Verizon or whatever.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.480]   Scott, you say they have to do it because you want them to do it.
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:24.640]   I really want it.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:26.000]   And that's simply enough.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.200]   And yes, I would pay $800.
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.200]   You know what?
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.200]   So what I?
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.200]   Because here's the deal.
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:35.120]   I've got, you know, you and I sat next to each other during the keynote at Macworld
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:40.520]   Leo and I was trying to figure out how to use my, my trio 650 to take a picture of
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:41.520]   us.
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.320]   And I still can't make that thing sink to my Mac properly.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:49.520]   No matter what I do, I am sick to death of not being able to talk to my computer with
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:50.680]   my cell phone.
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:52.480]   So yes, I would pay 800.
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.480]   Don't tell Steve Jobs.
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:54.480]   I would pay 1,800.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.480]   No.
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.880]   If it really, I would, I would in a heart.
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.040]   But they really were.
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.800]   Are there a lot of people like you?
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:01.800]   No.
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:02.640]   Thank God.
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:10.240]   But there probably are a lot of pretty serious Mac users who would pay, you know, full, you
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:13.920]   know, I bought a chocolate for four or 500 bucks for, you know, I mean, here's the way
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:14.920]   it works.
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.120]   You have this already happening in lots of places.
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:21.320]   I'm involved in an internet company that spells bandwidth that they lease from phone
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:22.320]   carriers.
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.720]   This is a fairly common practice.
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:28.520]   I can see Apple basically not building the network because we all agree that that's a
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.480]   really rough piece of this pie.
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:34.400]   But they could build the phone and they could build the add-on service, simply lease the
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:39.080]   network, provide a piece of the action to the company that's the backbone.
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.880]   I see that as actually doable.
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:45.000]   I'm curious though, for you guys, it sounds like you both are pretty excited, Scott in
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.200]   particular about how to do it.
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.920]   So what's the, is it syncing?
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:49.920]   Is syncing the killer feature?
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:51.160]   Sounds like Scott.
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.160]   That's what he wants.
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.680]   But I mean, I guess when you say what constitutes an iPhone for you.
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:56.960]   So for me, that would be syncing.
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:01.480]   That would be an ability to use Sailing Clicker, all the stuff that I see out there that people
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.520]   with Erickson's can do.
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.960]   And with Sprint, I'm hobbled to a very minor subset of what you can do with things like
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:07.960]   Bluetooth.
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:08.960]   So I guess, are you saying syncing?
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.680]   You're saying full Bluetooth capabilities?
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:12.520]   When you say iPhone, what does that mean to you?
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:18.040]   That means a good point because, Scott, a lot of what, let's just say if we get the
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:22.280]   syncing software working, I use Sailing Clicker on my Windows Mobile 5 device.
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.760]   It works fine.
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.040]   The syncing kind of works.
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.600]   I mean, it works pretty well using a missing sync.
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.480]   There's got to be more to it than that.
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.840]   Those things are just little fixes.
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:33.840]   I agree.
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:38.240]   I definitely am very into trying to find ways to sync, not because of the syncing itself,
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:43.560]   but because I want all the great functionality that makes me a Mac user available to me on
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:44.560]   my mobile device.
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:45.560]   A more Mac-ish phone?
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.440]   Yeah, I want everything Mac.
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.040]   And here's what I know about Apple.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:53.880]   Despite the fact that they make me angry sometimes, I love the way that they end up doing things.
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:57.040]   The iTunes Store is a great example.
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:01.560]   Looking at the iPod and the iTunes Store, those are great successes because Apple figures
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:02.760]   out how to make it work.
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:06.440]   I can guarantee you if they ever did a phone, and we don't know that they will, but if they
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:11.920]   ever did, it would just be as successful as the iPod and the iTunes Store because they'd
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:15.520]   find some way to make that value at work.
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:18.760]   And then you can actually really enjoy your calendar program and all that.
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:21.000]   To me, it starts with the iPod.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.760]   The iPod is the device.
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:26.280]   From Apple's point of view, it's the device.
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:29.600]   To me, people are saying what people want.
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.640]   What I want is an iPod with phone capabilities.
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.800]   It starts with the iPod.
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:35.800]   Don't you think, Merlin?
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.240]   Yeah, I do think that.
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.680]   I mean, one interesting way to think of this.
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:45.280]   I haven't made a big deal about this because I'm still getting my C-legs, but I've got a
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.280]   trio.
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:47.880]   I've got a trio 700, Palm.
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:52.520]   I'm really still getting my C-legs with all the functionality of it.
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:57.400]   Versus other Sprint phones I've used, I've used probably six different Sprint phones now.
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.160]   This is far and away the best experience.
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.800]   It's still not up to the point of using the little clicker wheel on my iPod.
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.400]   There's still such a dis...
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:07.800]   Don't get me started on Sprint and how disjointed all their little Java apps are and they don't
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:09.320]   talk to each other.
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:10.600]   The thing is I've been evaluating these.
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:14.800]   A lot of people for the Sprint and Basseter program, when you get these free phones.
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:18.240]   And hang up for all of these things is you've got these little weird functional alcoves
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:21.200]   that you have to enter into this little area to do a thing.
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.840]   And everyone is different.
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:27.560]   And I can't bring there's no way to bring my contacts in because I'm on a Mac.
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:31.040]   So I mean, I have 700, actually right now I've got about close to 1000 contacts I'd
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:32.040]   love to have in there.
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:36.880]   I've been able to sync my address book, no problem at all, to Windows Mobile 5.
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.360]   Well no, with the trio, yes.
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:42.480]   But right now I'm looking at this, what is it, the LG, Lusic.
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:46.760]   And it's a great little phone, it's a great size, it's as music player phones go I think
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:49.560]   it's pretty good so far in the week I've been using it.
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.720]   But I mean, but here's I think what we're...
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:55.640]   That the heart of it is like Scott said we want a Mac experience, we want an Apple experience.
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:59.440]   And so I want the whole interface for this thing to work together and be integrated.
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:02.840]   For me to like little things like having more of a sense of state.
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:07.040]   You know, after the multi-finder we get used to the idea that you're in an application,
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:10.040]   you go somewhere and when you come back it remembers what you were doing, right?
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.840]   That seems like the most obvious thing in the world.
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.800]   If I want to change to a different app on my trio, I got to go back and start over.
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:16.480]   If I want to copy something and paste it.
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:20.320]   And so really, I mean like to me one thing they could do if they were going to do a phone
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:24.360]   is to add something like a slightly finder like capability that has a sense of state
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:25.360]   of where you...
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:27.080]   I'm going to go once to farther.
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:31.000]   I think really what you're hearing, what I'm hearing is we're just dissatisfied with
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.440]   the way cell phones are right now.
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:36.680]   We want somebody to do a better cell phone and it just seems like Apple should be able
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:37.920]   to do a better cell phone.
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:38.920]   Amen.
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:39.920]   I mean that's really it, right?
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.920]   Cell phone operating systems are crap.
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:43.920]   Cell phones suck.
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:48.240]   Well, you know, every time I use a cell phone, I see it as a very costly collection of business
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.920]   relationships that I'm paying for.
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.960]   I see a lot of business development happening.
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:55.760]   I see something that was relatively easy to build and relatively easy to market, but
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.920]   it's not user, it's not user centered in any way.
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:00.440]   Yeah, the Biz Dev phone.
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.800]   No, you hit the nail on the head there.
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:08.240]   Speaking of business, some good business being done in the iTunes movie store, you know,
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:13.520]   I didn't notice this, but they changed the name of iTunes music store to just the iTunes
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:17.760]   store to accommodate the fact that they're selling movies and a lot of movies.
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:22.760]   125,000 downloads worth a million dollars in the first week.
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:27.920]   Yeah, I guess that was a real smart decision by all those other studios to sit it out,
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:28.920]   Leo.
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.680]   They're really making their board members happy.
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:33.520]   Hey, stockholders, we don't want any of that million dollars.
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:34.520]   No.
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:38.200]   Well, I guess the question is, is that number going to go up or down in week two?
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:43.160]   It's probably going to stabilize, but then I see gradually going up as people get into
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.560]   adopting this new technology.
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:48.080]   Now, as you know, I got to tell you, I still stick by my original prediction.
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.280]   It's kind of a yawn for me personally.
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:54.880]   The price point is simply too high to make me want to do it, but I see a lot of hands.
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.440]   Has anybody bought any movies yet?
[00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:02.640]   I bought, I kind of buy so much stuff on the iTunes store.
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:03.640]   It's ridiculous.
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.560]   I don't think I bought any movies yet.
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:07.320]   I happen buying TV shows.
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:10.960]   I mean, I guess I just curious Scott a little bit because I see this as being very much for
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.800]   people like me, or it's an impulse buy.
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:17.600]   I mean, again, think about, again, for me, this keeps coming down to these decision-making
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:18.600]   buying points.
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:22.280]   And one of those is sitting in the airport on Wi-Fi and you got 45 minutes to your flight
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:23.280]   starts.
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:25.600]   And I don't know if that's enough time to download a whole movie, but for me, grabbing
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:31.360]   that content and having it on the go is worth that cash, you know, and to not have to deal
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:34.680]   with hand-break or whatever it is to make that happen.
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:39.120]   I don't know if it's going to, I'm terrible at these kinds of predictions, but I suspect
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.120]   it'll level out.
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:43.560]   And then as people's comfort level with it gets more familiar and is, you know, and
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:44.560]   who knows?
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:48.400]   Maybe in the inside of a Mountain Dew cap, you know, next week you'll have a free download.
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.600]   Well, you know, that's all it is.
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.600]   It's all this stuff.
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:51.960]   What did Napster ultimately teach us?
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:56.320]   It taught us that once you get in people into the habit of being able to have things as soon
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:00.240]   as they want it, the business model will happen around that habit.
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:05.080]   And as much as all those companies, you know, moaned about, you know, how that was going
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:08.960]   to be the end of the world, you know, we're right back to Sony and the VCR in the 70s,
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:12.320]   you know, it's, you know, Disney and the VCR in the 70s.
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.960]   But now that's the single biggest source of income for these companies.
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.840]   So, you know, they eventually find a way to make money off of it.
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.760]   And they eventually find a price point that works for a while.
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:24.040]   And I think that's going to happen in the next probably six months to a year.
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:26.720]   Scott, you haven't bought anything on there and don't intend to.
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:30.600]   I, you know, I buy lots of stuff at the iTunes store, just no movies.
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:34.640]   I downloaded my free copy of the Blade Television Pilot.
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:35.920]   Oh, what do you think?
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.800]   I thought it was very interesting and very fun.
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:38.800]   But, you know, here's the thing, Leo.
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:46.080]   I've got like a 50 inch high definition TV connected to a $10,000 THX certified receiver.
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:48.560]   I'm not going to watch any movies on my MacBook Pro.
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:49.560]   Thank you.
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:52.840]   You might want to give out your address, Scott, just leave here for people.
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.080]   That way they won't have to Google you.
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.080]   Yeah.
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.080]   How do we get that?
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:57.080]   I don't.
[00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:58.640]   I don't have a tent that I have.
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:04.760]   I have basically a room full of pit bulls and some rusty barbed wire and a very old transistor
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:05.760]   radio.
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:06.760]   That's all I've got.
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:11.760]   I'm actually in all seriousness, not because I'm trying to avoid burglary like like Mr.
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:12.960]   Hotdog's ladies here.
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:19.760]   And we'll be giving out his address later on unless he says the special word.
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:20.760]   Banana.
[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:22.840]   There is a safe word is banana.
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.480]   Our safe word for the show is banana.
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:27.880]   If you should hear any host yell banana at any time, you are just.
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.920]   Did you miss something really good after that?
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:33.880]   Immediately cease listening for the next 10 seconds.
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:34.880]   Or what?
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:35.880]   What should they do if they hear the same?
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:36.880]   I got you off, Scott.
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:38.880]   You've got a big STV.
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:43.160]   And you were saying you got a big STV.
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:46.520]   Maybe you should just leave a dolly by it to make it easier for people to carry it out.
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:47.520]   No.
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:48.920]   But you get lots of pixelation.
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.520]   It just looks like crap.
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:55.680]   And I just would rather, you know, I can walk eight steps from I was on to him the other
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:56.680]   day talking about this.
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:02.000]   I can walk eight steps from my barco lounger and drop a DVD that I got from Netflix for
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   the equivalent of about a buck into my $80.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.560]   I don't think it's usually exclusive though.
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:07.560]   I don't either.
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:08.560]   I totally know.
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:09.560]   You're either.
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:10.560]   I totally know.
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:11.560]   You're either unusual, Scott, because you have a very high quality components.
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:12.560]   I don't.
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:13.560]   I don't think it's mutually exclusive.
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:14.560]   I download TV shows.
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:15.560]   I download movies.
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:16.560]   I also watch.
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:19.280]   I mean, I have a five disc Netflix subscription and I still download this stuff.
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:25.120]   I mean, I've got box sets of music, but that doesn't stop me from buying a Tamiynet cassette
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.120]   when I'm on a road trip.
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.960]   I just want something to listen to.
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:29.200]   I think it's very interesting.
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:33.560]   And I think younger people in particular who have maybe not had the experience that I have
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:37.920]   of, you know, coming up with media to put in their hands will be more inclined to do
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:38.920]   it.
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:39.920]   Believe me, I'm not dissing it.
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:44.080]   I think it's very cool because it really says two to three, four, five years from now
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.080]   things will change.
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:47.080]   And that's when I'll probably get excited.
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:50.200]   Just at this price point, I'm not probably going to be a player.
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.680]   I'm going to stick with what I got.
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:52.680]   And, you know, I'm old.
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:53.960]   I'm supposed to do things that way.
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:57.560]   So with that nice AV setup, do you have a Sonos?
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:58.560]   No, I don't.
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:23:59.560]   Oh, boy.
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:00.560]   I clove it these.
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:01.880]   Do you have one, Merlin?
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:07.800]   No, I would like to make it very clear that as much as my morals and ethics are in line,
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:09.960]   I would be very happy to receive a free Sonos.
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:13.360]   So you were saying that they apparently given them out.
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:18.800]   I heard from a little bird that Sonos is available to people.
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:22.440]   And I would just like to say the Sonos product would be a true product.
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.440]   Fine.
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:24.440]   Yeah.
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:25.440]   Well, yeah.
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.080]   I mean, there was this is like at this right off Boing Boing yesterday.
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:28.880]   And it looked from what Mark is saying on Boing Boing.
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.880]   It looks like now.
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:32.040]   And again, I haven't followed this.
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:33.040]   So this might be old news.
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:38.560]   But the ability now to run Rhapsody over your Sonos system.
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.800]   So do you want to explain Sonos to people who don't know?
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:43.120]   We actually have reviewed it on Call for Help.
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:44.120]   And it's beautiful.
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:46.080]   I mean, there are a lot of devices that do this.
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:52.480]   They're wireless devices that take the content, in this case, just music, that's on your computer
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:54.800]   and then send it to your stereo system.
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:58.560]   And the Sonos has the capability of they have powered speakers.
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:00.440]   So you could put speakers all over the house.
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:03.120]   Each speaker system can play different songs.
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:05.280]   So it's not like you have one unified system.
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:10.960]   They have perhaps the best looking easiest to use iPod similar remote on the market.
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:11.960]   They're also expensive.
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.800]   The base kit is $1,000.
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:21.360]   But if you're a very high-end AV kind of guy, this is-- or gal, this is clearly the one you
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.360]   want.
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:24.000]   Does it work with iTunes Leo?
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   He does.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.960]   Well, I'll be having one tomorrow.
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:29.200]   Well, and talk about your reverse Polaroid model.
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:33.520]   I mean, if you can drop a grant on this thing, you then go ahead and pay your $10 a month
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:37.080]   for Rhapsody and have access to a bajillion songs.
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:39.480]   You can stream-- apparently, you tell me this is truly a book.
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.280]   You can stream different songs to different rooms.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:42.280]   That's right.
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.600]   Well, now, I don't actually-- I don't know if that would work with Rhapsody.
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.040]   You can do it with stuff on your hard drive.
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:47.680]   I'm not sure how that would work with Rhapsody.
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:48.680]   I'll be honest with you.
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:49.840]   I don't really care about Rhapsody.
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:52.760]   I want it to support Pandora.
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:55.200]   The Slim Devices supports Pandora.
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.280]   It's very similar, less expensive.
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:58.280]   You like Pandora, don't you?
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:00.680]   I think-- I thought you heard you were a Pandora fan.
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:01.680]   Me?
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:02.680]   Yeah.
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:03.680]   I'll be with it a little bit.
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:05.360]   I played luck with that in Last FM.
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:06.360]   It seems to be a fan.
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:07.360]   That's to me.
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:09.240]   I'd rather have it support that than Rhapsody.
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.240]   That's kind of an interesting idea.
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.440]   I mean, the neat thing about Rhapsody is it's kind of the ultimate--
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:14.440]   It's everything.
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:18.440]   You're up late and having drinks and you want to hear "The Only Boy" by Andrew Gold
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:19.440]   and it's right there.
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:23.040]   Jeez, you really-- you get drunk and you want to hear "The Lonely Boy"?
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:24.040]   Banana!
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:25.040]   Banana!
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:26.040]   OK.
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:30.400]   I'm thinking more like it's a quarter to three.
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:33.600]   There's no one in the place that me and "The Lonely Boy"--
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.920]   But Scott, is there a place for anything like this in your life?
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:38.080]   It sounds like you've got your own kind of standard media.
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:39.800]   You're out there buying plastic discs and stuff.
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:41.440]   So there would be no place for this in your life.
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:47.320]   Well, you know, I'm 52 years old and I value a good old fashion vinyl LP.
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:51.200]   There's nothing like a vinyl LP if you want to listen to music.
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.040]   They had music when you were younger?
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.040]   They did.
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:55.040]   Vinyl.
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.040]   Wow.
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.160]   And I got to tell you that I do kind of use the old method.
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:59.520]   But now, here's the thing.
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:04.520]   When I travel, I am pretty much based in my MacBook Pro and I have a lot of iTunes music
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:05.920]   store music that I've purchased.
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:08.840]   I don't like everybody else that buys CDs and rips them.
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:12.420]   I actually have bought quite a lot of music from the iTunes store and I buy a lot of audio
[00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:14.240]   books from the iTunes store.
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:17.280]   And those are things that I've sort of gravitated to.
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:19.080]   But I'm very interested in all this stuff.
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:22.440]   It's just that, you know, I'm old-fashioned and it takes me a while to get to it.
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:26.720]   And plus, Merlin, keep in mind, you're being at least a decade younger than me.
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:27.720]   They market to you.
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:28.720]   They don't market to me.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:29.720]   So I don't hear about this.
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:34.520]   I think actually the Sonos is really aimed at rich folk like you.
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:36.720]   I don't think it's aimed at the younger.
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:37.720]   No, no, yeah.
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:39.720]   Banana, I am not rich.
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:44.720]   I just play a rich man on the podcast.
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.720]   Excuse me while I change my monocle.
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:47.720]   Oh, sure.
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:48.720]   Loving.
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:49.720]   Another more teenage play.
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:50.720]   I do.
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:51.720]   I do.
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:52.720]   If you're a dollar speaker, just put in my hand.
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:53.720]   I would do.
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:59.160]   If I had, you know, I'm thinking like, you know, you got your office full of 10 or 15 people.
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:03.720]   And you know, it's kind of still a pain in the butt to, I mean, unless you're kind of
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:07.520]   have the hacky mind set, it's not the easiest thing in the world to share libraries and
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:09.600]   have a music system that everybody can have access to.
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.720]   This seems to me like to be a great friend of office.
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:12.720]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:16.360]   Yeah, in fact, I do know offices that use this and love it a lot.
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:19.000]   But again, it's a thousand dollars just to get started.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.320]   And I think that that is actually a pretty prohibitive price point for most people.
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:25.920]   If it works with iTunes, I'm interested in it.
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:27.520]   We'll get you a unit.
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.160]   We'll call Mark Fraunfeller and see what he can do.
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:33.720]   There's only one way to find out, so nice.
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:38.680]   If they would let me have one, perfect proof that anyone could use it because an old geese
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.200]   are like me can hook it up.
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.280]   Hey, they took ours back from call for help.
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:44.440]   So I don't know about it.
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:48.200]   First details office 2007 for the Mac.
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:51.360]   We've been hearing a lot about office 2007 for Windows.
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:54.720]   It's got the new Vista interface.
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:57.840]   Apparently an all new UI for Mac users too.
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:00.560]   Do you know, I know Merlin, you write a lot.
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:01.560]   I'd be surprised.
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:02.560]   Do you use office?
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:06.760]   Well, you know, I got to say, I love Excel.
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:11.040]   I mean, oh gosh, to me, Excel is like one of the all time great programs.
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:15.520]   Excel is, you know, you're basically exposing a UI for a database.
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:16.520]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:17.520]   It's a great, very powerful.
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:18.520]   I'd just surprise that you use it.
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:20.840]   Well, now having said that, I write everything in text mate.
[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:21.840]   You're a text mate fan as well.
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:22.840]   I love text mate.
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:23.840]   Yeah.
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:24.840]   So I mean, I write everything in text files.
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:29.320]   And I use a key note, not PowerPoint, but I have to say there is no compatible, you
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:30.760]   know, there's no comparable spreadsheet.
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:31.760]   See, but here's the problem.
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:34.800]   I mean, if you're going to, like I learned early on when I was, you know, trying to
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:38.440]   write my God for Second Book for O'Reilly, you know, there's no way of getting away
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:39.440]   from Word.
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.440]   By the way, that's the name of the book.
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:43.440]   My God for Second Book.
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.480]   Still not available at your bookstore.
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:49.440]   But the fact of the matter is if you deal with the rest of the world, there's, you know,
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.880]   text edit will only take you so far.
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:53.080]   I love just being able to open stuff in text edit.
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:56.800]   Yeah, but there are certain things you got to have word for.
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:59.960]   It's like, you know what, to me, it's like software equivalent of owning a fax machine.
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:03.040]   Like, I need it just often enough to be incredibly annoying.
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:04.040]   How about you, Scott?
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:05.040]   Do you use it?
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:06.680]   I use Nissis writer experience.
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:07.680]   Me too.
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:08.680]   I'm a Nissis fan.
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:09.680]   I like Nissis, Nissis, however it is.
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:10.680]   Yeah.
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:14.480]   But I just, I just want to piggyback on top of Merlin's last comment because that's where
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:15.480]   I'm at.
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.600]   I deal with a lot of people that send me stuff as word talk.
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.040]   It's kind of hard to have it, don't you?
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:24.840]   So I do have the full Microsoft suite on my computer, but when it comes to presentations,
[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:27.360]   I'm a hundred percent tried and true keynote guy.
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:28.360]   Me too.
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:31.920]   And, you know, I prefer the Nissis product.
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:35.760]   And, you know, I'm excited about the new word though because if they've done a better
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:40.960]   job of working with the Mac interface and can make things a little smoother, I'm a fan
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:41.960]   if it works.
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:46.680]   You know, it's going to do something kind of like the ribbon on Office 2007 for Windows.
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.520]   That's the new Microsoft look.
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:50.960]   And to me, the most important thing is it's universal.
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:51.960]   Absolutely.
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.960]   Which Office is not right now.
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:54.960]   It's slow.
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.800]   It's really slow on my MacBook Pro.
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:57.800]   Yeah.
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:01.520]   They say sometime between July and September of next year.
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:02.520]   So it's a while.
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:03.520]   We're not.
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:05.000]   This isn't going to happen right away.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.840]   So in other words, about 24 months before Vista release.
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.600]   Yeah, right.
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:10.600]   We shall see.
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:13.320]   We've got a Vista podcast launching on Friday.
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:17.040]   So and I was, you know, at first I was going to call it countdown to Vista and I thought,
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:18.040]   then Vista will come out.
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:19.040]   We'd have to change the name.
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:21.120]   And then I realized, but by then I'll be dead.
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:26.120]   So we're just going to call it countdown to Vista.
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:29.760]   We'll start at a thousand nine hundred ninety nine.
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:31.000]   Nine hundred ninety eight.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.600]   That's going to be episode twenty three thousand.
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:34.600]   Six five.
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:37.240]   We have to change our name.
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.040]   So I'm a poor junior.
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:42.040]   My son is getting ready.
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.280]   He's training up.
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:44.280]   He's at twelve now.
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:47.440]   The time it comes out, he should be my age.
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:48.440]   Let's see.
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:49.640]   What else boot camp one point one?
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:52.880]   A little trouble with the twenty four inch iMac.
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.360]   Is that true?
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:57.160]   That's kind of disappointing.
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.160]   It's not my area.
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:01.320]   I don't want to put windows on my Mac.
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:02.320]   Yeah, I haven't tried this.
[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:03.920]   I don't, I mean, I don't have the Mac to try this on.
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:07.400]   It was just something that a few people were talking about over on the Apple board.
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.480]   This is a link that comes in via dig.
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:12.760]   And I don't know if it's accurate.
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:13.760]   It sure sounds like that.
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:14.760]   He likes parallels.
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:16.560]   I'm just so happy with parallels that I have.
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:20.200]   I kind of haven't tried boot camps since it first came out.
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:27.200]   But boy, you'd think on the twenty four inch iMac is just made to do both Mac and Windows.
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:30.520]   Isn't it something that they're kind of selling in the ads?
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:31.520]   I mean, it's like the...
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:35.560]   Well, interesting because no, the ads, once they, they were selling run windows, but they
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:37.520]   started pushing parallels, not boot camps.
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:38.520]   So I don't know.
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:43.200]   I think what they're saying also is that because boot camp is technically beta, it's not supported.
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.200]   Does that sound right?
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:47.440]   Yeah, I think that might be the case as well.
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:49.760]   So you know, we'll leave that still up in the air.
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:55.440]   I do have a my neighbor kid who's a Windows user for life because he's, because he plays
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.440]   games.
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:57.680]   So shock the heck out of me.
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:02.320]   He just bought a twenty four inch or twenty inch iMac because of the core to and because
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:03.760]   he could run boot camp.
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:06.760]   So he's going to be a little disappointed if he can't.
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:10.080]   YouTube showing that maybe it will survive.
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:14.360]   You know, one of the problems YouTube has is they spent over a million dollars a month
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:15.600]   in bandwidth.
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:16.600]   How do you monetize that?
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:18.800]   You make a deal with Warner music.
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:22.720]   You're going to start seeing music videos from Warner's artists like Madonna, Red Hot
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:26.880]   Chili Peppers, Sean Paul on YouTube.
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.280]   A great way to promote music.
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:30.160]   Yeah, it absolutely is.
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:33.800]   I mean, the, it's, gosh, the message is so much of this stuff seems to be, you know, why,
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:38.800]   why not let some willing person pay the freight on getting this stuff out there and the communities
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:42.240]   that build up around this stuff are just, are just fantastic.
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:47.480]   Yeah, I like that business model and, you know, my only concern for YouTube is how they're
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:50.760]   going to deal with all the copyright lawsuits they get from the people that aren't part
[00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:51.760]   of the deal.
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:52.760]   You know, it's funny.
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:54.560]   We had Steve Chen from YouTube.
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:34:00.560]   Amber was one of the early, early proponents of YouTube over a year ago and we had Steve
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:06.120]   on in March on inside the net and, and the real concern when we had him on then was not
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:08.840]   how do you pay for the bandwidth because it wasn't that huge yet.
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:11.440]   It was, how are you going to survive the copyright lawsuits?
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:14.480]   They've somehow managed to dodge that bullet all this time.
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:16.720]   And now all the talk is really, well, what's your burn rate?
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:24.040]   How much is it costing you, you know, a hundred million videos a day being served?
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:26.440]   In fact, Merlin, look what you're doing with your Vox blog.
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:27.600]   It's all links to YouTube.
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:28.600]   Yeah.
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:29.600]   Yeah.
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:30.600]   That's it.
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:31.600]   That's, it's, I don't know.
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:32.600]   I just, I think it's kind of interesting.
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:35.520]   Any of these, the reason I thought this would be fun to talk about on the Mac one is just
[00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:36.800]   again thinking about this whole idea.
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:40.520]   We talked last week a little bit about iTunes and how it could be made a little bit more
[00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:44.760]   into something like democracy and a program that goes out there and finds this stuff for
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:45.760]   you.
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:48.920]   I mean, one thing I love about YouTube and democracy for that matter is I can just go
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:51.800]   point it at something that I'm interested in.
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:54.680]   I said this last week, but I think this is a point not to be missed.
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:57.840]   You know, to be able to go out there and point it at something I'm interested in, this is,
[00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:01.320]   you know, go find me stuff about whatever Madonna and it's going to pull that stuff
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.320]   in for me automatically.
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:03.760]   It just seems like more and more.
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:04.760]   This is going to be a great model.
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:07.160]   Boy, I think that's a great model for them.
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:08.160]   Well, yeah, absolutely.
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:11.160]   It's a business, a business use for RSS.
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:12.160]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:17.880]   Well, then it always was an issue for me with YouTube was they make it so easy to link that
[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:21.760]   many people will watch, you know, I don't know how many of their videos are watched,
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:26.480]   not even from the YouTube site, but from people's blogs where there's no chance to monetize
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:28.640]   unless they do a pre-roll ad or something.
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:32.520]   Well, you know, there's probably like they say, I'll go into my 1998 mode for a minute,
[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:36.120]   but I mean, there's probably not room for five players in this space, but to become
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:37.120]   the video.
[00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:39.120]   Yeah, the guy, right.
[00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:40.120]   Let me drill down this.
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:41.920]   What I want to do is open the kimono net net.
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:43.720]   We need to capture eyeballs.
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:46.520]   No, but listen, listen seriously.
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:48.920]   I just felt like we went back in time seven years.
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:49.920]   That was amazing.
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:54.920]   Listen, Leo, we don't want to boil the ocean really at the end of the day, but I just
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:57.120]   know, but at the end of the day, that's all you have to do.
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:58.120]   It's over.
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:35:59.520]   It's over at the end of the day.
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:01.120]   It's a profit deal.
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:03.520]   At the end of the day, net net.
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:04.520]   Yeah.
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:06.440]   No, but the reason I mentioned that is I don't know.
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:07.600]   I just think it's interesting to think about.
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:08.600]   There's so many directions now.
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:12.720]   It's so clear that iTunes is going to become this kind of this hub of activity for the
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.640]   way you think about media and the way you do this stuff.
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:15.640]   I don't know.
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:17.440]   I just thought it was kind of an interesting kind of related story.
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:21.120]   You think YouTube is a natural competitor to iTunes?
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:23.440]   Well, see, I don't know if they're competitors.
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:27.600]   I think, I mean, one thing, gosh, we're still so much in this mindset of you go somewhere
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.920]   on the internet and do this thing.
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:34.320]   I know I get 10 pitches a week from people who want me to create a 15th community blog
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:35.320]   or a 15th community.
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:36.320]   You know what I mean?
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:38.320]   And so to me, some of the best way.
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:41.120]   I think people are tired of getting tired of going places.
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:42.120]   Well, they are.
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:45.640]   And I mean, the phrase that I've started using for this stuff is what I call functional
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:46.880]   spackle.
[00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:51.800]   Things where you're using technologies like APIs and XML RPC to make this stuff all kind
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:53.120]   of work together.
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:54.120]   And so I don't know.
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:57.320]   I just think it's kind of fascinating to think about the ways that these apps can interact
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:58.520]   with each other.
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:36:59.520]   And who knows?
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:02.760]   I mean, nobody in the early days probably thought Google was going to be making all
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:03.760]   their money off of ads.
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:06.640]   They thought, well, they'll pay for placement or what have you.
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:07.640]   I don't know.
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:10.320]   I just think there's still a lot of interesting models that can happen with this stuff.
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:12.520]   And there's no telling where it's going to end up.
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:13.520]   One last--
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:14.520]   Go ahead.
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:17.320]   Let me just bring in a little perspective of an old man, though.
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:18.320]   You know.
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:19.840]   The old rich man speaks.
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:21.520]   Would you stop with the rich?
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:24.000]   We're just going to call you Thurston.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   What is it Thurston?
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.720]   Just because I have a nice TV does it not mean I'm rich.
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:31.720]   You sound like a rich, guilty guy to me.
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:32.720]   Yeah.
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:33.720]   Listen, listen.
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:36.200]   I give lots of money to people.
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:37.200]   I do.
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:38.200]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:39.720]   You guys are just teasing you.
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:40.720]   Go ahead.
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.720]   I want this edited out, Leo.
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:48.200]   But now, OK, I remember a little company because I signed one of the first deals with
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:49.200]   them called PointCast.
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:50.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:52.720]   And they were a surge at the time.
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:57.640]   In fact, let me just remind everybody that Adam Curry is not the podfather.
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:01.800]   I'm the podfather because I delivered the first streaming media video of PointCast.
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:03.200]   Did you do audio on PointCast?
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:05.640]   We were-- NetRadio did the first deal with them.
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:06.640]   It was for him.
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:09.720]   And so we were doing podcasting 12 years ago.
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:13.980]   PointCast was so successful that for a while, the entire internet would slow down at 9
[00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:17.960]   in the morning when everybody got to the office flipped on their machines and PointCast
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:19.960]   started downloading the mega-side crap.
[00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:20.960]   Was that a urban myth?
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:23.600]   Because I had heard that actually-- I'd heard that same thing that along the lines of the
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:27.160]   Super Bowl toilet flushing that's something like so many minutes.
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:28.160]   And really--
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:32.440]   I worked in an office where that was a real problem and they had to start banning PointCast.
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:36.240]   I think Ziff Davis-Y, they had to start banning PointCast for that very reason.
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:40.240]   Their servers would get slammed when people came in the morning because that's how PointCast
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:41.240]   was set up.
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:42.240]   It was impolite.
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:43.240]   It would just start downloading.
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:44.880]   The minute it was turned on.
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:48.840]   And I just want to point out that this is really, you know, Merlin's bringing this problem
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:49.840]   up.
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:50.840]   Everybody wants stuff delivered to him.
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:53.160]   Well, we tried to deliver it to him 12 years ago.
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:58.160]   And I think that RSS is a much better implementation than what PointCast was trying to do.
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:38:59.760]   But these things go in cycles.
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:03.640]   And I don't know that it's a permanent response to say people want stuff delivered to him.
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:04.640]   I think we're going to see that.
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:08.240]   I do have to say, though, that it's to go from site to site to site to site to get each
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:10.480]   of these little features.
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:15.120]   Not just news hits, but, you know, now I have a lot of Web 2.0 applications.
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:18.960]   You know, Google's spreadsheet and I've been fresh books for my billing.
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:20.760]   And it's getting a little annoying, frankly.
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:21.760]   Yeah.
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:24.040]   And so I don't disagree, really, with what you're saying, Scott.
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:27.600]   I think the problem, not the problem, but the interesting thing to notice is that everybody
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:31.720]   focuses so heavily on, you know, what the newest shiny widget is and what the business
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:32.720]   model for that is.
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:36.440]   And to me, the thing that's interesting to watch is how people's habits evolve.
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:39.880]   You know, to me, of course, this is straight, you know, out of the kind of 43 folder stuff
[00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:40.880]   that we talk about.
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:43.720]   But I think the thing to watch is what people do habitually.
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:48.240]   And even if there's not a business model directly associated with YouTube today, to think about
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:52.240]   the fact that people are getting used to the idea of being able to get video on demand
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:55.800]   and then take it any place, to me, that's the really interesting thing here.
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:58.760]   And this in the same way that iTunes lets me go and download the first season of Law
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:02.560]   and Order, you know, that's the pattern to watch to me.
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:04.160]   It's not who that funded for what.
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:07.160]   It's where these habits as consumers are starting to group.
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:12.240]   By the way, Merlin, that's only on 73 times a night in rerun by every channel.
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:15.960]   The first season, I'm talking George Zunda years.
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:17.560]   The really good years.
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:22.560]   What night of the week is Law and Order not on 53 channels?
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:23.560]   That's what I want.
[00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:26.720]   You know what's great, though, is with your big screen, you can actually watch seven episodes
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:27.720]   at once.
[00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:28.720]   Same time.
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:29.720]   Not as anything.
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:30.720]   Yeah.
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:31.720]   Can I make a confession?
[00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:32.720]   I've never seen Law and Order.
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:33.720]   Oh, be thankful.
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:34.720]   Be thankful.
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:35.720]   Be thankful.
[00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:36.720]   Be thankful.
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:37.720]   Be thankful.
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:38.720]   Be thankful.
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:39.720]   Be thankful.
[00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:40.720]   Be thankful.
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:41.720]   Be thankful.
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:42.720]   Be thankful.
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:43.720]   I am that guy.
[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:44.720]   I've never seen any of this stuff.
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:47.200]   I might listen to vinyl music, but you're not known about Law and Order.
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:50.080]   If it doesn't have Corbin Burnson in it, I don't want to see it.
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:51.080]   Yep.
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:52.080]   That's a rule here at our house.
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:53.080]   We just won't watch it.
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:54.080]   It's not a problem to pretend.
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:55.080]   No.
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:56.080]   Well, let's see what's on tonight.
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:58.760]   Well, how are we doing for Burnson content?
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:04.640]   One last story, and then I do want to talk about the hack, the so-called hack that people
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:05.640]   have been talking about.
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:12.840]   It's been all the conversation since it was kind of revealed Friday in the Mac installer,
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:19.720]   but we wanted to mention quickly this retail update from Apple, Ron Johnson, who's senior
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:25.160]   vice president of retail for Apple Computer, was speaking at a conference and really kind
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:27.120]   of a dramatic numbers here.
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:35.040]   Apple's going to order open 40 new stores this year, 3500 special events, 10,000 visitors
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:37.560]   each week on per store.
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:39.760]   That's up, by the way, from 9,000 the week before.
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.200]   The average revenue.
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:42.960]   This is the one blew me away.
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:47.560]   Per store, $441,000 a week.
[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:48.560]   They're doing very well.
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:51.480]   I'm one of the first people who said Apple should not open stores.
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:52.480]   It's a bad business.
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:54.840]   Look what happened to Gateway and boy, was I wrong.
[00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:55.840]   Right.
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:58.000]   Well, their implementation is much better than Gateway, obviously.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.960]   I know some people that work up here in the northwest with Costco and they're really looking
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:08.880]   at those numbers from a take per square foot standpoint and they're very envious because
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:12.840]   the unit prices at Apple stores are so much higher, obviously, because they're dealing
[00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:18.480]   with computers and the people that have drawn that up and made it work are really heroes
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:20.080]   in the retailing world.
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:21.160]   That's the number to look at.
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:22.400]   Take per square foot.
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:23.400]   It is very high.
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:27.440]   They have six, each store averaging 6,000 square feet.
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:33.400]   6,000 square foot store generates 66% of the business of a Best Buy, which is 38,000 square
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:34.400]   feet.
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:36.720]   That's the number that you really got to notice.
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:37.720]   Very efficient.
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:43.440]   What do you think of that little thing you slid in about the "entirely new store design"?
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:47.640]   Yeah, the fifth avenue store I guess is the inspiration and that's pretty an amazing store,
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:48.640]   by the way.
[00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:50.840]   They're one millionth visitor just recently.
[00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:52.240]   What do you think that would be?
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:54.440]   Glass elevators and all the stores?
[00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:56.560]   You know, I noticed something kind of interesting.
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:59.080]   We have one at the mall that's just kind of right near my house.
[00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:03.760]   So if I ever need something super fasting, an iPod case or whatever, I can just jet down
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:04.760]   there.
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:05.760]   I don't know.
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:06.760]   Have you guys noticed this?
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:07.760]   I mean, this too.
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:08.760]   They're very big.
[00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:09.760]   This is one of the smaller stores, right?
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:10.760]   This is not like the one on top.
[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:11.760]   There's two kinds.
[00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:13.560]   There's big stores and there's a little mall stores.
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:17.440]   But in any case, at all of these, they seem like they're doing what they can to kind of
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:18.840]   reach out to the community.
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:19.840]   Like I go in there.
[00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:21.680]   If I go in there in the morning, there'll be like school kids there.
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:22.840]   That's computer camp.
[00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:23.840]   That's what he said.
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:30.720]   They've sent 20,000 kids through there, whatever it is, summer camp program.
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:32.320]   What a brilliant idea.
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:33.320]   Get kids used to.
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:34.320]   We have.
[00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:35.320]   We have.
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:36.320]   Now.
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:37.320]   And just that whole idea.
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:40.720]   Well, but who drops kids off at the store?
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:43.960]   I mean, maybe dad will pop by and just have a look at those nanos.
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:46.520]   If it's free computer classes, why not, right?
[00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:47.520]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:49.000]   But I mean, I just think that's kind of an interesting idea.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.880]   And you look at what they do at Stockton.
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:53.560]   Actually, yeah, I saw you do the Twitch podcast.
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:54.560]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:58.680]   In that area, usually, they're doing these demonstrations and showing people.
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:02.320]   And man, in the middle, of course, at San Francisco, so this is an outlier.
[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:05.760]   But you go in there in the middle of the day and there's frequently a bunch of people
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:07.560]   there like learning how to do stuff with iPhone.
[00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:09.560]   They say men don't like to shop.
[00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:11.200]   Anybody who says that hasn't been to an Apple store.
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:12.840]   It's full of shopping men.
[00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:13.840]   Right?
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:19.720]   Well, in the 1940s, IBM had free typewriter clinics for young women so that they would
[00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:24.040]   get a customer using the typewriters and moving up into the secretarial pools that were so
[00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:25.440]   prominent back then.
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:26.720]   This is not a new idea.
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:28.760]   It's just a very good implementation of it.
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:33.520]   And I am a little bit saddened to hear that they are doing away with the theaters in the
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:34.520]   store design.
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:35.520]   Yeah.
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:38.320]   They're doing the theaters, which is actually one of the things I really liked about the
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:39.320]   store.
[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:40.320]   But I guess I don't count.
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:43.600]   It doesn't generate revenue, at least not right away.
[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:47.960]   It breaks into that cost per square foot revenue per square foot model that they so much love.
[00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:48.960]   I agree with you, though.
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:52.280]   That's too bad because that's really what draws people into the store often is these
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:53.280]   presentations.
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:55.640]   And then afterwards, they buy, buy, buy.
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:45:01.760]   They're going to expand the genius bar, apparently, in response to removing the...
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:04.120]   I'm still waiting for the first genius to show up.
[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:07.480]   I would like to see them expand the level of genius that's available.
[00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:11.080]   Or geniuses!
[00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:14.520]   Buy a new computer that's not counted as genius.
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:15.520]   No.
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:20.840]   There is a pretty significant exploit that's being talked about on the Apple discussion
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:22.480]   boards and elsewhere.
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:29.040]   A malformed installer package can actually give a bad guy root access to a Macintosh,
[00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:31.760]   giving them the ability to do anything they want.
[00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:34.160]   Turns out this is nothing new.
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:36.000]   We talked with Adam Knight.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:42.040]   He is the editor of a Mac blog called MacGeekery@macgeekery.com.
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:47.440]   He actually described and demonstrated this whole and has some advice for you.
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:48.440]   Hi, Adam.
[00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:49.440]   Hi there.
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:50.440]   This is not anything new.
[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:51.440]   No, no.
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:54.720]   This has been around since the inception, really.
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:55.720]   And there's been a...
[00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:59.520]   I mean, at least for six months, maybe more, there's been talk about this on the Apple
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:02.120]   forums, but Apple's not done anything about it.
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:03.120]   Right.
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:10.120]   Well, I mean, it's one of those situations where it is almost a graphical bug.
[00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:12.400]   It could be considered that, but not really.
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:15.840]   A graphical, graphical bug in what sense?
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:16.840]   Well, if...
[00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:20.640]   Okay, there's three different security levels for an installer package.
[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:23.200]   There's none, which it runs as you.
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:24.800]   There's root, which it runs as root.
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:27.520]   There's admin, where curiously it runs as root.
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:28.520]   And that's our problem.
[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:29.520]   Ah.
[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:30.520]   If you're an admin...
[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:33.840]   Before we go too much farther, and by the way, your blog is a great place for Mac security,
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:37.760]   if people want to know more about it, what is the difference between on a Mac between
[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:39.760]   admin and root?
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:40.800]   That's a very good question.
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:44.440]   So a Mac actually has three security levels.
[00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:49.680]   That's your average user, which has access to his home folder, can read everything else,
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:51.480]   really, but that's where you can change.
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:52.480]   And that's...
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:55.000]   And by the way, and you've recommended it and I do too, that that's how you should be
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   running nicely.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   Absolutely.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.920]   So if you're in a Mac, any operating system, except Windows is hard to do it in, but any
[00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:04.760]   good operating system, you could run as a limited user and that's the safest way to
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:05.760]   run.
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:06.760]   Yes.
[00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:12.280]   Because if anything takes control of your account, they can only do what you can do.
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:16.440]   If you prevent yourself from being able to do some of these things, then the scripts
[00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:18.400]   or worms or whatever else can't do it.
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:19.400]   Right.
[00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:20.560]   Now there's the admin account, which is...
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:24.440]   Which you always have to create when you first create a...
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:26.440]   Set up a OS10 system.
[00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:31.920]   And that's the account that you go into or run as when you want to install stuff, modify
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:37.160]   system files, open your system preference pains, that kind of thing.
[00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:38.160]   That's right.
[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:41.480]   That's the one that has the authorization to actually change things on the computer.
[00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:45.080]   And I always assume that was root, but it's not.
[00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:46.080]   It isn't.
[00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:49.360]   You see, that's where the gem of this comes in.
[00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:55.440]   It is a normal user with the permission to become root with the proper credentials.
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:56.440]   All right.
[00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:59.680]   So the root user is what the systems we running as.
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:01.640]   That's what the computer is.
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:06.840]   There's a security framework for Mac OS10 programs that allows them to escalate their
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:11.800]   privileges legitimately to root by presenting that password dialogue saying, "Who are you?
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:13.400]   Or you would admin user?"
[00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:15.440]   And then it runs things as root afterwards.
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:18.880]   That's the authenticate dialogue that you see sometimes.
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:19.880]   That's right.
[00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:20.880]   So whenever you want to do something...
[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:25.040]   I've seen this happen on the command line because I always run as a normal user.
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:26.040]   And you can't pseudo.
[00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:30.000]   A lot of times when you're doing stuff in terminal, you'll pseudo to become root.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.840]   And you can't pseudo as a normal user.
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:34.440]   You have to first su to the admin user.
[00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:36.160]   You have to become the admin user.
[00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:38.320]   And then you can pseudo after that.
[00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:39.320]   That's right.
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:40.320]   So that's the same thing here.
[00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:45.640]   The programs that need root access are not allowed to escalate to root unless you as in
[00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:47.960]   an administrator authorize it.
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:48.960]   That's right.
[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:49.960]   Okay.
[00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:50.960]   That makes sense.
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:51.960]   So it's almost a three-step thing.
[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:52.960]   It is.
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:57.000]   What makes a normal user an admin is merely the membership in the admin group.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   Okay.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   It is otherwise the same thing.
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:00.680]   So being in that group lets it do it.
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:04.360]   So that's the only thing different between a normal user and admin user is membership
[00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:05.800]   of the admin group.
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:06.800]   That's right.
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:07.800]   Okay.
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:10.400]   So that's where this becomes a problem, however.
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:15.800]   So the authorization framework says, "If you're in this group, I can let you become roots."
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:22.720]   Somehow Apple has said, "Well, if the package has this one flag saying admin rights and
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:26.600]   you're already an admin, we'll just go ahead and give your root without prompting."
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:28.480]   Oh, all right.
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:30.680]   So you download installer package.
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:32.440]   It says it needs admin rights.
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:36.560]   It's the same thing as root rights would have.
[00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:41.400]   Running the package as root and including that, the shell scripts there inside of it
[00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:43.960]   and installing in places that root can install to.
[00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:49.680]   So even if you run this installer as a limited normal user, it will have root access?
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:52.560]   If you run it as a regular user, that's your defense.
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:56.880]   Because you're not an admin and it can't jump to root.
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:58.240]   That's the protection against it.
[00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:01.600]   So it will then still have to ask you for your admin.
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:02.600]   Precisely.
[00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:04.880]   And it will require the admin password, not your account.
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:10.040]   But if you are running as many people still do, which is really a shame as an administrative
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:11.440]   user.
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:16.000]   And I entirely blame Apple for that because when the system is installed, there's one
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:20.880]   user made and that user's an admin user and no mention of what that user can do is ever
[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:23.120]   presented the user and then named simplicity.
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:27.280]   Yeah, in fact, when you install Linux in most cases, it'll create a root account, but it
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:30.840]   will also instruct you to create a normal user account and use that.
[00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:32.560]   They're very clear about that.
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:33.560]   Right.
[00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:36.360]   And several of the installations I've done recently have forced you to go down to a regular
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:37.360]   user.
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:38.360]   Right.
[00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:39.360]   Right.
[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:42.120]   So I mean, it's just partly just getting the word out.
[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:43.840]   It doesn't sound like there's a fix.
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:46.840]   You think a patch that Apple should be making?
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:47.840]   So there's two things you can do.
[00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:51.800]   I mean, today, go down to a normal user and we have instructions on the side on how to
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:53.560]   do that.
[00:50:53.560 --> 00:51:00.120]   The other thing that Apple can do immediately to resolve this is to simply make the installer
[00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:05.920]   present the authentication dialogue so that you know it wants elevated privileges for the
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:06.920]   file.
[00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:09.520]   So people who write installers need to be doing this.
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:10.520]   And they can't do that.
[00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:12.080]   Well, actually they can.
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:16.160]   They can change that flag to use root privileges instead of admin privileges and that'll present
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:17.160]   the dialogue.
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:23.160]   So Apple could fix it or an installer package or the individual can do it and should be
[00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:27.520]   doing it because this escalation is fact not the only kind of escalation that can happen.
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:33.760]   This was when we saw a kind of a sample exploit a few months ago, that's exactly how it worked
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:35.800]   as well of a different exploit.
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:40.280]   Now, the thing I would warn saying that the package author can change it, that's right.
[00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:41.840]   They can.
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:46.200]   But that's not going to solve the underlying problem is that you can go to admin and get
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:47.200]   these privileges.
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:48.200]   Right.
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:49.200]   That's a bad guy.
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:50.440]   What's it going to do it?
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:51.440]   Exactly.
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:53.000]   So the bad guy he wants to do this.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:58.440]   So what has to happen is the user takes his fate in his own hands right now and moves
[00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:04.240]   himself down to regular user or Apple in some future release says both admin authorization
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:08.320]   and root authorization both give you a password dialogue.
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:09.760]   That would be the real fix for now.
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:10.760]   Right.
[00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:15.760]   So somebody points out on your blog that really it's not exactly a security issue in the
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:18.720]   sense that this is normal behavior.
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:22.720]   The issue really is that users shouldn't be running as administrators.
[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:23.720]   That's part of it.
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:26.280]   There's two, there is a security problem.
[00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:27.680]   There's two parts to it.
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:29.320]   The first is the users.
[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:30.320]   Never run anything.
[00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:31.320]   You don't know what it is.
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:32.320]   I mean, really.
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:33.320]   Right.
[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:34.320]   Right.
[00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:35.320]   That's one of the fundamental things in security.
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:36.800]   Trust what you're going to do.
[00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:39.080]   The second is on Apple.
[00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:45.560]   Anytime a system escalates your privileges, it should require the user to use your own
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:47.800]   user to input some sort of authorization.
[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:48.800]   Right.
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:49.800]   Right.
[00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:56.360]   If you go from normal user to root, it should prompt you and say, can you really do this?
[00:52:56.360 --> 00:53:00.480]   Same thing is if you're running an administrator, if there's an escalation, it should ask.
[00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:01.480]   Right.
[00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:04.640]   Because again, the administrator is just a user and some member of a certain group.
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:05.640]   Right.
[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:06.640]   Right.
[00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:09.360]   So they've chosen to get around that and they should choose not to.
[00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:15.520]   You have on your posting on MacGeekery.com, you have kind of an example of the exploit.
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:18.680]   And a very clear description of how it works.
[00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:23.120]   But more importantly, and I would recommend people read this, you also describe how to
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:27.200]   stop running as administrator, how to do it right.
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:29.640]   You say stop living in your admin account.
[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:30.640]   Right.
[00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:32.440]   And it's not so hard to do.
[00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:36.120]   In fact, I did it the minute I heard about the exploit a few, six months ago, I said,
[00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:37.800]   what am I doing running as an admin?
[00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:40.040]   And I changed all of my systems.
[00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:45.400]   And you know, unlike Windows, where it's a real pain not to run as admin, it's absolutely
[00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:46.400]   easy as pie.
[00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:50.800]   The only time I get annoyed is when I want to change system preference settings.
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:53.640]   And I have to, you know, unlock that padlock after authenticate.
[00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:55.280]   But that's as it should be.
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:56.280]   Right.
[00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:59.160]   And after you unlock it, it behaves exactly as if you're the admin.
[00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:00.160]   Right.
[00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:01.160]   Right.
[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:02.160]   Right.
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:03.160]   That's as it should be.
[00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:04.160]   Well, I really appreciate your clarification on this, Adam.
[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:07.720]   And I'm glad we could get you on Mac break weekly and get the word out.
[00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:15.360]   MacGeekery.com is the place to get your geek on a community site for, you say, moderate
[00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:16.360]   to advanced geekery.
[00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:20.680]   But I think anybody who uses a Mac could do well by reading your postings there.
[00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:21.680]   Thank you, Adam.
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:22.680]   I appreciate it.
[00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:23.680]   Thanks for having me, Leo.
[00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:27.240]   So I got a question for you, Scott and Merlin.
[00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:29.760]   Are you running as an administrator?
[00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:37.520]   I don't run as administrator when I'm on my Wi-Fi network, but others otherwise I do.
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:38.680]   Merlin?
[00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:40.760]   Not in 10 minutes from now.
[00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:45.320]   You know, it's funny because it was about six months ago.
[00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:48.080]   I can't remember the name of this exploit.
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:51.480]   There was a theoretical exploit and everybody said, "Oh, the first Mac exploit."
[00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:53.880]   And that was exactly what it said.
[00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:57.960]   It only works if you're not running, if you're running as administrator, if you're not running
[00:54:57.960 --> 00:54:58.960]   as a limited user.
[00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:01.680]   So I immediately changed to a normal user on all my machines.
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:02.680]   And you know what?
[00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:03.680]   It's no problem at all.
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:04.680]   It's easy.
[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:05.680]   Highly rare.
[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:08.840]   And you're still you're still typing your password in all the time, anyhow, right?
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:12.040]   You would be anyway, but this way you know that you're not escalated to root without
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:13.040]   your without at least...
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:14.040]   Yeah.
[00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:17.520]   I mentioned this a couple episodes ago, but I think the problem for me is you kind of
[00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:19.360]   go numb to typing in the password.
[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:20.360]   You have to do a terrible thing.
[00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:21.360]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:24.920]   And you've got to hit the little reveal triangle, at least in my case.
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:27.880]   I don't know, yours is configured, but you need to hit a reveal triangle to pop down
[00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:30.280]   and see what process is asking for that permission.
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:33.800]   I mean, one thing that might be kind of handy and this might be more hand-holding than a
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:37.520]   lot of people want, but maybe to show you like, you know, like for example, they added
[00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:41.320]   that thing in where the first time you launched an application, it lets you know that...
[00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:42.320]   Right.
[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:43.320]   That's nice.
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:45.200]   And it's like, "Wow, this is kind of extraordinary.
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:47.120]   This is a process that doesn't get used a lot."
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:48.120]   Right.
[00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:49.120]   You know what I mean?
[00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:51.200]   Just to kind of give you some sense of notification of what you're allowing.
[00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:55.600]   Well, at least for me, if I see that pop up and I'm not installing something or trying
[00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:59.800]   to open a system preference pane, and then I'm going to be suspicious, if it coincides
[00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:05.120]   with the time when I'd expect to see it, maybe that's where I'm numb.
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:08.240]   Maybe that would be a good time for somebody to slip in.
[00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:11.120]   But it sounds like the way he's describing this exploit is part of the problem is you
[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:12.400]   don't even need to do this password.
[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:13.400]   It's something that...
[00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:14.400]   Right.
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:19.200]   If you're a full user, an administrative user, and you run this installer, it will get root
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:20.680]   access whether you give it a pass.
[00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:21.680]   It's inherited.
[00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:22.680]   It's inherited.
[00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:23.680]   You're looking at it.
[00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:24.680]   Yeah.
[00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:25.680]   So I think that's very important.
[00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:28.800]   And I think people probably should take this as an indication that it's time to stop running
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:31.960]   as administrator day to day and start running as a normal user.
[00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:32.960]   Certainly.
[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:34.440]   That's what I do, and it's totally doable.
[00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:36.680]   We have one more interview.
[00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:40.120]   This is going to be forever known as the interview.
[00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:41.800]   Mac Break Weekly.
[00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:44.280]   This one's kind of important to the entire Mac community.
[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:48.720]   Adam Christensen is on the horn, and this is kind of a last-minute addition to this
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:50.560]   week's Mac Break Weekly.
[00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:51.560]   I've poor Adam.
[00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:55.680]   I had kind of a problem on Monday, and the problem has persisted all week.
[00:56:55.680 --> 00:57:02.120]   If you are a fan of Maccast as we all are, you might have noticed no Maccast for a while.
[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:06.880]   Post though at his blog explains why.
[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:07.880]   Is that a new blog for you?
[00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:08.880]   I hadn't seen that site before.
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:14.000]   No, it's just another site that I ended up having to emergency sort of redirect everything
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:20.960]   to because I was shut down by the hosting company, and I didn't have any way to communicate
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:21.960]   to my audience.
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:24.240]   This actually happened on Wednesday morning.
[00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:25.240]   Wednesday, isn't it?
[00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:28.000]   Yeah, as near as I can tell, about 9 a.m.
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.560]   I think Pacific time.
[00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:33.480]   The problem kind of started about 5 a.m. that morning, I guess.
[00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:35.840]   What happened?
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:40.760]   Too many people visiting the site, and now I'm coming to realize that it may have been
[00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:42.760]   a dig effect.
[00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:45.000]   So I may have happened to think.
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:49.040]   He's been ducked, hoist by his own success.
[00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:51.880]   So here's the thing that was surprising.
[00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:56.040]   This actually is kind of a word of warning to all podcasters or anybody putting up a
[00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:59.000]   site where you might get a lot of traffic all of a sudden.
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:04.320]   You had a lot of bandwidth, two terabytes of bandwidth, which was more than enough.
[00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:05.960]   You had 200 gigabytes of storage.
[00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:07.600]   20 is more than enough.
[00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:08.960]   And you thought, well, hey, what can happen?
[00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:12.120]   As long as I monitor that, I should stay online.
[00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:13.040]   Right, right.
[00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:17.840]   And that was, you know, I told my listeners that I think I was a little naive in this
[00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:20.520]   space, thinking that that's what I was buying.
[00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:22.720]   I knew I was on a shared hosting account.
[00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:28.240]   I think it's no secret that my hosting company right now is GoDaddy.
[00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:29.240]   And they've been great.
[00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:30.840]   I've had them since January.
[00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:32.960]   The service has been absolutely fabulous.
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:36.040]   And like you said, I monitored the bandwidth very, very closely.
[00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:37.040]   I kept an eye on it.
[00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:41.160]   But I was only pulling, I don't host my MP3 files there.
[00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:43.840]   I use Libsyn for that, who are fabulous.
[00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:47.440]   So the bandwidth wasn't coming off of the podcast download?
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:48.440]   Not at all.
[00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:53.680]   It was simply a fact of I have my WordPress blog hosted there.
[00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:58.000]   I do have my, I run a pretty popular forum there.
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:02.440]   But like I said, for since January, I've had no issues whatsoever.
[00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:04.040]   It's been running just great.
[00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:07.440]   And I haven't had any huge spikes in bandwidth.
[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:08.880]   I mean, there's been steady growth.
[00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:13.400]   But again, I wasn't reaching anywhere near my two terabyte a month limit.
[00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:14.400]   I mean, not even close.
[00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:20.640]   I think last I checked, I was doing about 150 gigabytes a month.
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:22.280]   So you're well below your limit.
[00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:23.280]   So what happened?
[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:24.280]   Yeah.
[00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:29.080]   So like I said, I think I've come to find out that what I started to do is I recently
[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:34.280]   brought on some guys to help bring up the content on my website so that the podcast
[00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:37.040]   has been going great and that's been fabulous.
[00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:40.160]   And my bulletin board has been hugely successful.
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:45.360]   And so I just was kind of adding to the things I was trying to do for my listeners and for
[00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:46.360]   the Mac community.
[00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:49.680]   And so I thought, well, you know, I want to start posting some more articles and reviews
[00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:50.680]   and things like that.
[00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:54.880]   So I got together a team of volunteers and they started posting last week.
[00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:58.200]   And I guess one of the posts got picked up on Dig.
[00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:04.160]   And then it was just like an influx that one morning, the traffic to the website about
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:05.840]   Quadrupled.
[01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:08.040]   So it went up instantly spiked.
[01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:10.480]   And I guess GoDaddy had a problem with that.
[01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:14.480]   It was affecting other people on the shared server.
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:18.200]   So it's probably worth explaining to everybody kind of how shared servers work because that
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:19.960]   seems to be where the issue lies.
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:20.960]   Yeah.
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:25.120]   It's in fact very common if you get a low cost hosting plan that you may be on the same
[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:29.240]   physical hardware as hundreds, maybe sometimes even thousands of other websites.
[01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:31.000]   And of course, that makes sense.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.680]   Most websites don't pull much bandwidth.
[01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:35.720]   It works pretty well until you become popular.
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:40.160]   Then you're sucking all the CPU, all the bandwidth, all the horsepower that that one machine
[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:41.160]   has.
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:42.160]   Right.
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:47.640]   And so my thing is as an industry, it seems like this isn't really talked about.
[01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:53.400]   So they say you have this much a month, but it really comes down to your sort of allocated,
[01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:57.240]   I think, so much per hour per minute.
[01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:59.120]   I don't know how they absolutely do it.
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:00.720]   I haven't really gotten the answer on that.
[01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:06.040]   But I mean, if you spike out in a given period of time and even if it's intermittent, like
[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:10.240]   this only lasted for a couple hours, but they just saw the problem, they go in and look
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:13.440]   at the server and they go, well, it's this website and their immediate reaction is,
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:14.440]   shut it off.
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:19.400]   Well, that's because all of the other websites that are on your same hardware are in fact
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:21.240]   down or slowed greatly.
[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:22.240]   Right.
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:25.800]   And I absolutely understand that.
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:30.520]   What I sort of took issue with GoDaddy on in their handling of the situation is I found
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:31.520]   out about it.
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:32.680]   So they should have down about nine.
[01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:38.920]   I probably found out about it about 10 when I got up and started checking my email.
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:41.600]   And then I had to call them and say, what's going on?
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:43.240]   My site's down.
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:44.640]   And then they told me about the problem.
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:47.680]   So yeah, there was no notification.
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:50.080]   There was no, not even immediately after.
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:54.160]   And I've since now obviously been in contact with GoDaddy and they explained that there
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:56.160]   was a failure on their end.
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:02:00.320]   At least that's what they're telling me at this time that that's not their normal procedure
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:03.480]   that I should have been contacted immediately after the shutdown.
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:07.400]   They said there was nothing they could do to do it prior to the shutdown, which is how
[01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:09.640]   I would really like to see things in the industry operate.
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:11.080]   Must be something automated.
[01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:12.080]   Yeah.
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:17.320]   Well, not only said it was a physical person who did it and that it was just a new person
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:19.200]   and he didn't follow the procedure.
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.880]   So that's the story I'd been given so far.
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:27.440]   Well, it's very embarrassing for GoDaddy, who by the way is trying to reach out to podcasters
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:30.160]   and certainly has its own podcast and sponsors a lot of podcast.
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:31.960]   They sponsor a Matt cast?
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:32.960]   No, they don't.
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:36.440]   And I guess they never will at this point.
[01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:39.320]   But you're staying on GoDaddy.
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:46.640]   For the time being, so yeah, so immediately what I did as you noted was I finally took
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:51.080]   me a while to figure out because my main stress when this happened was how do I get to my
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:52.080]   audience?
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:53.440]   How do I tell everybody what's going on?
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:56.200]   Because right now, no podcasters going out.
[01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:58.720]   People can't find your podcast.
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:02.800]   We should explain that even though you're hosted on Libsyn, your RSS feed, which is kind
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:05.640]   of critical to the podcast, apparently was coming from GoDaddy.
[01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:08.080]   Yeah, the RSS feeds are on GoDaddy.
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:10.480]   So I had no way to get a podcast out.
[01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:12.440]   I had no way to get even a web page out.
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:17.640]   So for some reason it just clicked on my head, well, I can domain forward my domain to another
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:19.000]   site and at least get a page up.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:25.120]   So put that page up and then that is sort of triggered the sequence of events where I
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:29.000]   think that got picked up on Dig and there was a lot of news and I guess people were sending
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.160]   emails to GoDaddy.
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:36.680]   So lo and behold, GoDaddy of course emailed me directly, directly via the VP of technology.
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:40.880]   I got a personal email and they have been very helpful.
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:45.240]   Now I want to stress that through the whole process I initially called customer service
[01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:49.360]   and GoDaddy's customer service has been fabulous.
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:51.280]   They were really tied by their policies.
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:53.280]   There wasn't much they could do for me.
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:57.960]   I mean, you pointed out need to protect all of their customers, not just one customer
[01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:02.680]   and I fully recognize that and I'm just trying to be very clear with my audience and with
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:06.560]   everybody that this is not just a GoDaddy problem.
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:11.080]   How they handled it maybe was not the best and they promote themselves as being sort
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:14.880]   of above the rest and so that's what I'm taking issue with.
[01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:20.320]   But this happens and I've talked to other podcasters and bloggers and I'm finding out
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:23.480]   that tons of people have this happen to them every single day.
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:27.720]   Oh yeah, in fact we've been on, Twitch's been on dedicated servers since day one because
[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:31.680]   for that very reason we have three full-time servers.
[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:35.520]   It's the only way you can guarantee bandwidth, guarantee uptime.
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:36.520]   Yeah.
[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:38.840]   And I think at some point you're going to have to spend the money to do that.
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:42.320]   But there are a lot of people who have five dollar hosting plans and that's why if it's
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:46.760]   you're paying five bucks a month or six bucks or ten bucks you're shared for sure.
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:48.160]   Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:52.360]   And so I think it's good now that we can kind of get the word out to people because I mean
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:57.240]   there's a lot more bloggers out there and all it's going to take is one thing on dig
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:01.600]   and this could happen to you without warning, without notification and now I understand.
[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:06.120]   So I'm moving to a dedicated server right now.
[01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:07.760]   It's GoDaddy because they're helping.
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:10.720]   They actually are migrating it for me.
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:15.320]   We use a company called The Planet which I've been very happy with but it's a 250 bucks
[01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:18.320]   of servers so it's expensive, it's a lot more expensive.
[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:21.680]   Yeah, like I said my hosting costs just one up 900%.
[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:22.680]   Yep.
[01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:23.680]   Yep.
[01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:25.600]   It's exactly right.
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:29.120]   Well MacCast is a great podcast everybody knows.
[01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:35.240]   I love it and I've been on it and Adam's always been one of the earliest podcasts, a proto-podcast
[01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:36.920]   or in a great guy.
[01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:40.160]   And so I was really distressed when I saw what happened and I'm glad we could get you
[01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:42.160]   on to let the world know.
[01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:49.440]   MacCast.com is up and your feeds are working and the MacCast is out.
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:51.440]   Yeah, we're going to stay up.
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:55.960]   Everything's on dedicated and I'll be shopping around but for now GoDaddy's been great and
[01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:58.040]   they've helped me get over and back up and running.
[01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:00.680]   So it's good news.
[01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:01.680]   Thank you Adam.
[01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:03.480]   And some time you got to come by and join them.
[01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:04.480]   Mac, break quickly.
[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:05.840]   We'd love to have you on the panel.
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:07.080]   Anytime, just give me a call.
[01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:08.080]   I'll give you a call.
[01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:09.080]   We'll see you at Podcast Expo.
[01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:11.160]   Alright, take care.
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:14.240]   That's Adam Christensen of MacCast.com.
[01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:17.560]   He's going to be back up and actually is up and running right now.
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:23.000]   Before we get back to our regular panel and their picks of the week, just a reminder that
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.680]   this podcast as all the Twitter podcasts in the month of September has been brought to
[01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:27.680]   you by Visa.
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:32.000]   Visa has been very helpful in supporting the podcast.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.120]   They want to get the word out that Visa is a better way to buy online.
[01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:41.840]   I certainly agree with their fraud protection, their constant monitoring, their double guarantee
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:44.920]   that you're not going to have a problem if you use your Visa card online.
[01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:47.920]   It just gives you that safe peace of mind.
[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:50.040]   Visa, safer, better money.
[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:51.640]   Life and Twitter.
[01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.040]   Takes Visa.
[01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:55.880]   Before we go, Scott Borne, what are you working on?
[01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:56.880]   Anything interesting?
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:59.000]   Application that you're interested in?
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.480]   Something new coming down the pipe?
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:02.280]   A heads up about anything?
[01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:07.720]   Well, I've just been thoroughly enjoying the new iTunes music store, which is no longer
[01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:11.920]   called the music store, which is now called the iTunes store.
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:13.720]   I discovered something quiet by accident.
[01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:17.520]   Do you know that if it's because of the way my keyboard's configured, I was kind of leaning
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:22.680]   on my keyboard and I accidentally leaned on the Alt key while launching iTunes.
[01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:28.200]   Guess what? You can now select which folder you want your iTunes library to be.
[01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:29.960]   Automatically.
[01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:33.720]   If you hold down the E when you're starting, you hold down the Alt key.
[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:35.680]   Or the Option key, I guess.
[01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:36.680]   Yeah.
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:38.080]   Create an Option library.
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:40.680]   You could choose a different library every time you launch.
[01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:43.480]   Yes, and I thought, man, now that is cool.
[01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:46.640]   It's a small little thing, but I discovered that.
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:49.760]   I don't know if it's always been this way, but I also discovered that if you wanted to
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:55.360]   see an organized by date list of all your prior purchases, you just go to the store,
[01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:59.040]   view my account, and click purchase history, and there it is, organized by date.
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:01.800]   I don't know if that's always been there, but I found that in the new one, and I think
[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:02.800]   that's cool.
[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:05.520]   Merlin, you don't want to do that because that number is awfully large.
[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:06.880]   No, I don't like to look at that.
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:07.880]   I agree with you, Scott.
[01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:12.120]   I feel like I am still finding so much stuff in this everyday.
[01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:13.120]   Yeah.
[01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:17.960]   If you guys got into this whole skipping thing, yeah, work and track, I'm not sure I get
[01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:18.960]   this right.
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:23.520]   In this, Scott, it will determine whether you skipped over songs, and so it will kind of,
[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:24.520]   is that how that works?
[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:26.160]   It basically remembers banana.
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:28.120]   Let's leave this part out.
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:29.920]   It's a speculation.
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:32.920]   I don't know anything about it, Merlin.
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:35.840]   I'll Google this and be ready for the next one.
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:41.120]   But there's all kinds of great stuff.
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:43.720]   You know what I love in this one is the gapolis playing.
[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:48.600]   It seems like such a stupid thing, but I really, you were talking about classical music.
[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:54.520]   I mean, but even, gosh, listening to you name it, Genesis Records back when they were
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:55.520]   still really good.
[01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:59.520]   You know, and it's all basically one long record and not having that little janky skip
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:00.520]   makes a huge difference.
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:06.960]   And if you page through your album art incessantly.
[01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:09.080]   Mine's not anywhere close to complete.
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:11.200]   I keep saying download it, download it, download it.
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:12.760]   I still have lots of empty albums.
[01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:14.440]   I have a thought on that.
[01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:17.280]   I mean, so I can't remember this cover flow.
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:18.880]   I think it was up the name of the app that it's based on.
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:21.840]   I think cover flow was pulling in the images from Amazon.
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:22.840]   Is that right?
[01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:26.000]   I know, like, for example, there's, I can never remember the names of these apps, but
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.440]   there was the one that would like show your entire desktop would be all out.
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:31.240]   Those pull in based on Amazon data.
[01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:33.200]   And I think the Amazon stuff is a little more forgiving.
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:37.480]   I think if you, if it, if your stuff is a, if it's not on the iTunes store and b, if
[01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:40.920]   it's not named the way the iTunes store likes, I think that may be part of your problem.
[01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:47.240]   I have way too many blank, you know, like, okay, Osamba, which was the wonderful collection
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:50.680]   that was put together by David Byrne of Brazilian Samba music.
[01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:52.880]   Now that was in stores and nothing.
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:55.320]   They don't have that Tropicalia record either.
[01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:58.320]   You know, that, that, that little best of that came out.
[01:09:58.320 --> 01:09:59.880]   Oh, brother, we're out though.
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:00.880]   Not here.
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:05.800]   I mean, just things that, boy, you sure think they would have Jesus Christ Superstar, not
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:06.800]   here.
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:08.560]   I'm just, so it's, it's a, you know, I love it.
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:09.560]   Wow.
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:11.880]   I think it's great, but it needs, it's not complete enough.
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:13.960]   All the new hits in the Leola Porte music.
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:16.120]   Yeah, I'm learning a lot about you.
[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:18.120]   My mind is clearer now.
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:20.640]   Jesus Christ Superstar.
[01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:27.880]   Nobody in the, nobody in the audience knows what you're talking about for you.
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:29.880]   Merlin, man, your tip of the week.
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:35.680]   Oh, man, I, I had a pretty popular post on mind mapping, something a lot of people enjoy.
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:38.680]   You know, it's this kind of ability to like dump a lot of ideas and kind of make a sense.
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:40.600]   Yeah, and you brought, we brought back inspiration.
[01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:41.600]   I love that.
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:45.560]   I loved inspiration until they, until they started chasing the kindergarten market.
[01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:46.760]   That was, that was a terrific guy.
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:47.760]   It's still a good app.
[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:51.840]   I mean, but you know what I discovered, my buddy's over at, at Omni Group, one of my
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:55.440]   favorite companies, I can't say enough good things about, they pointed out that Omni
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:57.440]   Graffle Pro, I don't know if you've seen this.
[01:10:57.440 --> 01:10:58.440]   Do you have Omni Graffle Pro?
[01:10:58.440 --> 01:10:59.440]   I, I do.
[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:00.440]   Yeah.
[01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:04.680]   It's got a built in outlining ability that lets you basically, it pops out as a little drawer
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:09.600]   on the side and lets you basically ad hoc generate, same way you would an Omni outliner,
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:13.480]   generate these super fast outlines that can be, then be generated just like inspiration
[01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:16.640]   into semantic mind maps.
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:18.240]   And it's, it's really fast to do.
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.360]   I'll have a post coming up on this.
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:25.280]   Ken Case told me some really great super secret commands for quickly generating lots of symbols.
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:26.560]   And so I'm having a heck of a time with that.
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:29.520]   I mean, cause a lot of, I mean, there's some good apps out there, but there's some of them
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:31.040]   are pretty costly.
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:35.720]   And some of the, some of the, the open source ones are a little, you know, feels like you're
[01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:36.720]   in swing or something.
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:37.720]   You know what I mean?
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:38.720]   It's got that kind of feeling it.
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:42.800]   But, you know, Omni, Omni Group makes such great polished apps and so I'm having a lot
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:43.800]   of fun with that.
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:45.200]   Got a big post coming up on that.
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:46.200]   So I'm mind mapping.
[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:50.040]   I'm going to steal for my tip of the week something from that you just told me about
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:51.040]   Merlin.
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:53.040]   So it's really Merlin's tip is new from ROGAMI.
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:57.520]   Meeba, it's a new audio editing program called Fission.
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:11:59.840]   Break it down as in nuclear fission.
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:01.400]   I've been looking for a good audio editor.
[01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:03.960]   I actually still edit my stuff on Windows.
[01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:05.520]   I'm ashamed to say it's the last Windows app.
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:06.800]   I still use regularly.
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:08.680]   It's Adobe Audition.
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:12.920]   And Soundtrack Pro, the high end program from Apple just doesn't do it for me.
[01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:19.120]   I've tried Felt tips, studios, Sound Studio and not quite it yet either.
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:20.320]   But I'm looking forward to it.
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:21.320]   I like ROGAMI.
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:22.320]   Good stuff.
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:23.320]   I think audio hijack.
[01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:25.480]   It was a great program and I'm really looking forward to seeing it.
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:27.480]   Fission is like a, it's like a really sharp little pairing knife.
[01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:28.480]   Really literally.
[01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:29.960]   It's, it's there to help you.
[01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:33.720]   I mean, if you've done a lot of podcast recording or whatever, if you've say, you know, let's
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:35.000]   say, let's look at it this way.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.880]   Let's say you've used hijack to grab a stream while you were gone.
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:40.800]   So you got, you know, eight hours of music.
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:44.560]   This is going to really quickly help you run in and split that into separate files, which
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:45.560]   is fine.
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:46.960]   Silence and all that stuff.
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:50.520]   And, and, you know, if I've done it right, you're not going to hear the word banana once
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:51.520]   in this podcast.
[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:53.520]   And that's just how good this editor is.
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:54.920]   They're going to edit that one out.
[01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:55.920]   That banana.
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:57.080]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:58.080]   Now it's your fractal.
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:12:59.080]   Now your fractal.
[01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:01.680]   There's two banana, three bananas.
[01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:02.680]   Four.
[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:06.320]   Let's stop right here and say good night to everybody.
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:10.440]   Scott Warren is part of the iLife Zone, a great podcast and website.
[01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:12.280]   Also podcast zone.
[01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:16.440]   Is that the podcasting podcasting tricks dot com podcast?
