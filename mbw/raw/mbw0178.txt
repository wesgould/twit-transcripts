[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show that covers everything that has to do with Apple, especially the iPad.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Because I have a feeling this is going to be one of them shows.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Right now on the line with me, via Skype.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   The Buffont of all knowledge, Mr. Chris Breen.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   It's great to see you, Chris, senior editor of Macworld.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Hi Leo.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   And the author of Mac 9, is it 911 or 411?
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   It's 911.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   911.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   411 is information. 911 is help.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   And would you really need the big help?
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   We're so glad to have you back on.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   We had you on last week during our iPad coverage and we realized suddenly that Skype is working again for you.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   You know, if you change ISPs, miraculous things happen.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   I mean, we could not pick you up at all, but now you look great.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Well, thank you.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   I've got a new blush and a foundation by using it.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   It's looking lovely.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Well, thank you.

[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Also joining us right now, Mr. Andy Anatko, who needs no makeup.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   He's just beautiful all on his own.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Hello, Mr. I.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   And my suits are by botany 500.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   From the Chicago Sun times.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Back home where you belong.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Yes, back home to the 14 degree weather where you realize that the suit jacket that served you so well in 52 degree San Francisco probably should have been rethought given that we would be lending back.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Well, you're coming back aren't you tomorrow?
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   I'm coming back.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Not tomorrow, but I'm leaving a week from today.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Back to that gum better be left where I left in the bottom of that park bench.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Let's go.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   I trusted you.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Okay.

[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Gum or gun for go.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Well, let's just let's just see what which one is what also here.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Merlin man from 43 folders.com and the great you look nice today.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Podcast.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Alex Lindsey is on assignment in the sasials.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   I kid you not.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   I don't know why.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Is that code for something?
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   No, he's in the state.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   These in the state.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   I'm Ricky San Francisco.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Things you're into.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   No, it's just north of Madagascar.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Oh, I bet it is.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   North of Madagascar.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Another one.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Yes, we have south of market and north of Madagascar.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Is this a lost tie in?
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   I mean, does this island move around from behind?
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   I cannot figure out what he's doing in the Seychell Islands, but it's apparently he says it's work.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   I have that kind of work sometimes.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Ah, pretty good idea.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Alex, he's not here to defend himself, but if he comes back, you know, just a little extra happy.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Remember, we're supposed to just ask if he's lost weight.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   That's right.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   You just look well rested.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   I think that's kind of like a lot of sleep during those three and a half weeks.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   He looks so well rested.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   You know, I hate to do it to you guys, but there really is only one story in the apple world,
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   at least for a while.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   I don't know if there's some other minor stories, but it's the iPad.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Well, I guess we'll start with asking you one by one now a week later what your assessment
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   is.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   I tell you, I did not expect the backlash, the negativity from so many people on the iPad.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   People hate the name, the lack of multitasking, the lack of a camera, the lack of, I don't
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   know, a solar panel on the back.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   People wanted more, I guess.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   What do you think, Chris Breen?
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Are you at this point bullish on the iPad?
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   At least it's ability to sell.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.600]   You know, I am mostly mainly my reaction is just after a week of this, my head is pounding
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:07.000]   and I've been tweeting quotes from the Grinch because I've kind of had it with all the noise,
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.920]   noise, noise about this thing.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.560]   I think it's going to do perfectly well.
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:18.520]   I think that the geeks among us really, really care a lot about Flash and HTML5, but everybody
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.000]   else, meaning the majority of people who buy this thing don't give a damn.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.920]   I mean, it will be a perfectly lovely device.
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.920]   They will pick it up, they will use it.
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.800]   If they encounter pages that don't use or that have Flash and they can't use it, they'll
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.440]   say, oh, that's fine.
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.440]   I'm accustomed to that.
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.200]   I've seen that on my iPod touch.
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.600]   I've seen it on my iPhone.
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.600]   No big deal.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.600]   I'll move along as people continue to use devices like this.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.640]   Then maybe Flash will go away simply because people are choosing other ways to view their
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:45.640]   media.
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:50.080]   But for the most part, it seems like people have forgotten that we've already been here
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.080]   a couple of times.
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.520]   We've done this with the iPod, we've done it with the iPhone.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.320]   The same kind of noise occurred then.
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.040]   It was more about prices in that case than it is now.
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.560]   But still, it's like, well, this is never going to work.
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.960]   It's going to be a terrible failure.
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.640]   And then a year down the line, we all look back and go, oh, look at that.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.200]   People seem to like this device.
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.200]   Yeah.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.440]   You agree, Andy?
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.560]   I really think it's going to be more of a situation where it's going to be the geeks
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.920]   device for the first year.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:26.040]   And during that time, everybody who right now is not unwise for people to be skeptical
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:30.560]   about a device that doesn't have certain basic things that they tend to associate with the
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.560]   computers.
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.480]   It's not unrealistic for them to have those fears.
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.400]   But during that year, the people like us who bought them early, we're going to be in
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.720]   airplanes, we're going to be in conference rooms, we're going to be in restaurants and
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.600]   burrito stands using this thing.
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.760]   And I think a year from now, when all those people, they have five or six hundred bucks
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.720]   to buy a new laptop or buy a new this or that, they're going to remember that.
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.040]   Well, you know, there was that guy in the conference room who was taking notes on an
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.840]   iPad instead of a notebook and that worked really, really well.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.600]   And just remember that time that we were flying from Boston to Boston to San Francisco,
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.880]   there's this guy who had this iPad out for like six whole hours, getting things done
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.680]   and reading things and being entertained.
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.040]   Maybe I'll just at least take a look at it.
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:12.360]   It takes a while for you to realize that a new thing is indeed a new thing and not just
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.200]   a new version of the thing that you've been looking at for the past two or three or four
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.200]   years.
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.760]   It's like everybody's comparing it to the netbook, you know, and I don't know if it's
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.240]   in the book or place.
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:27.120]   I mean, this is one of those instances in which I, there was a really great book about
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.760]   the development of the lunar lander.
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:33.920]   It's just nothing but the project manager of the entire lunar lander problem, a program
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.560]   at Grumman Aviation about how this thing was designed and developed.
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.680]   And it just reminded me of the chapter which he talks about this breakthrough moment in
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.960]   which they're trying to figure out how do we save weight.
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.720]   Gosh, we have these huge windows in the lunar lander.
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.480]   They're structurally bad and they let in too much heat and that's that's a big problem.
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:54.160]   And then suddenly somebody had the idea, wait a minute, what if we just take out the seats?
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.840]   There wasn't, well, we gotta have seats in this thing.
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.760]   Well, no, you don't because this isn't an aircraft that we normally build.
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.040]   This is a spacecraft that operates in almost no gravity.
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:07.440]   Even when it lands on the moon, it's going to be on almost zero gravity.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.560]   And as soon as they deleted the seats, they realized that almost all the other problems
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.320]   that they were having with us designed went away and all because they were trying to design
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:18.280]   this thing to make it like every other thing they've ever built without even thinking about
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.800]   do we need everything that we usually put in one of these things.
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.520]   You talked to a lot of mainstream media, do a lot of interviews.
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.840]   Their interest is still high, yes.
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:32.040]   Still extremely high, chiefly because they know that anything that Apple does, not only
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:35.200]   is it about the thing itself, but it's also about the ripple effect they're going to have
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.920]   to do it not only with society, but other businesses.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:40.240]   So they're still covering this pretty aggressively.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:45.120]   There was a big debate with my producer at CBS about whether we should, we can even afford
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:50.720]   to do my segment after the first Saturday after the event or whether we should just make sure
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.680]   we get on this really, really early and start talking about it beforehand.
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.600]   So there's still a lot of excitement about it.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:59.920]   Merlin, what do you think now a week later in the cold light of day?
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:05.080]   Well, I just want to say for the record that I think Andy's piece that I read the other
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.960]   day about the iPad, I think it was one of the best things I've read.
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.920]   If you hadn't read it, you should check it out.
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.000]   And that's that's in that paper you're right for, Andy.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.400]   Is that where people can find that?
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.400]   Yes, sometimes.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.400]   Sometimes.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.400]   It's really good.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.400]   It was very good.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.960]   The smartest things I've heard people say about this.
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.080]   And again, the tagline is it does make sense.
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.080]   Right?
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.080]   Yeah.
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.080]   Yeah.
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.160]   And I mean, partly it's also that he spent a little bit more time with it than a lot of
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:32.360]   people who were as you went dashing off to meet a deadline and you saw in the limited
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.680]   amount of time you have what it's capable of.
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.120]   The smartest things that I feel like I'm hearing from people are people who are saying, you
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.120]   know what?
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.560]   We haven't really spent much time with it yet.
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:44.360]   But based on what we've seen so far, it's clear that this is something different.
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:50.400]   And so number one, I think, yes, anytime something new comes out that we haven't had
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.400]   time with, we're, you know, past this prologue, we're always going to use the vocabulary and
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.480]   use cases of previous things.
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.800]   So I forget who did this.
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.680]   Probably everybody who wrote about this said the same thing.
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:03.160]   But do you remember when was it the iMac came out and it wasn't going to have a floppy?
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.160]   Yeah.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.160]   It's huge.
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.840]   And I come up there, okay?
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:07.840]   Yeah.
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.080]   It's starting to get a little weird.
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.080]   It'll get better now.
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.400]   But do you remember when the iMac came out and it wasn't, yeah, I'm back and there wasn't
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.400]   going to be a floppy.
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.400]   Right.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.400]   The first time I had no floppy.
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:21.040]   People flip because, you know, at the time, you know, you could, you could do, there's
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.040]   a million cases of this.
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:25.200]   Like when Clinton did their welfare reform, there's all these things that happen and then
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.200]   strangely enough, the world doesn't end.
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.200]   It doesn't mean it's going to get better.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.720]   It doesn't mean it's going to get worse.
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.240]   But the truth is when things change, it's not always incremental.
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.240]   It's really true.
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:39.360]   People don't like change and no matter what the change is, big or small, there's always
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:44.360]   this kind of moment where people just, a certain percentage just freak out.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:49.760]   But you, but that's, but what you're saying is this is, is this is a paradigm shift to
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:50.760]   use an overused phrase.
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:51.760]   You're saying this is kind of an inflection.
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:57.520]   I don't know if it's a paradigm shift, but I will say that this is a company that has
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:00.280]   a record of shifting paradigms from time to time.
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:05.160]   What I will say is that a lot of, I think a lot of the arrows people are shooting are
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:09.680]   falling away short because it's either not germane to the kind of audience that would
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:13.160]   use this or they're leaving out really important facts.
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.560]   The most important is flash business.
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:21.040]   I mean, flash started out as this goofy thing for having little kind of rich media animations
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.040]   on pages.
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.040]   And then God love it.
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.080]   It took over the entire frickin' world and people started making whole sites out of
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:30.280]   it, it became way for a designer to build a portfolio in the back of some company.
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:33.800]   I'm sorry, I have strong feelings about flash and I'm just really kind of saying this whole
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:34.800]   thing.
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.760]   People think flash equals equals, right?
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.920]   That flash is the equivalent of streaming.
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.360]   We know a real player used to be our only choice for streaming too.
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.520]   And now you've not seen quite so much.
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.000]   So I just want to be really clear that, you know, if you look at stuff, what's the thing
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.520]   Gruber link to the other day?
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.520]   The new, the new, the new, the new, the new, the new, the new, the new, the new, the new
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:51.520]   Live player.
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:52.520]   Oh yeah, the, the, the, you, you.
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:53.520]   Sublime video.
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:54.520]   Yeah.
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:55.520]   Yeah.
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.120]   So, so, so, Sublime video.
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:01.240]   This is, I'm getting this straight out during Fireball, but there's, if you go to, uh, Jillian.com
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.120]   with 1L, I believe, it's a HTML5 video player.
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:09.160]   It doesn't work in Firefox yet, but as a proof of concept, super interesting uses JavaScript
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.680]   to do a lot of the rich stuff that you wouldn't do with straight HTML.
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.160]   But it just goes to show you evolution happens.
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:20.040]   I don't want to rant, but it just, I'm so sick of this whole, like, uh, say, uh, this
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:26.560]   cancercy because, uh, or flash, and it's like, you know, things come and go.
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:29.000]   And uh, you know, I, it drives me crazy.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.280]   I'm on my iPhone and I want to find out what are the two things that you want to find out
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.160]   about when you're on the road, right?
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.840]   Bands and restaurants, right?
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.240]   There's this band playing.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.240]   Where's the restaurant?
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.360]   And those are the two people who most often have flashlight.
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.360]   There's an age goal.
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.360]   Unusable.
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.360]   Isn't that funny?
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.360]   You can't use it.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.920]   But there is an age golf here because, uh, for me, it's bathrooms and restaurants, but,
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.520]   but other than that, there should be an app for that.
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.720]   Uh, no, I'm with you.
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.600]   And in fact, I think I admire Apple's stance on flash.
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:59.760]   Oh, here, here comes some sublime video.
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.440]   This is the sublime video player.
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:08.520]   But you can go to, you know, you can participate in the HTML 5 demo on YouTube.
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:09.960]   They're doing beta of most of their video.
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:15.400]   If you go to YouTube.com/html5 and most of that video, if you've ever watched, if you
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.520]   ever watched a video on YouTube on your phone, this shouldn't be such a mystery.
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:19.520]   Right.
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:20.520]   As I understand it.
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:21.520]   It's H.264.
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:22.520]   Yeah.
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:23.520]   Yeah.
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:25.320]   H.264, which is an open standard, right?
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:30.720]   Now, and I had my, I was saying I admire Apple for putting a flag in the sand and saying,
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:34.800]   okay, uh, we're going to take some heat for this, but we really want to move away from
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:35.800]   flash.
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.560]   You know, I saw an interesting on tech crunch today.
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:41.000]   There's an interesting, uh, it's a really a rumor piece.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.240]   Um, the folks at chromium, which who are not technically affiliated with Google and
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:49.760]   yet, um, there's some Google association because they're doing the, the open source
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:50.760]   builds of Chrome.
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:55.320]   Uh, they're, they're showing a video which was created by somebody from Google of a
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.320]   Chrome tablet.
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:00.720]   Now it's a, it's kind of a mock up, but it, but it's an interesting thing to see.
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:05.800]   It's, it's, you know, the, the Chrome OS does play flash, of course, but it's all browser.
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:09.760]   I mean, you know, basically it's, it's, it's to say it's an OS is to, is to give it a little
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:10.760]   too much credit.
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:14.600]   It's basically a big browser, but I would be very, I'm less interested in frankly a
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:15.600]   Chrome OS tablet.
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.440]   I'd be very interested in an Android tablet.
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.440]   Yeah.
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:23.800]   It's, I really think that the, that we already have, uh, Acer saying that, yeah, you know,
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:27.480]   how last year we were making noise about maybe doing a tablet, we've decided that we'd much
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:31.520]   rather not try to compete with a $500 Apple tablet and we make enough money as it is on
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:32.520]   our other businesses.
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:33.560]   So we're not even going to get involved.
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:37.520]   And I think we're going to see a lot of the things that were demonstrated last month, uh,
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.920]   not because, or not going to be seen again, not because they were not good products, but
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:43.960]   because they know now how competitive the space is going to be.
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:49.160]   Uh, it really, it really is a classic face off between what is better, a machine that
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:53.680]   doesn't do everything but does what it does extremely well and is very flexible or something
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:58.120]   that just packs in as much features as possible for a very, very good, very, very low price.
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:02.600]   Uh, I mean, there are people, I've had Android versus iPhone arguments over dinner tables
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:06.440]   with people, uh, often enough to know that there are people that are certainly willing
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:10.920]   to sacrifice usability and certainly willing to sacrifice a clean interface.
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:13.240]   So long as they can say, well, I can do this, this, this, and this.
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.960]   And if a year from now, I want to do this, it seems as though it will be possible for
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:18.520]   me to do it as opposed to having to wait for Apple to support it.
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:22.920]   I, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm fully, the Nexus one is now my full-time phone.
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.560]   The iPhone is in a, on a shelf somewhere.
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:29.960]   Um, and I am fully happy with the Nexus one as a phone, but I have to say even for me
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:33.600]   as an Nexus one user, I'm thrilled about the iPad because those three or four applications
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:39.480]   I miss, including my Sonos five remote control mint, uh, will be replaced with the iPad.
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:43.200]   And I've been thinking as I think of applications to the iPad, my mom does cross-out.
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.560]   Crossword puzzles.
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:50.640]   This is going to be the deluxe crossword puzzle machine among every other thing that you get.
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:52.440]   It'll be perfect for that or Sudoku.
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:56.840]   And I also think that the Apple did a really smart thing with a 4.99 price point.
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:02.200]   And the more I think about it, I think, you know, a number of analysts said, uh, uh,
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:05.920]   oh, nobody's going to buy 4.99 people always buy the second one up and so forth.
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.720]   I think, I think they're going to sell a lot of 4.99s and I don't think they're going
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.520]   to sell that well on the higher price price.
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:13.640]   I think the, uh, I think this is the perfect parent computer.
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:18.120]   Uh, my mom has an IMAX and she now has a laptop, but she's not comfortable with a laptop.
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:23.080]   And I could easily see getting her this device because not only is it great for crosswords,
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:28.320]   but it's a good computer to have in the kitchen so she can watch iTunes videos on the thinking
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:32.680]   while she's cooking or she can look up recipes and she can get on the web and she can do
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:33.680]   email.
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:37.400]   And it's all just tap, tap, tap, tap, tap and none of this now opens Safari and you're
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.600]   going to have to enter this and you're going to have to go over here and do that.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:44.960]   She's smart enough to do all those things, but for a $500 device to just put in her hands
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:48.920]   and say, I think you can figure this out in about 10 minutes and she will be able to.
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.240]   And I think most people will be into.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.680]   So I think you're going to see a lot of geeks in the first year.
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:57.720]   Next time the holiday season comes around, there's going to be an iPad under the tree.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:03.440]   I think one, uh, an unremarked thing even by me is the idea that this could be the first
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:09.240]   truly modern computer and the first truly modern operating system ever released.
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:14.120]   Because everything else has started with some leftover of old hardware designs or old operating
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:15.280]   system designs.
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:19.400]   If the one feature that Apple can sell the iPad on is that this is the computer that
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:23.320]   doesn't freeze, doesn't crash, you turn it on and it will work.
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:24.840]   It will do things that you expect it to do.
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:28.400]   And it doesn't expect you to do things in a way that's been done for 20 years just because
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.440]   that's the way we've always done it.
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:34.760]   One of the things that I had to write my piece, it was a considered hopefully in a research
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:38.320]   piece hopefully, but it was also a first day piece about the iPad.
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:43.240]   And one of the one things I was openly concerned about is the lack of an open file system that
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:48.120]   that I would get on a tablet or an Android device that I typically can't get on an iPhone.
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:52.400]   And of course, then the developer documentation started floating around discovering that Apple
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:56.120]   has come up apparently something with something better than an open file system.
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:18:01.400]   I can't browse the directory system of the entire device, but every time I need a word
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.840]   file, it will show me every word file that's relevant to my task right now.
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:05.840]   You can now.
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:06.840]   That's perfect.
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:07.840]   Right.
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:11.800]   That's going to be a computing experience that's full of stuff like that where, oh geez, I
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.000]   can't configure a new printer.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.760]   Well, you don't have to configure a new printer.
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:18.520]   It'll just simply sense where things can print to and ask you which one has to go to.
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:19.520]   What's your next problem?
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.000]   I can't use Flash.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.360]   Well, we're giving you something better than Flash.
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:26.760]   Also, we're giving you something that won't cause the machine to slow down freeze.
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:30.400]   Well, no multitasking again, or make it more stable.
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.160]   It could be a very interesting new shift.
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:36.200]   I think there's two patterns that are interesting here.
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:40.360]   The one that's on obvious pattern, I think obvious pattern, is that people in general
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:47.680]   are becoming more comfortable with technology that's not permanently fixed to a location
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:49.160]   or a use.
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:54.240]   Typically, in the past, you learn how to fire up windows and do a spreadsheet or whatever.
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:57.560]   I think over time, people through things like phones have gotten more comfortable.
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:00.600]   That's a typical adoption curve kind of thing, nothing unusual.
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:05.520]   To me, the other thing that's a lot more interesting is we're going to continue to see
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:11.160]   a split amongst the people who use different kinds of technology.
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.480]   I was thinking in terms of vegetarians.
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:17.360]   If you were a vegetarian in 1950 and you met another vegetarian, you wouldn't care about
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.640]   anything else that that person did, just because you're both vegetarians.
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:21.640]   Not today.
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:22.640]   That's interesting.
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:26.920]   The reason somebody's a vegetarian could be because they don't like tainted beef.
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:28.440]   It could be for their health.
[00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.280]   It could be for moral reasons.
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:32.040]   It could be for a million reasons.
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:40.360]   To assume that you can make a decision about somebody based on a noun like Apple user.
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:44.720]   I just think that's becomes a pretty weak way to really determine how people use this
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:45.720]   stuff.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.920]   The reasons and the ways we use this stuff are going to continue to explode and splinter
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.120]   in really interesting ways.
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.640]   The only reason I say that, when somebody sits around and goes, "Well, if there's enough
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:20:00.840]   flash or it doesn't have five cameras," maybe someday there'll be one that does.
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:02.800]   Maybe sooner than Sunday.
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:08.000]   What about the rumors that Apple might in fact ship put some of this stuff in before
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   the thing comes out?
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   We got two months, right?
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.880]   You want to say, "Okay, great.
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:15.240]   It's a coffee cup, but it has a camera."
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:17.240]   That must be your perfect iPad.
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.240]   It's a great...
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.760]   It's a coffee cup and a camera.
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.560]   Somebody also said to me, "Think about it.
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:23.560]   Put a camera.
[00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.240]   Just do a mock-up of a camera and iPad.
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:28.800]   It's just going to be shooting up people's noses."
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:32.360]   Unless you hold it like that, the iPad really is...
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:33.360]   This is a good point.
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:37.040]   It's going to be more like here or even on the ground.
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.800]   It's not going to be an ideal camera device.
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.480]   You'd have to hold it up or put it on a stand.
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.400]   Not that that means there won't be a camera, and there may well be a camera.
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.400]   Who knows?
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:48.400]   There's some evidence that there's room for a camera.
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.400]   Well, yeah.
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:55.520]   There was somebody in a parts house, I guess, got frames for the iPad replacement parts,
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:59.040]   and there's a little divot in there where...
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.360]   And they said, "Oh, look, if we could...
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:05.600]   We'll just take this camera out of this Mac book, bro, and it fits perfectly."
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:06.600]   So maybe...
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.160]   "Meenie, meenie, meenie."
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.160]   Yes.
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:12.520]   I mean, certainly for V2, yes, a camera makes sense.
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:13.520]   V1, maybe.
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:17.800]   Maybe they throw it in there and say, "Oh, by the way, you get this too."
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:18.800]   I would see...
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:22.240]   I think it's much more likely that any extra cycles they've got are going to be spent
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:23.240]   on performance.
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:26.000]   And I don't know anything about this process, I'm pulling this out of my ass.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.600]   But my guess is that they're going to work on performance enhancements, engineering
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:31.840]   stuff, and just polishing.
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:33.480]   I can't imagine they would add a lot of heart.
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:34.480]   Speed is critical.
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:35.480]   Speed is critical.
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:36.480]   And I think...
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:37.480]   That's what Andy said.
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:38.480]   Andy said, "This thing's a monster in terms of speed."
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:39.480]   Yeah.
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.480]   In fact, the people who've held it...
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.520]   It's funny, I kind of took it out of my mind that I've actually looked at it and looked
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:45.320]   at the website, and I had the same reaction that a lot of people are having.
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.400]   It looks like the fat nano.
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.400]   It looks wrong.
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:51.480]   The pictures do not do it justice.
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:53.600]   You get two impressions when you actually hold it.
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:55.880]   One is the elegance of the design.
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.840]   But the other is just raw speed.
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:58.840]   Exactly.
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:04.640]   I was doing ridiculous things with this, like just saying, "Well, here's the browser,
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.760]   and of course I can zoom in and out by squeezing and stretching.
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.080]   And if I just do this, it'll just really freak it out."
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:11.120]   But no, it was absolutely keeping up with me.
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:14.680]   If I went like this, suddenly in one man of a second, it zoomed into where...
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:16.520]   And Beléricé was now this big.
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:18.440]   And that's a great feeling when that happens.
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:22.200]   It's neat.
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:26.000]   That's why I get back to the idea of the first time that someone goes into a Best Buy or
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.960]   something, intending to buy a cheap $500 Windows Notebook.
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:32.680]   They're going to see a cheap $500 Windows Notebook.
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:36.440]   A lot of these $500 Windows Notebooks, it's a full notebook with a full keyboard, but
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:37.440]   it can't eat...
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.680]   And a camera and flash and multi-dasking.
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:40.960]   And the processing is...
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:45.280]   The processor is not even good enough to really play full screen-full frame video.
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.080]   You have to re-optimize it for mobile.
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:52.440]   And yet this $500 device, it screams quality with every tap of the button.
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:59.800]   Every time you move something, the example that I kept coming back to is we've seen e-book
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:03.760]   readers, like software readers for phones and stuff, where they try to get clever and
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:07.320]   say, "Well, we'll have this turn pages like a book.
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:11.520]   We'll flip it to the left and we'll be an animation of a page flipping to the left."
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:12.520]   And okay, that's cute.
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:13.520]   You see...
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:15.280]   It always feels like, "Okay."
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:18.840]   It always feels as though the devices is hearing you saying, "I understand that you've just
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:20.040]   given a command to turn a page.
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.200]   I will now play an animation of the page turning."
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.760]   And what that page turning is completely now continuing reading.
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:29.120]   With the iPad, you put your finger on the lower corner of the page, you drag the page...
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:34.520]   You drag the page over until the springiness of that page causes to flip over on its own.
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:37.240]   It feels as though you're actually interacting with a sheet of paper.
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:39.000]   It's that kind of responsive.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.880]   I was really wondering...
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:45.400]   One category I'd love to see is what happens when people start to build musical instruments
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.400]   for this.
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:51.320]   I mean, even the grand piano apps for the iPhone are damn responsive and damn interactive.
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:54.600]   I can't wait to see what happens when these developers start saying, "Well, now we have
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.040]   enough screen real estate.
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:58.200]   We can actually put a full hand on this.
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:01.680]   It will be fast enough and responsible enough that you can actually play a note and have
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:04.080]   it go out pretty much when you expect it to go out."
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:06.520]   I'm going to talk about some other things.
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:08.680]   We're going to talk about the A4 chip.
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:15.120]   From rumors, I talked to Philip Ryu about his program classics, which the iBook program
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.920]   looks a lot like.
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:20.200]   We have a lot more to talk about, including our picks of the week, but we're going to
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:21.200]   take a break and come back.
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.960]   Paul Kans going to join us in a few minutes, too, to talk about Mackerel Expo.
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:25.800]   He's got an update on that.
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:27.440]   I'm going to tell you a little bit about what I'm doing.
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.960]   I'm very excited about what I'm going to do at Mackerel Expo, and I know Andy's got
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:31.400]   some seminars and so forth.
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:34.840]   But before we go on, I do want to mention my friends at Citrix and the folks who do go
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:36.880]   to my PC.
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:41.680]   This is the program that lets you access your computer anywhere you go.
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:46.160]   They want it especially to be on Macke break because they want to remind you, "Go to my
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.520]   PC works on Macs."
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:54.000]   In fact, you can access a Mac from a PC, access a PC from a Mac, access a Mac from a Mac.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.960]   It is kind of the universal bottle opener for computing.
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:02.360]   I'll tell you what, you could try it right now for free for 30 days, and I really encourage
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:03.360]   you to do this.
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:07.840]   Everyone's going to get emails from people who say, "Well, I tried it, but it doesn't
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:13.440]   do the one thing I needed or it doesn't work in my environment or whatever it is."
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:20.000]   This is why I've always asked all of our advertisers to offer free trials because then you'll know.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.360]   Don't go out and buy it right away.
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.800]   Just try before you buy it.
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:25.520]   Go to go to myPC.com/Macbreak.
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:28.240]   You'll get 30 days free, and it's unlimited.
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:31.200]   When they first started, they said one hour, and I said, "No, I want you to be able to
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.800]   use it all day, every day."
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:34.160]   They said, "Okay."
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:39.160]   For the Macbreak audience, "Okay, go to myPC.com/Macbreak."
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.160]   You could try it right now.
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.920]   It'll take you about 30 seconds to install.
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:42.920]   It's that fast.
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:45.320]   There's no firewall port forwarding, no configuration.
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:50.720]   It does not traversal, so it's actually very elegant in the way it works, yet completely
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.280]   secure.
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:55.800]   Unlike most other remote access products, there's never been an exploit.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:56.920]   There's never been a hack.
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:58.960]   This thing is 128-bit SSL.
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:05.960]   In fact, if you're at a sketchy internet access spot, if you're at a hotel or whatever, safest
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:08.400]   thing to do, log on to your work computer.
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:09.400]   We use a go to myPC.
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:10.400]   It's like VPN.
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:14.640]   Now you're completely connected, completely securely through a tunnel, and now you could
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:17.040]   surf safely.
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:18.040]   It's award-winning.
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:21.760]   Of course, PCworld gave it their world-class award, yet again for best remote access software.
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:22.920]   I think it's almost a gimme.
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:23.920]   There is nothing better out there.
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:24.920]   It is the best.
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:25.920]   I've tried it.
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:28.840]   I use it all the time, and I encourage you to try it for free right now.
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:29.840]   Go to myPC.com/MacBreak.
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:30.840]   Give it a try.
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:41.240]   I think you'll find many, many uses for it, but that's what the free trial is all about.
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.440]   What was I going to say?
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:45.120]   I was a for chip.
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.320]   Now I don't know how much of this is rumors or not.
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:53.400]   One of the reasons the iPad is so fast is Apple's done some custom silicon, right side
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:58.800]   of news.com, which I had not heard of before, but apparently Daniela, "Custum" is a real
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:03.680]   master who does this, is pretty expert on hardware.
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:08.480]   She was at a global foundries event in Las Vegas and spoke with the CEO of Arm, Warren
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:09.800]   East.
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:13.920]   This was before the iPad was released, so she wasn't able to write about it until after
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.560]   the release.
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:25.720]   But apparently, PI semi-founder Dan Dauberfri, and by the way, what a great name, Dauberfuy,
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:32.320]   by the way, PI semi is the chip foundry that Apple bought some a couple of years ago,
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:39.920]   was the lead designer, the founder of PI semi, of the alpha and strong arm processors, the
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:41.560]   deck alpha.
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:46.360]   And it's her belief that the A4 is, and according to what she's been told, it's a system on
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:52.920]   a chip that integrates an Arm Cortex A9, which is the same thing used in the Tegra and the
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:28:00.600]   Qualcomm Snapdragon, with the Arm Malley GPU, which is a very fast graphics processor.
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.520]   So it's all in one chip.
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:07.600]   Memory controller is also on the silicon.
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:14.120]   So it's kind of an impressive chip, but it isn't really Apple designed particularly.
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:17.080]   It's kind of Apple glued together.
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:20.160]   Does that much match with Chris Breen, what you've been hearing about this?
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.320]   Yeah, that has been what I've heard.
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:25.760]   When the thing first came out and they saw the A4 processor in there, I don't think anybody
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:29.960]   thought that Apple had suddenly gone into the chip making business.
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:32.600]   It certainly acquired that kind of talent.
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:36.880]   And I think it shows that if we look at the past room, things like the PowerPC chips,
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:41.600]   where Apple sort of was at the mercy of the people who made these things and it didn't
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:46.800]   happen as quickly as they wanted, they established a relationship with Intel and so that they
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:51.800]   could get things, have a little more influence, but now that they've acquired these kind of
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:55.920]   manufacturers and then can go there and say, you know, this is the sort of chip we need.
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:29:00.400]   And then the chip manufacturer's attention is not going to be diverted that, yes, we
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:05.520]   serve you, oh, Master Steve and the rest of you, it happens.
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:08.760]   Yes, we will deliver on time and it will be as fast as you'd like.
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:13.000]   As the Proster Chan says in our chat room, unfortunately, there's really no way to know
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.120]   this unless others leak it and I'm sure they won't, except by, I don't know, taking it
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:18.120]   up.
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:19.120]   You can't really take it apart.
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:21.600]   I guess you could disassemble to die and maybe try to figure out what's in there.
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:24.080]   So we may never know, but this makes sense.
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:28.400]   Now, Tegra is dual core arm A9.
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.960]   Nobody's saying whether this dual core or not.
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:32.600]   So we just don't know.
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.320]   It would explain the speed though, I have to say.
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:39.760]   But if it's dual core, then it begs the question, well, why not multitask?
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:43.760]   I mean, battery, battery, you think, maybe.
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:49.360]   I think a lot of it's about power and reliability, but power.
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:55.360]   I think so, because you keep looking at people with their iPhones and we may have forgotten
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:58.640]   those of us who have iPhones for the last couple of years.
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:02.360]   But if you go back and look at the cell phone that you had prior to that and you could leave
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:06.360]   it uncharged for a week and you could still make a call on the thing, I can't do that
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:07.360]   with my iPhone now.
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:11.880]   I use my iPhone as it's meant to be used, meaning not only for making calls, but computing
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:12.880]   with it.
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:16.960]   At the end of every day, I have to plug it in or maybe before the end of that day, I
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.040]   have to plug the thing in.
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:22.720]   So I think that Apple has to be very concerned about power consumption.
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:27.200]   There's a lot of conspiracy theory that Apple's, you know, all of this is to lock it down,
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.200]   is to lock the buyer in.
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.200]   Well, that'd be unusual.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:34.200]   I've never heard of that, huh?
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:39.200]   Yeah, I know.
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:42.200]   It seems usually really all about making it easy for you.
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:46.000]   It's like Casablanca when Claude Raines goes gambling.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   I'm shocked.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   I'm shocked.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   I think there's another relevant line from Casablanca where Peter Laurie says, "Rake,
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.920]   you must hate, you despise me, don't you, Rake?"
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:00.440]   And then, you just sort of glances over and saying, "I don't know if I ever gave you
[00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:02.440]   a second thought like that would."
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:06.240]   And I think if Apple ever gave you a second thought, maybe they'd think about how they
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:08.520]   can screw you over by locking you into a decision.
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:14.680]   I think it's just corporate culture that says, "Before we make this choice, will it make the
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:16.720]   platform more stable or less stable?
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:19.840]   Will it make it easier to use or harder to use?
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:21.640]   Will it complicate things or simplify things?"
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:25.360]   And I think that's the reasons why they're not doing multitasking.
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:29.520]   Also, realize that they can't just simply press a button and simply decide, "Great
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:32.080]   now, all applications can live simultaneously."
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:36.840]   They need to have some sort of a new common system resource so that they can all interact
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:40.000]   with the user at the same time without bumping heads with each other.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.040]   Android has that nice little notification bar, but even that sometimes...
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:45.120]   Well, I love that by the way.
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:50.280]   See, again, it's okay, but it's a little bit cludgy because if I've...
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:54.680]   Like Chris mentioned, if I've got the Nexus phone out for about overnight, by the time
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:59.080]   I pick it up again in the morning, I have to scroll through two dozen different notifications
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:01.120]   from all these different things.
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:06.840]   Also, I had a cricket problem with it about the second night because it was in the other
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:09.560]   room and just would keep going, "Kricka, click, click, click, click."
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:11.480]   You could turn all that stuff off, you know.
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:13.480]   Well, you have total control of that.
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:14.480]   But that was the problem.
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:18.320]   I had to go through, "Okay, which of these nine applications is making that noise?"
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:20.760]   And I had to go through each and every one of them.
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:26.600]   It's like having your web browser and realizing that suddenly you start hearing, "It a word.
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:28.880]   We're love was again the lot."
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:29.880]   Damn it.
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:34.200]   It's one of these 40 tabs and windows just suddenly open to Flashadd and just going through
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.920]   one after the other closing windows.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:39.000]   But I spent a lot of time tweaking it.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.480]   And you get in the habit of every time you install an application is looking in the settings,
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:43.560]   of course.
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:48.080]   And then when it says notifications, you control the notifications and what's going on with
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:49.080]   it.
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:52.560]   But that's the Apple way of doing it would be to make sure that you don't have to go looking
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:54.160]   through notifications to turn things off.
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.600]   Yeah, they have one global setting in the settings.
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:01.960]   I think it would be more like, first of all, having 10 minutes alone in a darkened room
[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:06.700]   with a rubber hose with this developer saying, "Do you really want to make the phone go kick?
[00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:08.520]   That rant of intervals.
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:09.800]   Is it really that important?"
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:10.800]   But I love it.
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:14.520]   I love that I can have, for instance, my Twitter application tweets when there's a direct message
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:15.940]   and I can control when it tweets.
[00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:19.480]   And at first I had it turned on for mentions, but I get too many, so I turned that off.
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:21.280]   I love that kind of granularity.
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:23.920]   And this is that Windows Mac argument too.
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:28.680]   I mean, Windows has all these little fiddly bits buried all over the place.
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:33.440]   And geeks like that, but it isn't maybe very user friendly, right?
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:38.280]   It's the oldest metaphor in the Mac world is the Protestant versus Catholic.
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:40.320]   And you might have said that in the 80s.
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:46.320]   But there was an essay a very long time ago about how PC users are Protestants and Mac
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:47.880]   users are Catholics.
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:49.760]   Because we want the mediated experience.
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:51.760]   It's like we want to be able to control it.
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:55.160]   It's one thing to be able to fire up my text editor and change a P list.
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:56.960]   But I don't want to have to do that to check my mail.
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:57.960]   Right.
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:58.960]   Yeah.
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:03.960]   But I think we also get back to the idea of why do we want multitasking just so that
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:05.880]   we can say that we have multitasking?
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:11.560]   When you consider how fast I can switch between applications on my iPhone, if you, if Apple,
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:14.720]   we're, let's say Apple, we're going to be really, really being spirited and start lying
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:21.680]   to us and say, "Okay, well, today's we're reintroduced Apple OS update 3.1.2," which
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:24.000]   they actually did, by the way, about an hour ago.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.560]   And we've, we've listened to our, to our, to you people complaints.
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:29.200]   We have added multitasking now.
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.760]   We, it runs all apps simultaneously.
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.320]   But they didn't tell us that they didn't actually do anything at all.
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:38.000]   All they did was make sure that there's no longer any cues that you're closing down one
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   running app and switching to another.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.120]   Every single blogger would say, "My God, this is great.
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:46.560]   Now it's maybe half, only half a second slower than on my Nexus phone, but it's true multitasking
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:47.560]   and it works great."
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:52.060]   I mean, if you give me, I don't want the feature, I want the effects of the feature.
[00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:55.960]   And I think the iPhone delivers at least 80% of the effects of having real multitasking.
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:56.960]   Yeah.
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:57.960]   Yeah.
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:59.960]   I'd like multitasking.
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:00.960]   Yeah.
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:06.120]   And I'm not, I, I, I, I have to say that I miss it the most when I'm traveling because
[00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:10.880]   when I go into my flat, flight tracker, I just want to do one swipe, take a look at the latest
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:14.240]   data, update on my flight and then switch back to my book or whatever I'm doing.
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:15.900]   That's what I really miss multitasking.
[00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:16.900]   Yeah.
[00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:20.300]   Also with limited, limited amounts of time, the thing I run into in somebody's like an
[00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:25.420]   airport thing that drives me freaking crazy about the, what is it, the T-Mobile service.
[00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:29.140]   You know, it takes, by the time I'm done trying to log in and buying extra points and stuff
[00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:31.580]   like that, I got to get back on the plane.
[00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:32.580]   It's really frustrating.
[00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:36.880]   It's those little periods of time, you know, I think the busier you are, the more you travel,
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:41.680]   the more kind of CEO like you are, the more you need that blast of power when you need
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:42.680]   it.
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:44.680]   You can't just sit there and let something render, you know.
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:49.140]   Can I talk to someone thing, you know, I don't know anything about chips, but I do know that
[00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:54.180]   Apple likes to control everything they can vertically and that's been good to them.
[00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:57.060]   You know, if you think about, you know, this is, let's talk in a group about this the other
[00:35:57.060 --> 00:36:02.380]   night, you think about how every piece of it locks together, right?
[00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:05.660]   I mean, this is again, this is an old point, but it's worth making.
[00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:07.340]   I don't know if the chip thing's about multitasking.
[00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:08.740]   I don't know what part it's about.
[00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:12.540]   All I know is that the thing that Steve does not want to do is walk on stage and have to
[00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:14.340]   apologize for AT&T.
[00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:17.560]   He does not want to walk on stage and have to apologize for Motorola.
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:21.300]   He wants to put a line up behind him, shut up, and let him push out a product that makes
[00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:22.920]   everybody's jaw drop.
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:26.040]   And the last thing he wants is have to have to depend on some bonehead company that he
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:29.440]   has no control over with his crazy control problems.
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:32.920]   So I think that's, I mean, I don't know anything about how these things get made, but it would
[00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:38.360]   not surprise me at all if, to the extent possible, they will control every piece of
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:39.360]   this.
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:43.160]   Up to, I will say, you know, oh, look at things like Pixar involvement, right?
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:45.740]   They're getting more involved in the media that's on there.
[00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:48.840]   I think every chance they get, they're going to try and get their fingers into every piece
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:50.480]   of the process.
[00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:51.480]   Over?
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:53.880]   It's an interesting debate.
[00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:57.040]   No, no, you're making me think, Merlin.
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:00.400]   I know that something that rarely happens on this show, but I'm actually...
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:02.560]   I liked, I liked, I had a G1 for a while.
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:05.680]   I mentioned this a few weeks ago.
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:09.040]   And there was, I, initially, I had exactly the same reaction.
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:11.120]   I was like, wow, the iPhone.
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:13.680]   Can't do anything on there.
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:15.880]   Look at all these apps, blah, blah.
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:18.040]   And it was really, and again, this is the G1.
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:22.560]   This is not the sexy one you've got, but it didn't take more than a couple of days.
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:26.640]   And one usage of my iPhone, until I went, oh, that's why I like that.
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:28.080]   I did the same thing.
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:29.080]   I did the same thing.
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:31.480]   Store, the store was a mess.
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:33.480]   It was really hard to do super basic things.
[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:34.480]   Well, first of all, we come...
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:35.720]   It was, it's updated.
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:36.720]   Every app was like four steps.
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:38.280]   Yeah, but it's a year later.
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:41.720]   It's a year later, so that's one thing.
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:43.920]   The G1 was the first iteration.
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:47.160]   The other thing, and this is what you see in the iPad, is speed makes a big difference.
[00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:50.080]   And the G1 was really underpowered.
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:51.680]   Speed makes a huge difference.
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:52.680]   There's a one...
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:53.680]   I want to start now.
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:54.680]   Mine is dead.
[00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:56.160]   My G1 will not even start up.
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:57.160]   I've done the whole thing.
[00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:58.160]   I've done all the way.
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:37:59.160]   Mine's in a drawer.
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:00.160]   I mean, it's not...
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:03.160]   But the Nexus one is not the G1.
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:05.800]   However, I'm not here to defend either.
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:09.000]   And I would be very interested to see what an Android tablet looks like, but I think it's
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.800]   pretty clear it would not have the same ease of use.
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:13.640]   You know what's interesting?
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:18.440]   As OS X has evolved, the differences between it and Windows in terms of pure ease of use
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:20.240]   have really almost...
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:21.760]   are almost completely gone.
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:24.520]   It is a complex, full-blown operating system.
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:26.440]   And in a way, that's why I liked seeing the iPad.
[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:32.840]   It was a kind of a return to Apple's initial mission, which was for the rest of us, right?
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:33.840]   Something easy to use.
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:38.520]   OS X hasn't been that easy to use in years.
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:40.120]   And hasn't always felt that fast.
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:41.120]   I mean...
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:42.120]   That's true too.
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:43.120]   From the early days, I could be wrong.
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:44.120]   This might just be my memory.
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:50.280]   But I think about being on something in my memory, being on an SE30, running 7.0, whatever
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:55.880]   one of the odd-numbered good releases was, running 7.0 points something.
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:39:03.800]   I want to say like five or seven versus running early OS X revisions before, I guess, Jaguar.
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:07.920]   It was like, no contest.
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:10.200]   My Mac in 1989 felt about twice as fast.
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:11.320]   Now, is that me?
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:12.320]   Or what do you guys think?
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:17.800]   No, it was, because you know, those days, when we were running like 10.2, and you took
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:21.160]   the opportunity to go actually boot back into OS 9.
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:23.560]   OS 9 was screaming fast.
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:24.560]   And then you get back to the Finder.
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:27.360]   I mean, especially in the Finder, you'd really feel it.
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:28.360]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:30.160]   Well, it had terrible memory management.
[00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:31.480]   OS 9 did some other issues.
[00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:32.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:33.480]   It was really clunky.
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:37.960]   But then just for pure raw speed, particularly if you had a, now you have a faster computer
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:39.240]   because you need it for OS 10.
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:43.000]   And then you run OS 9 and the thing, and go, oh my God, look at this thing.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   I never had a reason why we can't do it.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   I love this.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.640]   I'm going to circle back and turn this into a swipe against Flash.
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:53.040]   As soon as I turned off Flash and Safari everywhere, suddenly all that speed that I lost over
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:54.920]   the past two years came right back to me.
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:55.920]   Yeah.
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:57.480]   I use Flash blocker in Safari.
[00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:02.800]   And it's actually great because I just, all that Flash, you know, you can click it
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:04.800]   to start it, but it just is gone.
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:05.800]   And it is amazing.
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:07.200]   Flash is a big.
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:12.520]   Now we broadcast in Flash, but I could say right now that Ustream, which is one of our
[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:20.760]   providers, has done an H.264 HTML based streaming, HTTP based streaming, which we're using if
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:25.440]   you use the iPhone application or the Android application for the Ustream player and you
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:27.080]   watch us, you're not watching Flash.
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:30.640]   Obviously, it's working on the iPhone as well as the Android phone.
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:32.760]   But Leo, this is, this is that kind of borderline person.
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:35.360]   It's a personality disorder that really typifies the web today.
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:36.360]   Right?
[00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:38.720]   Everything's black and white and every, there's no nuance to anything.
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:40.000]   If you use this, you're evil.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   If you don't use this, you're good.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.040]   All that stuff is such garbage.
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:44.040]   You know, there's.
[00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:45.040]   It's media.
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.520]   It's not, by the way, it's not just computers.
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:48.200]   It's politics to people looking at.
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:51.920]   It's the narcissism of minor differences.
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:54.920]   We look for ways to pick fights with each other and it's stupid.
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:58.840]   And the thing is I wrote a post on my site a little while back about bands screwing up
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:00.920]   their site by being totally in Flash.
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:04.680]   Ted Leo, I told you this, Boston guy, you can't go to a single page on a site because it's
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:05.680]   one file.
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:07.400]   Okay, that's a dumb idea.
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:09.680]   I still say Flash is cilantro.
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:11.960]   You do not want to eat a bowl of it.
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:14.240]   And you know what?
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:15.240]   You don't want to, you know what?
[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:17.280]   Can I just say you don't want to live in a house made out of cilantro?
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:18.880]   You want to cilantro couch?
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:20.880]   But you want to eat a little of your salad?
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:21.880]   Yeah.
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:22.880]   Yeah.
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:25.920]   And when you go to a site and you want to go to a restaurant and the site is a blue
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:31.680]   Lego, that is a failure at every level and that designer should be horse whipped for allowing
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:33.120]   you to have a site in Flash.
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:34.840]   And Gruber of course has a great post on this.
[00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:38.080]   And I think that he's right that Hulu will be using HTML5 everybody will.
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:41.360]   And I guess that's what I was starting to say at the beginning of that Flash conversation,
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:44.960]   which is I'm, I think it's great that Apple is saying no more.
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:46.520]   Somebody had to step up and do it.
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:50.440]   And it's simply enough to have it be not in any Apple portable devices for sites to
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:52.520]   say, okay, there's an alternative.
[00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:53.520]   Let's use it.
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:58.800]   Yeah, I think I think it's even close to what I was saying a couple of weeks ago about how
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:01.960]   sometimes in order to make a change, you can't simply accommodate.
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:03.560]   You simply have to abandon.
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:06.480]   And maybe that's part of that philosophy being given here.
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:10.120]   We can give you Flash, but that would that would not really motivate makers of flash
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:12.000]   sites to move away from Flash.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.640]   That great site that Gruber linked to last week about the response to the Blue Lego,
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:22.320]   Adobe's Blue Lego blog posting, the same where, you know, the word Adobe posted this thing
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:26.200]   saying, well, here's all the sites that are now inoperative because it doesn't have flash.
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:30.480]   And so then someone else said, okay, well, let us load up every one of these sites on
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:31.840]   an iPhone, which doesn't have flash.
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:33.520]   And hey, what do you know?
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:37.840]   Nearly all of these sites created an iPhone specific version that works just as well without
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:38.840]   it.
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:41.960]   So, and I don't think that would have been possible that all those sites would not have
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:42.960]   gone to that trouble.
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:46.520]   If iPhone said, okay, well, we're going to support it, but we like guys, we really want
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:47.760]   you to move away from it.
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:51.080]   So we're only going to let you do that for maybe another five or six years.
[00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:52.960]   So you're on notice, buddy.
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:43:00.000]   Well, and I should say that we are, of course, we have several iPhone apps and we are going
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.080]   to modify at least one.
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:07.920]   I think we've got two in the works that will work on the iPad and will support video.
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:10.960]   And by the way, kind of support multitasking because I want to make it so you can watch
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:12.600]   the video and chat at the same time.
[00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:15.520]   I think the iPad is great for content creators like us.
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:19.560]   We can make a custom experience for Twit Live that's fantastic on the iPad.
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:25.360]   There is one issue though for developers and a couple of people have raised this is if
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:29.920]   you want to ship on launch, you have to trust the SDK emulation and cross your fingers because
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:35.840]   you can't test before you ship and knowing how long it takes Apple to ship revisions or
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:40.320]   publish revisions, if you're, if you're really taking a chance, if you say, well, I'm going
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:44.360]   to push it out for launch, which we'd like to do, but if it doesn't work, then it might
[00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:50.320]   be a lot of unhappy people for a while or do I wait and come out on day two and have some
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:52.640]   limited testing.
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:54.760]   It's an interesting challenge for developers.
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:58.120]   Marko from Tumblr had a great post about that and it's basically laid out the three
[00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:01.160]   options that you've got for what your choices are.
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:04.280]   If I were a developer, I wouldn't love any of them.
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:06.000]   I mean, what's that story?
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   Is that Gates?
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   Is it Bill Gates with DOS?
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.920]   Like he'd never actually run it until he just written it on cards and then he ran it one
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:12.920]   day and it worked?
[00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:13.920]   Is it DOS?
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:15.960]   I mean, I'd want to wait.
[00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:16.960]   I would want to wait.
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:20.680]   But then again, the App Store, as it is for the iPhone, is such a gold rush right now
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:22.680]   or a land grab.
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:27.480]   You know, there's going to be people there on day one, trying to win the SERPs for certain
[00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:30.240]   key words basically from day one.
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:34.040]   And that's, if you make your living off that stuff, you want to be there on day zero when
[00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:35.240]   that stuff goes up.
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:36.240]   Yeah.
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:40.000]   But I would have to think that initially they're going to have the big sites up there.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.520]   And so we're going to see electronic arts there because they will have had these devices
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:44.520]   you bet.
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:46.920]   So I'm sure that Apple Bear has an iPad.
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:49.120]   Surely, electronic arts is going to get out.
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:51.320]   So they're going to see these to the major players.
[00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:54.720]   And so when you go there, when you first have your iPad, you're not going to get up
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:56.280]   there and there's going to be crickets.
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:59.560]   You're going to see something there that's going to catch your attention.
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:01.480]   And sure, the small developers may not be there.
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:05.760]   And I think actually be wise to them not to be there on day zero because if they rush
[00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:10.880]   something out and it's broken and then Apple has this flood of applications coming in.
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:14.320]   But you know, if I was three weeks, where are you then?
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:17.520]   Yes, you've got your stake in the ground, but it's a stake.
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:22.360]   Has anybody talked to developers about what the experience is, whether they feel it'll
[00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:26.960]   be a simple thing to create iPad specific versions or whether they even want to do that?
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:32.280]   I would imagine what you'd like to do is have the programs auto sense and do the right thing,
[00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:33.280]   right?
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:36.080]   So it works on any platform or would well, Andy, how much?
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:39.640]   How good is the is the pixel expansion on this thing?
[00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:40.640]   Yeah.
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:41.640]   Okay.
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:46.400]   I played Assassin's Creed and you know, you press the two X, which is really forex because
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:48.320]   it's double this way and double this way.
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:49.960]   Jaggy, jaggy, jaggy, jaggy, jaggy.
[00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:54.240]   Well, it does remind you of how much you how many user interface elements aren't things
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:57.360]   that are being sort of built by the operating system, but they're actually bit maps that
[00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:58.360]   are harder.
[00:45:58.360 --> 00:45:59.360]   The application bundle.
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:02.800]   So when you even when you're using like a non, it's you're you kind of expect that when
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:05.520]   you're shooting orcs that maybe the orc if it's a bit that is going to start looking
[00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:07.360]   like a legos.
[00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:11.080]   Sometimes it'll be, you know, if you're in an outliner app, it'll say that the button
[00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:12.360]   for like expanding the outline.
[00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:13.680]   Oh, it used to be a triangle.
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:17.280]   Now again, it's a small blood pyramid of a Mayan stone blocks.
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:21.520]   But the other hand, if you use to font for that, it should scale beautifully.
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:23.320]   So a lot of things will work great.
[00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:24.320]   Some things will scale beautifully.
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:29.120]   I really would love to see how well the Amazon app looks or stands a looks because if that's
[00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:32.680]   simply just scales directly upward, that's a that's a very, very simple tweak.
[00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:37.480]   You know, obviously Apple is going to, I think that most developers of iPhone apps have
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:40.480]   enough focus on the quality of their product that they're not going to simply say, great,
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:42.200]   we changed eight lines done, ship it.
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:43.200]   We're done.
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:47.360]   They're going to waste completely reconceive it for the iPad.
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:48.960]   And they're they Apple did something really cool.
[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:52.760]   There's actually the ability to do a universal package that'll have one package that has
[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:57.360]   both the iPod and the excuse me, the iPod slash iPhone and iPad versions of it.
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:02.360]   So people want to if if Stan wants to do just one upload, just not not contaminate their
[00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:06.120]   store by having multiple SKUs that can simply say, buy this no matter what you have.
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:09.520]   If you have an iPhone and an iPad that one downloadable service, both I think that's
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:10.520]   the way to do it.
[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:13.440]   And I imagine that'll be you'll have that capability.
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:16.760]   It may blow up applications a little bit because you have bigger, you know, more bit maps in
[00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:23.920]   there, but my pals at Omni Group are just like I'm saying from reading their blog post.
[00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:24.920]   They're turning things upside down.
[00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:25.920]   Isn't that exciting?
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:30.080]   They're moving some really serious furniture to to really push out.
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:32.680]   But I mean, there's such an interesting company all of those guys.
[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:35.560]   They're going to move they're going to move all their apps except for I guess Omni Web.
[00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:38.720]   They're going to move all their apps to the iPad.
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:41.120]   And I mean, I mean, everything they're they're out outline nerds.
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:46.080]   I mean, it's basically it's, you know, it's one big, you know, emacs app with like, you
[00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:47.440]   know, a fish tank in it.
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:48.880]   That's that's all the places.
[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:51.640]   And you know, iPad, IDL or whatever.
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:56.040]   So they know everything for them.
[00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:58.680]   Everything for them starts with outlining and kind of goes outward.
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:47:59.680]   I think I think I'm.
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:04.120]   Omni Graffle on the iPad will be a killer app.
[00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:07.880]   I guess, you know, people are just talking about, you know, all these computer stuff.
[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:11.680]   I think for sales people, you know, for people who want to go out and do a demo on the road,
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:14.480]   this is going to blow people out of the water, you know, to be able to.
[00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:18.240]   And Leah, remember how we talked in the past about how even like, like I've got a MacBook,
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:19.760]   a pretty nice unibody MacBook.
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:20.760]   You always wanted that.
[00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:24.440]   Well, if I run keynote, remember we talked about this.
[00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:29.280]   I would have to take my MacBook Pro on the road to use keynote because, you know, you'd
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:31.560]   be hurting trying to get any of those transitions.
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:35.080]   Imagine this thing, we pop it open and based on what Andy said, stuff just flops.
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:36.080]   Yeah.
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:37.080]   That's huge.
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:38.080]   Yeah.
[00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:42.360]   I was talking to, I'm sorry, I was talking to Rick Smolan, who's the does the 24 hours
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:46.480]   books and all these really great best selling commercial photo books.
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:49.960]   And he was telling me that he thinks the display is good enough to use it as a portfolio presentation
[00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:50.960]   piece.
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:51.960]   Wow.
[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:54.320]   So when that comes from a professional photographer, that really made an impression on me.
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:55.320]   Ten.
[00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:56.560]   It's only 1024 by 768.
[00:48:56.560 --> 00:49:00.160]   You know, the one, the one thing I, the only thing, I can live without multitasking.
[00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:01.440]   I can live without a camera.
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:02.960]   I can easily live without flash.
[00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:04.280]   In fact, I'm glad that they don't.
[00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:09.920]   I'm actually now turned around on this flash issue and I'm glad that they're killing flash.
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:12.160]   But I hate it that it's not 16, nine.
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:17.920]   Well, I mean, again, if they give you the exact same screen area, only they didn't give
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:19.720]   you the black bars up at the top and the bottom.
[00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:21.120]   Would you still complain about it?
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:23.120]   Is it the aspect ratio itself or is it the idea that-
[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:24.920]   Well, I'd like to see 720p.
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:28.920]   I really will because it has to be, it has to be a book reader too.
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:30.800]   It has to serve multiple masters.
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:37.880]   I'm not sure how well every time I've seen a device that is that aspect ratio, it's great
[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:39.000]   for some things.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.920]   It just feels like you're looking at a legal pad for a lot of other things.
[00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:47.400]   I think that I know that that's more of an anthropology problem than a technical problem.
[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:49.800]   But your eyes simply say, oh, this is long as it should be.
[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:50.800]   No, I'm with you.
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:54.720]   And I think then that then the message is important to put out that this is a great
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:59.320]   book reader, browser, blah, blah, blah, but it's not going to be a great movie viewing
[00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:00.320]   device in my opinion.
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:02.520]   Well, I think it's going to be a great thing.
[00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:07.640]   Because, OK, let's count pixels and let's see if it's true 720p or not.
[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:12.960]   If you saw the movie demos that were on the demo units last Wednesday, that is great
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:13.960]   freaking video.
[00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:14.960]   Yeah, they were fun.
[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:18.200]   And again, pardon me if I'm not up there with the rulers saying, excuse me, that is,
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:23.120]   it's all I only counted 708, even allowing for a 2% degree of error in my counting.
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:26.440]   I still potentially lower than 720p.
[00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:29.800]   I want to know what you're going to do about this situation because I have a live
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:30.800]   journal there.
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:33.800]   And I'm not reading you.
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:37.240]   I just waiting for him to ask for a stapler back at any moment.
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:38.760]   You have my stapler.
[00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:43.120]   Well, it really is a question of where there's been putting the emphasis on this device.
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:44.240]   And is it strictly media?
[00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:45.240]   I don't think so.
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:47.040]   And I think a lot of its productivity as well.
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:50.040]   Well, that's what surprised me because to me it was a con.
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:53.720]   I expected and I got a content consumption device.
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:57.960]   And I was kind of surprised to see this little nod with eyework to content creation.
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:50:58.960]   I'm not.
[00:50:58.960 --> 00:50:59.960]   It's a.
[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:02.760]   Yeah, but is that is you kind of like saying you're on the wrong thing in this way.
[00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:08.280]   I think that it hints that whereas the iPhone is not a great productivity device, it's fine
[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:09.360]   but it's too cramped.
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:13.800]   But now once you've got this bigger screen, you can do a lot of interesting things with
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:14.800]   this.
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:19.040]   And I think the fact that Omni is so interested in this is heartening that we are going to
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:22.880]   see this an explosion in product to give to the apps where they couldn't do it with these
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:23.880]   smaller devices.
[00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:24.880]   Yeah.
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:26.560]   We're going to take a break.
[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:27.560]   Come back.
[00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:28.560]   Paul Kent's going to join us.
[00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:31.560]   Give us a little update on Mac world Expo and there is other news.
[00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:36.320]   In fact, there's some surprising news from Apple regarding stanza, which is an Amazon
[00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:37.320]   owned application.
[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:44.400]   Now the book reader on the iPhone and there's new versions of the iPhone software and of
[00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:45.400]   Oh iTunes.
[00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:46.600]   We'll talk about that in a second.
[00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:48.880]   But before we do that, I do want to mention our friends.
[00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:55.400]   At carbonite.com, carbonite is a backup solution for anybody who, you know, especially with
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:52:01.120]   the laptop, but anybody who's got stuff on the computer that you care about.
[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:06.360]   13% of hard drives, according to Carnegie Mellon in a study they did, 13% of hard drives
[00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:10.200]   crash in the first year.
[00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:15.080]   For 43% of people lose files, they consider irreplaceable at least once a year, according
[00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:16.080]   to Harris Interactive.
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:24.080]   600,000 laptops, 600,000 laptops were reported, lost or stolen at US airports every year.
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:26.960]   That's more than 10,000 a week.
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:32.000]   If you have your precious photos, your email, your financial documents on your computer and
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:37.480]   you are not doing offsite backup, you are not backed up.
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:41.000]   You know, when the worst happens, fire, flood earthquake and you lose the backup disk that's
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.360]   right next to the computer, you then you'll know what I'm talking about.
[00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:46.320]   That's why carbonite is such a great deal and a great solution.
[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:52.000]   Since 2006, carbonite has backed up over 25 billion files and restored 2 billion of those
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.640]   to customers who would have otherwise lost them.
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:57.760]   Even something as simple as human error.
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:00.800]   Carbonite backs up your files automatically, so you don't have to think about it.
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:05.520]   Your photos, music, emails, financial records, office documents and other irreplaceable files,
[00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:07.200]   no extra hardware is required.
[00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:10.800]   You can recover lost files on any computer as long as you can get online.
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:13.000]   You can even use carbonite to transfer files to a new computer.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.680]   Mac or PC, I want you to try carbonite right now.
[00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:18.960]   Go to carbonite.com, use the offer code MacBreak.
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:21.000]   You can try it free for two weeks.
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:25.480]   Again, always a good idea to try before you buy and I make sure that all our sponsors
[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:26.560]   do that except for Ford.
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:30.440]   We haven't figured out a way for you to drive a Mustang without paying for it.
[00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:31.920]   But we're working on that.
[00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:33.160]   Wouldn't that be nice?
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:36.040]   Try it free for a month.
[00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:38.040]   I would like to get that actually.
[00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:45.040]   It lets you try it free.
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:47.720]   It's less than five bucks a month for unlimited backup.
[00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:50.480]   Everything on your computer, not external drives, not network drives, but if it's on
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:56.240]   your computer and you'll get two free months if you use the coupon code MacBreak.
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:59.640]   Carbonite.com, it's backup.
[00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:01.440]   Done right.
[00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:02.440]   Carbonite.
[00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:04.200]   Let me call Paul Cat real quickly.
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:05.560]   We'll continue with our conversation.
[00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:08.280]   There's other Mac news as well.
[00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:11.920]   We told Paul we'd get him on just to get a little update.
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:13.680]   Andy's going to be doing Mac World Expo.
[00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:16.280]   I know you've got some seminars coming up, Andy.
[00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:17.280]   Yep.
[00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:20.360]   I'm going to be doing two things on the big stage and I'm going to be floating around
[00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:25.120]   doing things with Mac World's podcasts and I'm doing some things with Alex and some things.
[00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:28.840]   I'm sure we're going to do some things on the Twitter network.
[00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:31.960]   It's going to be eight days of peace, love and understanding.
[00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:32.960]   Fantastic.
[00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:34.440]   That's what's understanding because I'll be explaining it.
[00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:36.040]   I'm doing the Mac.
[00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:39.960]   David Pogue is going to be doing the big keynote and I'm going to be taking over his
[00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:43.080]   Mac World Live and we've got some great guests on that one.
[00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:48.640]   We're going to have Roger McGwin, the founder of The Birds is going to perform.
[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:49.640]   It's not going to be fun.
[00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:54.560]   Adam Savage from Mythbusters says he's going to blow something up or I don't know.
[00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:57.200]   Heather Gold has a great comedy bit she's going to do.
[00:54:57.200 --> 00:55:02.400]   The one you were talking about, Max, our protest Catholics and the PCs are protestant,
[00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:04.200]   something like that.
[00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:09.280]   We also are going to have a great Star Trek band called Warp 11 featuring, does the name
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:12.440]   Kiki Stockhammer ring a bell for anybody?
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:16.240]   Kiki was the great demo goddess, still is by the way, the great demo goddess for the
[00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:23.360]   Amiga video toaster you may remember going back some ways and she's now got a great band
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:25.720]   called Warp 11 so she's going to be joining us.
[00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:27.600]   It's all in all, it's going to be a lot of fun.
[00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:29.720]   Let's say hi to Paul Kent, he's putting this all together.
[00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:30.720]   Hey Paul.
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:31.720]   Hi, how you doing?
[00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:32.720]   I'm doing great.
[00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:34.800]   You must be going crazy right about now.
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:35.800]   It's pretty busy right now.
[00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:38.960]   It's really hopping around here but it's a lot of fun.
[00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:39.960]   Good.
[00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:42.640]   We talked to you a couple of, maybe a month ago.
[00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:47.360]   We talked a month ago, we were just kind of hitting that final ramp up right before the
[00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:49.360]   holidays.
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:53.840]   I see you tweet almost every day now with new people who are signing up.
[00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:57.440]   The absence of Apple isn't hurting you in terms of exhibitors.
[00:55:57.440 --> 00:55:59.320]   They want to be there.
[00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:00.800]   Different types of exhibitors.
[00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:03.360]   The absence of Apple has had different effects on us.
[00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:07.120]   We have certainly there'll be less exhibitors this year but I think the ones that are there
[00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:11.280]   are really interesting and it's the great cross section of things going on in the Apple
[00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:12.280]   products world.
[00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:15.000]   We have tons of app developers for the first time this year.
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:19.680]   In the mobile app showcase we have cool little software indie developers.
[00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:20.680]   We have big.
[00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:22.680]   That's what Merlin you call that tiny town.
[00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:23.680]   That's the tiny town.
[00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:24.680]   That's my favorite part.
[00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:26.080]   That's where all the fun is.
[00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:27.080]   It is.
[00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:29.080]   It's where the cool interesting developers are.
[00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:30.080]   I love that part.
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:33.160]   They're the guys who still care.
[00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:36.640]   I imagine that there'll be a lot of talk about the iPad.
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:41.200]   The iPad won't be out because Mac world Expo is just a week and a half from now or something
[00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:42.200]   like that.
[00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:43.200]   That's right.
[00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:47.340]   We announced a couple hours after Apple's event our own iPad special event that Jason
[00:56:47.340 --> 00:56:50.280]   Snell and Andy's going to sit on a panel with them.
[00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:54.920]   The good thing that Mac world can do is kind of be this like an advocate for users.
[00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:57.780]   If you're thinking about whether you should buy one and you want to have as much information
[00:56:57.780 --> 00:57:01.720]   as you can before you go out and spend your hard-earned money, Mac world's a good place
[00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:04.140]   for you to come and figure out what's what.
[00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:07.360]   Jason Stell and Andy and some other people are going to be putting on a panel.
[00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:09.440]   We're actually going to give an iPad away.
[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:11.800]   We're going to give an iPad away when it ships.
[00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:13.720]   We'll announce who wins it at the event.
[00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:17.660]   We announced an iPad special event where we'll really go into all the details.
[00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:19.100]   Form factor usage.
[00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:20.760]   Should it have a camera?
[00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:23.560]   I don't know if we'll get a lot of questions about Flash from the audience that will be
[00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:24.560]   there.
[00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:27.680]   It's a good place for Jason and the editors of Mac world and some special guests and good
[00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:31.140]   and informed people to really share everything that's going on.
[00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:32.140]   That's exciting.
[00:57:32.140 --> 00:57:33.740]   I think it's timely.
[00:57:33.740 --> 00:57:36.620]   Well, good scrambling.
[00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:38.380]   We were ready to get that one on there.
[00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:40.580]   Well, you knew.
[00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:46.700]   In a way, it's a shame that Apple, it must bug you a little bit that Apple ended up announcing
[00:57:46.700 --> 00:57:50.620]   something in January, even though some of what they were talking about was, "Well, we
[00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:53.260]   don't want to be forced to announce things in January."
[00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:54.460]   The glass is half full.
[00:57:54.460 --> 00:57:57.660]   They just created a way that we're just going to ride that way right through the show.
[00:57:57.660 --> 00:57:59.560]   That's a good way to think about it.
[00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:00.560]   Holy cow.
[00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:02.400]   I was like, "Come on."
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:03.400]   Oh, well.
[00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:04.400]   I'm very excited.
[00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:09.520]   Really, as we've said before, the key to Mac world Expo is the Mac community, the Apple
[00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:13.200]   community is a place to gather, regardless of what Apple thinks.
[00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:16.600]   We need a place to get together and talk about meet each other and talk about what's
[00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:17.600]   going on.
[00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:21.600]   I imagine a lot of people will be there trying to figure out what the iPad means and to their
[00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:24.720]   business and to them as users.
[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:28.080]   I think it'll definitely be one of the big topics of conversation in the show.
[00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:30.080]   There's so many things going on.
[00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:33.940]   Mac world is a very content, rich experience for people.
[00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:36.860]   All of the feature presentations we have, the great stuff that you're putting on for
[00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:39.120]   people, Pogue is doing some cool things.
[00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:40.860]   He asked me to play guitar for him.
[00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:44.780]   I think he's writing a play that he actually is going to have performed as part of his.
[00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:46.700]   Oh, I love it.
[00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:50.520]   You know, Guy Kawasaki is going to be featuring some cool new products.
[00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:54.220]   The folks at our sister company that put on the demo conference are going to be previewing
[00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:57.460]   premiering some new things.
[00:58:57.460 --> 00:59:03.380]   The filmmaker Kevin Smith, we've got the electronic music industry legend BT.
[00:59:03.380 --> 00:59:05.500]   So there's so many cool things to do.
[00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:08.900]   And then you have about 230 exhibitors on the show floor.
[00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:13.060]   So product discovery, cool learning, cool social networking.
[00:59:13.060 --> 00:59:17.700]   I think we've really done a good job this year creating an event, a true event that will
[00:59:17.700 --> 00:59:19.820]   really delight people when they come to the show.
[00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:20.820]   Mac world expo.
[00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:26.620]   Just around the corner, if you haven't registered, go to macworld Expo.com.
[00:59:26.620 --> 00:59:29.300]   It's a February 9th through 13th.
[00:59:29.300 --> 00:59:32.580]   And I'm going to be doing my event on Friday, the 12th.
[00:59:32.580 --> 00:59:33.580]   Is it two o'clock?
[00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:34.580]   I think it's two o'clock, three o'clock.
[00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:35.580]   That's right.
[00:59:35.580 --> 00:59:36.580]   Yeah.
[00:59:36.580 --> 00:59:37.580]   And then we're doing a tweet up.
[00:59:37.580 --> 00:59:40.420]   My rejoice has organized this one.
[00:59:40.420 --> 00:59:44.860]   630 p.m. that Friday evening at the Marriott Marquis, which is the jukebox Marriott right
[00:59:44.860 --> 00:59:46.500]   across the street.
[00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:48.500]   So we'll have more details on that.
[00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:49.500]   We want everybody to come out.
[00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:50.500]   I'll be there.
[00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:52.700]   If you're going to, if you could, I'd love for you to come.
[00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:53.700]   Everybody there.
[00:59:53.700 --> 00:59:54.700]   Good.
[00:59:54.700 --> 00:59:55.700]   Hey Leo, I have a couple giveaways if it's okay.
[00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:56.700]   Oh, would you please?
[00:59:56.700 --> 00:59:57.700]   That's great.
[00:59:57.700 --> 00:59:58.700]   Yeah.
[00:59:58.700 --> 00:59:59.700]   Absolutely.
[00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:02.060]   You know, whenever I come on, we want to make sure that all of Leo's listeners have
[01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:03.100]   a chance to come and see him.
[01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:07.500]   So we're going to give 100 free passes to the expo floor, which also includes seeing
[01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:09.020]   Leo and seeing pog.
[01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:14.900]   All you have to do is go to macworld expo.com and enter the code Leo, L-E-O.
[01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:18.660]   And that the first 100 people will get a free pass to come to Mac world.
[01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:23.260]   And then we're going to select 10 of those people at random and give them passes to our
[01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:26.780]   big attendee party, which is later on Friday night, the Mac world blasts.
[01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:27.780]   So it's really kind of cool.
[01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:28.780]   I can't wait.
[01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:30.060]   I think it's all good.
[01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:31.860]   We have a cool video on the website.
[01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:32.860]   I see this.
[01:00:32.860 --> 01:00:34.340]   Can you give that a run?
[01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:35.340]   Yeah.
[01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:36.340]   Let me show you this.
[01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:37.340]   This is really cool.
[01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:39.700]   I have to push some buttons here to get this to work.
[01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:45.660]   I'm going to make it go widescreen too because I have you squaged down to a small size.
[01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:46.660]   There we go.
[01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:52.100]   6,100, 6,111 miles to Mac world.
[01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:55.860]   It says that's a long way to go.
[01:00:55.860 --> 01:01:00.740]   We had faculty and fans from all over the world send in little clips.
[01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:05.940]   And the inspiration for this was the famous Bob Dylan video subterranean, Hope 6.
[01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:07.420]   Oh, I was going to do this for you.
[01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:08.420]   And I just, oh, I'm sorry.
[01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:09.900]   I just didn't get around to it.
[01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:10.900]   Look at this.
[01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:11.900]   This is fun.
[01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:18.900]   There's Tom McAllister.
[01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:28.140]   I love it.
[01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:29.860]   You're going to have to watch this on the site.
[01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:31.660]   I just need.
[01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:33.940]   Oh, that's neat.
[01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:35.260]   Have fun.
[01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:38.060]   At least it's not.
[01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:39.060]   And more.
[01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:40.060]   And more.
[01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:41.060]   Who is it?
[01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:42.060]   And more.
[01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:43.060]   And more.
[01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:44.780]   Oh, that's great in San Francisco.
[01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:45.780]   That's great.
[01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:50.980]   A lot of people using their iPhones as an uncedator.
[01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:54.700]   I like that.
[01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:55.700]   Well go watch it.
[01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:56.700]   Macworldxpo.com.
[01:01:56.700 --> 01:01:58.420]   You can see the full video.
[01:01:58.420 --> 01:02:00.620]   Paul Kent, thank you so much for the coupon.
[01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:01.620]   We really appreciate that.
[01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:03.380]   Go to Macworldxpo.com and register.
[01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:07.740]   I can't believe if you haven't done it yet and use my name Leo as the offer code and you'll
[01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:08.740]   get a deal.
[01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:12.220]   Thanks for all your support and all the guys who are on the screen there that all helped
[01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:13.220]   in some way.
[01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:14.220]   They're either speaking for us.
[01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:15.220]   Merlin and I spent a lot of time together.
[01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:18.660]   He gave me a lot of advice about how Macworld can really ring true for ten.
[01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:19.660]   No, we haven't.
[01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:20.660]   We never decided on something.
[01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:22.660]   Tell me what to do and I'll show up.
[01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:26.100]   I mean, I can pull soft serve cones.
[01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:32.060]   I can see him doing that.
[01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:33.060]   That's great.
[01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:34.060]   That's really fun.
[01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:36.060]   You have an idea how long you'll be served.
[01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:38.020]   Oh, yes, I am really mad.
[01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:41.500]   I can make your dashboard more efficient while you're inside.
[01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:42.500]   It's so cool.
[01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:43.500]   You got all these people to do.
[01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:45.500]   Did you talk less and park more?
[01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:47.500]   All right.
[01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:48.660]   By the way, that's a good bumper sticker.
[01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:49.660]   I saw somewhere.
[01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:50.660]   Waggless, park more.
[01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:51.660]   I like that.
[01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:52.660]   All right.
[01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:53.660]   We're going to let you go, Paul.
[01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:54.660]   Thank you.
[01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:55.660]   Good luck.
[01:02:55.660 --> 01:02:57.060]   I know you have a lot to do before next week.
[01:02:57.060 --> 01:02:58.060]   There's Alex.
[01:02:58.060 --> 01:02:59.060]   See you next week.
[01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:00.060]   Absolutely.
[01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:01.060]   Thanks for everything.
[01:03:01.060 --> 01:03:02.060]   Take care.
[01:03:02.060 --> 01:03:05.060]   Paul Kent from IDG and they're working hard to make Macworld happen.
[01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:08.060]   I'm sure it was a bit of a blow when Apple said we're not going to be there, but I think
[01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:14.660]   that the community still needs to have an event that we can call our own.
[01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:15.660]   It's really important.
[01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:16.660]   It's really neat to see this video.
[01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:19.580]   I'm mad at myself because I didn't get around to making a clip for them.
[01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:25.420]   Yeah, I myself, I fell victim to awesomeness perilous paralysis.
[01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:26.420]   Yeah, paralysis.
[01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:27.420]   Yes.
[01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:31.780]   Because you're like, okay, I can either turn on the webcam, turn on quick time.
[01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:33.700]   I see you at Macworld.
[01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:37.300]   Like, no, no, no, I should get the walking cam and I'll go.
[01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:38.380]   I'll find I'll go into Boston.
[01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:39.620]   I'll go to the top of the Hancock Tower.
[01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:40.900]   Oh, but I can't go for three days.
[01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:42.100]   Well, I'll go next week.
[01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:44.580]   And then oh, wait, that was supposed to happen today.
[01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:45.580]   Yeah.
[01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:47.580]   I did that exact same.
[01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:49.420]   Great artists ship.
[01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:56.300]   Yeah, that's the famous Steve Jobs line when they to the Macintosh group.
[01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:57.500]   So a couple of stories.
[01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:03.940]   This one just in from TechCrunch, which is I'm sorry to say is kind of a bummer.
[01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:06.020]   Amazon bought Stanza, which we all agree.
[01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:11.860]   In fact, Andy was your pick of the week or some weeks ago, is a really neat reader.
[01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:16.700]   And one of the great features that Stanza had was you could download stuff on your PC,
[01:04:16.700 --> 01:04:18.460]   on your Mac, on your PC, on your computer.
[01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:22.700]   Well, I worked on PC too, but you could download stuff and have it sync up to Stanza.
[01:04:22.700 --> 01:04:29.980]   Apparently, according to LexCycle, Apple has requested the removal of the ability to share
[01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:33.220]   books via USB with Stanza.
[01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:38.620]   And if they don't update your stands at a 2.1, if you have an iPhone, because they push
[01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:41.220]   that update out today.
[01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:46.620]   I'm trying to figure out exactly what that limitation entails because I've been a regular
[01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:50.020]   Stanza user, you know, for God knows how long.
[01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:53.900]   I've never moved books from one place to another via USB.
[01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:56.300]   I've always done it via Wi-Fi.
[01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:59.100]   So I guess the Wi-Fi is thinking--
[01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:00.100]   Go ahead.
[01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:01.100]   Go ahead, Bernard.
[01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:03.380]   This is going to be a big news for caliber.
[01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:04.380]   Now is your chance.
[01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:06.900]   Go download, caliber, learn it, get used to it.
[01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:07.900]   It's ugly.
[01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:08.900]   It's awesome.
[01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:12.820]   And it stands as a reader is still great, but Stanza for transferring files is not nearly
[01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:15.260]   as good as caliber.
[01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:16.260]   So have you used it yet, Leo?
[01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:17.260]   Have you used it yet, Leo?
[01:05:17.260 --> 01:05:18.260]   No, we'll try caliber.
[01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:19.260]   All right.
[01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:20.260]   So I'm going to interrupt you.
[01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:23.900]   We should come back to that, though, because it's a-- it crushes Stanza in terms of the
[01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:25.580]   functionality they're trying to take away.
[01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:29.940]   Well, you have to think that they're going to do the same thing to them, right?
[01:05:29.940 --> 01:05:30.940]   So that's interesting, Andy, you're right.
[01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:32.140]   No, it's open source.
[01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:33.140]   The Python app.
[01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:34.140]   Oh, it's a Python app.
[01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:35.140]   Calibre's a Python app.
[01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:36.620]   Yeah, it runs on your Mac.
[01:05:36.620 --> 01:05:39.020]   And basically, it pulls down RSS feeds.
[01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:41.580]   It automatically syncs with your Kindle when you plug it in.
[01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:42.580]   It does EPUB.
[01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:43.580]   It does Moby.
[01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:44.580]   It does everything.
[01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:45.580]   It's iTunes for your books.
[01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:46.580]   It's ugly as hell.
[01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:47.580]   And it's amazing.
[01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:49.580]   And we've talked about it before on the show now.
[01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:50.580]   Come to think of it.
[01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:52.100]   Yeah, I does ring a bell.
[01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:55.180]   But now, how do you get it on your iPhone?
[01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:58.340]   Open port 8080, the Hoa port.
[01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:01.060]   And open up 8080, and it just flies through the air.
[01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:04.820]   If you're running dynamic DNS or what have you, you can just go to port 8080 from wherever
[01:06:04.820 --> 01:06:05.820]   you are.
[01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:08.140]   You pop in your password and download your books from anywhere.
[01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:09.380]   Just shows you you can't-- it's that easy.
[01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:11.620]   You can't-- it's just that easy.
[01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:14.620]   It just shows you, though, you can't really lock stuff down forever.
[01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:21.100]   If you've got a browser, there's going to be the ability to get stuff into it.
[01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:23.300]   However, I think this is a little disappointing.
[01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:27.380]   Apple, clearly showing that they want to-- it's really a battle between Apple and Amazon.
[01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:29.780]   Amazon, I thought Amazon would welcome the iPad.
[01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:33.780]   It would embrace it with open arms because I thought Amazon stupid me was in the business
[01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:35.660]   of selling books and really not the Kindle.
[01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:37.180]   But apparently, they want to protect the Kindle.
[01:06:37.180 --> 01:06:42.060]   That's the whole point of the McMillan showdown over this past weekend.
[01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:43.060]   Amazon did cave.
[01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:48.900]   They said, well, we know McMillan's going to win, but they did pull all of McMillan's
[01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:53.740]   books printed and otherwise offamazon.com.
[01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:57.660]   You had to use a third party bookseller if you wanted to get anything from McMillan.
[01:06:57.660 --> 01:07:03.380]   A lot of authors very upset because they were no longer able to sell their books through
[01:07:03.380 --> 01:07:06.020]   Amazon on the Kindle or in paper form.
[01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:07.020]   Yeah.
[01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:13.020]   You have the idea that maybe Jeff Bezos has a nephew Lonnie.
[01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:17.300]   And like when whenever it leaves for the weekend, they just leave Lonnie in charge and say,
[01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:20.820]   now remember, if anything bad happens, what are you going to do?
[01:07:20.820 --> 01:07:21.820]   I'm going to solve.
[01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:22.820]   No, you're not.
[01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:23.820]   Here's my phone number.
[01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:26.740]   You're going to call me and let me know what it is, then we'll solve it.
[01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:30.060]   Because how could you possibly have had a worse response then?
[01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:34.540]   I know we will pull one sixth of all of our content from there and everybody will rally
[01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:40.380]   to our side and blame Apple for us having to pull one sixth of all our content.
[01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:45.740]   You know, it's just them looking back at the NBC iTunes deal and saying, well, Apple got
[01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:46.740]   away with it.
[01:07:46.740 --> 01:07:50.140]   They booted NBC out of the place because they wanted to have variable pricing.
[01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:53.260]   So we can do it too and we'll be heroes, right?
[01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:54.260]   Apparently not.
[01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:55.260]   And they work.
[01:07:55.260 --> 01:07:57.380]   It doesn't look good as good in a black mock tournament.
[01:07:57.380 --> 01:07:58.380]   That's for sure.
[01:07:58.380 --> 01:07:59.380]   Yeah.
[01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:02.220]   I think there's also there's a big difference between doing things in your decision making
[01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:04.900]   and deals that make people want to go someplace else.
[01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:10.020]   I think that's really different than the kind of porcious interference involved in like
[01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:12.820]   forcing people to change something in order to play your game.
[01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:14.860]   I mean, I think that's pretty different.
[01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:17.980]   And I think it's a weak pussy move on Apple's part.
[01:08:17.980 --> 01:08:20.020]   Anytime you go after like that, you know what?
[01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:23.540]   If your product is good on Amazon's part or Apple's part.
[01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:25.100]   Sorry, on Amazon's part.
[01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:26.100]   I apologize.
[01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:27.740]   You just call Apple pussy and this is Mac break weekly.
[01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:29.060]   You're not allowed to do that.
[01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:30.060]   I'm sorry.
[01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:31.060]   You'll fix that post.
[01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:32.060]   I'll fix that post.
[01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:34.060]   I'll just add the word cat.
[01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:36.700]   Well, and you know what it does, Leo?
[01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:39.860]   It pushes it pushes people into other channels.
[01:08:39.860 --> 01:08:41.340]   I'll just say that.
[01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:42.340]   Well, exactly.
[01:08:42.340 --> 01:08:47.380]   I mean, Apple's got to be going, yeah, yeah, why don't you throw random house and penguin
[01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:49.420]   off to Amazon.
[01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:53.620]   Let's just stop selling books Amazon because who's that good for?
[01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:56.820]   Yeah, like are you in the business of moving product or you in the business of making
[01:08:56.820 --> 01:08:58.540]   squirrely rules, you know?
[01:08:58.540 --> 01:09:02.820]   Well, it's clear that Amazon in this case wants to be more than a bookstore.
[01:09:02.820 --> 01:09:09.860]   What they're saying is we are not a bookstore because a bookstore doesn't do that.
[01:09:09.860 --> 01:09:11.140]   They want to control the chain.
[01:09:11.140 --> 01:09:15.340]   And I think this is it was it was I mean, I know I think they know right now what a stupid
[01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:16.340]   move it was.
[01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:22.500]   But did he catch like the awesome disc that McMillan made because part of the controversy,
[01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:26.780]   part of the explanation of how badly Amazon handled this was that their comment was on
[01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:29.780]   an anonymous post on one of their blogs.
[01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:35.060]   McMillan was smart enough to say, you know what, let's wake up the CEO for this.
[01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:37.300]   Let's have a statement coming right from the top.
[01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:42.380]   And by the way, boss, you're going to refer to Amazon as merely a customer of McMillan
[01:09:42.380 --> 01:09:43.380]   not as a marketer.
[01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:44.380]   Exactly.
[01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:52.220]   Like, oh, that's exactly the point is that, you know, who are they a customer?
[01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:57.780]   Do they resell books or are they the full, you know, are they the publisher in effect?
[01:09:57.780 --> 01:10:01.540]   Obviously, if I were a shareholder, if I was shareholder in a company that did stuff like
[01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:07.460]   that, I think I'd have some questions because to me, you're there's a very basic, there's
[01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:12.100]   a very basic decision at the heart of all of this kind of evolving commerce, all the
[01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:15.340]   decisions that people have to make about how they're going to deal with this at the center
[01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:20.100]   is a very basic question, which is, do you want to get bigger and more open or do you
[01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:22.060]   want to get smaller and more closed?
[01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:26.180]   I'm not saying that has to be mutually exclusive, but by and large, when you keep trying to
[01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:30.860]   close off avenues and you increasingly depend on a business model that's based on suing
[01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:36.300]   people or DRM or based on all this stuff, I think you really limit what you're capable
[01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:40.700]   of and you limit your market, you're reducing the number of people who use your stuff.
[01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:42.580]   Why not learn from something like Napster?
[01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:44.420]   Why not learn from something like Apple?
[01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:48.700]   I've got a very itchy buying finger and I would just be saying, hey, you know, just
[01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:51.220]   go get used to using this a lot.
[01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:55.020]   Before I could escalate this relationship to you giving us tons of money, I've got to
[01:10:55.020 --> 01:10:58.420]   meet you comfortably using this and there's still thousands and millions of people who've
[01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:00.420]   never even opened Stanza.
[01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:01.420]   I don't know.
[01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:04.020]   I just think that's a frustrating thing for companies when they close things down like
[01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:05.020]   that.
[01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:11.300]   It's interesting that Apple's really argument and Apple was able to establish the ad book
[01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:14.260]   store by going to companies like McMillan saying, charge whatever you want.
[01:11:14.260 --> 01:11:16.300]   You could charge 15 bucks.
[01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:18.900]   So Apple really launched this war.
[01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:23.900]   Apple is obviously in the war when they take out USB connectivity from Stanza.
[01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:25.660]   I wonder if they're going to take out Wi-Fi as well.
[01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:26.660]   I don't know.
[01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:30.740]   That's a strange loophole to leave in there.
[01:11:30.740 --> 01:11:31.700]   Maybe they can do it on their own.
[01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:32.700]   I don't know.
[01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:33.700]   Apple also.
[01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:36.060]   Stanza's not the only book reader on the iPhone.
[01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:37.060]   Right.
[01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:38.060]   I mean, let's be clear.
[01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:39.220]   Why wonder what they're going to do with the Kindle app?
[01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:40.220]   Are they going to allow?
[01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:45.900]   I mean, they can't artificially block the Kindle app, can you?
[01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:48.100]   That would be such an overt gesture on Apple's part.
[01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:50.860]   But we're in a shooting war right now, aren't we?
[01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:55.020]   But why? But how does blocking the Kindle app help Apple?
[01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:56.020]   It doesn't.
[01:11:56.020 --> 01:12:00.340]   What they're more likely to say is that yes, you can download this application that if
[01:12:00.340 --> 01:12:04.820]   you want to buy books will take you to a website that's not really well done, that will download
[01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:09.700]   content or that will then send it to you via a second mechanism or you can go to our
[01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:13.580]   very nice iTunes book store that is nicely organized and gives you nice pictures and
[01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:16.940]   previews and added content by all means use both of them.
[01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:21.140]   And so if they were to lock out the Kindle, so the bad rap they get from the Kindle app
[01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:24.900]   at a time when they're trying to start a brand new market for themselves, I just don't
[01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:26.660]   see any upside to that form.
[01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:27.660]   Right.
[01:12:27.660 --> 01:12:28.660]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:32.660]   I think that Apple is very confident in the iTunes store and the app store.
[01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:37.340]   And one of the things that we didn't mention about this whole Acer idea, they're not going
[01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:41.940]   to compete on the tablet is the reason they cited for that is they can't compete against
[01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:43.940]   the app store and iTunes.
[01:12:43.940 --> 01:12:44.940]   Right.
[01:12:44.940 --> 01:12:49.100]   So we really have to look at that relationship just as we did with the iPod and the iPhone
[01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:53.500]   is that Apple's got the full solution and having iTunes and having an app store.
[01:12:53.500 --> 01:13:00.460]   So yes, you can come out with this wonderful device, but if you don't have the whole enchilada,
[01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:01.940]   you've got half a solution.
[01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:07.900]   And so it makes sense for people not to try to compete in this space.
[01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:11.300]   There is another weird rumor on tech crunch, which I don't really credit very much that
[01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:16.020]   Apple is still developing another tablet with a really big screen.
[01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:19.980]   Yes, we get to spend more months speculating and guessing.
[01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:22.540]   Yeah, let's just let's take a break.
[01:13:22.540 --> 01:13:27.580]   Because they only work on one idea at a time and they have my boards there.
[01:13:27.580 --> 01:13:29.580]   They can afford these things.
[01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:32.860]   Lea, Lea, but it's Cali Canis, the source on.
[01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:33.860]   Yeah, probably.
[01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:38.540]   For the past three or four days, I've had to like do all kinds of research about a device
[01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:42.740]   that really exists, answering real questions that people have and not really having access
[01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:43.740]   to any answers.
[01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:47.900]   I really want to go back to that day when I could simply say, well, I believe there
[01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:50.700]   won't be 3G connectivity as a contract.
[01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:53.020]   And I think it makes sense for Apple to do it.
[01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:56.580]   It's so much easier just to pull things out of whatever places you can find them available
[01:13:56.580 --> 01:13:57.580]   on somewhere.
[01:13:57.580 --> 01:14:00.820]   I have my scorecard because I filled out the scorecard.
[01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:02.780]   I remember where it is.
[01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:05.100]   Do you guys did you guys fill out that scorecard?
[01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:06.340]   I did pretty well, actually.
[01:14:06.340 --> 01:14:09.340]   I was filling it out inside my head when they came up.
[01:14:09.340 --> 01:14:14.860]   When we saw that first graphic about the keyboard dock, I was replaying it in my mind.
[01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:18.940]   All that really wonderful stuff I was saying about how no Apple won't have keyboard support.
[01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:20.620]   No, not even via Bluetooth.
[01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:22.740]   I don't think it makes sense for them to do that.
[01:14:22.740 --> 01:14:24.580]   OK, I was wrong about that.
[01:14:24.580 --> 01:14:28.780]   I stand by my prediction that there will be no keyboard on the iPad.
[01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:31.300]   No, no, no, it has to be.
[01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:35.260]   I will have to go to everyone's homes and destroy them because I can do that right.
[01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:36.260]   There shouldn't be.
[01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:39.100]   There shouldn't be, even if there is, there shouldn't be a keyboard.
[01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:40.100]   It makes sense.
[01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:41.100]   People before the before the first.
[01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:42.100]   You know, I should clarify.
[01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:43.220]   I got a little bit backwards.
[01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:46.940]   I thought there would be one camera and three solar panels.
[01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:53.900]   So no one in this room fell for Jason's silliness, obviously.
[01:14:53.900 --> 01:14:56.180]   We weren't the CNN types, right?
[01:14:56.180 --> 01:14:58.180]   We knew that he was being silly.
[01:14:58.180 --> 01:15:00.380]   But yeah, but all the same.
[01:15:00.380 --> 01:15:02.380]   I really think he has to take some response.
[01:15:02.380 --> 01:15:06.180]   If someone is going to say, oh, everyone who believed that was an idiot, you have to realize
[01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:11.140]   that this is you go on Twitter, you might see two or three of these tweets.
[01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:12.940]   You're not going to stick around for everything.
[01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:16.500]   The stuff that he was making up wasn't.
[01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:20.380]   If you take two or three of them were completely ridiculous.
[01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:23.700]   That's why when people were asking me about it that night, I was pretty much I just gotten
[01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:27.100]   off my plane at like 11 o'clock and catching up on stuff.
[01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:31.500]   And that's that's a bad time for a real journalist to be getting information because on the night
[01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:33.220]   before something, it would have been.
[01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:35.100]   I'm just saying you were vulnerable.
[01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:40.020]   Well, no, I'm saying that that's a time when someone might say, if you weren't, if you're
[01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:43.620]   not quite so careful as you should be, that's when you simply say, well, there's a rumor
[01:15:43.620 --> 01:15:46.780]   from Jason that he has that he has one right now.
[01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:48.140]   And I'll take a look at it later.
[01:15:48.140 --> 01:15:51.860]   And now suddenly it's the Chicago Sun Times that saying this not just some guy on Twitter.
[01:15:51.860 --> 01:15:52.860]   Right.
[01:15:52.860 --> 01:15:53.860]   And that becomes a big problem.
[01:15:53.860 --> 01:15:58.420]   I do think that you have to be really careful about how you do jokes like this just to make
[01:15:58.420 --> 01:16:02.900]   sure you realize that not there are not a whole lot of people who realize that having
[01:16:02.900 --> 01:16:07.060]   four cameras and a solar panel is actually a stupid idea for this tablet because they're
[01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:08.380]   the regular consumers.
[01:16:08.380 --> 01:16:12.820]   They think Apple does a lot of cool things that no one ever expected and who knows.
[01:16:12.820 --> 01:16:13.820]   Right.
[01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:16.060]   It's just it's sad.
[01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:19.380]   It's like a it's like a kid who starts out eating burgers for a nickel and then he just
[01:16:19.380 --> 01:16:21.660]   does it for free because he likes the attention.
[01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:22.660]   You know, I don't know.
[01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:26.180]   You know, what a boneheaded thing to do with the kind of audience he has.
[01:16:26.180 --> 01:16:28.780]   It's just that's pathetic.
[01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:30.220]   Oh, see, it didn't bother me.
[01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:35.980]   I cause it but I guess because it was just so obvious that I said it's personality spam.
[01:16:35.980 --> 01:16:40.460]   You know, it's just like, oh, it's a joke.
[01:16:40.460 --> 01:16:41.460]   I mean, can't you?
[01:16:41.460 --> 01:16:44.700]   I mean, maybe maybe it wasn't a funny joke to some.
[01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:48.580]   I have a certain amount of experience with this because one of the first really popular
[01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:52.020]   things I ever wrote and published back when I was just writing for the Boston Pierce Society's
[01:16:52.020 --> 01:16:57.380]   Mac group newsletter was I wrote an April Fool's piece that was published on April Fool's
[01:16:57.380 --> 01:16:59.740]   April Fool's Day.
[01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:03.580]   That was about how this is when the Mac SC was first coming out that Apple was recalling
[01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:09.300]   all 128K Macs because they're a hazard, you know, they're a hazard of some kind and it
[01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:14.060]   was like all of like a page and a half long and you'd have to get to only paragraph number
[01:17:14.060 --> 01:17:17.940]   seven before start getting off the rails because it explains what the problem is and the problem
[01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:21.900]   is that these were installed with gasoline soaked rags underneath the motherboard and
[01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:26.540]   that the CRT electron bomb which would, which was a problem where we start to fire backwards
[01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:30.540]   into the back of the case to try to erase the names of all the Mac people who were on that
[01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:32.500]   team who had been fired from Apple.
[01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:36.220]   And you would think that that would say, okay, I guess this is an April Fool's joke, but
[01:17:36.220 --> 01:17:38.580]   Apple was getting 500 emails.
[01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:43.740]   We got 500 phone calls from people who said, oh, I got to where do I take my Mac 128 back
[01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:48.020]   in because apparently, you know, either people read the first three paragraphs or somebody
[01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:51.300]   who needs someone in a real news act would actually happen was that someone who is writes
[01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:56.580]   for a new real newspaper who apparently had two inches left in his column basically heard
[01:17:56.580 --> 01:17:59.100]   about this and just a source of the Boston computers.
[01:17:59.100 --> 01:18:00.700]   Let's just throw that in.
[01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:04.340]   It's like the gasoline soaked rags did not get away.
[01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:09.420]   But really does this every year he got to, you know, to be fair, he does it a neighbor
[01:18:09.420 --> 01:18:15.060]   first, which is usually a giveaway and usually he has he quotes somebody and it called the
[01:18:15.060 --> 01:18:19.900]   slurp of slurp aloof, which is a refus backwards.
[01:18:19.900 --> 01:18:22.540]   And to me, I always see the slurp aloof on that kind of note.
[01:18:22.540 --> 01:18:25.060]   And I'm always looking for the slurp aloof in everything.
[01:18:25.060 --> 01:18:30.740]   Maybe that's maybe that's just because I'm a cynical soapy new just a quick update new
[01:18:30.740 --> 01:18:32.620]   iPhone software three one three.
[01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:36.460]   It's not three point two, which is the software that was on the iPad, but we're getting closer,
[01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:42.540]   I guess, three one three is out now if you are an iPhone user, a better battery level
[01:18:42.540 --> 01:18:48.020]   reporting, according to the change logs fixes for problems with the Japanese Kana keyboard,
[01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:52.060]   which by the way, I think I discovered in the iPad petting zoo because I had a Japanese
[01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:56.340]   journalist ahead of me turn on the Kana keyboard and the whole thing crashed.
[01:18:56.340 --> 01:19:04.820]   So maybe they fixed it preempt early for the I pad and some other minor fixes in Ipone
[01:19:04.820 --> 01:19:07.380]   three one three.
[01:19:07.380 --> 01:19:08.380]   Ipone.
[01:19:08.380 --> 01:19:12.980]   That's that new that's that new corn corn management app, right?
[01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:13.980]   Ipone.
[01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:14.980]   Wouldn't that have been a good name?
[01:19:14.980 --> 01:19:15.980]   The Ipone.
[01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:16.980]   No relation to you.
[01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:17.980]   It's terrific.
[01:19:17.980 --> 01:19:19.980]   Yeah, because the Icob and the it was already taken.
[01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:21.700]   Icob they couldn't do it.
[01:19:21.700 --> 01:19:23.820]   That's the final break.
[01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:26.420]   It probably does it probably does break that.
[01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:28.100]   Yeah, that's actually the iPhone.
[01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:32.380]   Hey, don't don't upgrade if you want to keep your jailbreak.
[01:19:32.380 --> 01:19:33.380]   It's going to be harder.
[01:19:33.380 --> 01:19:37.420]   Before is going to make it harder to jailbreak the pad, right?
[01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:38.420]   You know, I don't know.
[01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:41.380]   I never bet against smart 12 year olds.
[01:19:41.380 --> 01:19:42.380]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:44.380]   They got a lot of time.
[01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:46.380]   What was that?
[01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:48.100]   It's what it said again?
[01:19:48.100 --> 01:19:50.380]   It's I never bet against smart 12 year olds.
[01:19:50.380 --> 01:19:51.380]   Never do.
[01:19:51.380 --> 01:19:53.180]   Never bet against a smart 12 year old.
[01:19:53.180 --> 01:19:54.780]   I'm going to write that.
[01:19:54.780 --> 01:19:55.780]   That's a good.
[01:19:55.780 --> 01:19:57.780]   It's a words to live by.
[01:19:57.780 --> 01:19:58.780]   Sure.
[01:19:58.780 --> 01:20:02.060]   Also, 9.0.3.
[01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:03.660]   Is that right?
[01:20:03.660 --> 01:20:05.780]   On the iTunes, an update there.
[01:20:05.780 --> 01:20:11.420]   I imagine that has similar pirate breaking updates.
[01:20:11.420 --> 01:20:12.940]   Well, I just downloaded it.
[01:20:12.940 --> 01:20:15.900]   I've heard about it about a half hour ago.
[01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:19.580]   One of the things I'm really curious about, it says that it corrects a problem where it
[01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:21.580]   loses your password.
[01:20:21.580 --> 01:20:27.340]   So as I've rented several times before, this iTunes keeps asking me, "Sorry, your account
[01:20:27.340 --> 01:20:29.620]   has been disabled for security reasons."
[01:20:29.620 --> 01:20:34.260]   And then I have to then gollyingly have to click a button that says, "Forgot your password."
[01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:35.260]   That's okay.
[01:20:35.260 --> 01:20:37.260]   Lots of people forget your password.
[01:20:37.260 --> 01:20:38.260]   No, I didn't.
[01:20:38.260 --> 01:20:39.900]   You guys, you forgot.
[01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:41.900]   You forgot not me.
[01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:43.820]   So let's see if that fixes it.
[01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:45.740]   I'm trying it right now because it forgot my password.
[01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:48.340]   It's just, it looks, I have it in front of me right now and it looks absolutely identical
[01:20:48.340 --> 01:20:49.740]   to what we had before.
[01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:51.700]   There's nothing visual about it.
[01:20:51.700 --> 01:20:56.060]   It looks like I remembered my password and then just flashed all of my account information
[01:20:56.060 --> 01:20:57.060]   on the screen.
[01:20:57.060 --> 01:20:58.060]   So those of you who are watching at home.
[01:20:58.060 --> 01:21:01.820]   If you just rewind and pause, you should be able to get everything you need.
[01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:02.820]   Great.
[01:21:02.820 --> 01:21:06.220]   I want the entire lost UVA before I start again.
[01:21:06.220 --> 01:21:10.820]   So thank you very much for that.
[01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:14.580]   I'm actually, you know, I'm going to buy, there's a couple of apps I want to buy for
[01:21:14.580 --> 01:21:15.580]   the iPad.
[01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:17.260]   One is the Sling app, which is a little overpriced.
[01:21:17.260 --> 01:21:22.140]   I think it's 25 bucks because I want to put a Sling box on my, then I can use the iPad
[01:21:22.140 --> 01:21:24.580]   as a TV and walk around with it anywhere, right?
[01:21:24.580 --> 01:21:27.540]   But then somebody's saying, "I TV for five bucks to do that," right?
[01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:28.540]   And I have I TV.
[01:21:28.540 --> 01:21:30.460]   So maybe I'll just do it with the I TV.
[01:21:30.460 --> 01:21:33.060]   And the remote apps are going to be really nice on these things.
[01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:34.060]   The Sonos.
[01:21:34.060 --> 01:21:35.060]   The Sonos is great.
[01:21:35.060 --> 01:21:38.180]   I mean, it's great anyway because it duplicates the interface.
[01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:39.900]   It's on their hardware controller.
[01:21:39.900 --> 01:21:43.260]   But for controlling your AV gear, because a lot of companies are now starting to come
[01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:45.620]   out with these IR dongles.
[01:21:45.620 --> 01:21:48.380]   And doing it on the iPhone is it's a little clumsy.
[01:21:48.380 --> 01:21:53.140]   We're actually controlling a mini that's plugged into your TV, having that space to
[01:21:53.140 --> 01:21:54.860]   be able to really move around.
[01:21:54.860 --> 01:21:58.860]   I was going to say that's something like the air touch or the remote.
[01:21:58.860 --> 01:21:59.860]   Air touch.
[01:21:59.860 --> 01:22:03.700]   Because it's going to turn it into a keyboard for your mini even the TV.
[01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:05.780]   You know what it's going to turn it into?
[01:22:05.780 --> 01:22:08.380]   It's going to turn it into that computer at work.
[01:22:08.380 --> 01:22:13.980]   I mean, if you can run VNC full screen sharing on this thing, if it's as snappy as it sounds,
[01:22:13.980 --> 01:22:15.660]   I mean, that's, yeah.
[01:22:15.660 --> 01:22:20.420]   I see that that will be the ultimate accessory to have to like buy one of these stupid little
[01:22:20.420 --> 01:22:24.380]   like Windows tablets that are going to, that's going to cost about $500.
[01:22:24.380 --> 01:22:29.820]   Velcro it to the back of your iPad and just run VNC to get a much, much better interface.
[01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:34.740]   You can run all your Windows apps on the iPad via VNC with this little like piggyback thing
[01:22:34.740 --> 01:22:38.820]   you've duct tape to the back of it and still have the full iPad experience.
[01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:41.220]   That's totally Philip K glass or Philip K glass.
[01:22:41.220 --> 01:22:42.220]   That's a funny name.
[01:22:42.220 --> 01:22:44.980]   So it gets totally full of K dick.
[01:22:44.980 --> 01:22:45.980]   The glass.
[01:22:45.980 --> 01:22:47.140]   I think is his real name.
[01:22:47.140 --> 01:22:51.660]   It's the same plot over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over.
[01:22:51.660 --> 01:22:53.380]   Androids androids androids.
[01:22:53.380 --> 01:22:57.220]   Sheep, sheep, sheep, androids androids androids androids.
[01:22:57.220 --> 01:22:58.220]   Sheep.
[01:22:58.220 --> 01:22:59.220]   Nicely done.
[01:22:59.220 --> 01:23:00.220]   Oh, good.
[01:23:00.220 --> 01:23:03.460]   As we've turned into NPR, we're making more Philip glass jokes.
[01:23:03.460 --> 01:23:04.460]   That's bad.
[01:23:04.460 --> 01:23:08.300]   This is the sort of sort of programming that you like.
[01:23:08.300 --> 01:23:11.060]   We all mean, you're supported radio and MPa.
[01:23:11.060 --> 01:23:12.900]   Don't forget to tell me a sex.
[01:23:12.900 --> 01:23:15.460]   A woman who makes typewriters out of old toothbakes.
[01:23:15.460 --> 01:23:17.660]   We'll be back.
[01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:20.260]   Philip K dick.
[01:23:20.260 --> 01:23:21.420]   Philip K dick.
[01:23:21.420 --> 01:23:25.340]   Who never collaborated with Philip glass in my to my knowledge.
[01:23:25.340 --> 01:23:26.340]   No, okay.
[01:23:26.340 --> 01:23:28.940]   Anyway, I've used those apps on the iPhone and they're crazy.
[01:23:28.940 --> 01:23:29.940]   Great.
[01:23:29.940 --> 01:23:30.940]   I mean, well, what's the one?
[01:23:30.940 --> 01:23:32.860]   I don't have my phone here with me, but there's one.
[01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:34.420]   There's a terminal app that's pretty amazing.
[01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:35.420]   I forget what it's called.
[01:23:35.420 --> 01:23:36.420]   Something touch.
[01:23:36.420 --> 01:23:37.420]   And I'm trying to remember this.
[01:23:37.420 --> 01:23:38.420]   Oh, you know what it is?
[01:23:38.420 --> 01:23:41.180]   It's that you mentioned it that the Vonu or what's it called?
[01:23:41.180 --> 01:23:42.180]   Vonu VLC.
[01:23:42.180 --> 01:23:43.780]   You know what I'm talking about you guys?
[01:23:43.780 --> 01:23:44.780]   Yeah.
[01:23:44.780 --> 01:23:47.820]   And so one of the nerds in the in the chat room, tell me what this is called.
[01:23:47.820 --> 01:23:48.820]   Vonu or Vadu?
[01:23:48.820 --> 01:23:49.820]   Vadu.
[01:23:49.820 --> 01:23:50.820]   Vonu.
[01:23:50.820 --> 01:23:51.820]   You'll learn anyway.
[01:23:51.820 --> 01:23:52.820]   It's a dude.
[01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:53.820]   Jadu.
[01:23:53.820 --> 01:23:54.820]   Jadu.
[01:23:54.820 --> 01:23:55.820]   Jadu.
[01:23:55.820 --> 01:23:56.820]   Thank you.
[01:23:56.820 --> 01:23:57.820]   You run a demon type deal on your Mac.
[01:23:57.820 --> 01:23:58.820]   Have you guys used this?
[01:23:58.820 --> 01:23:59.820]   It's crazy.
[01:23:59.820 --> 01:24:04.860]   You run a demon kind of thing on your Mac and you basically SSH in and your entire, you
[01:24:04.860 --> 01:24:09.020]   can squeeze and pinch and it's basically screen sharing on your iPhone and it works
[01:24:09.020 --> 01:24:12.020]   and it's crazy.
[01:24:12.020 --> 01:24:14.820]   And now you lose the squeeze and pinch putting on the iPad.
[01:24:14.820 --> 01:24:16.540]   So it's it's wonderful.
[01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:17.540]   Do you will be wonderful?
[01:24:17.540 --> 01:24:19.420]   I love the ways in pinch.
[01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:20.420]   Stink.
[01:24:20.420 --> 01:24:23.700]   By the way, I love, you know what I love about the iPad?
[01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:27.700]   Even if you hate the iPad, you hate Apple, you hate everything that's nice, new, shiny
[01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:32.820]   and pretty, even if you hate your world and the life that you live, the great thing about
[01:24:32.820 --> 01:24:39.100]   competition is it stimulates everybody to step up and you know what Google just did?
[01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:43.500]   They announced their shipping and update to the Nexus One to turn on multi touch.
[01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:48.820]   And by the way, I interpret that as a shot.
[01:24:48.820 --> 01:24:52.660]   Apple and Google have started to kind of shoot at each other a little bit.
[01:24:52.660 --> 01:24:56.820]   And I think Google didn't put a multi touch in out of respect to Apple or out of deference
[01:24:56.820 --> 01:24:59.500]   to Apple or maybe fear of a lawsuit.
[01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:01.820]   And I think that was it was available internationally, but not here.
[01:25:01.820 --> 01:25:04.380]   Yeah, wasn't available in the US or Apple has multi touch patents.
[01:25:04.380 --> 01:25:07.700]   And I think this is Google's way of saying.
[01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:08.700]   Okay.
[01:25:08.700 --> 01:25:09.700]   Okay.
[01:25:09.700 --> 01:25:11.660]   It's not officially okay.
[01:25:11.660 --> 01:25:12.660]   So it's like this.
[01:25:12.660 --> 01:25:13.660]   Okay.
[01:25:13.660 --> 01:25:15.540]   So it's it is on.
[01:25:15.540 --> 01:25:20.100]   I didn't know it was going to be like this, but I guess now I guess like this great, great
[01:25:20.100 --> 01:25:21.100]   beliefs on.
[01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:25.180]   Well, I think that's so interesting that now it's Apple and Google.
[01:25:25.180 --> 01:25:26.180]   Yeah.
[01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:27.660]   Who thought that was going to happen?
[01:25:27.660 --> 01:25:30.100]   Yeah, they were in bed with each other for a long time.
[01:25:30.100 --> 01:25:31.780]   You talk about the red stapler guy.
[01:25:31.780 --> 01:25:33.620]   Now Microsoft is the.
[01:25:33.620 --> 01:25:35.420]   We market share.
[01:25:35.420 --> 01:25:38.420]   We still matter.
[01:25:38.420 --> 01:25:39.420]   Right.
[01:25:39.420 --> 01:25:44.580]   I'm going to be going to set the server page on fire.
[01:25:44.580 --> 01:25:45.580]   Okay.
[01:25:45.580 --> 01:25:47.580]   App for the seven bubble.
[01:25:47.580 --> 01:25:48.580]   Please.
[01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:52.340]   I was told I would I was told I would dominate the market for many years.
[01:25:52.340 --> 01:25:55.740]   Of course, I will set the active server pages on fire.
[01:25:55.740 --> 01:26:01.500]   Didn't Microsoft say that a problem with the iPad is it doesn't support net.
[01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:02.500]   That could be.
[01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:05.660]   Oh, there you go big mess up with Apple there.
[01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:06.660]   They're kicking themselves.
[01:26:06.660 --> 01:26:08.300]   You did see the wired question.
[01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:09.300]   Yes.
[01:26:09.300 --> 01:26:10.460]   Andy, have you used I'm sorry.
[01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:13.700]   Have you used the multi touch on on the Nexus one?
[01:26:13.700 --> 01:26:15.580]   I'm just that seems like that would be crazy crashing.
[01:26:15.580 --> 01:26:19.180]   I mean, potentially just because it's there's so much going on with that on top of everything
[01:26:19.180 --> 01:26:20.180]   you're doing.
[01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:22.980]   Is it pretty stable as far as you know?
[01:26:22.980 --> 01:26:25.420]   Well, the the update just came out today.
[01:26:25.420 --> 01:26:26.420]   I have used my international.
[01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:27.420]   You could do it.
[01:26:27.420 --> 01:26:28.420]   Go ahead.
[01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:30.220]   You have to have the milestone.
[01:26:30.220 --> 01:26:33.220]   I thought you said internationally it was available.
[01:26:33.220 --> 01:26:34.220]   It is if you have the.
[01:26:34.220 --> 01:26:36.420]   I'm saying it is available internationally.
[01:26:36.420 --> 01:26:43.500]   Someone showed someone obtained that update via paralegal means and let me use it on his
[01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:45.140]   on his droid phone.
[01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:48.700]   International law and it worked just fine.
[01:26:48.700 --> 01:26:50.100]   It's not very it's not very fast.
[01:26:50.100 --> 01:26:51.100]   It's not very responsive.
[01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:55.980]   I think if anything, it shows off how limited their multi touch stack is.
[01:26:55.980 --> 01:26:57.340]   I mean, it's just not very good.
[01:26:57.340 --> 01:27:03.980]   I think I think right now there's a an Android commercial commercial for some sort of Android
[01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:04.980]   series of phone.
[01:27:04.980 --> 01:27:10.380]   I'm sorry, the my touch phone for the runs Android and shows and shows Eric clapped and
[01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:14.340]   like strumming a guitar on his like little Android guitar.
[01:27:14.340 --> 01:27:18.060]   Yeah, and I downloaded those apps because I got really interested in these like keyboard
[01:27:18.060 --> 01:27:24.020]   apps you can get for for the iPhone and they're almost unusable on an Android device because
[01:27:24.020 --> 01:27:28.420]   we're ass on the iPhone you can actually stroke within within a few seconds.
[01:27:28.420 --> 01:27:30.260]   You're just going strum strum strum, core change.
[01:27:30.260 --> 01:27:32.820]   So I'm strum strum with the Android device.
[01:27:32.820 --> 01:27:36.500]   It's strum strum strum strum strum.
[01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:39.260]   It's like being at the Grammys where you can't hear yourself actually play.
[01:27:39.260 --> 01:27:40.420]   So everyone thinks that you're out.
[01:27:40.420 --> 01:27:42.060]   You're completely out of sync with everybody.
[01:27:42.060 --> 01:27:43.060]   It's not my experience.
[01:27:43.060 --> 01:27:45.940]   I have a multi touch browser on the Nexus one.
[01:27:45.940 --> 01:27:46.940]   All right.
[01:27:46.940 --> 01:27:48.460]   The third party multi touch browser.
[01:27:48.460 --> 01:27:51.660]   You can get it's called dolphin and it I mean, I'm doing it right now.
[01:27:51.660 --> 01:27:52.660]   It does a pretty good job.
[01:27:52.660 --> 01:27:53.660]   It's not multi touch.
[01:27:53.660 --> 01:27:55.340]   I mean, it's it's fast.
[01:27:55.340 --> 01:27:57.980]   It's not that that's not what I'm seeing.
[01:27:57.980 --> 01:28:03.380]   Yeah, you know, I think it also you want we'll find out because the real key is Google maps.
[01:28:03.380 --> 01:28:05.540]   That's the one you really want multi touch on.
[01:28:05.540 --> 01:28:07.180]   Maybe the gallery the photo gallery.
[01:28:07.180 --> 01:28:08.180]   Those are the things that are missing.
[01:28:08.180 --> 01:28:09.620]   But but the browser works fine.
[01:28:09.620 --> 01:28:12.860]   I mean, I'm able to I'm able to surf and use multi touch all the time.
[01:28:12.860 --> 01:28:14.940]   And frankly, that's that's something I really was missing.
[01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:18.180]   I hate that zoom that silly little zoom that's stupid.
[01:28:18.180 --> 01:28:19.180]   Yeah.
[01:28:19.180 --> 01:28:20.820]   Magnifying glasses a real limitation.
[01:28:20.820 --> 01:28:26.420]   So, you know, it kind of works for me watch on just zoom in on these things and you know,
[01:28:26.420 --> 01:28:28.820]   and it scales the fonts pretty well and all of that.
[01:28:28.820 --> 01:28:36.120]   So but anyway, anyway, who's who's to say you get the phone you like, you know, that's
[01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:37.120]   all I can say.
[01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:38.820]   So long as you admit that I'm right, then you're wrong.
[01:28:38.820 --> 01:28:39.820]   We can pass this.
[01:28:39.820 --> 01:28:41.220]   There's no need to keep by the way.
[01:28:41.220 --> 01:28:46.460]   Oh, I forgot one very important detail on the three one three update.
[01:28:46.460 --> 01:28:52.180]   The iPhone now understands the word iPad and stops turning it into I Puss or Puss or whatever
[01:28:52.180 --> 01:28:53.180]   it was.
[01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:55.580]   So that's I think really the main reason for 3.13.
[01:28:55.580 --> 01:28:56.580]   Exactly.
[01:28:56.580 --> 01:28:58.180]   I just tweeted about that like two days ago.
[01:28:58.180 --> 01:29:02.580]   What are how long before they released an update just to correct that you did and they
[01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:04.940]   did it was two days for the
[01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:08.200]   e-i-l
[01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:11.860]   Let us move on to our picks of the week here in just a second before we do.
[01:29:11.860 --> 01:29:14.860]   I do want to do our audible pick of the week audible is our sponsor.
[01:29:14.860 --> 01:29:17.940]   Of course, they do the great audio books that we love.
[01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:23.900]   So well, they had a nice page on audible.com where they listed all the Grammy nominees for
[01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:29.420]   spoken word that were on audible and it's almost, you know, well, it is everything that the
[01:29:29.420 --> 01:29:33.660]   nice thing about audible now is they're so dominant in audio books that pretty much they
[01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:37.260]   have everything there is to get in audio.
[01:29:37.260 --> 01:29:44.700]   If you go to audible.com right now, actually audible.com/macbreak you can sign up for
[01:29:44.700 --> 01:29:50.820]   a free book, which is a pretty good deal audible.com/macbreak.
[01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:52.580]   There are 70,000 to choose from though.
[01:29:52.580 --> 01:29:58.140]   So we like to pick one just so you know, you know, kind of what you're getting into.
[01:29:58.140 --> 01:30:00.820]   Andy, did you have something you wanted to pick?
[01:30:00.820 --> 01:30:06.140]   Yes, I'm halfway through last week's pick, which is Craig Ferguson's American.
[01:30:06.140 --> 01:30:07.140]   I just want to hear that.
[01:30:07.140 --> 01:30:08.140]   Yeah.
[01:30:08.140 --> 01:30:13.500]   And it's just it's that's such a good book that it has it has been upgraded to to any
[01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:17.300]   time I'm in the car, even if it's just five minutes to go down to FedEx, I'm listening
[01:30:17.300 --> 01:30:18.300]   to this book.
[01:30:18.300 --> 01:30:20.740]   Usually I say them for when drives are more than a half an hour.
[01:30:20.740 --> 01:30:22.260]   So that's still paying dividends.
[01:30:22.260 --> 01:30:27.500]   The next one I've got lined up is something that I read the first chapter of in an airport
[01:30:27.500 --> 01:30:28.500]   bookstore.
[01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:33.980]   George Carlin's biography, last words.
[01:30:33.980 --> 01:30:36.780]   Tony Hendra is a name that's going to be familiar to a lot of our listeners.
[01:30:36.780 --> 01:30:41.340]   He was one of the original editors of the golden era of the national lampoon.
[01:30:41.340 --> 01:30:42.860]   He was he paid.
[01:30:42.860 --> 01:30:45.940]   He played the tour manager and spinal tap.
[01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:47.260]   He is a good comedy heritage.
[01:30:47.260 --> 01:30:52.180]   And apparently for years, he and George Carlin were talking about doing a biography of George
[01:30:52.180 --> 01:30:55.820]   together and they recorded hours and hours and hours of interviews together.
[01:30:55.820 --> 01:30:59.060]   And so after Carlin died, they he approached the family.
[01:30:59.060 --> 01:31:00.460]   So well, look, we got all these notes.
[01:31:00.460 --> 01:31:03.300]   We should really I'd really like to keep working on this.
[01:31:03.300 --> 01:31:04.300]   And I haven't read the whole thing.
[01:31:04.300 --> 01:31:06.420]   I read the first couple of chapters.
[01:31:06.420 --> 01:31:11.100]   And what I like about this, what really encourages me to get the entire audio book
[01:31:11.100 --> 01:31:15.580]   is because we're used to hearing George Carlin's voice through his comedy where he knows he's
[01:31:15.580 --> 01:31:17.900]   going to be in front of two or three thousand people.
[01:31:17.900 --> 01:31:20.180]   And so and it has to make jokes and be funny.
[01:31:20.180 --> 01:31:25.620]   So this is a chance this is a time where we can hear his voice not trying to be a stand
[01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:31.500]   up but trying to be George Carlin explaining his philosophies and his ideas and what formed
[01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:33.100]   and influenced him.
[01:31:33.100 --> 01:31:37.500]   There's some excerpts that are up on George Carlin dot com that really brings this home.
[01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:41.700]   It's one thing when he's talking about individualism and value systems and religion where he knows
[01:31:41.700 --> 01:31:45.700]   it does not have to build up to everybody laughing and applauding that really makes you
[01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:48.220]   understand his feelings a lot more.
[01:31:48.220 --> 01:31:51.300]   And plus it is a great straight biography.
[01:31:51.300 --> 01:31:55.340]   I've been a George Carlin fan since I was 12 or 13 years old and I bought my first George
[01:31:55.340 --> 01:31:59.660]   Carlin record and it was years and it wasn't until like five or six years ago that I understood
[01:31:59.660 --> 01:32:03.580]   that my perceptions of his history were completely wrong.
[01:32:03.580 --> 01:32:08.420]   I always thought that he was one of these fringe comedians that couldn't get a booking, couldn't
[01:32:08.420 --> 01:32:09.700]   get lunch in any town.
[01:32:09.700 --> 01:32:14.380]   But then the hippie move and started and suddenly people his philosophies and his style of comedy
[01:32:14.380 --> 01:32:18.100]   became commercial and so he was able to have a success.
[01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:24.420]   No, he was the straight laced suit and tie short hair Ed Sullivan show Hollywood Palace
[01:32:24.420 --> 01:32:28.580]   comedian doing jokes about the hippie dippy weatherman and stuff that really had a very
[01:32:28.580 --> 01:32:31.220]   low short life shelf life.
[01:32:31.220 --> 01:32:35.260]   And he was having a huge career and a lot of success like this, but he decided this isn't
[01:32:35.260 --> 01:32:36.260]   me.
[01:32:36.260 --> 01:32:37.420]   This isn't how I want to spend my future.
[01:32:37.420 --> 01:32:43.420]   He totally threw out his entire act, totally threw out his entire persona and totally trashed
[01:32:43.420 --> 01:32:48.020]   his entire career to start again from step one to be the George Carlin that we all know
[01:32:48.020 --> 01:32:49.020]   and love.
[01:32:49.020 --> 01:32:52.260]   So this is a lot of that story about how that was the decisions were made.
[01:32:52.260 --> 01:32:53.980]   So it's about six and a half hours.
[01:32:53.980 --> 01:32:59.940]   It's not the most stickness of the man you can get for your free book or for your credit.
[01:32:59.940 --> 01:33:01.740]   But it's from what I've seen with us so far.
[01:33:01.740 --> 01:33:04.060]   I'm really looking forward to diving into it.
[01:33:04.060 --> 01:33:09.820]   You know what I like about it is it's narrated as you said by Tony Hendra who is really great.
[01:33:09.820 --> 01:33:13.580]   And by Patrick Carlin who I presume is must be George's son.
[01:33:13.580 --> 01:33:14.580]   Yes.
[01:33:14.580 --> 01:33:15.580]   I believe so.
[01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:16.580]   Yeah.
[01:33:16.580 --> 01:33:18.660]   So that's kind of that's kind of a neat twist.
[01:33:18.660 --> 01:33:21.580]   George Carlin last words.
[01:33:21.580 --> 01:33:25.260]   It's yeah, it's a bridged unfortunately Simon and Schuster published it abridged.
[01:33:25.260 --> 01:33:28.020]   But hey, at least we get to hear this much of it.
[01:33:28.020 --> 01:33:31.900]   Tony Hendra by the way has a great book also on audible.com.
[01:33:31.900 --> 01:33:33.620]   It's not a biography.
[01:33:33.620 --> 01:33:35.500]   Is a father Joe father Joe, right?
[01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:36.780]   Oh, is that a good book?
[01:33:36.780 --> 01:33:39.500]   Yeah, I think I recommended it a couple of years ago.
[01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:41.140]   Yeah, it's it was part of that.
[01:33:41.140 --> 01:33:44.940]   It was part of the market that was created by Tuesdays with Morrie where middle aged man
[01:33:44.940 --> 01:33:48.700]   tells a story about how talking to an old man for most of his life really helped him
[01:33:48.700 --> 01:33:49.700]   out a lot.
[01:33:49.700 --> 01:33:51.580]   But it wasn't but it wasn't the sort of self serving.
[01:33:51.580 --> 01:33:55.500]   Yes, I'm a much better person unlike you who's never thought about these things.
[01:33:55.500 --> 01:33:56.500]   Yeah.
[01:33:56.500 --> 01:33:59.980]   And it's a great picture of all the scripts he's made in his life and this really sweet
[01:33:59.980 --> 01:34:05.740]   monk who despite despite living in an Abbey in on the coast of France, all of his life,
[01:34:05.740 --> 01:34:10.860]   you know, just seem to through Tony Hendra's recollections and eyes just seem to really
[01:34:10.860 --> 01:34:14.740]   understand that the only thing that's really important in life is to care for each other
[01:34:14.740 --> 01:34:15.740]   and to love each other.
[01:34:15.740 --> 01:34:18.860]   And then once you stop thinking of your life in those terms, everything else falls into
[01:34:18.860 --> 01:34:20.740]   place very, very inspirational.
[01:34:20.740 --> 01:34:22.300]   Good pick.
[01:34:22.300 --> 01:34:23.740]   And of course you can get it free.
[01:34:23.740 --> 01:34:28.740]   That's the beauty of this.
[01:34:28.740 --> 01:34:29.740]   Go to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:34:29.740 --> 01:34:30.740]   Sign up for that gold account.
[01:34:30.740 --> 01:34:31.740]   That's a book a month and the first one's free.
[01:34:31.740 --> 01:34:32.740]   You're just to keep you can cancel it anytime.
[01:34:32.740 --> 01:34:36.740]   I got to say that before you pick, you should browse around because there's so much great
[01:34:36.740 --> 01:34:37.740]   stuff.
[01:34:37.740 --> 01:34:44.740]   You know, best sellers, classics, sci-fi, science and technology and more audible.com/macbreak.
[01:34:44.740 --> 01:34:50.020]   We thank you so much for the support of Mac Break Weekly and I love it that they publish
[01:34:50.020 --> 01:34:53.780]   books like this because it's just, you know, great to hear this stuff in people's own
[01:34:53.780 --> 01:34:54.780]   words.
[01:34:54.780 --> 01:34:57.300]   Time for our picks of the week.
[01:34:57.300 --> 01:34:59.500]   Who wants to go for a show of hands?
[01:34:59.500 --> 01:35:01.380]   Chris Breen, you're in the upper left hand corner.
[01:35:01.380 --> 01:35:03.180]   Chris Breen the block.
[01:35:03.180 --> 01:35:04.740]   All right.
[01:35:04.740 --> 01:35:09.540]   I haven't been on for a while, so I had to search through your site to see if anybody
[01:35:09.540 --> 01:35:12.140]   had recommended this and no one had and I was surprised.
[01:35:12.140 --> 01:35:14.540]   It is the little app factories rip it.
[01:35:14.540 --> 01:35:16.420]   It's $20.
[01:35:16.420 --> 01:35:20.100]   And it's for ripping DVDs that you own.
[01:35:20.100 --> 01:35:23.020]   If you try to rip DVDs that you don't own, it works too.
[01:35:23.020 --> 01:35:24.820]   But you go to hell.
[01:35:24.820 --> 01:35:25.980]   They know somehow.
[01:35:25.980 --> 01:35:30.180]   They know somehow that's a bad story.
[01:35:30.180 --> 01:35:35.620]   Somehow your immortal soul has just, and you know, honestly, you know, a copy of Alvin
[01:35:35.620 --> 01:35:39.380]   in the chip box is not worth spending an eternity in a firewood.
[01:35:39.380 --> 01:35:40.980]   Wouldn't that be sad?
[01:35:40.980 --> 01:35:45.540]   You know, you get to the pearly gates and everything's perfect and clean except they say, wait
[01:35:45.540 --> 01:35:48.660]   a minute, there's this one thing.
[01:35:48.660 --> 01:35:49.660]   One ball.
[01:35:49.660 --> 01:35:50.660]   Who is this?
[01:35:50.660 --> 01:35:52.660]   It's the hell for you, pal.
[01:35:52.660 --> 01:35:54.660]   Oh, God, that'd be horrible.
[01:35:54.660 --> 01:35:57.100]   And worse than you have to watch it for eternity.
[01:35:57.100 --> 01:35:58.420]   Yeah, earnest goes to camp.
[01:35:58.420 --> 01:36:00.060]   Well, that would be the punishment.
[01:36:00.060 --> 01:36:02.060]   You liked it so much.
[01:36:02.060 --> 01:36:03.060]   It's yours.
[01:36:03.060 --> 01:36:05.060]   It's for eternity.
[01:36:05.060 --> 01:36:14.380]   Oh, so what this thing is unlike handbrake, I can actually rip the entire DVD.
[01:36:14.380 --> 01:36:16.660]   So you get everything that's on the DVD.
[01:36:16.660 --> 01:36:18.580]   So this is just the main feature.
[01:36:18.580 --> 01:36:23.140]   You get all the extras, all the subtitles, all the alternate angles and languages.
[01:36:23.140 --> 01:36:25.940]   And it may be the easiest software you've ever used.
[01:36:25.940 --> 01:36:31.220]   You put in a DVD and you push the rip button and then you go away for an hour and it's
[01:36:31.220 --> 01:36:32.220]   done.
[01:36:32.220 --> 01:36:36.860]   And the quality is fantastic because it doesn't do any kind of transcending, just removing
[01:36:36.860 --> 01:36:38.340]   the copy protection.
[01:36:38.340 --> 01:36:42.660]   It gives you a DVD file that you can play with DVD player.
[01:36:42.660 --> 01:36:47.180]   If at that point you want to do some kind of encoding, you can bring it into something
[01:36:47.180 --> 01:36:52.740]   I can break and then rip just the main feature out of it and put it on your iPod, your iPad,
[01:36:52.740 --> 01:36:55.020]   your iPhone or any kind of stuff.
[01:36:55.020 --> 01:36:58.140]   Let me make this clear because I want to go to hell.
[01:36:58.140 --> 01:37:00.020]   Does it take off the copy protection?
[01:37:00.020 --> 01:37:04.100]   So in other words, there's no more protection on the ripped version.
[01:37:04.100 --> 01:37:05.100]   Absolutely right.
[01:37:05.100 --> 01:37:06.980]   All the copy protection is gone.
[01:37:06.980 --> 01:37:11.940]   And one reason I recommend this because there is handbrake, which is free and this is $20.
[01:37:11.940 --> 01:37:17.780]   But this thing has nailed every single DVD I've ever tried to throw at it.
[01:37:17.780 --> 01:37:21.580]   And that includes anything that came out in the last week.
[01:37:21.580 --> 01:37:27.580]   If you look at their site, they have statistics on this and it's like $99.99992.
[01:37:27.580 --> 01:37:31.460]   And if you find a DVD that it can't rip, you just send them a message saying, "This one
[01:37:31.460 --> 01:37:32.460]   doesn't work.
[01:37:32.460 --> 01:37:34.700]   They'll go out and buy it and they'll figure out a way to do it and then they'll update
[01:37:34.700 --> 01:37:35.700]   the program."
[01:37:35.700 --> 01:37:37.420]   You know, it also does.
[01:37:37.420 --> 01:37:41.660]   I mean, this, this, I hate to be all Corey Doctorow, but it's crazy making to me that
[01:37:41.660 --> 01:37:46.260]   I buy a frickin DVD and then I've got to sit through an ad at the beginning that I can't
[01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:47.260]   fast forward through.
[01:37:47.260 --> 01:37:48.260]   Rip it.
[01:37:48.260 --> 01:37:49.460]   It'll take that out.
[01:37:49.460 --> 01:37:52.460]   It will make it so that you can skip over that or just take it out completely.
[01:37:52.460 --> 01:37:53.460]   Very good.
[01:37:53.460 --> 01:37:55.180]   And remember that right, Chris?
[01:37:55.180 --> 01:37:57.700]   I might be thinking of Mac the Ripper, but I believe that's right.
[01:37:57.700 --> 01:38:01.660]   You maybe think of Mac the Ripper because I believe that Ripper give or rip it gives
[01:38:01.660 --> 01:38:03.260]   you an exact copy.
[01:38:03.260 --> 01:38:04.420]   So you get everything.
[01:38:04.420 --> 01:38:07.660]   So if you don't like the ad, then you take it into something like Handbrake or Mac the
[01:38:07.660 --> 01:38:09.860]   Ripper and deal with it there.
[01:38:09.860 --> 01:38:13.820]   Or actually, once the copy protection is gone, then you can take it into toast or something
[01:38:13.820 --> 01:38:17.260]   else and deal with it there.
[01:38:17.260 --> 01:38:19.740]   Andy and Notko, how about a pick from you, sir?
[01:38:19.740 --> 01:38:21.900]   You're now in the upper right square, so you'd be next.
[01:38:21.900 --> 01:38:24.260]   This is clockwise order.
[01:38:24.260 --> 01:38:27.140]   I haven't seen Hogwarts squares in so long that I cannot come up with the inappropriate
[01:38:27.140 --> 01:38:28.700]   Paul Lindism.
[01:38:28.700 --> 01:38:35.700]   Just go, oh, oh, the last time I was in Dayton, Ohio.
[01:38:35.700 --> 01:38:40.260]   No, I think that was the bottom.
[01:38:40.260 --> 01:38:47.540]   Yeah, this is sometimes I come back to something that I'm sure I picked a couple of years
[01:38:47.540 --> 01:38:54.580]   ago only because it turns it really is one of those pick of the week all stars that there's
[01:38:54.580 --> 01:38:58.660]   something I need to do that I remember that I had this tool on my hard drive fort.
[01:38:58.660 --> 01:39:00.780]   And it absolutely solves all my problems.
[01:39:00.780 --> 01:39:06.020]   I am fixing doing style sheets for a new site and also for a couple of new pieces of content
[01:39:06.020 --> 01:39:08.500]   for my existing sites.
[01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:11.660]   And style sheets are just not easy enough to create.
[01:39:11.660 --> 01:39:18.220]   They're not it's not a creative process where you just simply let a design flow as you see
[01:39:18.220 --> 01:39:19.220]   pieces come together.
[01:39:19.220 --> 01:39:23.820]   You have to just think in terms of, you know, creating this CSS specification and BB edit
[01:39:23.820 --> 01:39:24.820]   or whatever your text edit is.
[01:39:24.820 --> 01:39:28.180]   And you have to remember, OK, I want margin gap of 12 points.
[01:39:28.180 --> 01:39:33.700]   And then a 10 point gutter and then at eight point, you know, you know, that.
[01:39:33.700 --> 01:39:38.940]   So this is really wonderful application from MacRabbit.com called CSS edit.
[01:39:38.940 --> 01:39:41.740]   That is just it's it's it's it's like a movie prop.
[01:39:41.740 --> 01:39:46.260]   If you ever had to do if a character in a movie needs to design a website, they would
[01:39:46.260 --> 01:39:50.460]   say no, we can't have shots of people just typing in numbers and just spreadsheet.
[01:39:50.460 --> 01:39:52.660]   Let's just make this phony baloney app that makes it all visual.
[01:39:52.660 --> 01:39:54.140]   But it makes it all visual.
[01:39:54.140 --> 01:39:59.540]   You tell with the URL of your of your CSS file is you tell the URL of the page that
[01:39:59.540 --> 01:40:02.980]   you're trying to redesign and then simply opens it up as CSS.
[01:40:02.980 --> 01:40:06.420]   And if you want to say, OK, what's that what's selected as being used for that?
[01:40:06.420 --> 01:40:08.820]   OK, that's a box for a.
[01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:10.580]   That's CSS style called question.
[01:40:10.580 --> 01:40:11.580]   Great.
[01:40:11.580 --> 01:40:12.580]   Where's question?
[01:40:12.580 --> 01:40:13.580]   Great.
[01:40:13.580 --> 01:40:14.580]   I click on the boxing question.
[01:40:14.580 --> 01:40:15.580]   It opens up the style sheet.
[01:40:15.580 --> 01:40:19.180]   And then I have a nice little like tool palette rather like a style palette that says, OK,
[01:40:19.180 --> 01:40:20.700]   now I want that background to be this colored.
[01:40:20.700 --> 01:40:21.700]   Great.
[01:40:21.700 --> 01:40:22.700]   I want to add a drop shadow like here.
[01:40:22.700 --> 01:40:23.700]   Great.
[01:40:23.700 --> 01:40:26.780]   I want to add a little bit more space.
[01:40:26.780 --> 01:40:27.780]   Great.
[01:40:27.780 --> 01:40:28.780]   Done.
[01:40:28.780 --> 01:40:29.780]   Perfect.
[01:40:29.780 --> 01:40:30.780]   Save it.
[01:40:30.780 --> 01:40:31.780]   We're done.
[01:40:31.780 --> 01:40:32.780]   So I'm telling you, I started off this project.
[01:40:32.780 --> 01:40:34.940]   It took me about an hour just to get the basic.
[01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:38.100]   I think I wanted to be inside a green box.
[01:40:38.100 --> 01:40:41.980]   I would also like if that's OK for that green box to be centered.
[01:40:41.980 --> 01:40:42.980]   If that's pop.
[01:40:42.980 --> 01:40:43.980]   No, OK, I don't do that.
[01:40:43.980 --> 01:40:44.980]   Well, how do I do?
[01:40:44.980 --> 01:40:45.980]   No, that's not how I do it.
[01:40:45.980 --> 01:40:47.260]   Well, how do I know that's not how I do it.
[01:40:47.260 --> 01:40:48.700]   Then I remember CSS at it.
[01:40:48.700 --> 01:40:52.500]   And within a half hour, I had every single change and every single new style I want.
[01:40:52.500 --> 01:40:55.220]   And it's done, dusted exactly well.
[01:40:55.220 --> 01:40:56.540]   It's only 40 bucks.
[01:40:56.540 --> 01:41:00.820]   But if you, I think at the half hour mark of trying to edit CSS by hand, you, that'll
[01:41:00.820 --> 01:41:02.820]   be the cheapest 40 bucks you have ever seen in your life.
[01:41:02.820 --> 01:41:03.820]   I haven't.
[01:41:03.820 --> 01:41:04.820]   I use it all the time and you're absolutely.
[01:41:04.820 --> 01:41:05.820]   It's from MacRabbit.
[01:41:05.820 --> 01:41:09.740]   It's absolutely spectacularly done.
[01:41:09.740 --> 01:41:16.900]   It's actually one of the there's some apps that make a Mac so recommendable over windows
[01:41:16.900 --> 01:41:19.620]   and CSS edit is one.
[01:41:19.620 --> 01:41:24.700]   Coda is the other one and the two combined are just great tools for web development.
[01:41:24.700 --> 01:41:26.540]   Just you know, there's nothing like it.
[01:41:26.540 --> 01:41:29.700]   Merlin, man, have you a pick for us, my friend?
[01:41:29.700 --> 01:41:30.700]   Oh, do I?
[01:41:30.700 --> 01:41:31.700]   First of all, I apologize.
[01:41:31.700 --> 01:41:34.860]   I'm informed by by Dane that I might have been on Wi-Fi.
[01:41:34.860 --> 01:41:37.940]   So that could be why you're not seeing much of me, but I know.
[01:41:37.940 --> 01:41:38.940]   Dane, no.
[01:41:38.940 --> 01:41:39.940]   Is he reading your?
[01:41:39.940 --> 01:41:40.940]   He's prescient.
[01:41:40.940 --> 01:41:42.980]   He's kind of stalking me a little bit.
[01:41:42.980 --> 01:41:43.980]   I'm a weird.
[01:41:43.980 --> 01:41:44.980]   Wow.
[01:41:44.980 --> 01:41:45.980]   Anyway, I apologize.
[01:41:45.980 --> 01:41:48.700]   I have got a pick that's going to blow your whatever clothing you have on.
[01:41:48.700 --> 01:41:49.700]   It'll be blown off.
[01:41:49.700 --> 01:41:50.700]   All right.
[01:41:50.700 --> 01:41:51.700]   Okay.
[01:41:51.700 --> 01:41:57.500]   So I'm going to I'm going to break down and probably do a pretty long series about some
[01:41:57.500 --> 01:42:01.060]   stuff of my setup because it's really come a long way over the years.
[01:42:01.060 --> 01:42:02.300]   I know what you're going to.
[01:42:02.300 --> 01:42:03.300]   I know what you're going to go.
[01:42:03.300 --> 01:42:05.300]   You sure you totally know what I'm going to.
[01:42:05.300 --> 01:42:06.300]   I know it's your.
[01:42:06.300 --> 01:42:07.300]   Giants.
[01:42:07.300 --> 01:42:08.300]   Yep.
[01:42:08.300 --> 01:42:09.300]   Okay.
[01:42:09.300 --> 01:42:11.900]   This is an app that's been around for probably five years now and it's been amazing all
[01:42:11.900 --> 01:42:12.900]   along.
[01:42:12.900 --> 01:42:13.900]   It's an app called Notational Velocity.
[01:42:13.900 --> 01:42:15.500]   Oh, no, I didn't know what you're going to pick.
[01:42:15.500 --> 01:42:17.700]   I thought it was going to be you're going to pick quick.
[01:42:17.700 --> 01:42:19.540]   Oh my God.
[01:42:19.540 --> 01:42:20.540]   That's amazing too.
[01:42:20.540 --> 01:42:21.540]   Okay.
[01:42:21.540 --> 01:42:22.540]   Next week.
[01:42:22.540 --> 01:42:23.540]   Nobody do quick.
[01:42:23.540 --> 01:42:24.540]   Next week.
[01:42:24.540 --> 01:42:26.260]   I don't know notational velocity.
[01:42:26.260 --> 01:42:27.260]   What's that?
[01:42:27.260 --> 01:42:28.260]   What?
[01:42:28.260 --> 01:42:29.260]   That's crazy talk.
[01:42:29.260 --> 01:42:30.260]   Really?
[01:42:30.260 --> 01:42:31.260]   What?
[01:42:31.260 --> 01:42:32.260]   No, I never heard of it.
[01:42:32.260 --> 01:42:33.260]   What is it?
[01:42:33.260 --> 01:42:34.260]   What does it do?
[01:42:34.260 --> 01:42:35.260]   All right.
[01:42:35.260 --> 01:42:38.820]   Official velocity is a note taking note searching app that is a no mouse keyboard only incremental
[01:42:38.820 --> 01:42:41.220]   search based note app.
[01:42:41.220 --> 01:42:44.140]   Very hard hard to explain until you see it being used.
[01:42:44.140 --> 01:42:49.220]   But if you can imagine it's basically you've got an area where you type to find things.
[01:42:49.220 --> 01:42:52.980]   If it doesn't find the match that you wanted, you hit enter and it creates a new document
[01:42:52.980 --> 01:42:54.860]   based on whatever you just typed.
[01:42:54.860 --> 01:43:01.300]   So if you're like me, so imagine you've got several thousand text files in one directory.
[01:43:01.300 --> 01:43:06.020]   Now you can incrementally search the contents of that entire thing using notational velocity.
[01:43:06.020 --> 01:43:11.180]   So you can choose to either point it at one secure encrypted database or you could point
[01:43:11.180 --> 01:43:12.780]   it at a folder full of text files.
[01:43:12.780 --> 01:43:14.420]   Which is what I've heard.
[01:43:14.420 --> 01:43:15.420]   This is giant.
[01:43:15.420 --> 01:43:18.460]   As far as quick note taking, it is supported by services.
[01:43:18.460 --> 01:43:21.260]   So it's really easy to get to it from anywhere.
[01:43:21.260 --> 01:43:25.580]   If you're a nerd and you like text files, have a look at this because it's a fantastic
[01:43:25.580 --> 01:43:26.580]   way to take notes.
[01:43:26.580 --> 01:43:30.060]   Now up until now, for five years or however long it's been around, I think it kind of
[01:43:30.060 --> 01:43:31.340]   languished for a while.
[01:43:31.340 --> 01:43:32.340]   It's totally open source.
[01:43:32.340 --> 01:43:36.820]   It did languish for a while, but it has come back strong.
[01:43:36.820 --> 01:43:40.860]   The latest revision, they've polished the interface a little bit, added a nice couple
[01:43:40.860 --> 01:43:45.940]   little features, but it added one thing that has changed my game.
[01:43:45.940 --> 01:43:50.780]   And that is it now syncs programmatically through the API with simple note.
[01:43:50.780 --> 01:43:57.860]   Which means that simple note, which is a web service, web application, simple text, simple
[01:43:57.860 --> 01:43:58.860]   note.
[01:43:58.860 --> 01:43:59.860]   Oh, okay.
[01:43:59.860 --> 01:44:04.860]   Which basically is a simple note app I want to say.
[01:44:04.860 --> 01:44:08.900]   And basically everybody's, everybody that's used this in the quest to find a good iPhone
[01:44:08.900 --> 01:44:11.500]   app, pretty much everybody ends up with simple note.
[01:44:11.500 --> 01:44:14.060]   It's simplenoteapp.com.
[01:44:14.060 --> 01:44:15.060]   And it's free.
[01:44:15.060 --> 01:44:16.060]   I have the pay app.
[01:44:16.060 --> 01:44:17.820]   I have the pay version because you get more cool stuff.
[01:44:17.820 --> 01:44:20.620]   But basically, I'm trying to explain.
[01:44:20.620 --> 01:44:23.620]   So you're saying it syncs with your iPhone.
[01:44:23.620 --> 01:44:27.700]   It syncs with your iPhone and the cloud through the simple note service.
[01:44:27.700 --> 01:44:31.300]   So simple note is a service and an iPhone app.
[01:44:31.300 --> 01:44:35.800]   And if you're like me and you're running Dropbox, I mean it also seamlessly is securely
[01:44:35.800 --> 01:44:42.640]   backed up with incremental changes, all our Wikipedia in the cloud and everywhere.
[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:45.000]   And it's just about, it's crazy fast.
[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.280]   You can have it basically update every minute.
[01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:49.680]   So every time you make a change, oh, it's totally, what's the word?
[01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:50.680]   Nonmodal.
[01:44:50.680 --> 01:44:51.680]   I always get this wrong.
[01:44:51.680 --> 01:44:54.360]   But you type, you do stuff and that's all there is.
[01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:55.680]   There's no mouse.
[01:44:55.680 --> 01:44:57.480]   It just as soon as you're typing it remembers it.
[01:44:57.480 --> 01:44:58.480]   It's recorded.
[01:44:58.480 --> 01:44:59.480]   It's brilliant.
[01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:01.280]   You can still use any text application you want.
[01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:04.600]   You can use task paper, task mate, BB edit, any of those.
[01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:06.640]   It works perfectly with any text app.
[01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:09.640]   I really encourage you to look at notational velocity.
[01:45:09.640 --> 01:45:14.840]   And I really encourage you to look at simple note because it's to have all of your stuff
[01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:19.640]   everywhere with you updated in real time is mind blowing.
[01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:21.560]   It's totally friction free.
[01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:26.040]   So yeah, so so notational velocity, I think it's velocity.net.
[01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:27.680]   Simple note is simple note app.com.
[01:45:27.680 --> 01:45:32.520]   I have tons more to say about this that I'll be talking about on 43 folders in a series.
[01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:34.120]   But I think you're going to like it a lot.
[01:45:34.120 --> 01:45:36.040]   I'm very interested in that article.
[01:45:36.040 --> 01:45:40.760]   As always, I love reading those articles about how you do what you do.
[01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:41.760]   And this is almost downloading right now.
[01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:43.600]   Well, I did a post yesterday.
[01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:47.640]   Finally, after like five years of not posting there, I started posting on the site again.
[01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:50.280]   There's a little thing yesterday on 43 folders where I talk a little bit about it.
[01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:55.800]   And you can see screenshots of what my iPhone looks like in simple notes and ditto.
[01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:57.040]   You can see what the app looks like.
[01:45:57.040 --> 01:46:01.600]   But really put your hands on it because if you're a fast typist and you can really type
[01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:02.640]   over 100 words a minute.
[01:46:02.640 --> 01:46:03.640]   Is that true?
[01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:04.640]   Absolutely.
[01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:05.640]   Wow.
[01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:07.280]   That's completely fine.
[01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:09.080]   When I don't have it.
[01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:13.040]   And so you can keep up with how fast you talk.
[01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:14.040]   Right?
[01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:15.040]   Yes.
[01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:19.760]   If I made absolutely zero typos, I could I can on a good day when I'm properly properly
[01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:24.160]   caffeinated, I can transcribe when people who are not talking really fast talk.
[01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:25.160]   Wow.
[01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:26.160]   It's most it's most that fast.
[01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:27.520]   I already know what I'm going to be writing.
[01:46:27.520 --> 01:46:31.000]   It's mostly the mostly the the factor of well, okay.
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:32.840]   I know there should be an ad for here.
[01:46:32.840 --> 01:46:38.040]   Somewhere out there, there's a little old lady teacher who taught you how to do that, right?
[01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:41.240]   No, I think the designers of the Apple two plus keyboard.
[01:46:41.240 --> 01:46:42.240]   Really?
[01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:43.240]   You didn't take typing class?
[01:46:43.240 --> 01:46:45.240]   I think no, I didn't take typing.
[01:46:45.240 --> 01:46:46.960]   It was just simple memorization.
[01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:53.680]   Also, but my friend, a friend of mine in junior high or Goldstein, I was coding something
[01:46:53.680 --> 01:46:54.680]   at his house.
[01:46:54.680 --> 01:46:55.760]   I saw how fast he typed.
[01:46:55.760 --> 01:46:58.800]   I thought, okay, so it is possible to be as fast as possible.
[01:46:58.800 --> 01:46:59.960]   Don't look at the keyboard.
[01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:01.960]   Just try to trust that the letter is going to fall.
[01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:06.280]   She didn't know that Eric Goldstein was typing gibberish the whole time.
[01:47:06.280 --> 01:47:11.920]   Well, he's well, if he was typing gibberish, it was causing the machine to do lots of
[01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:13.520]   interesting and cool things.
[01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:14.520]   Okay.
[01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:16.920]   Can I still have curiosity?
[01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:20.320]   Have you guys have you guys used any of these sinky kind of services?
[01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:23.880]   I think it's all started when the notes app sucked so bad on the iPhone and wouldn't
[01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:24.880]   sink.
[01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:25.880]   I'm just curious.
[01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:26.880]   You guys.
[01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:27.880]   I never know.
[01:47:27.880 --> 01:47:28.880]   I use ever know nonstop.
[01:47:28.880 --> 01:47:29.880]   It's a great app.
[01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:30.880]   It's a great.
[01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:33.960]   Actually, the only thing that would slow me down and moving to something like simple note,
[01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:36.800]   well, first of all, I'm using Nexus 1, which would really slow me down.
[01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:38.920]   Evernote is available on all my platforms.
[01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:39.920]   I do like that.
[01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:42.160]   Well, you know, it might not have an API though.
[01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:43.920]   There's a dashboard app.
[01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:46.640]   There's API so you can have an app on anywhere that we need to have.
[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:47.960]   Notational velocity is open source.
[01:47:47.960 --> 01:47:48.960]   It might be possible.
[01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:49.960]   I have to look into it.
[01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:53.040]   It would be great if it would sink with Evernote.
[01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:54.040]   Then I would use it.
[01:47:54.040 --> 01:47:55.040]   Probably with Evernote.
[01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:57.760]   I love Evernote, but the reason I stopped using it was that if you're on the road and
[01:47:57.760 --> 01:48:01.960]   you're not on, even if you're on a live connection, you're basically appending to an RTF.
[01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:04.200]   You're not actually changing a text file.
[01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:06.560]   And that kind of doesn't scale for the way that I will.
[01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:08.080]   You want plain text.
[01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:09.080]   Yeah.
[01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:10.840]   I mean, I've turned off formatting.
[01:48:10.840 --> 01:48:17.360]   But with that said, notational velocity, for example, it could identify simple note
[01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:18.560]   and notational velocity.
[01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:20.560]   Can identify URLs and make them clickable.
[01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:22.680]   You know, it's got some nice polish.
[01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:25.480]   But like, Chris, what do you use for this kind of nonsense?
[01:48:25.480 --> 01:48:29.080]   So what do you use for your like piles of information?
[01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:32.440]   I use Evernote every so often.
[01:48:32.440 --> 01:48:36.840]   But I also have the advantage that I never, ever leave my house.
[01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:39.920]   So I can write things on the walls.
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:44.600]   I can write them on little scraps of paper and leave them in piles somewhere where I lose
[01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:45.600]   them.
[01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:51.040]   My greatest disappointment in life was that the spray paint that supposedly turns walls
[01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:53.600]   into whiteboards doesn't work so well.
[01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:55.800]   I was just going to paint everything.
[01:48:55.800 --> 01:48:56.800]   It's a breathful joke.
[01:48:56.800 --> 01:48:57.800]   Yeah.
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:48:59.760]   And make it all a whiteboard and just have markers everywhere.
[01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:03.000]   And you just any time you had a thought, you just write it on the wall.
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:04.000]   Doesn't work.
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:05.000]   You still do that.
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:06.000]   Yeah, you can.
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:07.400]   My boards are expensive, man.
[01:49:07.400 --> 01:49:08.840]   I was going to buy a giant ass whiteboard.
[01:49:08.840 --> 01:49:10.040]   It was like 600 bucks.
[01:49:10.040 --> 01:49:11.040]   Wow.
[01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:12.040]   Really expensive.
[01:49:12.040 --> 01:49:13.040]   This painting is really a good idea.
[01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:14.920]   You know, Rustoleum makes it.
[01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:18.800]   But then I read all the reviews and says, no, you kind of do 80 coats before it's any
[01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:19.800]   good.
[01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:21.400]   The walls got to be totally flat for it to work.
[01:49:21.400 --> 01:49:22.400]   Yeah.
[01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:25.000]   I mean, I think it's a lot of different issues that go on with it.
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:29.000]   But anyway, my pick is something I picked before, but it's back.
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:32.280]   Shosh watt and Che Tan are back, baby.
[01:49:32.280 --> 01:49:34.400]   And it's like they never left.
[01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:35.920]   I recommended an application.
[01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:39.520]   I think actually, maybe I didn't even get to recommend it on Mac break weekly because
[01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:44.000]   I recommended it on Twitter and we immediately crashed their servers and put them out of
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:45.000]   business.
[01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:49.480]   Well, they went out and they got, they raised some money from mom and dad.
[01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:51.120]   They got, they did a great job.
[01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:52.120]   They put it back.
[01:49:52.120 --> 01:49:55.200]   They're talking about an application called Pollux.
[01:49:55.200 --> 01:49:58.840]   Now Pollux is a really cool windows and Mac.
[01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:00.040]   They're charging for it now.
[01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:02.400]   The problem is they were doing it for free and they used up.
[01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:03.400]   So many people started using it.
[01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:06.560]   They used up their free licenses to CDDB.
[01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:10.720]   So they're charging a mere 10 bucks a year now for this.
[01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:12.640]   Let me tell you folks, highly recommended.
[01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:16.560]   If you've got iTunes, Windows again, Windows or Mac, well, there's my account information
[01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:19.080]   again in case anybody wants to get it.
[01:50:19.080 --> 01:50:20.080]   Damn.
[01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:24.720]   Now, we're only going to be showing that once more before they have the podcast.
[01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:26.880]   So make sure you write it down next time.
[01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:30.360]   So let's say you've, you've, you've, you've imported an album and it doesn't have album
[01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:31.360]   art.
[01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:32.360]   What's great Pollux?
[01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:33.720]   It kind of sits in the menu bar.
[01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:36.160]   You say tag selected iTunes tracks.
[01:50:36.160 --> 01:50:41.640]   It goes out, goes to CDDB, gets the album art, adds name, artist, album, your genre, even
[01:50:41.640 --> 01:50:44.560]   lyrics to your iTunes.
[01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:49.960]   It is just the greatest way to kind of completely clean up your iTunes library.
[01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:51.360]   It does such a good job.
[01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:52.760]   You can try it for free.
[01:50:52.760 --> 01:50:54.880]   But now they've, and I think they had to do this.
[01:50:54.880 --> 01:50:58.280]   They've started charging a mere 10 bucks a month to pay their license.
[01:50:58.280 --> 01:50:59.280]   And a year.
[01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:00.280]   A year.
[01:51:00.280 --> 01:51:01.280]   I'm sorry.
[01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:02.280]   Yeah.
[01:51:02.280 --> 01:51:04.880]   They're licensed with the CDDB and these guys are two, they're two college kids.
[01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:07.720]   One's a student at University of Berkeley, California.
[01:51:07.720 --> 01:51:08.720]   University of California, Berkeley.
[01:51:08.720 --> 01:51:12.240]   I think one's at UC Davis or UCSC.
[01:51:12.240 --> 01:51:13.240]   No one's at Stanford.
[01:51:13.240 --> 01:51:14.240]   Anyway.
[01:51:14.240 --> 01:51:15.440]   I'm a college kid who wrote this.
[01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:17.400]   And it's just a, it's a neat story.
[01:51:17.400 --> 01:51:20.360]   And I'm really glad they raised money.
[01:51:20.360 --> 01:51:21.360]   Here it is.
[01:51:21.360 --> 01:51:25.440]   Chetan Surpur is a second year undergrad at UC Berkeley.
[01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:29.560]   Shosh Wat is a second year undergrad at Santa Cruz.
[01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:34.320]   And they've got a third developer who's at the Monopoly Institute of Technology in India,
[01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:36.280]   the very famous MIT.
[01:51:36.280 --> 01:51:38.360]   And he's writing the Windows version of this.
[01:51:38.360 --> 01:51:40.320]   And I just, it's just really great.
[01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:47.520]   You, P-O-L-L-U-X, P-O-L-L-U-X, as in Castor and Pollux app.com.
[01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:48.920]   Try it free.
[01:51:48.920 --> 01:51:51.040]   But I found it a really great way to clean up your iTunes.
[01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:52.040]   It's always been a problem.
[01:51:52.040 --> 01:51:54.360]   The tagging and so forth and the album art.
[01:51:54.360 --> 01:51:55.360]   It just cleans it all up.
[01:51:55.360 --> 01:51:56.760]   It does a great job.
[01:51:56.760 --> 01:51:59.320]   And I'm just glad they're back because I felt so bad.
[01:51:59.320 --> 01:52:00.960]   So guilty that I killed them.
[01:52:00.960 --> 01:52:06.160]   And what do you think that iTunes doesn't download album art on its own through, when
[01:52:06.160 --> 01:52:07.160]   you were reading it?
[01:52:07.160 --> 01:52:08.160]   You think it was.
[01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:10.360]   It was a very 1993 limitation.
[01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:11.360]   Yeah.
[01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:17.360]   And they also don't store in the MP3.
[01:52:17.360 --> 01:52:21.240]   They store it in an XML file that's called by iTunes.
[01:52:21.240 --> 01:52:26.880]   But if you move the files around, if you didn't buy them on the iTunes store, and you move
[01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:28.760]   the files around, you lose the album art.
[01:52:28.760 --> 01:52:32.000]   It's just a weird system that iTunes has decided on.
[01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:33.000]   So this is just really nice.
[01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:36.760]   I think it's a real good solution.
[01:52:36.760 --> 01:52:39.200]   There you go.
[01:52:39.200 --> 01:52:40.200]   That's our picks of the week.
[01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:41.760]   Some really good ones.
[01:52:41.760 --> 01:52:46.480]   As usual, I'm off to download the Rippet program, which I didn't know about.
[01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:48.640]   And this notational anarchy thing.
[01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:53.440]   Today was definitely one of those days where I regret that I just come back from obviously
[01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:55.120]   a big conference.
[01:52:55.120 --> 01:52:58.840]   So the first thing I do before I leave the house is turn off all of the sharing features
[01:52:58.840 --> 01:53:00.080]   of my MacBook.
[01:53:00.080 --> 01:53:04.960]   And so I figure switching saying I need to pack my Mac upstairs to my MacBook so I can
[01:53:04.960 --> 01:53:09.400]   start downloading stuff so I'll be there when I go back upstairs and get my Mac.
[01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:13.680]   So you see me not looking at the camera, not paying attention, because I'm typing in
[01:53:13.680 --> 01:53:17.000]   your else for Alex and delicious stuff.
[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:22.680]   And I already use CSS edit, but it is such a sweet program.
[01:53:22.680 --> 01:53:24.080]   So some really great picks this week.
[01:53:24.080 --> 01:53:25.680]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:53:25.680 --> 01:53:30.280]   Both Chris and Merlin are going to become regulars once again on Mac Break Weekly.
[01:53:30.280 --> 01:53:32.000]   Actually it's ironic because you guys have swapped.
[01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:36.680]   Now Chris has great bandwidth and Merlin seems to be, you've got some sort of red flag over
[01:53:36.680 --> 01:53:38.600]   your head, which I think indicates that you...
[01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:39.600]   I'll fix it.
[01:53:39.600 --> 01:53:40.600]   I don't know what that is.
[01:53:40.600 --> 01:53:41.600]   Maybe I'm using the...
[01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:43.840]   I look like I'm in the witness protection.
[01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:46.000]   Talk about real player.
[01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:47.640]   This is straight out of 1980.
[01:53:47.640 --> 01:53:50.240]   Meanwhile Chris looks like he's in studio with us.
[01:53:50.240 --> 01:53:54.160]   Well now that I've got this brand with, Merlin, I've got, you know, there's space in the garage
[01:53:54.160 --> 01:53:55.160]   and well moving.
[01:53:55.160 --> 01:53:57.440]   I'm all just moving.
[01:53:57.440 --> 01:53:59.160]   The surfs up, it's great.
[01:53:59.160 --> 01:54:00.160]   Yeah, baby.
[01:54:00.160 --> 01:54:01.160]   Yeah, baby.
[01:54:01.160 --> 01:54:02.160]   I'm there.
[01:54:02.160 --> 01:54:06.000]   Merlin Man is at 43folders.com and that's where you'll put that article about how you
[01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:07.000]   do it.
[01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:08.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.840]   The notation of loss, anything a little shorty's up.
[01:54:10.840 --> 01:54:11.840]   Yeah, let's press something.
[01:54:11.840 --> 01:54:12.840]   I'll do the next couple of weeks.
[01:54:12.840 --> 01:54:13.840]   Boy, I do look bad.
[01:54:13.840 --> 01:54:14.840]   Sorry about that.
[01:54:14.840 --> 01:54:15.840]   I'm fine.
[01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:16.840]   Yeah.
[01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:18.080]   Thanks for having me back Lee.
[01:54:18.080 --> 01:54:19.080]   That's nice to be there.
[01:54:19.080 --> 01:54:20.080]   Oh, we love you Merlin.
[01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:21.080]   It's so great to have you on.
[01:54:21.080 --> 01:54:25.320]   Merlin's going to be on whatever we can every other week at least hope depending on travel
[01:54:25.320 --> 01:54:26.320]   and so forth.
[01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:29.480]   Andy Inaco is of course a regular on Mac Break Weekly.
[01:54:29.480 --> 01:54:32.960]   He's our friend, our pal and our star and he's going to be out at Mac World.
[01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:36.600]   So we'll look forward to seeing a lot of you on Mac Break the Video.
[01:54:36.600 --> 01:54:38.400]   That'll be fun.
[01:54:38.400 --> 01:54:42.680]   Yes, I've already, I've been hearing from a lot of people who now that the streams and
[01:54:42.680 --> 01:54:47.200]   the video is being placed in other places, I'm getting some flack from people saying,
[01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:49.400]   "Why don't you wear a nice shirt?"
[01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:50.400]   No, we love.
[01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:51.400]   How do you look?
[01:54:51.400 --> 01:54:52.400]   It's both in the office.
[01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:54.160]   It's New England and it's winter time.
[01:54:54.160 --> 01:54:57.560]   We saw the sideburns in the Economist this week.
[01:54:57.560 --> 01:54:58.560]   Oh, God.
[01:54:58.560 --> 01:54:59.560]   Yes.
[01:54:59.560 --> 01:55:09.200]   So what people don't see, that's the first time my technology trance has been documented
[01:55:09.200 --> 01:55:13.440]   because I've literally been holding this thing in my hand for exactly 10 seconds.
[01:55:13.440 --> 01:55:18.240]   So I'm in full-spread spectrum, high-intensity data capture mode.
[01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:22.000]   I'm trying to make through a mentalist of all the things I want to check out, all the things
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:23.200]   I want to take notice of.
[01:55:23.200 --> 01:55:27.880]   So I just have this look of concentration that looks like to a third party.
[01:55:27.880 --> 01:55:29.880]   Oh, this is, I don't like this much at all.
[01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:30.880]   There is a camera.
[01:55:30.880 --> 01:55:31.880]   I don't see.
[01:55:31.880 --> 01:55:33.920]   Oh, and I bet the suburbs doesn't have flash.
[01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:34.920]   So.
[01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:38.920]   But it's nice to be hearing from so many people, friends that say, "Hey, dude, you're the
[01:55:38.920 --> 01:55:39.920]   Economist."
[01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:40.920]   Is it in the...
[01:55:40.920 --> 01:55:45.080]   I remember, as a little kid, you know, looking at the center folds of the Economist saying,
[01:55:45.080 --> 01:55:46.080]   "You know what?
[01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:47.080]   Maybe just like J.D.
[01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:50.680]   Salinger, I'll be interviewed by the Economist someday and I'll be in that magazine."
[01:55:50.680 --> 01:55:51.680]   There he is.
[01:55:51.680 --> 01:55:52.880]   Little boys' dreams just came true.
[01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:53.880]   There he is.
[01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:55.880]   I don't know exactly what that face is, but...
[01:55:55.880 --> 01:55:58.200]   At least again, at least.
[01:55:58.200 --> 01:56:02.200]   See, I had to go to the airport twice to get onto this flight and the second time I said,
[01:56:02.200 --> 01:56:03.200]   "You know what?
[01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:04.200]   I think I will take the suit jacket.
[01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:05.200]   I won't just unpack it."
[01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:07.320]   At least you were wearing a jacket.
[01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:08.320]   At least see exactly.
[01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:10.880]   My mom would say, "At least you're wearing a nice jacket."
[01:56:10.880 --> 01:56:12.200]   They didn't say who you were.
[01:56:12.200 --> 01:56:18.160]   They just have a picture and then they've captioned it very nice, but where's the off switch?
[01:56:18.160 --> 01:56:19.160]   Which is not what you're thinking.
[01:56:19.160 --> 01:56:20.360]   It's kind of a Christopher Lee look.
[01:56:20.360 --> 01:56:21.360]   I'm thinking kind of that.
[01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:22.360]   And that's from below.
[01:56:22.360 --> 01:56:24.960]   So, sore on nose.
[01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:32.280]   I've witnessed the full power, this fully armed and operational abolition to it.
[01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:36.200]   Chris Breen is the MacDaddy at Macworld.com.
[01:56:36.200 --> 01:56:39.560]   As the online site of course, Macworld Magazine is on newsstands everywhere.
[01:56:39.560 --> 01:56:43.640]   You can read his 911 column and there and of course, all those other coverage.
[01:56:43.640 --> 01:56:44.640]   Senior Editor at Macworld.
[01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:46.480]   Great to have you, Chris.
[01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:47.480]   And thanks for having me back.
[01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:48.480]   I really enjoyed it.
[01:56:48.480 --> 01:56:49.480]   He loved you.
[01:56:49.480 --> 01:56:50.480]   Great.
[01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:51.480]   Thank you for being here.
[01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:52.480]   You bet.
[01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:53.480]   All right.
[01:56:53.480 --> 01:56:54.800]   Another Mac break is broke.
