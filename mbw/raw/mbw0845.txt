[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   It's time for Mac Break, Weekly Andy Inako, Alex Lindsey, Jason Snell. They're all in-house.
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.680]   We'll talk more about Apple privacy. Turns out they are sending a unique identifier back to the
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.000]   home office. We'll also talk about the Chinese government. They're bringing in
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   former military to help work in Apple's factories in China and putting Quake on an Apple Watch.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.600]   That and a whole lot more coming up next.
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.920]   Podcasts you love. From people you trust. This is Quake.
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:42.560]   This is Mac Break Weekly, Episode 845, recorded Tuesday, November 22, 2022.

[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.480]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the latest Apple News.
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:51.920]   Hello, hello. You look like George freakin' Hamilton. Have you been tanning?
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.760]   What are you doing, dude? What are you doing?
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:04.640]   I think you put me next to... It's just good lighting. Yeah, it's just lighting. It looks so good.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.000]   The shot looks so good. If Room Raider were looking at this show, which you'd get 10 out of
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.360]   11 out of 10, you'd just... I'm still kind of middle of the road for my office hours.
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.680]   Yeah, I know that's funny. Keep it up with the Jones Institute.
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.720]   Keep it up. Well, I can't keep up with you, so we're just going to live with it. By the way,
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.280]   Andy, you look pretty good too. Andy Inako is also here in his little tiny,
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:38.080]   Tatami-lined room. Exactly. I love how we all learn so much from Alex. Every time he talks about
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.880]   new adjustments he's made to his setup, he just mentioned during the pre-show Maker Pipe,
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.120]   which is not... Wow, because I wanted to have a lighting grid. We are maybe
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.760]   Jason too. We are the Alpha and Omega, where we absolutely care about being looking
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:01.280]   half as good as Leo, and if we can be a quarter as good looking as Alex, we don't have that kind
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.440]   of a budget or infrastructure, but it's like, "Hey, look, On eBay, I can buy these Japanese screens,
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.600]   and hey, look, I can buy diffusion shrouds for the $100 LED lights I got from Amazon."
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:24.240]   This is ecumenical. All poor people like me are absolutely welcome here in the podcasting
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:30.320]   little world. It's funny how it's over the years how much it's changed. First, we're just glad to
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.720]   have anything, a picture, anything. Patrick Norton used to do the show under his car.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.400]   Literally, he'd be working on his car, and he'd have a light, and he'd... I don't know,
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:49.280]   and you can hear the wrench clanging. I think a lot to Alex, thanks a lot to Alex. We've kind of
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.520]   upgraded a little bit anyway. Also with us, Jason Snell from the Snellavision factory.
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.000]   Hello, Jason. Yeah, so that's right. This is my garage where I work all day, every day,
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.560]   making things for the internet. Renee Ritchie told me to buy a couple of lights, and I have a
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.160]   couple of lights. That's all. That's for Renee. Yeah, that's all. And then a lava lamp, and I put
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.960]   some old computers behind me. That's it. That's the best I can do.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:20.480]   I'm trying to catch up with Jason, though. I got the cube here, and then I've got my old one.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.360]   I like when... Oh, look, yeah, it's a classic. I got my classic air.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.920]   That's right, Alex. You just dreamed to have my backdrop, don't you?
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.680]   I want to have more... Well, I think I'm trying not to get all the computers that I had in the past,
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.840]   but I am trying to collect the whole... And so, an 840AV is something I'm looking for,
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.840]   because that was like... I think it's kind of fun to... Because it's a little bit blurred in the
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:48.400]   background, because you have an actual camera with depth of field. But I think I spot a $30,000
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.200]   camera behind you. Is that the only couple of... That was a $60,000 camera.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:59.760]   $60,000 camera. So, the first one was $60,000. The second two were $30,000 each, and the last
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:06.880]   three were $75,000 each. And then 14 months later, the one's a prop. It's a prop. It's a prop.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.720]   The history of technology, isn't it? Oh my god.
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.000]   Yeah, so I know. It was very expensive when I bought it.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.880]   When that one... But that one, it was expensive, but it's not expensive anymore.
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.160]   It's an adventure. It's an adventure. It's an adventure.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.640]   Is it with a dongle? Does that count? I mean, look at that.
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.080]   Man, it's history, baby. It's like a dongle.
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.520]   Nine dollar dongle right there.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.040]   Wow. Nine dollars.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.480]   Wow. Amazing.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.200]   What a deal.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.240]   We are in a field where stuff gets obsolete so fast.
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:36.000]   Like I said, I'm doing the whole house clean-up, and I've tried to do every five years,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.480]   like literally, let's get down to the baseboards.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.080]   Let's put my hands on every single thing I own, decide whether it can stay or go.
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:49.120]   And it's like, I'm learning that there's a narrow window of opportunity between,
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.880]   okay, this is obsolete, this is junk, I'm throwing it away.
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.760]   But the clock is ticking, because if you don't get rid of it within like three and a half to
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:04.240]   four years, damn it. Now it's a collectible. Now there's somebody who give me like $63 for it,
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.760]   and I've got enough of these that I could like buy a new iPhone just by damn it.
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:13.040]   So this is why I have a box. I have a big box like in my closet that is simply labeled
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:18.160]   iPhone and iPad boxes because the damn things are now, it's a box full of air,
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:23.920]   but I could conceivably trade it in a toto for like an iPhone 14 Pro.
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.040]   I'm like, damn it.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.040]   Every, missed my mark as a box of wires somewhere.
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.040]   Just like power adapters.
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:39.840]   Yeah, the worst is a box. I have a box of wallworks that I painfully didn't put label on each one of
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.960]   them. So right. So you have no idea what they do. I have that box as well.
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:43.440]   No, I know.
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:43.440]   I know.
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:43.920]   I know.
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:48.320]   All I do now is label because I'm too old to read them anymore. So I have to get it.
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.840]   I have to get my phone magnified.
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:50.080]   Yes.
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:55.360]   And then I'm going to really big 18 volts, 3.3 amps on the side of this.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.040]   So if I'm looking for something, I can try to find it.
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:01.440]   Seriously, get yourself a white paint marker. I'll make that one of my picks of the week
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.320]   to show you. It is the handiest thing because a label like there's a label maker, they're great,
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.240]   but it takes steps to like, okay, I got lots of software, get, watch the phone app and
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.760]   blow it in and stick it out and put it in.
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.200]   We're asked with a paint marker. You just put 12 volts, 5 amps done.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.080]   And it's like white on black and it solves the problem immediately.
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:24.080]   I think in the early days, did we not have a contest to win Patrick Norton's box of crap?
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.600]   I believe.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.640]   I believe he did.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.000]   He wrote the whole wallboards.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:36.640]   And it was mostly a wall warts and yeah, it was episode 9 from 2005 of this week at Tech.
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.520]   Win Patrick's box of crap.
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:46.240]   Can I say how happy I am that these days, almost every piece of junk that I get just
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.280]   charges with USB?
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.720]   Oh my god, yes.
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.600]   Thank you.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.200]   Should we thank the EU for that?
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:56.080]   I don't know, but like, I know there's some controversy about it, but like the fact that
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.280]   instead of having like all these different connectors and all these different voltages,
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:04.640]   namps, the ubiquity of USB has just driven down the price to the point that all the manufacturers
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.000]   are cheap crap are just like, what's the cheapest we can do?
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:08.720]   USB?
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.520]   Let's do it.
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:14.320]   And so we don't have to do like, I'm just so relieved when I get some piece of cheap tech
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.400]   garbage that I bought for some reason.
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.720]   And it's just got a USB C or a micro.
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.560]   I'll take micro or mini USB.
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.280]   I don't care.
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.960]   As long as I don't have to have another wall wart that is only for this one thing.
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:30.480]   Yeah, just two or three days ago, I finally found the custom charger that goes with my,
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:37.920]   I think it's a, like a 1990s Casio camera watch that's like, that's too cool, like not
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:43.920]   to, not to, not to keep, but it's like, I want to put fire to the wire and actually fire it up and
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:48.720]   check out one of these like 48 pixel by 60 pixel selfies that this thing could take.
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:55.040]   We, by the way, somebody's saying in the chatroom that the winner never got the box.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.640]   And I think the winner was happy.
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.280]   Frank, there you go.
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.160]   That's how they want.
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:58.960]   They want it.
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.800]   That was second place.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:01.840]   Got the box.
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:02.640]   I do have.
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:07.120]   I was going to save this for the end of the show, but why not lead with the worst story.
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.440]   Remember this whole keyboard saga?
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.120]   I bought the DOS keyboard.
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.720]   It had a type C connector.
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.040]   It wouldn't work on my Mac studio.
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.120]   It wouldn't work on my MacBook Pro.
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.280]   It worked on a Linux box for some reason.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.480]   So here's the final end of the story.
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:30.240]   I put a type C to A adapter on it plugged into the type A connector in the Mac studio and it works.
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.280]   Why would that be?
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:36.160]   Well, God bless standards.
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.760]   There's lots of different kinds of USB-C.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:41.760]   So the, one of my favorite bargain high-cast microphones, the ATR
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:47.360]   9,900, whatever from Audio Technica.
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.560]   It's a good little microphone.
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:49.440]   Does it XLR?
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:55.440]   Does USB and they have a new version that is USB-C, but it's this super weird version of USB-C
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.560]   that it comes with a cable.
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:03.280]   But Ben Thompson from Stratecary, he went on a trip with it and didn't bring his cable
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.600]   and went down and just bought another USB-C cable.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:10.800]   And it didn't work because it was this super esoteric like two-way
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.760]   It was a standard.
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:14.880]   It was a standard.
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:19.280]   But like we all just think USB-C, USB-C is fine and it's a lie.
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.320]   It's a lie people.
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.360]   Wake up everybody.
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:27.520]   It's, again, you have to explain to people that their USB-C is the shape and mold of the thing
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.040]   that will actually physically plug in.
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:29.360]   Yeah.
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.880]   Then there's like, okay, but what is that?
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.480]   What is flowing through that pipe?
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.440]   It might be limited.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:33.840]   Trusting nothing.
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.600]   It might be the opposite of lemonade.
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.240]   Unbelievable.
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.760]   Anyway, that's kind of my tail of whoa.
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:42.800]   I thought I passed that along.
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.560]   Now Apple has a little tail of whoa.
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.840]   This is actually kind of a, I don't know, it's a developing story.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.040]   It's a significant story.
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:56.960]   This is MISC, again, the research team talking about device analytics.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:03.200]   And now the latest is that Apple is sending your iCloud ID
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:14.160]   to iOS developers as well as itself, which does in fact link you to this so-called anonymized
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.840]   information.
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:21.360]   Even if you turn off device analytics, Apple, according to MISC, Apple sends your DSID.
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:26.400]   We talked about this last week, but now it's kind of the plot thickens.
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:30.080]   I want to correct one thing here because this is the Verge article makes this seem like it's
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:36.000]   something that it's not.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:36.320]   Okay.
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:40.480]   The iOS developers referenced in the story's headline are MISC.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:45.760]   And it makes it look like all your data is actually being passed to third-party app developers.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:49.840]   And it sounds, it's a good article with a, I would say, a misleading headline because what
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:56.160]   it says is, if you actually read the details of Apple's privacy policy, you realize this is
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.200]   probably allowed, which is not great.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:04.480]   So MISC's apps were asking for it, in other words.
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:07.200]   It's not great that they-
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.400]   You agree to the description.
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.360]   All your stuff.
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:14.240]   And so it's not, it's that they found this, they're the developers who found this out,
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:17.600]   but it's not like every app developer gets this, but it is being transmitted to Apple.
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.760]   But then to the Verge's credit, they go through the privacy policy and they're like,
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.320]   it doesn't actually say it won't be transmitted.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.600]   It says it won't be used and it will be discarded.
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:33.040]   But then there are also these adjuncts that maybe some stuff could be used later.
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.240]   And it's like, it's all-
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:38.400]   That, I thought was the best thing about that Verge article is they're like,
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:42.160]   Apple has a very simple message about privacy, but when you look at the policy,
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.840]   you find that Apple can use your data in a lot of interesting ways.
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:50.160]   And, you know, that are not in violation of its policy.
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:54.160]   They just sound weird given what their public marketing stance is.
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:01.920]   So how does this, the same story we reported on last week?
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:07.600]   No, because now it's the iCloud ID, which potentially identifies you specifically, yes?
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:12.320]   Right, although if this is going back to Apple, Apple already knows who you are.
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.120]   Apple knows.
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:18.000]   And it doesn't seem like a developer would be able to tie your DSID to you.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.120]   Only Apple could do that.
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.240]   Or is that wrong?
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:24.160]   If the developer got that information.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.480]   Some developers must say it, right?
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.560]   No, I don't think this is just going to Apple.
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:29.680]   This is device analytics.
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.280]   Well, how can MISC get it then?
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:37.280]   MISC is, you remember using a jailbroken iPhone and looking at the data stream.
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:37.680]   That's right.
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:42.320]   But I think it's interesting that, you know, as they point out, you know,
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.960]   Apple's privacy documents is none of the collected information
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.080]   identifies you personally.
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.560]   Personal data is not logged at all.
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:54.240]   There are, it is what, subject to privacy preserving techniques such as differential privacy,
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.520]   or is removed from any reports before they're sent to Apple.
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:02.160]   But there's like, but they may correlate some usage data about Apple apps across devices that,
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.400]   like there's, it's complicated, right?
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:09.040]   And I think that there's a real question here based on what MISC is seeing about,
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:13.440]   like what is it, what is purposeful, what is, is any of this an accident?
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:17.520]   That was the theory I had last week, but like Apple's not talking about this at all.
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:18.640]   We still are nothing.
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:19.040]   Yeah.
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.240]   There's no clarity here.
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:26.640]   Which I, you know, I'm at this point a week after we first talked about this,
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:29.280]   and 10 days after this first came out or 14 days,
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:33.680]   I would say that Apple is in effect saying, yeah, we do that.
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:39.040]   I don't, I'm not going to make any conclusions.
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:43.600]   I think, I think if they, I'm going to say that if they don't address it by the end of the year,
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:47.600]   and I'm only saying end of the year because there are a lot of people who have already checked
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:53.040]   out at Apple, like in the, for the Thanksgiving holidays and who are probably going to be like
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:56.880]   soft working in month of December, they absolutely have to respond as if they don't,
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:00.800]   I will find that, I agree with you that we'll find, I will find it very, very suspicious because
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:06.560]   it's not as though there was a Reddit post that a couple of people talked about and got like 18
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:11.920]   comments. This is when the Verge is writing about this, you, it's, it's on everybody's radar and you
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.360]   have a responsibility to talk about it.
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:21.520]   Well, I guess all will become clear eventually.
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.920]   Be can hope.
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:29.920]   It's, I mean, it's not the end of the world app. As you say, Apple already knows it's you.
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:37.120]   It's also, I wonder if, if it's a calculation just about penetration, right, where it's basically
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:41.600]   like, nobody knows about this. It's a couple of obscure articles. It hasn't picked up steam.
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:45.600]   And if you're Apple PR, I wonder if you get to the point where you're like, if we talk about this,
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.000]   we make it a story. It's only worse. Yeah. Let's just talk.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.520]   Only that's kind of my feeling is like, yeah, in effect, what Apple said by saying nothing is,
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:58.080]   we can only make it worse. There's nothing we can say here that's going to make it better.
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:03.280]   In other words, it's not going to be, oh, that was a bug. We're going to fix it because they're not.
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:08.960]   Even if it isn't right, it's like, if nobody cares, why would you even say, well, we have to disclose,
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:13.920]   right? It's, it's just bad messaging for them. And if they feel like nobody's really heard,
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:18.160]   then they can just sweep it under the rug and forget about it. I'm not advocating for that position.
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:23.120]   I think that they should come out and say, look, yes, they found something. It's a mistake. We're
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:28.000]   correcting it. Here's the details. Let's walk away. But I could see how maybe somebody inside Apple
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.880]   would be like, why are we giving these people any oxygen at all? The story is not traveling beyond
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:38.080]   the verge and gizmodo. And we're not, we're not concerned about it.
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:43.040]   Yeah. I would see that. That's, that would, I would find more concerning than anything else.
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:49.040]   And if they decide that if, if the, if the who cares, nobody cares about this, even extends to
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:54.160]   people inside of Apple, that is absolutely contradictory to the messaging they've been saying about privacy
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:59.120]   all along that it's, I think that we, I think everybody accepts that there is a, there is an,
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:02.320]   there is an amount of tracking that we will never be completely aware of because we don't have that
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:07.280]   kind of technical facility. And we also don't have that kind of ability to peek into what's going
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:12.400]   into all of our phones, be it, I've been an iPhone, being an Android phone, be it whatever. However,
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:17.200]   it's a, it's a, it's a, you're, you're kind of shrug when you find out that I host this, I'm sorry,
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:21.520]   I'm not a bird. When you, when you buy like a piece of junk food and you find out, oh,
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:27.120]   isn't that chemical also used in like enamel car, car paint? And we're asked, we're asked when you
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:31.920]   buy it when you buy it, when you buy something from the other aisle says here at nature's Gaia,
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:38.480]   hug, hippie, wonderful nature, planet love, green foods, we believe in the bond from the farmer to
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:44.400]   the tables like, yeah, and you also have a known pesticide in the flavoring. Maybe,
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:49.200]   maybe you should discuss like why you, you, you, you're talking about being such a wonderful,
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:54.400]   healthy, natural product. And you have something that's banned in 11 countries, including Russia,
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:58.080]   of course, six, of course, the best size, don't bother us in the United States that much anyway.
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:02.800]   Right. So anyway, you're like, I feel like we're, you know, like, because the man has beaten us
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:09.040]   down. The man has taught us, trained us not to care anymore about something we should care about,
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:13.440]   man. But it is like, if you go to, if you go to a, you know, it's, you have a certain expectation
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:17.520]   at one store versus another and at Apple, we have a very high expectation because of what they do.
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:22.560]   And if we, if this was happening pretty much on any other platform, any other,
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:26.880]   at any other place, we'd be like, oh, yeah, of course. That's what, that's what happens. But
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:31.280]   because it's Apple, I think Apple does have to come up with some kind of explanation. I think that
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:36.160]   the reason they're probably taking more time is that they want to unwrap exactly what, what it is,
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:41.600]   why they do it. I think that they're just trying to jumping out and saying things quickly sometimes,
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:45.040]   you know, they might want to aim a couple of times, you know, like, or measure a couple of
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:49.360]   times before they say it to make sure that whatever they release is complete and they may be even
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:53.520]   trying to build a little bit of education around it. Like, this is what it is. If they're not going
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:57.600]   to just immediately turn it off, this is what it is. And this is why we're doing it. And this is why
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:01.520]   it doesn't hurt you. And this is why, you know, like, that's what they may be trying to build,
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:06.720]   especially over a holiday time period, which is going to be slower. So I would,
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:11.680]   I'm kind of just waiting to see what what we have to say. I won't bring it up again
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.800]   until January. How about that?
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:19.440]   Well, I mean, we got to give them a couple of weeks. Who press the snooze button on Leo,
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:27.520]   guys? Yes, snooze me until January 13th. Here we go. Okay, I'll give
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:31.360]   them a week. Yes. Yeah, get past 60 days.
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:38.000]   Yeah, remind me, but that's the most annoying feature. I read it, by the way.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.320]   Somebody opposed something. I read it. And then the next post is remind me in 60 days. It's like,
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:47.440]   can that be private somehow? How about how else are you going to find out whether or not they
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:52.400]   managed to open that safe that they found in the house they just bought? Remind me, not otherwise.
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:56.880]   Remind me. All right. Well, that's the big story. Thank you, everybody. I think we should go home
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:03.280]   now for Thanksgiving. Gobble gobble. Great. Andy, will you be doing your Suvi burrito for
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:08.800]   Thanksgiving again this year? No, no, no, I'm doing my Suvi Turkey, which is the,
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:13.920]   which is the greatest, like, I've never had Turkey as good as this. It's not a reflection on me.
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:19.120]   It's the reflection on the cooking technique. So I'm actually picking up my Turkey this afternoon,
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:23.040]   so I can do like a two day brine. Are you a Suvieter, Jason?
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:27.520]   Because three am. Oh, four out of four Mac break weekly hosts are Suvieters.
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:32.480]   Yeah, it's good. It's good. Right. Like it's good. You can't ruin it,
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:37.520]   which is really nice. And it's also great for thawing frozen stuff. Alex, are you going to do the,
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:41.920]   didn't you do a Friar Turkey, like the big deep fat fried turkey? I have done it in the past,
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:48.320]   but what I do when left my own device was your scars. Yeah, exactly. No, I did. I did. I did.
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:56.080]   I did exactly. I didn't just do a little bit like Alton Brown. I did. I watched it over and
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:02.080]   over again, took notes, bought all the same brands did exactly all the way down to the iced tea,
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:06.960]   like just, you know, like built the exactly. Like I was it good? Great. It was great. It was
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:10.480]   just a lot of work and I had to do it. I was like, I didn't want to do with all that oil. So I was
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:14.080]   just like, you know, like it's, but it was really good. I mean, it was exceptional.
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:18.560]   It's easy to do with it. You have, he has iced tea. He said he instructs you to sit there with
[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:22.720]   your iced tea outside. Yeah, because you have to do it outside, right? So we get the lawn chair
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:29.360]   and a giant pyramid above the thing. And yeah, don't leave it while you're there. And he only
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:35.280]   has two words for you. Burn unit. Anyway, so the, I've watched that, that episode a lot.
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:42.800]   You know, so the, but the, I, I found that when I sous vide it, it was kind of by accident because
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:46.240]   we got the turkey and I just didn't have any other plan. I realized that all I know how to do
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:52.080]   was deep fat fry it. And I, in California outside, when it was, it wasn't, it hadn't
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:55.520]   rained for a little while. My neighbors would probably be pretty upset if I, if they saw me
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:22:01.520]   doing something hot. We have, so we have video of Alex doing his deep fried turkey.
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:11.200]   Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So try this at home, folks. Yeah. So no, I, it's not flimble. It turns out,
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:16.400]   run, run, how are we about the story and turn into the hit movie "Backcraft"? Exactly. It took
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:21.840]   some liberties with the story. This is from an insurance company that made a compilation of deep
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:28.560]   fried turkey fails. I Googled it. Oh, on a deck. On a deck. Not a good idea. Look, so you get
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:32.480]   they got shields though. They're all right. They've got shields. They're prepared.
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:36.800]   Yeah. They're wearing their safety squints. Oh, none of that happened to me.
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:42.160]   But the, but, but I will say that the sous vide, the big thing was I,
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:47.280]   I will say sous vide is kind of ruined our, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:51.440]   he's dropping a turkey and oh gosh, while it was burning. While it was burning.
[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:56.960]   Someone, I mean, oh no, he's smart. He's doing this on ice. Oh, that's a horrible idea. Oh, dear.
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.320]   Oh my God.
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:03.760]   Too close to the house, dude. Don't do it. Too close to the house.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:09.120]   I assume you're muting the yakety sex on the, on the back.
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:18.720]   But I will say when you start to do it, when you do either turkey or chicken at 100, like,
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.680]   I don't know what I do for the turkey, but I know it chicken. We do it for one reason.
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:27.120]   I do 145 degrees for the, for the chicken. It ruins you because everything,
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:31.040]   every chicken tastes hard after that. Like it just tastes overdone all the time.
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:37.120]   And Kenji Al Lopez does, of course, discuss this and tests just he's the, he's the,
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:40.560]   he's the, you, Alex Lindsay of cooking. Yeah. Test every,
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:42.560]   definitive article. That is the cooking chicken.
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:46.880]   Cooking chicken and I am a 164 degree guy because I like it a little stringy.
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:51.520]   You, I cooked it that way, Alex once. And Lisa said, what's with his chicken?
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:58.080]   It's mushy. And he even says, if you want the traditional kind of stringy feel of chicken,
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:02.080]   don't cook it that low. I mean, a lot, a lot of food is emotional. And that's,
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:06.000]   that's not a, and that's an important part of things. What are you feeling when you, when you
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.880]   eat something? It's, but like the first time that like I had turkey and it's like, my god,
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:14.240]   it is moist. And there's flavor all the way through the core.
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:18.880]   It's kind of nice. Yeah. It's, it's wonderful. Yeah. I mean, I wrap, you just salt pepper. I've got
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:22.720]   some sprigs of rosemary that I'm going to be wrapping around it before I see, I bag and seal it.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.240]   But the, but the other, the other thing about Suvie that I really, really like,
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:31.440]   it's especially important for something like Thanksgiving, it's not like you're just like
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:35.280]   waiting for it's not like you're waiting for a donor heart to come off the planes. You can grab
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:41.120]   it and put into action. It's like, okay, it's, it's been, it's been the Suvie that 144 for 90
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:47.600]   minutes to two hours. I now have a hour and a half to two hour window to take this out of the water.
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:51.440]   So basically the turkey's done. So great. So now I'm going to do, now I'm going to do the size.
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:55.920]   Now I'm going to basically uncork the wine, that sort of stuff, because you don't, you don't have
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:25:00.960]   to like have like a move, go, go, go, go, go, like Navy seals jumping out of a landing craft.
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:05.920]   It's like, no, okay, now I have a hour. If I can get my stuff together in 90 minutes after the
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:10.560]   turkey is done, I feel that things will, things will work out. Okay. So just for those of you who
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:14.720]   are going, what the hell are they talking about? This is a very, very slowly cooking
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:18.400]   food at a very, very low temperatures, low and slow in a water bath.
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:22.720]   In a water bath, yeah. And the bottom line is that the water bath is a certain temperature,
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:26.880]   and eventually everything equalizes to whatever that temperature is. And so you, you know, when
[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:31.520]   it's because it's vacuum packed in. And so it's just, and so, and all it does after that is get
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:39.520]   softer. If I have inadvertently done an experiment that if you take a steak and you leave it in Suvie
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:43.360]   for two and a half weeks, I know you did that. I turned into a bag of liquid.
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:48.640]   It just, it just keeps the nature in. It got softer, softer, softer, and then just turned into
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:53.200]   liquid. I went to Europe and came back and it was still, it becomes more of a forensic
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:58.160]   problem project than a culinary project. I would attempt to take a sip, but I was like, no, no,
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:01.920]   no, no again. I wonder what it tastes like. We don't have enough bathrooms in the house.
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:04.800]   We have too many people in the house for me to take a risk like that. Yes.
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:10.560]   That's just go to serious eats.com before you do any of this read as much as you can.
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.400]   You need a special piece of hardware that doesn't cost all that much money.
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:18.240]   Yeah. Basically, basically the science of your like, oh my god, you're eating turkey that was
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:25.840]   cooked at like 144 degrees. Isn't the safety tables come are basically based on how much time
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:30.160]   the meat spends at that temperature 165 degrees, which is like the gold standard
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:36.480]   means that if it's that, if the meat is that temperature for 10 seconds, all of the basically
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:41.600]   enough of the bacteria that will make you sick is dead in there. And so you're going to be safe to
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:46.480]   eat at lower temperatures. It means okay, it has to hold at that temperature with every single
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:52.960]   bit of that meat at 144 degrees. But if it's at that temperature for 90 minutes or more,
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:58.240]   that will achieve the same thing. So don't think that like, this isn't like, you know,
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:05.200]   like engine manifold, and engine manifold turkey was just like, okay, YOLO, good. Look, everybody.
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:10.480]   It's a four day weekend. We got some we got some days off to spend just in case things don't work
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:14.240]   the way that we were hoping it was going to work. We did. We actually went down to Kenji's house
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:19.760]   and did a segment for the new screensaver. Nice. He's a great guy. It was really fun.
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:25.520]   And his book is really worth buying if you like to cook the food lab highly. And obviously,
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:32.880]   Jason Snell is also a Kenji Lopez alt. Of course, fans. That's, you never made better chicken.
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:36.800]   I don't actually suvi the turkey because I don't have a bag that big, or I'd have to put them,
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:41.760]   like in a bathtub with like five, two, V in machines in it. It works for a leg, basically.
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:46.880]   I'm not going to do that. But I do use the, I do brine it. I use the Alton Brown Goode's Rose
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:51.840]   turkey brine and it's a five gallon bucket from the Home Depot with a turkey in it. And you leave
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:55.840]   it there overnight and it tastes great. Does it come with a turkey in it? You go to Home Depot and
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:28:00.480]   it comes with a turkey in it. They should do that. They should steal you a Christmas tree
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:05.840]   and a five gallon bucket with a turkey in it and go to town. And the great thing,
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:09.760]   it's a great value too, because after Thanksgiving, you have this bucket full of like salt for your
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:16.400]   driveway and sidewalks. In a related story, the Apple Watch can help spot life-threatening
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:23.840]   heart conditions, including left ventricular dysfunction. So there, make sure this holiday
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:32.640]   season, you're aware in your Apple Watch, Mayo Clinic, new study, left ventric.
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:36.480]   My partner bought me a Fitbit. I think they're trying to kill me.
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:41.520]   It won't tell me about left ventricular dysfunction. It's usually...
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:45.920]   What's insurance money? It's a bad sign because it's usually followed by
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:52.720]   congestive heart failure. The left ventricle pumps the oxygen to your vital organs.
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:29:00.000]   So don't let it fail, kids. The study included 2,400... By the way, you might have been in this
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:06.160]   study, right? This is one of those Apple Watch studies you could sign up for. 2,454 patients
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:12.720]   from the US and 11 countries, 125,000 ECGs from their Apple Watch. The results were,
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:20.480]   quote, "scrubbed and processed by a proprietary AI algorithm developed by the researchers.
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:28.240]   They detected patients with low ejection fraction with an area under the curve of 0.885, which is a
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:34.240]   95% confidence interval using the mean prediction within a 30... I don't know any of this means.
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:42.480]   Anyway, consumer watch ECGs. I guess there are other consumer watch systems that do it. I don't know.
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:46.960]   I think the Samsungs do, right? Acquired in non-clinical environments can
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.840]   identify patients with cardiac dysfunction. So it's not just the Apple Watch. It's not just for AFib anymore.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.320]   Good news.
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:04.160]   Yeah. I'm glad that all the data... This is the power of crowdsource data on that on an
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:08.400]   hour-by-hour basis, on a such a wide scale like this. It's like you don't know what you can
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:13.360]   figure out until you've got all this data you can sift through. And society is very correct to
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:19.120]   wonder if, "Hey, maybe before we make these artificial intelligence machine language systems that can
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:23.440]   create art based on having learned about art from actual working artists that are no longer
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:28.800]   getting work." There's the other side of that where we can make people healthier and extend life
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:35.360]   and prevent disease by, again, collecting all this data, having actual peer-reviewed science
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:38.800]   that actually backed it up, not the colloquial. "Hey, we noticed that most people who have the
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:45.600]   red watch band tend to have fewer digestive problems. Like, okay, that's not really actually science."
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:50.160]   As predicted, the Apple Watch satellite SOS ads have started to come.
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:58.160]   I don't know if you saw it on the football game the other day. Here we go. I can't play the sound
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:03.120]   because Apple, for some reason, doesn't want us to play their ads. I'm just giving you a free ad,
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:07.680]   but here comes the helicopter coming down the valley.
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:16.000]   It's kind of like a scene. Oh, look, the poor guy broke his ankle. I don't know how he got all
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.200]   the way up there somehow he did. His wife is using her iPhone 14. And here comes the helicopter.
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:28.640]   Somehow I need to be found as a song, I guess. Why didn't the camera crew help them? Yeah,
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:35.040]   they had a whole camera crew up there. And they said, "Look, they got spotlights. They're searching
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:43.200]   the area. Emergency services responders have been notified." That's kind of like a scene at a
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:47.280]   diehard. The helicopter pulls up. Thank goodness. "Just crying."
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:55.600]   And there you go, Apple. Thank you, Apple. Saving the world one smart watch at a time.
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:02.800]   I did notice... Being modest about it, as usual. I did notice that they are now...
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:08.000]   They like I got a red one saying, "You've got to notice and then I have to go into settings."
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.680]   And theirs is learn how the satellite works and all that stuff. So they're really encouraging
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:16.000]   people to do that. And at the same time, it says, "Also update your medical alert information if you
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:23.440]   haven't done so." Which works. Super smart. It is smart. Hey, did you know that the iPhone has
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:29.600]   your medical information? I said, "You've... I've been... They've had it for years." And they also
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:33.440]   know everybody's going to be like, "Oh, I want to try out that satellite. Hey, let's give that a shot."
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:40.000]   Here's a button you can look for a satellite. You can pretend all you like without actually
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.680]   getting into the emergency system because that's bad. So that was really smart. They know human
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:50.000]   nature. I'm glad they're doing this. And now that obviously was a staged commercial that didn't
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.440]   really happen or you're right, Andy. The camera crew would have saved him. But I hooked up the
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:59.040]   top battle with the camera crew broke my ankle. But thank goodness I had an iPhone.
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:04.720]   But I don't want to monetize it. We will start to see the ads as we already do with the Apple Watch.
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:09.440]   I've fallen and I can't get up. And the Apple Watch saved me.
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:13.600]   And to get back to what Andy was talking about a little earlier, I think that we're really going
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:19.280]   to see this... I mean, I think that Tim Cook is right. That the impact that the Apple Watch is
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:25.440]   going to make on health is going to be traumatic over a decade because the anonymized data
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:32.800]   in such a... No one's ever had that sample ever. That many people are sampling that much data.
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:36.720]   And I do think that we're going to get to a point where it's not just saying you have a little
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:40.880]   arrhythmia or you have something else that's going to go, "Hey, we're seeing something that
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:47.200]   you should go see the doctor. You should get a checkup for this." Because we're seeing something
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:53.120]   that has a trend that goes towards something that you might want to just get that checked out.
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:34:00.000]   And you're able to get to something months before or years before, life-saving time before
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.680]   you would feel it otherwise. And so I think that those little idiosyncrasies are going to be
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:11.920]   we're going to see all kinds of things grow out of this that we can't. And it's hard to imagine
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:16.720]   right now. We've talked about the Apple strategy going forward that they need the next big thing.
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:21.040]   We've talked about the kind of the tent poles apples thinking of, of course, the car,
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:29.680]   AR, but health. And I think people downplay how important health is. And I think honestly,
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:34.000]   I think that's the best bad apples place. It's not just by the way...
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.960]   And Ken Cook had said that's their big bet. Well, they have three big bets. There's been a
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:42.560]   lot of money. But it's interesting. That's what I'm talking about mostly.
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:46.000]   You think it's mostly health? He knows. He's talked about that because it's safe to say
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   because they aren't working on it. We know they have it.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.640]   He's like, we're really excited about AR and we don't want to talk about something.
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:57.520]   But it's also exciting just to see the storyline of the development of this watch
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:02.400]   where for the first year, they figure that, hey, we're going to make this stylish watch and the
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:06.880]   features are going to be nice. But hey, look at this stylish watch that we made. And they really
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:12.240]   fumbled around the darkness for a year before they figured out not only was the secret sauce
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:18.000]   can be fitness, we have an opportunity to stop doing a fitness watch and start doing a health
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.440]   watch, which is something that almost nobody was doing. Certainly not at the scale of how Apple was
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:27.760]   doing it. And this is why they were rewarded by pretty much ruining this market right now.
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:34.640]   There's again, I'm still wearing my sample pixel watch. I probably have to start fishing or cutting
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:38.480]   bait. I have to make that decision. I think by the end of December, I'm going to buy one of my own
[00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:43.680]   when I send this back or whatever. And it has the ECG, it has heart rate tracking, has all the sort
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:49.760]   of stuff, but not the sort of comprehensive. Here's a picture that we're starting to figure out
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:54.480]   about your habits and your health from the data we're collecting. Nothing like that. Do you think
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:59.840]   that's because Apple has a head start, which they clearly do, or that Apple's doing has some
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:03.920]   secret sauce that they're doing something that Google's just not willing to do? Well, I think
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:08.800]   that they, it's the secret sauce of Apple form on almost every product that they make that's a
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:13.440]   success is commitment. They thought about what they wanted to do. They made the plan and now they're
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:22.960]   executing that plan. We're asked Google, God love them. It's like, they're gonna throw it out there.
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:26.560]   They're gonna see how people react to it. They're gonna see if it makes sense for whatever they're
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:32.720]   doing next year. Whereas Apple says, no, if if we sell 18 of these, we're still gonna proceed with
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:36.400]   the next year's plan, maybe not the year after that, maybe we'll modify next year's plan.
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:40.320]   But it's like they did not move forward with the watch if they did not believe that this piece of
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:44.400]   hardware, the software we're gonna work on, because but you have to, you can't keep changing the
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:48.240]   hardware every single year without losing your shirt on it. We are going to be committed to this
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:52.400]   idea of a wearable and we're gonna see what we can do with this technology. And two years later,
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:56.720]   they figured out that again, not just fitness, not just workouts, it's gonna be health. It's that
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:01.600]   commitment and hiring that sort of team that knows that by the way, you will be with this company
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:06.320]   long enough for your stock, for your stock options to come through. We are not gonna
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:10.720]   do, we're not gonna do, shut you aside on some sort of printer cable project, because we decided
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:16.960]   that we don't, the current macroeconomic international monetary situation is it means it means it means
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:20.800]   it means that this is not exactly the correct time for us to be pursuing a new product category at
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:24.800]   this time. Enjoy the new t-shirt tip factory that we want you to manage.
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:29.120]   Now I lost my iPad pencil. I did some around here somewhere, but I want to switch my studio,
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:32.480]   I put it somewhere and I can't find it. So I just gave up and ordered another one.
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:39.680]   And it really wasn't an explanation for me, like why Apple does so well. I ordered it on the Apple
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:46.720]   Store. It was delivered in a nice perfectly packed bag two hours later to my house.
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:54.080]   When I opened it, the packaging, I realized that Apple probably spent more time designing how
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:38:02.160]   I unpackaged a pen than most people spend on their interface. It was just an incredible,
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:05.840]   like this little arrow, oh, I was like, there's got to be an arrow here. It's an Apple user.
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:10.800]   And I just opened a whole bunch of horribly packaged things right before it. So I think
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:14.400]   that's why it stood out so much. I just like, oh, I can't figure out how to get this thing out.
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:17.760]   And this was like, oh, I just pull this down and then I open this up and then it just pops out.
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:23.760]   And they just think about all those things, because all of those things do matter. They matter on
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:27.280]   how you think about the company, how you think about the product, how you think about
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:30.560]   all those things. And I think Apple does that better than just about anybody else.
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:39.120]   And particularly, it's not just the watch, new study in a journal called I Science,
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:46.640]   which is not the science of iPhone devices, despite its name. I think it's, I don't know if
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:52.800]   it's peer reviewed. It's an open app access journal of science. But a study that's very interesting,
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:57.760]   smartphone bundled earphones as personal sound amplification products and adults with sensor
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:05.840]   a neural hearing loss. The effect they found that the AirPods Pro meets most of the anti-electro
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:11.840]   acoustic standards, speech recognition of the AirPods Pro, similar to conventional hearing aids in noise.
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:17.680]   AirPods Pro may serve as a hearing assistive device for mild to moderate hearing loss.
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:25.520]   They make a pretty darn good hearing aid, and they're comparing them to a high quality,
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:32.480]   you know, $6,000 hearing aids. And they compare favorably for mild hearing loss.
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:36.400]   I think the big thing is battery life. Like they last for a while, but they don't last the
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:41.040]   same as a hearing aid does most of the time. So they don't last all of the hearing aids
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:44.160]   last from when you get up to when you go to bed. So it's 60 hours.
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:50.480]   And I will say that I think that Apple still has to work on the fit and finish of how I fit.
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:54.800]   I mean, I have tried every nub. Even the pros. Yeah. Even the pros. You know,
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:58.960]   when I want to listen to stuff, I'm going to my ultimate ears. Those little ones that heat up
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:03.760]   that we talked about at some point. I bought those. And when I want to just listen to stuff,
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:06.800]   I put those in and they just feel like they've they just feel like I don't think about them.
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:10.000]   They were an advertiser, but I agree with you. They were very comfortable.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.320]   Because they and I get into it and you probably use a molded earpiece like I do.
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:19.680]   I actually don't. I mean, I don't find them very comfortable. Like I found them because
[00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:24.160]   they're hard plastic. Yeah. And I I've not found them to be that funny. That was funny.
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:30.000]   The UE fits same company are not hard plastic. They're soft rubber and it's really comfortable.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.920]   Yeah. And and I I use them. I use them pretty heavily when I'm when I'm just walking around.
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:40.880]   If I'm if I might answer the phone, if I'm going to answer the phone, I use either the
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:48.480]   Oh, shocks my shocks open gear because it's got a boom. So people can hear me better.
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:53.520]   And then and then the only thing and I and I don't know if this is something that Apple has
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:57.520]   this is this gets into one of those little conspiracy things that usually Andy brings up.
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:04.560]   That is about why Apple does certain things. My Apple AirPods will immediately when I answer
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:10.080]   the phone will immediately jump to my Apple AirPods. All my other Bluetooth ones, I have to select it
[00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:14.880]   manually and it's super annoying because I was like, I was just listening to it. I was listening
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:18.880]   to music through that that that Bluetooth and then someone calls and it switches out of that and
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:23.840]   goes to my phone and I have to switch back to my Bluetooth and I don't know why Apple does that.
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:29.360]   Yeah. Yeah. Bluetooth is hard, but this but this I'm really excited by what all companies can do
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:34.240]   with stuff like this because you're absolutely right. The difference between a medically created
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:39.760]   hearing aid that's being fitted to you and set up for you by an actual audiologist
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:43.440]   is miles apart from anything you're going to get off the shelf, including an off the shelf
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:49.120]   hearing aid that you can now get since from October onward. However, for the number of people that
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:54.880]   are in either in an economic situation or they're just not in the habit of like,
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:58.560]   hey, I've got I've got maybe a medical situation I want to check up on. I would need to make an
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:01.840]   appointment with somebody. And then when the next appointment is three months away and I have to
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:06.960]   remember to make that to keep that appointment, the idea that the the earbuds that maybe they
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:12.880]   already have can help them through this period without having an actual hearing aid is a very,
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:19.520]   very exciting thing. In addition to the idea of using machine learning models and extremely
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:28.480]   innovative techniques to address specific kinds of hearing problems like I was I was I I attended
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:33.920]   Roger Ebert was having a conversation on stage with studs Turkel who at the time was like
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:40.480]   88, 89, 90, 91, 92. And there was like, it's not a reception, but basically the lobby of this building
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:45.760]   was everybody milling about and he was hanging out and talking to people. And I'd met him at a
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:49.840]   conference like a couple of years before so, okay, I'm freaking out. Oh, yeah, how you been doing?
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:54.720]   He's absolutely wonderful guy. And then he just sort of like gently grabs my arm and says, look,
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:58.880]   I'm deaf as a post. Can you stay near me and like help me help me hear what people are
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:05.520]   telling me? And for I'm telling you the next 45 minutes, I was no absolutely.
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:08.320]   I was hearing it. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:12.800]   Sir Mr. Turkel, I'd be more than happy to stay with you. And but the fun and the funny thing is
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:18.000]   like for 45 minutes, a I learned exactly how much studs Turkel was loved by people in Chicago,
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:23.360]   because they be studs. I've never met you, but you interviewed my grandfather who was a steam
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:29.600]   fitter. He used to live on Delancy. Oh, yeah, Delancy. You know, when that fact, when they
[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:34.080]   have this wrongful conversation, but it would always be like the person would like be excited.
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:39.920]   They say their greetings to studs and studs would turn to me and I would repeat the exact same thing.
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:43.680]   He says that you've never met him, but you did meet his grandfather.
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:50.880]   So I looked like his like Svengali, like manager or something like that. But what I'm getting
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:55.440]   is that it wasn't just like that he was hard of hearing. It's that in that specific environment
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:44:00.800]   where there are lots of million voices, it's hard to isolate. And so imagine what the one of the
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:06.160]   things that Google was doing, for instance, with the captioning on videos is they can actually see,
[00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:11.760]   okay, well, that person's lips are moving and we can match a really buried sound in the soundtrack
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:16.880]   with that speaker so we can caption the right thing. And so it's not a big leap for someone
[00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:22.000]   like Apple or Google to essentially, well, look, keep your keep your iPhone like in your front
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.480]   pocket. So the camera's facing outward. If it will be able to identify the face of the person who
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:31.360]   seems to be looking at you and talking at you. And even if it's not necessarily isolating that
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:37.600]   voice, even if it just simply does speech to text and simply puts into your ear at a frequency,
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:43.440]   at a tone that you can that your hearing is really well, well equipped to capable, well equipped to
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:47.520]   process. And now you're just hearing instead of the blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:51.760]   of this crowded restaurant, you're hearing essentially this fengali manager,
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:59.840]   my goodness, I wish I weren't allergic to grapefruit or else we would I would absolutely go for this
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:05.280]   grapefruit cocktail to your male friend of like 20 years they haven't seen because he was he's been
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:09.200]   in the NFL or whatever. It's a big opportunity to deliver a lot of solutions to people who would
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:13.120]   not have access to it otherwise. This is why this was something I can tell you even having hearing aids
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:18.240]   does not help with understanding what he's talking about. Sometimes stories go like there was some
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:24.720]   a lot of back story. I pity you for not existing in the world in which I exist.
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:30.720]   I know none of us are boring. We all are pitiable for not living in the world. But I just wanted to
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:35.520]   mention this is not what you think of as like transparency in the airport. There's actually a
[00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:40.560]   feature called Live Listen. It's an accessibility feature you can add to control center and you
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:46.400]   have to flip it down and press it on. It does this filtering thing. It is doing what Andy described
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:52.400]   in slightly earlier in his conversation there which is the idea that it is trying to focus on
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:59.760]   in on voices so that you can hear your conversation even though you're in an area that could be
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:04.080]   really noisy because that is one of the big things for people who have hearing issues is if you're
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:09.040]   in a noisy area like a restaurant or a party or something where lots of people are talking,
[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:13.600]   you can't hear that person in front of you and Live Listen is tuned to do that. But it's not one
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:19.840]   of the standard like you click on your AirPods and you flip it on. They point out in this study
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:27.920]   that the AirPods Pro are good. The AirPods too not so good. And I'm trying to figure out I'm reading
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:33.280]   as quickly as I can if they're using that feature or maybe they're using the phone as a microphone
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:39.200]   because that's another feature. This story is about Live Listen. They use Live Listen.
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:44.720]   Okay. Thank you for reading it ahead of time. I should have. I was reading it while Andy was
[00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:49.920]   helping Sten's Circle. So it was fine. Which was great. And I think that the other thing I think
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:57.680]   the title of this show is NFL Grape Fruits I just want to say. Andy if you ever want to write a novel
[00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:03.600]   I mean you could write an infinite jest. You totally could. I swear to God you must have
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:09.520]   do you ever write fiction? Oh yeah. No I've written like six books. Oh where are they under a suit
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:13.840]   in them? They're there they're on a they're on a hard drive waiting for a moment where I believe
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:18.320]   where I believe that you know what I'm getting closer to something where hey look wow Andy you've
[00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:23.040]   really entertained yourself there for a good 300 days. David Foster Wallace got nothing in you
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:29.120]   baby. You got it. Whatever that is. I mean I would read that novel. I would I would love to like
[00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:33.680]   be the author of one of those books that like everybody has to buy and everybody wants to say
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:38.560]   that they read but no one actually read it so they can't actually I want to write the turbo
[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:42.720]   and tabulator book where it's like I don't understand a word of this but I don't want to look like a
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:46.080]   dope. So I'll just say it's genius and you should definitely buy as a way.
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:53.920]   And that was the 2022. What were you saying Alex? I'm sorry. I just think the interesting will be
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:58.000]   it will be the languages as well. It's going to get to a point where you have a real time.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.520]   Oh yeah. You're going to have an air pot in. It's going to identify which language is being taught
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:06.160]   you know and and I and we won't you know like and I'll just be we'll be able to understand it.
[00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:13.440]   I was in a meeting in in Rwanda for places in the one of that someone from the president's office
[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:19.680]   was there and she speaks English, French, quinterwanda and there was one other language and there was
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:23.040]   a bunch of us sitting around and she just kind of just translated for us all the all you know just
[00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:29.680]   back and forth she perfectly without an accent to every language and I was like holy smokes and
[00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:33.520]   but I did think to myself be really great if we had earpieces that just allowed us to talk to
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:38.560]   each other in very star tricky kind of way without without relying on rosings. Like the UN without
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:44.160]   like a whole bunch of people in that room. Google Google Google Google Translate does that in a
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:48.400]   in a not that not an instantaneous translation way but yeah you can have an earbud plugged in.
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:54.160]   This is this is why I don't think anybody is ahead of the game with augmented reality yet
[00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:57.760]   because I like we talked about last week we had a really great conversation about that. No one
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:04.000]   really knows what people would want to use it for but I got to say that for an experimental product
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:08.160]   with there if there if the first product that they that Google wants to talk to talked about in this
[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:12.960]   modern era is hey we've got a pair of glasses that will automatically live caption what people are
[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:19.360]   saying to you or translate it to a language you can understand that is a really that's a really
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:24.720]   good start because you're not just saying hey look and now you don't just read about an elephant have
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:31.040]   a have a have a 3d elephant on the table you can look at say okay that it means you can go back to
[00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:35.680]   watching Chris Nolan movies in the theater this is what you use this is what you use the translation
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:41.440]   app on the iPhone today to do some of this to with conversations which is it's getting there
[00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:45.840]   it's getting there quite there yet Google demonstrated it for their Google buds but never
[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:51.120]   actually shipped it so just for people want to know you have to turn on hearing in your control
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:56.240]   center and then you'll get a little ear in your control center and then you can turn on live
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:50:04.000]   listen from here I pay I paid $6,000 for Starkey hearing aids and for resounds you mentioned the
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.920]   cost and he certainly that's one reason people don't do this the other reason is stigma
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:14.000]   people for some reason I don't know why are embarrassed to be wearing hearing aids and
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:18.400]   and if that's the case wearing an AirPods you look cool right especially if you're younger I mean
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:23.760]   once you get to my age you don't care but if you're younger and you don't want to be seen wearing
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:29.840]   hearing aids but I think you also make an excellent point that there's nothing to replace an
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:35.280]   audiologist you know Adam Curry is like adamant about this over the counting hearing aids he says
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:39.920]   a terrible idea people need to go to audiologist and I agree but for people who can't afford it
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:46.080]   or don't want the stigma this is better than nothing maybe and I there's one other thing I always
[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:49.840]   thought when I first got hearing aids oh this is gonna be great I'm gonna be able to hear music
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:55.360]   you don't it just amplifies for the voice it makes voices more intelligible and AirPods will
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:51:00.400]   give you nice music too yeah and the and the real danger with the over over the counter is
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:05.200]   the how loud because what happens is very good near sighted person is a fiend for resolution
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:10.480]   people who are who don't hear as well are kind of a fiend for more volume and the problem is that's
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:15.200]   that's a sort that's a vicious cycle that they keep on turning exactly why Adam Curry and me have
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:21.200]   terrible hearing because we were DJs and I have your heads and we turn it up you turn it up so
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:25.200]   yeah you just keep on oh you want to hear every little bit of everything that's around you and I
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:29.280]   think that is that's a real challenge but I think apple does a pretty good job I get little warnings
[00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:33.360]   all the time if I turn it up too much you know you get these little like hey uh I don't wonder if
[00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:38.240]   nor is noise canceling headphones will make it less common that people lose their hearing with
[00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:43.760]   volume because I think some of the volume is there to block out the world right yeah yeah yeah I have
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:50.320]   to say that you know we go to live shows whenever we can and this watch is great because I wear
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:54.640]   earplugs now I wish to god I'd done it when I was younger because I like you I have tonight
[00:51:54.640 --> 00:52:02.000]   is and it's very very loud and annoying but the head the apple watch says it's dangerous where
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:06.400]   your earplugs and thank goodness I you know if I need a reminder that would be a great reminder
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:12.480]   turn that feature on to kids and be attention to it it's it's it's an actually development that
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:17.440]   even when I was a kid the kid who wore a bike helmet was like oh my god what a
[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:23.040]   wuss what a nerd we're asking that rest today fortunately it's like no no I I don't I don't want
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:27.440]   to I don't want to lose 40% of my faculties because I simply tipped over at eight miles an hour I
[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:33.040]   wish that the same thing were true of earplugs because now I have I you can buy a very good pair
[00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:39.360]   of like reusable cleanable ear earplugs for about like ten dollars 12 dollars if that and now I always
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:44.160]   I always have that little package like in my in my laptop bag because the number times where I've
[00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:48.560]   been I didn't know that I was going to be like in this place where there's a loudspeaker nearby but
[00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:52.240]   they'd be able to simply plug these in and still be able to hear normally but just not
[00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:57.280]   not hearing any pain whatsoever from being narrow loudspeakers like this was a good purchase of a
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:53:02.480]   new good eleven dollars to spend there I we were we were at the Veterans Day parade and there's an
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:07.600]   outside it's outside and there's a band playing it was great playing old blues music and I looked at
[00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:13.440]   my watch it was a hundred DB plus and I thought wow this is loud and we're outside oh god you know
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:19.040]   it was the last big fourth of July parade I went to it's like really fire department like you
[00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:23.840]   think it's a good idea you have this the sirens going as you're rolling at walking speed past
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:29.920]   lines of people who are right at the sidewalk oh it's like oh oh I see these kids and parents nowadays
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:35.040]   God bless all the work you do but hopefully please like yeah if you could have like your guys just
[00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:42.000]   you're you men and women just like simply like yelling from the side of the truck that would be
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:48.240]   a lot more entertaining and also less hazardous to people's hearing and here from from Chile comes a
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:55.920]   word of warning about airpods and birds can you turn the sand on is there sand
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:03.680]   there's a bird on the shoulder flies away with his hair but
[00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:21.920]   okay so don't don't wear those thanks to the chat room for that don't wear those right around
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:29.680]   birds all right let's take a little break on that lively note Andy and I coat Alex Lindsey
[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:36.080]   Jason Snell you guys are great it's great to have you our show today and it's great to have all of
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:42.880]   you watching our show today brought to you by our fine friends at rocket money I this is oh I feel
[00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:49.840]   like this is a public service announcement how many of you well you may not even know have subscriptions
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:55.760]   monthly subscriptions running in the background that you've forgotten about or you're double paying
[00:54:55.760 --> 00:55:04.480]   or something you never use you don't know about rocket money to survey of users 80 percent of people
[00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:10.320]   have subscriptions they've forgotten about almost everybody but this is the worst news
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:15.360]   according to the survey when they ask these people oh how much do you spend on subscriptions
[00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:20.480]   they would estimate about 80 dollars a month then they would look and they'd find out it's closer to
[00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:26.640]   200 dollars a month and I bet you that's low for a lot of people in this group because you've got
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:32.240]   lots of subscriptions you've got your apple you got your you got all this stuff right rocket money is
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:38.080]   a great way it was I actually started using it when it was true bill rockets acquired it and
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:43.200]   they've improved it immensely they've changed the name to rocket money but I've been a long I've used
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:48.160]   this for years because I tell you what it's one of the occupational hazards of this job I
[00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:53.840]   subscribed to a lot of stuff I probably shouldn't and then forget about it I bet you have a few
[00:55:53.840 --> 00:56:01.200]   subscriptions to newspapers maybe streaming services that you never watch so rocket money will find
[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:07.120]   them pinpoint them and then the best part is there's a button that says cancel all you have to do is
[00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:12.880]   press the cancel button rocket money takes care of the rest this is an app that will save you
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:19.680]   a ton of money I had political this was it's embarrassing to even admit this but you know when
[00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:24.560]   you do the political campaign contributions they have a little checkbox that says you want to just
[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:28.000]   do this every month and they've always checked and you have to remember to uncheck it I didn't
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:34.560]   forgot about it this was in the last cycle this was in what is it 2020 and I and it was true
[00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:38.320]   bill at the time but rocket money would do the same thing it found it said you know you spent
[00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:43.760]   it a lot of money every month in this camp I said I am and turned it off immediately saved me I
[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:48.160]   can't tell you how much money I can't tell you I don't want to tell you you get rid of useless

[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:46.240]   actually we we're talking before the show about our mastodon we have a
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:52.080]   twit social mastodon instance we have which we've had for years suddenly costing us a little bit of
[00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:59.360]   money that's everybody fleas Twitter we have our own forums at twit.community we have the chatroom at
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:04.880]   irc.twit.tv we have lots of ways to interact that are all free of course many free podcasts
[00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:10.640]   ads supported but there's a way you can get rid of the ads and continue to support all of the
[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:15.920]   things we do by joining club twit seven bucks a month that's all it is ad free shows the twit plus
[00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:22.560]   feed shows that we don't put anywhere else including the hands on Mac show with mica lots of tips
[00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:29.760]   hands on windows with paul thorat fantastic shows that are that were generated and paid for by the
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:33.600]   club so they're in the club right now sometimes they come out of the club this week in space was
[00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:37.920]   a club only thing that we we you know built an audience and then we're able to put it out in the
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:42.480]   public and so that's what our hope is with all of these the untitled lennox show stacy's book club
[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:47.280]   which is going to be the project hail mary which is a wonderful and or Andy we're book all of that
[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:54.480]   and the discord which is the best social network ever all you have to do is go to twit.tv/club
[00:58:54.480 --> 00:59:00.640]   twit and we thank you in advance for your support it really does make a difference in fact frankly
[00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:07.120]   it's you know you see you see you see all these tech companies struggling well those that there's
[00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:11.600]   a trickle-down effect because those are the companies that buy hats and uh on twit and as
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:15.440]   if it's getting harder and harder to sell ads more and more we're looking to the club members to
[00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:20.800]   not only make up that gap but i think going forward that may well be the future of everything we do
[00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:27.280]   i know you do that too Jason and you have a you have a patreon right i do we it is refreshing to be
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:32.480]   able to build what you're doing on the people who want to listen or read what you're doing yes
[00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:38.000]   instead of it just being about we love advertising you know it has you couldn't do without it i bought
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:43.280]   my house with advertising from a magazine right like i get it but it is nice to be able to have that
[00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:47.280]   like the magazine was advertising and it was also people paying to get the magazine right and it was
[00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:52.000]   like it's nice to get both of those streams in there and for the people who really care to be a part
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:57.120]   of it and to support you but also to get stuff they get stuff for it too right they get they get
[00:59:57.120 --> 01:00:03.200]   some value out of it too which is great yeah um i think going forward you know this like the
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:07.280]   my experience with mastodon over the last few weeks and then i go back to twitter and i see all
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:11.520]   the ads and all the crap and stuff and i i realize there is a i think there's a better way
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:18.880]   smaller communities that support the product and support you know the efforts uh and people who have
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:23.120]   you know kind of come together to be part of that community that's a really nice feeling that's
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:27.280]   that's what we get in the discord and so we're getting in these other things now so thank you
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:33.680]   club twit members because you make that all possible could you use i'm curious somebody in the uh
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:40.560]   in the discord actually is saying they use the air pods for a hearing protection um i did a little
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:45.280]   shooting with my dad kovar says a month ago he didn't have an extra pair of earplugs so i used
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:52.080]   my air pods pro did a great job protecting my ears i'm sure that's not recommended but really
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:57.680]   could you do the job i don't know if they did a great job there is a feature in the air pods pro
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:03.920]   now that is better in air pods pro two that is all about limiting the dynamic range right it's
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:09.440]   trying to take loud noises and and push them down right so that even when you're in transparency mode
[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:14.080]   it's trying to push that stuff out uh yeah to uh Alex's point i think we need another one of these
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:20.880]   studies to tell us whether it actually offers protection or not if it's a good seal right um
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:24.560]   promise no investigation works against continuous sound but not against
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:29.440]   gunshots i mean but it may be the seal you mentioned the seal like when you when you are wearing
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:34.240]   actually your protection that's how it's protecting you it's not necessarily active protection it's
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:38.800]   stuffing your ears right so yeah i mean i've done that a concert where i've been out of a concert
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:43.600]   and i haven't had earplugs and i've had my in-ear headphones better than nothing and i just stick
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:49.040]   them in with nothing plugged in and it that works right that is a way to protect your ears i guess
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:53.440]   i would say it's better than nothing but the the quality of the seal and how heavy that seal is
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:02:00.880]   yeah and in a lot of the head a lot of the ear protection for at a at a shooting range is actually
[01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:05.440]   both active and so really you know and so it's it's doing both of those things and most of those
[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:09.760]   aren't are not particularly expensive either and so i've done a lot of research in them because i
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:14.080]   wanted to put them around my other headphones so that i can really shut everything out when i'm
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:18.000]   listening to a program so i thought i thought i got into there's a world of are you wearing
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:23.040]   shooting headphones over your head while you're listening to i want no i'm not doing it now but i'm
[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:27.200]   trying to find the right one so i was doing all this research and just there's this huge you know
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:32.320]   world of aircraft headsets as well as as well as shooting range headsets here if you was somebody
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:39.040]   who was wearing a helicopter headset and the sound was spectacular so it had a good microphone
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:43.280]   and obviously when you get in a helicopter you have to wear those they are so noisy
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:49.600]   and it so protects your ears but also you can communicate yeah because you're talking to the
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:52.640]   person next to you in the helicopter and here you still can't you wouldn't be able to hear them very
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:56.800]   well if you didn't have them in there yeah absolutely never fly in a helicopter or shoot at a shooting
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:05.040]   range without good ear protection i i would say um all right let's uh move on here
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:12.880]   Evernote are we sad we had Phil Libben the founder of Evernote at ceo for many years on
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:19.200]   twit on sunday and he seemed to think bending spoons is going to be okay um but boy it makes me a
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:23.680]   little bit sad to see the end of the line for one of the big spoons is like uh what they're
[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:28.160]   kind of like a holding company they bought filmic for apps yeah so they bought they bought a bunch
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:33.200]   of apps and they're not bad i think the i think the vibe i get and i think a lot of people get is
[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:37.280]   that Evernote was at one point it seemed like it was going to be one of these companies that was
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:43.120]   going to kind of conquer the world yeah and and it didn't right and part of it was their product it
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:47.280]   really was i think the limitations of it and part of it was that they were in a space that
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:52.960]   threatened a lot of big players who said no no no we're gonna do that you can't do that but for
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:59.120]   whatever reason it's not that bending spoons is is bad necessarily i think it's that it feels like
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:03.040]   the sad sort of like capitulation of this story where it seemed like they were going to be huge
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:11.360]   and they're not but see but you and you who was it picked apples notes uh last week was it you i
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:18.640]   mean google with keep and apple with notes hit the the free end right and then Evernote started
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:24.400]   charging a subscription and it was like well you know it just was there was no place for it in the
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:29.760]   world one note is free on windows there was just no place for it in the long yeah i think that's i
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:34.320]   think that's it was a Alex's pick i think but it was and it's a good one like it's table stakes right
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:38.880]   and and the question when you this is like sure locking right it's the same conversation which is
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:43.600]   look the big players if there's something that's table stakes the big players are going to do that
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:48.400]   and so you have to build your business on going beyond what the big players are willing to do and
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:54.160]   finding a niche for the people who love it and i i think they tried to do that with Evernote but
[01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:58.080]   i think they had some technical issues and you know for what i don't i don't know enough about the
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:02.640]   inner workings of Evernote honestly i stopped paying attention to it yeah a few years ago i used
[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:07.440]   your religious beliefs for a while but yeah yeah i moved on yeah and i think that for me you know if
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:11.440]   if you're doing a lot across platform stuff i think that Evernote makes a lot of sense for a lot of
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:17.760]   folks i just don't do that you know so i'm i'm you know my my the pcs and the linux machines that i
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:23.520]   have are not part of my pipeline like they i have just as many pcs and just as many
[01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:30.240]   linux machines as i have max it's just that they don't their utilities their appliances to me
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:34.480]   and i don't interact with them on a day-to-day basis as part of my workflow and and because of
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:38.480]   that i don't and if you're all on a pc then you have other things as well so i think that whatever
[01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:43.040]   note did really well was kind of bridge all of these things together and they may still find a
[01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:46.640]   niche that does that i have a feeling with bending spoons it'll be an expensive niche right you know
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:52.000]   like that's the problem one of those things uh Phil said which is true is that Evernote
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:58.320]   did syncing before i-clap before there was a way built-in supported system way to do
[01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:05.200]   synchronization Evernote did transparent cross-platform synchronization yeah and that was there really
[01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:12.320]   that was their secret sauce wasn't it uh they had ocr built-in uh very early on so you could
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:17.600]   take a picture and then have the the text available for search there were some things they did and
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:22.640]   it now are not so special but at the time we're very special and i think one of their problems is
[01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:27.600]   is that that that that i don't know about the other side but apple their notes team is constantly
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:31.600]   making it better it's not like they just have this thing it's like good we have notes they have a
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:35.840]   team that is con- now it could it go faster or there are things features that i want sure like being
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:42.800]   able to draw over top of text. Anyways so um but uh but the uh but overall the problem is is that
[01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:48.240]   product keeps on getting better and surprises me like i i took a picture a weird little things my
[01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:53.280]   daughter knew about my phone of course that i didn't kids know we were taking pictures and i wanted
[01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:56.880]   to look at picture this so i could figure out what kind of tree that was we were out for a walk
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:07:01.120]   and she goes oh no just take a picture with the phone or or a note and you'll just be able to
[01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:06.640]   click on it and i'll just tell you what the plant is. Love that. Love that right and who knew that
[01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:10.400]   was in there like it was like hidden in there and they just keep on adding these little features if
[01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:14.240]   anything apple doesn't tell us enough about what i agree what's in it and i think they don't want
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:18.320]   to put other companies out of business right they don't want to hide right right they leave that
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:23.760]   opportunity to go be on the table sticks right but but like on that level ever note ever note was
[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:27.680]   so early i think that they actually became a victim of like building up their business on ever
[01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:31.760]   note and what they were willing to do and once you become that right then the more nimble competitors
[01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:36.320]   can come in and like you've seen it with notion and obsidian and some of these other like note
[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:41.760]   taking things that are out there on the frontier and and uh you know ever note was a little bit late
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:47.200]   for that and they were minding their own business which i get but like so now you've got apple and
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:50.800]   the other kind of and one note on windows like the table stakes on this side and then you've got
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:55.520]   notion and obsidian and stuff like that they're on the cutting edge on this side and it's you can
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:59.840]   see how the air went out of the balloon we were we were talking about it somebody i forgot who
[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:06.320]   brought up yo jimbo and it made me think of rich seagull andy your your friend rich and uh how he
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:14.160]   has managed to find a somehow survive in this world where every every every operating system
[01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:20.160]   comes with a text editor uh yo jimbo is kind of a a notes he's still selling yo jimbo which is
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:26.160]   awesome uh note no pad ad app how does how do you i mean don't you don't have to speak for rich
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:32.800]   andy but he's managed to find a way to continue forward in a world where everybody else is do
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:38.640]   give it away something similar right yeah i well bb edit i think it's very very clear that
[01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:43.440]   number one that's the way that he runs the company and the way that he supports that product
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:48.640]   it's like it is it is a it is uh Jason and i use it as a text editor just like a lot of people
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:55.120]   use it as a as markdown text editor however it's a developers love it because they know that
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:59.840]   this isn't like a random team of interns who come in and out of the project team right a year after
[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:04.240]   year it's rich is rich rich seagull who's building one of the one of the most historic
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:09.840]   life reps yeah so so he absolutely he absolutely understands what developers are going through
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:14.880]   in addition and part of that is understanding what happens when a developer is relying on a
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:19.520]   tool that's not working the way that they would like it to or there's a feature that they would like to
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:25.520]   add that they would they want to be heard about how about why something something should be word
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:29.760]   there there are so many times in the history of bare bones and this probably were probably overdue
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:34.480]   for having rich on for a second to talk about the state of the state of the state of apple
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:41.360]   development but the number of times where someone has a user has said oh jeez i wish that the i wish
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:45.520]   that you supported like this i'm doing this sort of element of javascript i wish that you supported
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:49.520]   better and said well what kind of development do you do well i do like jobs because what would you
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:54.160]   like do would you like to write us we will pay you to write a javascript plugin that adds the
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:58.880]   feature that you want and these people are continuing to be paid contributors to be be added for years
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:04.800]   and years and years and so in terms of jumbo it's simple he still uses your jumbo so if he's so
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:09.280]   if he's still if he's still supporting it for himself he's like okay we're we're not gonna we're not
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:13.200]   gonna sell a whole lot of units of your jumbo but i'm not gonna i'm not gonna have the whole
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:17.360]   cake to myself i'm gonna let other people like enjoy the cake as well but again the answer the
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:23.120]   and that bare bones is not just britts eagle but that sort of attitude is what makes bb edit it's
[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:28.480]   probably small enough though that he can you know he doesn't have to sell a million copies right
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:34.720]   you know i love his i love being a few birds he's good yeah right i love his uh in in the about us
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:39.040]   section he says we don't have investors to impress so we don't need a mission statement
[01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:44.880]   we enjoy writing and shipping great products that address the needs of ourselves and our customers
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:50.960]   and then and i think he kind of shares my attitude towards marketing because his slogan for years was
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:56.960]   uh bb edit sucks less right yeah if first and first first first first was doesn't suck it doesn't
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:03.040]   suck then it sucks less uh but now it's it still doesn't suck it yeah still doesn't suck it
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:08.400]   it's my attitude towards marketing you know it's so it's such a good app and it is a rare example
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:15.360]   of this but it is a small enough company and rich runs it responsibly and it's got its user base
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:19.120]   and it is people still discover it and it's amazing because you're like oh let me tell you that
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:25.680]   thing's 25 years old but 19 years old 19 yeah 30 years old 30 years old and yet it is come through
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:31.280]   it has come through from being a 68k mac app written in Pascal i think to all the way to being a modern
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:37.280]   mac app and it it changes with the times it updates it stays with it and i i not only write most of my
[01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:44.240]   stuff in it oh gee but i've been learning um last year i learned python and i do all my python work
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:48.800]   in bb edit too it's great and then you you know command shift r runs it and the results come back
[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:54.720]   in a different window and it like it's super uh you know it's super geeky and super savvy for um
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:12:00.000]   any of that stuff so yeah i love it the markdown stuff is great the scripting is great i mean it is
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:05.440]   yeah i always loved this i use it as a terminal sometimes because it remembers what you show worksheets
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:11.680]   yeah so cool uh they remind me of the old mac programmers workshop which did the same thing
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:16.160]   i think that that was probably the inspiration for it right yeah is he doing this in swift yet
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:24.000]   you know or is he still uh co-core i know i think i think he's still basically using using c and x code
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:29.760]   uh to do the sort of stuff i don't think i don't think he's swift averse but i think that i think
[01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:35.360]   that there's still there are not enough benefits to moving the the entire code base of bb edit
[01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:39.600]   a lot of work i think they used it in pieces like there was a big overhaul to their text display
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:43.520]   engine that just happened recently and now they can do things like support ligatures and there was
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:47.920]   that and i think it was motivated by the fact that in ventura there were a bunch of changes that made
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:52.400]   the old text display engine that they had been kind of like we don't need to do it there's no
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:57.120]   benefit and then they you see it ventura and it's like oh well there's a benefit now and then they
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:01.280]   updated to the new one and you get all these new features and i don't know how they built that but
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:05.520]   like that has been their approach is like look if it ain't broke don't fix it we're gonna spend our
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:10.720]   time on the stuff that matters and then if apple sweeps in and goes okay uh this matters now then
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:14.400]   bare bones like great because they're never going to be behind the times they never want to be that
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:18.560]   you you only have you only have a limited you have a limited number of spoons available to you
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:24.160]   when you're trying to get trying to get the get a project out the door and you can't spend all
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:30.320]   them on things basically basically bare bones it's like yeah it would nice to it with you big editing
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:34.960]   would be very cool but how many hours we're going to spend on this feature that only will be appreciated
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:41.120]   not even not necessarily even by andy and jason i think andy might like it jason wouldn't care
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:45.600]   because he's doing markdown all the time versus how much time would they would they appreciate if we
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:50.560]   put that time into again here is a it was what what what are what are people need if they're
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:55.360]   developing for rust what are what is bb edit not doing for rust developers that they could be doing
[01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:59.200]   right now and let's let's help those people instead but that that would be a great conversation to
[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:03.040]   have with rich the bottom yeah everything changes when it would every time every time every time
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:09.200]   every time that but every time that apple does an update and they put request demands or make
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:14.960]   create opportunities for developers how that filters into the manager of a major beloved project
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:18.960]   and how do you implement and how do you roll with that that would be an awesome conversation
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:23.920]   yes a great amount of discipline um here i would also throw james tomsen in there as an example of
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:29.920]   somebody who's been writing max software for twenty five thirty years pcalkin and uh and drag
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:34.000]   thing back in the day right and again it's that same sort of thing james is set up is a little
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:38.400]   bit smaller than than bare bones but it's a similar kind of story where you want how do you
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:43.040]   look at what apple is doing that's new or that breaks the things that you were doing and how do
[01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:48.800]   you navigate that and choose what to what to embrace and what to watch and say not yet like this is
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:53.600]   not yet for us and bare bones has really done a good job and discipline is the word i keep coming
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:58.720]   back to we should mention by the way because there's confusion about this although bb edit has a price
[01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:03.760]   uh when they got rid of what used to be bb edit light and then it was called text wrangler basically
[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:07.920]   there's a free mode in bb edit so if anybody is curious about this because we've been talking
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:13.840]   about it the free mode in bb edit has so many features in it and it won't it won't nag you it's
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:20.640]   not like a useless demo you could use the free bb edit forever and actually be very happy and i
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:24.160]   also want to put in another new feature that they added recently because again 30 year old product
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:29.280]   that keep adding features to it i one of the reasons i started embracing bb edit is for um
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:34.880]   it's for grep it's for pattern matching search correct is great and i bought the the regular
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:40.000]   expressions book from a riley and i learned how to do grep although the bb edit manual has a chapter
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.400]   that i think it's very good grouper i use it as a reference actually it is it is excellent about
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:48.400]   how to do regular expressions and they added this feature called the pattern playground i want to
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:54.720]   say yep where basically you can sit there and tweak your patterns to work right before you run
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:59.920]   them and you can see how they're working and it like is a debugger for search and replace it's
[01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:07.920]   so good and that's a new that's like a 2021 feature so just go to a website and test my grips oh yeah
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:15.040]   i know that website yeah yeah yeah regex 101 uh they've added lsp support if you're a programmer
[01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:20.800]   that's a big deal i guess that's what you're probably my python works so well stuff it pops up if you've
[01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:25.760]   got any mistakes so you don't have to use vs vs code to do your python and that big heavy
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:30.800]   electrode right it's leveraging all the work that everybody did to make the that stuff work with vs
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:35.600]   code and bb edit is like well that is a trend we should we should take now that they do come and
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:41.520]   let's set up i might have to try it i'm kind of an emax guy but boy it sure looks like maybe this
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:48.320]   is the solution i love this uh pattern playground that is a lifesaver it's so good yeah yeah i don't
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:52.320]   know we were just talking about notes and never know and we ended up just i brought it up because
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:17:00.160]   yeah it's just the example of how contrary to ever note of how you keep a product going and maybe
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:05.920]   it's because he's so max specific ever know try to be everything to say everybody and by focusing
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:11.840]   on the mac he's got these loyal people like you two supporting him right go ahead and i think that
[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:16.240]   i i look at this and kind of a generalized thing of you look at like starbucks is a good example starbucks
[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:19.440]   tends to look at like they're not they're not trying to get rid of other coffee shops but other
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:23.360]   coffee shops tell them hey there's a lot of people buying coffee right here right i want to put a
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:27.760]   shop there so they they'll put one you know in my office was within three blocks of my office
[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:33.120]   when i was in san francisco had nine starbucks you know and and in the south side in in pittsburgh
[01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:37.680]   there was a starbuck there was a place called the beehive was the first coffee house in pittsburgh
[01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:44.000]   the starbucks went right across right catacorner big old really nice big starbucks right there
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:49.760]   and uh the beehive just kept getting bigger you just kept on getting bigger and i was talking to
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:53.360]   the owner of the beehive and he and he said he said well what starbucks was the best thing ever
[01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:58.720]   happened to us people find a starbucks they find the starbucks because of of of their look they're
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:03.440]   searching for starbucks in google maps then they look across the street and they see this really artsy
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:11.440]   cool because what he is is he's very much that like he is he is uh the most artsy weird coffee shop
[01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:16.080]   you can walk into i know the red whale have you ever been to red whale coffee and that's nearer to
[01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:21.040]   you you got oh yeah that's yeah it's really good in navada yeah yeah and you just and but you know
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:24.320]   and you wander in and then they just didn't go back to starbucks and so that yeah exactly
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:28.880]   came a feeder exactly because but but what he but what i when i see things like that that really
[01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:33.200]   work it's because you have someone that's passionate running that business that understands where
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:38.320]   their limits are that they're going to solve this one problem but at one as soon as they say oh i'm
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:42.400]   going to try to compete with the big the big folks that are doing it i'm going to be as you said
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:47.680]   everything to everyone that's a super hard place to be we learned that lesson remember we tried a
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:52.720]   bunch of stuff that was a little bit outside of our and people really said no we want news reviews
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:58.000]   and how to that's what we want from twit and so we did the cooking shows and the i did a fitness
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:02.240]   program do you remember that for a while twit fit maybe i just did it because the name sounded
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:07.920]   so good but i mean ice cream yeah we made ice cream and we've really learned that actually sticking
[01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:14.400]   to your knitting and and really serving super serving that audience right that's the way to do it
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:20.640]   uh not try to be this giant conglomerate super super now we should say everyone else not dead
[01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:26.480]   and you just said in the chat and i agree with you Jason bending spoons is probably going to be a
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:32.400]   good caretaker that's what phil felt like uh so it we're we sound like we're eulogizing it they're
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:40.160]   not dead yet it is a reminder just as with twitter that periodically it's a good idea to use the
[01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:44.880]   backup feature to basically have a local copy of everything that you've done there not not because
[01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:50.160]   you not because you not because you think that ever note or apple notes or whatever is going to go
[01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:55.280]   down the tubes and take all your data with it but because you never know when like five years from
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:20:01.040]   now six years now ten years from now maybe this app is no longer being supported or maybe apple
[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:05.760]   changed whatever file system or whatever or now it's now it's on a basis we didn't want to go with
[01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:11.760]   but or maybe you just you just wanted to be able to do a simple like a spotlight search on your
[01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:18.320]   on your file server to find this thing did did i ever like happen to save that draft of that
[01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:22.880]   thing because i know i had notes about it but i don't know that that will save your butt in a
[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:29.200]   million different ways yeah that's why i prefer four uh file formats that are universal yeah and
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:33.120]   i think in a way that's why i didn't like ever note once i exported out of ever note i've kept it
[01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:39.760]   in plaintext or markdown uh because you know that's always going to work and that's plaintext it's
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:47.840]   gonna be readable yeah if if man is still alive in the year 25 25 you know plaintext i think you know
[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:54.160]   bbn could probably maybe not the plaintext bb can probably open ebchadik files i'm bet and
[01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:58.880]   translate it'll open anything yeah right like even if it's binary it'll open it yeah find
[01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:03.360]   a rich it'll open it all right let's take a little break more to come uh our show today they'll
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:09.120]   brought to you by zach doc everybody's these days looking for a doctor but you know how do you find
[01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:15.440]   the right doctor one that takes your insurance but more more to the point one that's going to be
[01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:22.480]   right for you it's funny because when before you book a brunch what do you go over listen i know
[01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:25.920]   i'm thinking about this lately because i'm gonna have saturday's off soon you go over lists and
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:30.320]   lists of reviews you look at all you carefully pick it but why don't you do the same thing when
[01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:34.640]   you're choosing a doctor most of us just go yeah well go ahead and go to that guy because he's
[01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:42.480]   got he's got to sign out with zach doc z o c d o c you can see real verified patient reviews
[01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:48.000]   to help you find the right doctor in your network and in your neighborhood because i mean let's
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:53.280]   face it finding the right doctor is at least as important as finding the best mamosas i'm saying
[01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:59.200]   i'm just thinking zach doc is a free app that shows you doctors who are patient reviewed
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:05.760]   take your insurance and are available when you need them and it's doctors in all areas too by the
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:10.800]   way not just mds with zach doc you can find every specialist under the sun whether you want to
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:16.320]   straighten your teeth fixing achy back get a mold checked out anything else zach doc has you covered
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:21.040]   zach doc's mobile app is very easy to use to search to find and book doctors with a few taps
[01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:24.960]   but the reviews to me that's gonna that's what really makes the difference they
[01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:31.440]   very carefully verify all the patient reviews they make sure they're real people who made real
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:35.920]   appointments who actually saw the doctor and that means you can not only trust the reviews
[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:39.680]   but that's going to help you because the reviews from real people are going to say
[01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:44.000]   yeah this doctor has a great bedside manner or this doctor people have different needs from a doctor
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:49.440]   you know this doctor focused on giving me all the information and making letting me do the choice
[01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:53.840]   this doctor told me what to do because i don't want to think about picking from a bunch of
[01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:58.560]   alternatives that's a very different style so you can find out ahead of time what that doctor
[01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:03.440]   is going to be like so you're all set to see somebody in your network who gets you and who
[01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:11.600]   operates the way you want them to zoc doc doc com find the doctor that fits you book an appointment
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:17.280]   in person or remotely by the way they still do remote yep uh and it works in your schedule too
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:22.800]   every month millions of people use zoc doc they're there whenever you need to find and book a quality
[01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:30.000]   doctor and it's i think this is really this is as it grows has become really the place to go
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:37.280]   to get this information and trusted information to zoc doc com slash mac break the app is free

[01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:58.960]   mac break many of the doctors are available within 24 hours zoc doc dot com slash mac break
[01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:06.880]   you may wonder let's talk about uh soccer and football uh you you get actually a great piece
[01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:12.960]   Jason on MLS and what apple tv's doing with major league soccer uh the we've been waiting to hear
[01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:19.920]   about the other shoot a drop on sunday tickets the last nfl package still nuts sold um the athletic
[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:29.440]   had a report uh saying there's something going on we've talked about this before that maybe apple
[01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:37.040]   wants well for one thing the nfl says you can't show in market games and you can't do it and you can't
[01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:41.440]   put these games international which is silly because the no i mean it's just played in mexico
[01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:44.880]   the other teams play in london and burlaine i mean they want an international audience but i
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:50.080]   guess they want to keep the rights themselves apple right supposedly says no no we want to do that
[01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:59.360]   um it's last december uh roger godel said the nfl is months away not
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:05.920]   days away for many months many months at least a year from selling a stake in nfl media which
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:12.400]   includes red zone the nfl website the nfl network uh maybe apple's bidding for that
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:18.960]   what do you think's going on i i mean i think at the highest level i think it's two companies that
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:24.480]   expect to do um to be able to do what they want right i think like the nfl expects that everybody's
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:28.400]   going to come to them and say you're the best and i think apple expects everybody to come to them
[01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:32.400]   and say you're the best and and now they're dealing with each other and so i think there's a culture
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:38.080]   clash here also and that athletic article did a really good job of explaining this the nfl's
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:42.960]   view of their deals their contracts is you do everything that's in the contract the letter of
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:50.800]   the contract and apple's view of contracts is give us room to innovate right like tell us what we
[01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:57.600]   can't do but don't tell it don't limit us to a list of things we can do and i totally get that right
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:01.520]   apples like we want to innovate we want to figure things out and the nfl's like no no we
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:05.440]   sold you five things you can only do those five things and so there sounds like there's a culture
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:11.440]   clash there i think it's also a little troubling that maybe there was some due diligence issues here
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:16.240]   where apple didn't realize that the nfl already has an international streaming product and so
[01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:21.120]   that's not part of the package the package look i think what's really happening is the package was
[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:26.240]   built for satellite right it was built for direct tv it was built 15 years ago or whatever for a
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:31.360]   different era and apple is bidding on that package now and they're saying this doesn't make sense
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:35.520]   we want to have these other features and the nfl seems to be saying well yeah but this is what's
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:40.720]   for sale and i i wonder whether apple's just trying to push on them saying could you talk to fox
[01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:44.880]   and could you talk to cbs because we want the local games and well we'll stream them with their ads
[01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:49.760]   and it won't be a problem and they're like no no no that's not what the deal is so whether this is
[01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:56.080]   actual like hard negotiation or whether it's a culture clash it is fascinating um this has never
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:27:00.480]   been the best fit for apple because it is an apple broadcasting their own games it's just apple
[01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:06.800]   rebroadcasting uh other companies broadcast putting a little layer on top of it and then also
[01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:11.680]   it's just in the u_s which is not the best fit for apples international ambitions at the same time
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:17.760]   though for people outside the u_s who don't know the nfl is king it is by far the biggest it's like
[01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:24.000]   the number one tv show is sunday night football like it is king and so if you're apple and you want to
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:29.600]   get into sports getting in with the nfl at all maybe becoming their partner on nfl media
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:37.040]   it's a huge thing yeah and then i think that one of the things that um is the challenge is is that
[01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:42.480]   we're really seeing old media versus new media you know so so that you know that we see i i deal
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:49.040]   with this almost on a daily basis which is that that i you know have um you know we have a new way of
[01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:54.400]   doing something and then you're then you cut you collide with old media and this is what this is
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:57.840]   what we have to do and this is the structure and this is what we what we're allowed to you know
[01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:02.880]   this is what we're going to do you know like and it's been ingrained over the last 30 40 50 years
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:08.240]   yeah and it's it's outdated you know we all know it's outdated and we all know that it but they don't
[01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:14.000]   but but stepping away from it's worked up until now and stepping away from it is really difficult and
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:18.480]   the problem for apple is is that they write these these contracts aren't year to year these are
[01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:22.160]   five-year cont i don't know how long this one is but they're often five-year contracts 10-year
[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:25.200]   contracts they only want to do this once and then they want to stop thinking about it for a while
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:31.440]   um and so the mls is going to be it's going to be really interesting to see what apple does with
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:36.800]   mls because it's there it's a place that they can do research they had some they had some scope
[01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:42.000]   they had because mls is not as strong as nfl they had some scope in the steel and i have to say i
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:46.320]   have to point out though because i've been through this a little bit recently leaving the radio show
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:52.480]   so you have an advantage with old media you know you have scope you have reach and so there's things
[01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:58.720]   that but but admittedly i won't be able to do so much more with the same show if it's just ours
[01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:06.240]   in a podcast then i could ever do it with premiere but it's not just like oh kill the old media there
[01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:12.960]   is some value to the old way of doing this and so this is this is tricky i guess because i think i
[01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:18.720]   think you're right it could be a clash when apple is i one of the most most brilliant things they do
[01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:22.480]   about running their business is making sure that they always control their own destiny that they
[01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:28.160]   never have to be beholden to they they told intel to go to get their make and go home you know the
[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:32.400]   biggest the biggest the cpu company in the world because it was not working out for them that we
[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:37.840]   can't control the cpu as well we don't want to be limited by another company's idea of what kind
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:42.640]   of product that they should they should serve to us on the other so it can be difficult when they
[01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:48.480]   are not in a situation in which they can absolutely call the shots because there is absolutely truth
[01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:54.560]   to obviously what alice is saying if i get out to saying it predisposes one to to uh understanding
[01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:58.880]   that yeah there's definitely going to be proof of what i was saying but i was saying we know how
[01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:03.840]   to do this that we've done a pretty good job i'll i'll i'll i'll i'm sorry what i was going to finish
[01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:08.480]   up by saying is that apple has to respect that there is reasons why we do the things we do just
[01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:14.560]   as just as when people say look and apple there is no reason for you not to have an i message client
[01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:19.440]   for android that's stupid you're just you're just doing this dogmatic thing we don't want to
[01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:24.080]   support other platforms where apple will say okay let me explain to you what happens if we decide
[01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:28.640]   to do a my message client for android and you may disagree with it but they have a very good reason
[01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:32.080]   for that and oftentimes i think that when you have an old media company where you have an
[01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:36.800]   established company say there is here is the here is you can you can pull you you might think that the
[01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:40.800]   this this you may think that this is a silly thing on an outdated thing but actually this
[01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:45.840]   outdated thing is also holding up a number of things that are crucially important and the value
[01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:51.040]   that you're giving us by by replacing this does not exceed the service that this thing is is giving
[01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:56.160]   us well for being there and the question is what is the nfl out of apple one out of apple right like
[01:30:56.160 --> 01:31:01.280]   do they want just cash like and that may be what the issue is here is that the nfl is like look
[01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:06.000]   you're depockoted you want to get into sports streaming this is the nfl we're great give us money
[01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:14.400]   and uh or it's possible that what the nfl is looking with amazon or with apple is also a partner
[01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:21.120]   who is going to try to push innovation in their product in a way that maybe the legacy tv networks
[01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:25.600]   won't and that they may learn something from that and i think that there's a clash going on there
[01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:30.000]   too uh potentially it may also be that apple's like no no we want to be that for you and the
[01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:35.280]   nfl is like we really just want you to write the check that's all and and from my experience working
[01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:39.760]   with doing this because i don't know what i do with doing this is i don't think that they actually
[01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:44.960]   want apple to innovate too much like i think they really want the check because the problem is is
[01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:48.640]   i get into situations where i'll show someone how to like we can do all this great stuff and then
[01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:53.760]   they go oh we don't want to do that because once we open that once people once the audience sees that
[01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:58.400]   they can't go back and now we're now we're in we've like we've secured all of our other
[01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:05.920]   apples yeah apple moves to let's say apple took nfl to high frame rate hdr you know 4k or 8k
[01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:12.000]   and just ran with that the problem would be is that is that you could never go back to television
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:16.880]   you know and so that means that the next negotiation is much rougher than the first one for the nfl
[01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:22.240]   and so nfl the nfl is always evolving the one thing about the nfl is they'll spend years
[01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:27.040]   developing new technologies to make the show cooler and better and everything else but they
[01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:31.440]   want to do it at a certain pace that everything gets kind of pulled along and so i think that they
[01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:37.120]   may actually be resistant i think that that's why the mls has been genius is if apple can get any
[01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:44.080]   toehold in to this process with the nfl and i think the only reason that apple's in the conversation
[01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:50.640]   right now i bet you apple is probably not making a lot of deals like they're like there's probably
[01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:54.720]   apples offering probably so much money that the nfl keeps talking to them but you know like good
[01:32:54.720 --> 01:33:00.560]   so the nfl is like i don't really want to do what apple's asking but the money money money
[01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:06.160]   money because you have to keep in mind pot of gold that apple's handed them you know because
[01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:10.160]   this is like a scratch on the surface of roger godel who has to do this or do they have to get the
[01:33:10.160 --> 01:33:15.440]   owners to approve it yeah get the owners the broadcasters the partners yeah it's a it's a big
[01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:19.760]   huge consortium of everybody going wow i think we have to keep in mind somebody in the chat room
[01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:22.720]   was asking why doesn't the nfl just do this themselves to make their own streaming service and the
[01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:26.320]   answer is they have their own streaming services called nfl plus how do you like it has different
[01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:31.120]   things in the u_s and now overseas and all that the reason this is not just let's not do sunday
[01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:37.280]   ticket let's wrap it up and put it in nfl plus is apple or amazon will overpay for it more than
[01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:41.600]   it's worth in order to get people onto their ecosystem and that is what the nfl wants to take
[01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:45.520]   advantage of just like how direct tv overpaid for it so that people would put satellite dishes on
[01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:49.280]   their roof right because it was the only place you could get it and once they're on the roof
[01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:52.960]   well then they're going to be your tv provider and you're going to cancel cable probably right
[01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:58.400]   that's the idea and so i agree it would be way simpler if the nfl just absorbed sunday ticket
[01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:02.800]   into nfl plus but they're not going to do it as long as there's a big pocketed company out there
[01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:06.800]   like amazon apple who will pay and in the end i think what will probably happen is that either
[01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:12.480]   apple or amazon will finally just say okay uh... will write the check i think apple's just trying
[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:19.200]   to get the nfl to budge a little bit and do a little bit more for them i but it's unclear
[01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:23.840]   it's not the like i said it's not the best match because it is us only it's not the best fit but it
[01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:28.080]   does get you in the door with the nfl and amazon's already in that door and the same as some
[01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:32.640]   monomingly frustrating is the is the blackouts like just the you know like from a from a very
[01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:36.160]   perspective someone doesn't live in petzburg but as a petzburg stealer fan even this year
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:42.800]   still a petzburg stealer fan um the uh is that i just want to watch the game and and then you're
[01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:46.560]   just like i'll pay for it like i would call it ten dollars to watch the game like the court cutter
[01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:53.040]   premise it the killer so like the stealers were on uh local tv for some reason in the bay area
[01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:58.400]   it was so grand i was i was like i thought to myself i literally within a minute so the
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:03.280]   doubt dallas was just crushing the vikings and that was the that was the game that was on youtube tv
[01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:06.720]   and i thought to myself i was watching it it was playing on one of my screens and while i was working
[01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:10.960]   and i i thought man i just want to see the third and fourth quarter of the stealer game i just
[01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:16.000]   want to see this game and literally i can you not within within within 30 seconds it just popped over
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:20.880]   the billion it was like you dilly had bailed so so this is what i'm pointed so if you're a fan of a
[01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:25.120]   team let's say that's the stealers the problem with the way it's architected right now is if you're
[01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:29.920]   if you are watching that game locally on fox and you're a court cutter so you can't get it there's
[01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:35.440]   no way for you to get it other than a uh vmpb and over the top uh streaming service you can't
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:39.440]   if you're uh if it's on cbs you could get paramount plus and you would actually be able to see it but
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:45.600]   fox hasn't done that and this is the frustration here right is like uh i want to watch my freaking
[01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:51.120]   local game and like how do i do it and even with sunday ticket you can't do it you can't do it because
[01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:55.600]   you know and and that's why i think what apple is saying is like look this product doesn't make
[01:35:55.600 --> 01:36:00.160]   sense because of all the blackout restrictions we need to take them off remember this is the
[01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:04.960]   like there's there's so many stakeholders there's the locals there's networks there's cave box would
[01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:11.920]   have to be a feline right yeah and and i know this just from 20 years ago at tech tv you can't piss off
[01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:19.600]   the the incumbent stakeholders by embracing a new stakeholder and so this is very delicate of
[01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:25.360]   course the nfl wants to move into the future but they have all these stakeholders they have to i
[01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:30.960]   didn't even think about this it's you have to appeal to every single individual owner every
[01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:36.080]   it goes all the way down to all the way down to the to the local ads being run by cable networks you
[01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:40.480]   know that are there because they get a certain number of local ads during during even the super
[01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:45.440]   bowl and during a football game and you know my brother pays you throw it into a lottery he
[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:50.640]   pay he has a gleeve golf course outside of pisburg and so he throws bird's foot um you know like uh
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:55.280]   ads into the lottery and sometimes they show up on a stealer game and suddenly they said like at
[01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:59.520]   the at the this is what gets back to traditional media like we think that online is really cool
[01:36:59.520 --> 01:37:04.640]   but when it hits a stealer game he says the phone just rings as soon as you put it down so just
[01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:08.720]   you know just like this incredible or full but it's and it's five dollars when you get it right
[01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:14.320]   it just happens everyone's a lot and the and the other thing is that uh those of us in this
[01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:22.720]   conversation we love the we we might even have like 4k HDR 120 frames per second screens but you
[01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:26.560]   also have to make sure that when you're talking about a popular sport you also have to make sure
[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:33.840]   that that sport is enjoyable by someone who basically has a 720p screen that they got for 10 dollars
[01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:37.920]   off a craigslist and that's not hard i mean that's not i mean that's not a hard thing because we send
[01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:43.680]   it we're sending you all of those resolutions when we you know when we hls is i mean apples hls
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:50.800]   solves that problem by i can give you everything down to a 360p or 240p you know image um in a
[01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:54.560]   the last you have to think about the graphics right you don't want graphics you can't read on that
[01:37:54.560 --> 01:38:01.440]   image you know we still design graphics around 360 by 640 by 360 so we look at graphics can i
[01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:07.680]   mostly when we do it we design them around a 640 by 360 can i read it at that resolution and if
[01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:11.280]   i can't read it at that resolution oftentimes there's a bunch of discussions about whether
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:15.840]   what does amazon prime do on thursday night do they care about that stuff or do they know they're
[01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:20.960]   gonna be on high res yeah yeah they definitely care definitely they're gonna pay attention if you
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:27.200]   have to say though watching the world series on 4k even though it was upscale 1080 really looked
[01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:33.760]   great and you see when it looks so nice you see when it's 4k and when it's 8k like the like baseball
[01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:40.960]   i i've been able to see baseball at 8k 120 frames per second on a on an 80 inch screen and it is
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:46.000]   there it is as if you were there like it's like you're looking at a window and you you there's
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.640]   part of your brain that wants you to know now the teams are saying but that's going to hurt our
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:54.480]   ticket sales yeah the ticket sales for for the film that's what's hurting that's what's hurting
[01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:58.800]   ticket sales it's like it's like it's like racing well and again that that depends on the on the
[01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:02.720]   team it depends this gets back into the relationship management of each of every team like the you
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:06.560]   know the the Steelers is a good example they're sold out for a decade right they're not you know
[01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:12.080]   like you can't you can't everybody's in the open they have five fans in the stands so you know
[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:15.920]   and that comes from you start moving your team around you make a lot of bad decisions you're gonna
[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:20.320]   do a bunch of things and it's hard to get hard to get my tickets so you wrote a good article Jason
[01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:25.040]   about Major League Soccer in fact i didn't even realize this look at this the st. Louis Soccer
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:30.640]   Club the St. Louis City have uh apple tv logos on their jerseys and they only debuted that because
[01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:35.280]   they're a new team but every single MLS team so we talked about this you know billions of dollars
[01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:39.600]   that apple is spending over 10 years with MLS but it's not just to get the broadcast although they
[01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:43.120]   are doing that they're going to be a shirt sponsor they're going to be on the sleeve of every single
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:48.640]   team in MLS um they're going to have this whole package the the athletic did a very good story
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:54.320]   again about their them and MLS trying to put together their broadcast teams and and how they're
[01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:58.400]   going to do it they're they're reunifying their schedule around certain days so that like instead
[01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:02.720]   of it being all over the map because broadcast partners like uh and Alex and we'll about this
[01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:06.720]   too but like ESPN like if they don't have a slot for you on Wednesday night and you say well the
[01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:11.680]   whole league plays on Wednesday night and Saturday and and ESPN's like yeah we really want that game
[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:17.040]   on Monday you can't say no basically you can't say no to your part broadcast partner but now that
[01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:22.080]   apple has a hundred percent of the games they're kind of simplifying the schedule around Wednesday
[01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:27.520]   and Saturday with uh uh some in the evenings and then like a saturday afternoon and a sunday afternoon
[01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:32.240]   game and they're they're building it all together so it's really interesting to see it all
[01:40:32.240 --> 01:40:37.120]   kind of come to fruition it is all the experts quoted are like this is happening really fast
[01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:42.640]   they they're a little bit behind where they should be but they're getting it there and uh we got
[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:47.840]   some details about like the pricing you don't have to be an apple tv plus subscriber to buy this
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:53.120]   package you just have to have access to the tv app apple tv plus subscribers will get a 20 dollar
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:56.880]   discount if you're a we already knew this but like i think it's really cool if you're a season
[01:40:56.880 --> 01:41:02.240]   ticket holder you get it for free if you're a season ticket holder of an MLS team you get the
[01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:06.400]   package for free you can watch your team on that and they're going to put the local radio for the
[01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:12.160]   home team as a second audio option which is kind of interesting and they're also being very ambitious
[01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:17.120]   every game will be in english and spanish and also any game involving a canadian team will also
[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:22.240]   have a french audio track so they're really trying to make this thing uh you know pretty
[01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:26.320]   sophisticated because this is the first thing that apple is going to be doing where they are
[01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:31.680]   actually directly involved in the production because they're majorly baseball stuff is sort of
[01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:36.480]   uh out outsourced to end the network this is a perfect kind of demo to other leagues exactly
[01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:41.120]   this is what could happen it is yeah it is it's going to be their calling card yeah it is really
[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:45.360]   it's going to it's going to improve their there but it's also just going to push the envelope really
[01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:50.160]   hard it's going to be i think that it's going to be very hard for other networks and other uh
[01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:54.240]   sports to keep up because apple doesn't have to negotiate with anybody anymore they don't have to
[01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:57.920]   figure out what truck we're going to use they're building i think all the facilities for these
[01:41:57.920 --> 01:42:02.960]   shows are being built for the ground up to support this network it's not they're not using you know
[01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:08.160]   legacy almost anything and so the hard part is is that everyone's going to look at that and if you
[01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:12.320]   start watching those games and you know apple's able to add all the stuff so much faster like once
[01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:18.400]   you get you know when you're trying to do live streams of existing events it's kind of like them in
[01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:23.280]   in the movie contact when that when that chair is held to the is bolted to the ground and you're
[01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:28.000]   she's just vibrating really hard and like everything hurts and as soon as it just as soon as it shears
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:32.240]   off of it's off of you know and you're not and you're no longer connected to the terrestrial
[01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:37.520]   legacy you uh you suddenly things get smooth and you can move really fast and so i think that and
[01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:42.000]   the fact that apple got it not for a year or two years but ten years by the end of those ten years
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:47.200]   it's going to move all of sports coverage forward you know because they can and it's going to be
[01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:51.120]   really difficult for it's going to hurt a lot for everybody else because they're trying to figure
[01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:56.080]   out all these deals we just talked about and all these terrestrial tv stations it may destroy i
[01:42:56.080 --> 01:43:00.480]   mean i've been thinking about this a lot it may destroy watching it on terrestrial tv because
[01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:04.880]   everyone's going to have to try to keep up and they're going to see this coming anyway right
[01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:09.120]   that's coming it's coming but it's just that it it could hang out for a long time so this like
[01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:12.400]   you know like they can they could drag this out for a long time and why are you spending so much
[01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:18.800]   time talking about sport but um if you look what david stern did to the nba which was really a
[01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:25.520]   ratty down and out sport until david stern came along and figured it all out and made the nba the
[01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:34.480]   multi-billion dollar enterprise it is globally uh these there is so much money in this is why uh
[01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:40.640]   it's just why they're playing in mexico city on monday night you know and there were 80,000 fans
[01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:46.240]   watching that in mexico city it was amazing they had es the best part though is they had espn
[01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:53.040]   deport's announcer do uh a touchdown play did you see that yeah oh my god that's fine
[01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:59.920]   i mean it was like a soccer match it was great i want to see that guy from nylp
[01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:05.280]   yeah and the thing is just like al michaels will ever do it like that but well it's one of the
[01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:08.960]   few things that you can put ads into because it's live like people understand oh we have to have a
[01:44:08.960 --> 01:44:13.440]   break because they're taking a break you know usually they get the ads between things they don't
[01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:16.720]   go in here that's the problem with football by the way where do you hell do you put the ads in
[01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:21.680]   soccer well in soccer it's hard but in american football it's really easy and you know and and
[01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:26.400]   what they do is they go well they're they're gonna punt the ball and then some guy with an orange
[01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:31.360]   sleeve comes out and just i know the guys wait a little longer until we get this done you go to a
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:36.160]   game live you see these guys they have these big orange sleeves and they're on the field and they
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:42.400]   go stop we're running in ad now yeah at the college football games now they have he holds just a
[01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:47.120]   stick that's got the the countdown timer for when he had it over so he comes walking out with 230
[01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:51.040]   and then you mentioned terrestrial i will say one of the brilliant things about the nfl strategy
[01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:58.000]   here all along has been this immutable kind of rule which is if your local team is playing
[01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:04.640]   it is on your local tv station it is on a local broadcast tv station and that is immutable if you're
[01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:10.160]   on monday night espn can have the exclusive but if you're on monday night you're also on a local
[01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:15.040]   channel channel if you're on thursday night on amazon yep you will also be on a local channel in those
[01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:21.920]   two markets even though it's exclusive yep it's not because the local market will always get it and
[01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:26.880]   that means that people with over the area antennas or just people with cable and nothing else never
[01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:33.120]   miss out from their local team and that is yep it's so smart and yes it's in the contract which is
[01:45:33.120 --> 01:45:37.680]   why apple is is fighting against that and and that they're not going to win because they're not
[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:41.600]   going to restructure those contracts couple of other quick stories before you get to your picks of the
[01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:47.600]   week vm where fusion is now following along with parallels adding windows 11 virtualization on
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:52.880]   apple silicon don't know why you'd want to do that you still can't use an official you have to use a
[01:45:52.880 --> 01:46:00.320]   beta version of windows 11 for arm and for some reason microsoft is not made that anything but beta
[01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:05.680]   but the the suspicion is they've got an exclusive deal with qualcom and they can't
[01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:12.400]   and i don't know how long that's gonna that's gonna last a really good article if you want to get
[01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:21.520]   super geeky in bite seller bite seller dot com a secret apple silicon extension to accommodate
[01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:31.120]   an intel eighty eighty artifact so rosetta two in some cases actually runs intel software faster
[01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:42.000]   on apple silicon than it does on intel emulation is faster and so this is worth reading i probably
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:49.760]   gonna butcher it so i won't go into too great a detail but uh there there is a reason for it
[01:46:49.760 --> 01:46:57.680]   and they've optimized uh the arm architecture to take it on apple silicon specifically
[01:46:57.680 --> 01:47:04.160]   to take advantage of of it and it's and it makes a big difference it's really quite fascinating
[01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:09.760]   it's like a mode that in in arm you would need multiple instructions in order to do this because
[01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:15.040]   it's reduced instruction right you know right but intel intel doesn't a different way than arm and
[01:47:15.040 --> 01:47:20.240]   so it's like oh well on arm this is five steps on intel this is one step and apple put in their
[01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:26.880]   chip not at their rosetta level but in the chip if you're running rosetta it enters this mode where
[01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:32.720]   it's one step and that and that is only something that you do because you are designing the chip and
[01:47:32.720 --> 01:47:39.440]   you're like you know what we really could use here is an intel compatibility mode for rosetta where
[01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:44.640]   the processor doesn't have to work five times as much for one step and uh i love that somebody found
[01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:50.240]   this i love that somebody at apple did this yeah and i love that there is some really weird esoteric
[01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:56.480]   design decision made decades ago by intel that everybody still has to account for and and i got
[01:47:56.480 --> 01:48:00.720]   to say that you know i keep on talking to developers about at the m1 and they just they just keep on
[01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:06.000]   talking about how you just keep on stripping away like if you keep on writing to it um you know
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:10.800]   whether it's rosetta or but when you're when the folks that are writing to it directly um there's
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:17.040]   a lot of talk among developers of like writing only m1 you know like you know that that's the
[01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:22.320]   you know because it's just so much faster and trying to do things in between um you know doesn't
[01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:26.000]   take full advantage of the chip you know and that's the you know that's the thing that i think we're
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:29.840]   in the performances that we're seeing on some of the stuff is just outrageous it's also the secret
[01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:35.840]   sauce because apple apple's making their own and they're making rosetta two they can build into
[01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:42.960]   silicon a switch for rosetta two that means that your intel emulation is faster on apple silicon
[01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:48.080]   than it is on intel it it's going to be really hard i mean i i'm very curious to see how the intel
[01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:54.160]   side of things evolves because um it's just so hard to do what apple's doing you know when you're
[01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:58.560]   right when you're building the chip and building the o s and building the you know all in the um
[01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:04.240]   you know the developing platform it it's super hard to it's super hard to compete with that
[01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:08.960]   it's usually something you would tell people not to do yeah because um you know and because it's so
[01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:15.440]   hard to do it and to maintain it and apple at scale can do it and that that's like a you know a
[01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:19.680]   three thousand pound you know elephant that can run like a cheetah you know and that's what i think
[01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:24.800]   has everybody a little scared it's it's it's a difficult it's a difficult thing to manage too because
[01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:32.960]   we we we forget that uh mecha wes is ten percent if that of the of the desktops in the world
[01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:38.080]   intel has intel and uh and the other makers have to basically satisfy the rest of the world that
[01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:43.760]   aren't necessarily motivated to buy a max specifically they just need a computer or even worse they need
[01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:48.720]   a thousand copies of a computer that that are built to an exact specification meaning that we
[01:49:48.720 --> 01:49:54.320]   don't want to i'm not gonna we don't want to spend an extra extra four dollars per unit on on
[01:49:54.320 --> 01:49:58.640]   graphics performance we don't actually need this high-level ram cache we just need someone who's
[01:49:58.640 --> 01:50:02.960]   going to be connect to our connect to our servers run our run our remote software
[01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:07.680]   so as it does that that's we're buying a thousand copies of the cpu a thousand copies of this computer
[01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:11.760]   why are you trying to why are you trying to tell us how well you can do live streaming with it when
[01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:16.320]   nobody uses this is going to do that so this this is why that the the wonderful stuff that
[01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:20.240]   something gets people really really excited is almost always going to come out of apple because
[01:50:20.240 --> 01:50:25.040]   apple apples they're they're they're they're making the postal the the the ups truck they're
[01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:31.040]   making the the the u_s postal service jeep they're not making like the really really cool cars that
[01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:36.320]   are exciting to drive and push the needle forward uh swift keys back what
[01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:44.720]   okay microsoft which bought the uh keyboard uh which was very big on android in fact i think it
[01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:48.800]   was one of the first keyboards i used it did swiping swipe was the first but yeah he was a second
[01:50:48.800 --> 01:50:53.920]   uh and then at microsoft pulled it from ios and now it's back so i just thought i tell you
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:51:03.360]   i don't who knows why or what is going on uh in redmond but there you have it uh and do you
[01:51:03.360 --> 01:51:14.880]   want to see quake running on an apple watch do i you do well good news this is insane you use the
[01:51:14.880 --> 01:51:19.440]   stem and the buttons to control look there oh here we go here we go
[01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:24.960]   even this even the nine inch-nail soundtrack
[01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:36.880]   okay there you go um i don't know why you'd want to but you can't no no does the watch give you
[01:51:36.880 --> 01:51:42.480]   a accelerated heart rate warnings and wow you're in a noisy environment warnings uh good question
[01:51:42.480 --> 01:51:48.160]   you do by the way have to supply your impact but uh one of the things that's really cool is it's
[01:51:48.160 --> 01:51:55.920]   on github so if you decide to hack your apple watch please let us know watch quake the quake one port
[01:51:55.920 --> 01:52:01.520]   for apple watches somebody got it running on the touch bar i mean you can run on anything i mean
[01:52:01.520 --> 01:52:08.480]   it's you know so and there's the menu controls just so you know turn to scroll tap to confirm tap
[01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:13.040]   and hold the go back change value with the menu sliders in game controls swim up some
[01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:17.040]   they're all there it's so silly it's totally playable
[01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:26.080]   uh let's see oh i wanted to warn people i got all excited because i am a fan of home brew i think
[01:52:26.080 --> 01:52:34.240]   anybody who uses a mac knows about brew which allows you to install um unix style applications
[01:52:34.240 --> 01:52:40.000]   command line applications even actually binary applications from the command line uh on a mac
[01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:44.480]   almost mac users use it there are other choices like mac ports which is older and
[01:52:44.480 --> 01:52:49.520]   nix which is cross-platform but the guy who designed home brew 13 years ago and has been out of
[01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:54.960]   the project i should point out for many years max howl has decided to do a blockchain crypto
[01:52:55.600 --> 01:53:06.000]   nft version of uh home brew called t get it nft i sat down and i thought oh that's exciting he's
[01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:11.120]   gonna solve a lot of these the idea was how do we monetize these open source projects as everybody's
[01:53:11.120 --> 01:53:16.800]   building on but nobody's paying for it i thought well that's his his hearts in the right place
[01:53:16.800 --> 01:53:25.120]   as soon as i started to install it i thought you know no no so um i guess i'm mentioning it i'm
[01:53:25.120 --> 01:53:36.320]   giving him some publicity t.xyz but i as i would be a little careful about uh sh curl ht tbst
[01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:42.640]   xyz don't do it it seems like we'll watch with the great interest i love them i love the idea
[01:53:42.640 --> 01:53:51.760]   uh but i don't know if this is the uh the answer to it uh sad story from a verge uh column columnist
[01:53:51.760 --> 01:53:58.480]   michal clark apple changed away how reading books works in ios 16 and i may never
[01:53:58.480 --> 01:54:06.480]   be happy again um there used to be as you may remember a lovely little curl animation
[01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:11.760]   that you depending on where you swiped from the page would be different and look there's even
[01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:19.600]   text backwards text underneath the page um and now he says uh as far as i could tell the
[01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:25.120]   experience is completely gone in ios 16 replaced by an animation that wouldn't feel out of place
[01:54:25.120 --> 01:54:35.760]   in a tinder ripoff or a pdf viewing utility app oh this speaks a man in pain yes i always i
[01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:40.720]   always think about it i always think about it in the future someone's gonna be like what's that
[01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:44.000]   at atembooke you know what does it do you read it you know and then then they're like and then
[01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:48.640]   then when they turn the page they're like is that what that effect goes remind me i know what that's
[01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:53.200]   more like why did that need it i guess it's skeomorphism and they don't i don't know why they
[01:54:53.200 --> 01:54:58.160]   would take it out but uh it's cool it's really cool sometimes skeomorphism is just cool it's
[01:54:58.160 --> 01:55:04.480]   like a lot of work in it that that's not trivial whimsy right it's whimsy whimsy it doesn't yeah
[01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:08.800]   it doesn't it does because it's not just a oh he's doing a swipe so i'm going to do an anib i'm
[01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:14.080]   gonna do uh render an animated like page curl effect it's no just it just as you saw in that video
[01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:18.480]   like if you like slide your finger around it's like you're lifting the page and you can basically
[01:55:18.480 --> 01:55:24.560]   curl it in different directions so they want to make sure that if you if you if you drag slightly
[01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:30.640]   from like lower lower right to slightly above to the left it will make sure that the that the page
[01:55:30.640 --> 01:55:34.400]   like curls in exactly the right way instead of like curling in a way that wouldn't work it's like
[01:55:34.400 --> 01:55:40.640]   that that is someone who basically said that you know what if it takes if i have to stay up a little
[01:55:40.640 --> 01:55:46.720]   late an extra three days to make this work awesome i think i they're paying me for awesome they're
[01:55:46.720 --> 01:55:52.240]   not paying me for just okay they're not paying me for kindle they're paying me for i books yeah
[01:55:52.240 --> 01:55:57.920]   oh well they just you know it should just be an option like you can go to the
[01:55:57.920 --> 01:56:02.480]   state where the preference is like making an easter egg like hidden yeah that's a hidden thing
[01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:10.720]   uh yeah skeomorphism on uh i don't know if i should worry about this or not uh the chinese government
[01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:17.760]   is so worried about the iphone factory the fox con iphone factory uh slowing down because of covid
[01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:24.080]   they've they've asked the military to step in off officials in central china have tapped this
[01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:28.160]   from the new york times have tapped the government's vast network of party members
[01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:35.360]   civil servants and military veterans to help fox con they've called on them to quote respond to
[01:56:35.360 --> 01:56:43.200]   the government's call and aid in the resumption of production um i guess i don't know i think that
[01:56:43.200 --> 01:56:47.520]   this the issue that they're seeing and and what's happening is there's a lot of companies especially
[01:56:47.520 --> 01:56:52.720]   apple are starting to regain their leverage you know they are they are able to they're basically
[01:56:52.720 --> 01:56:56.880]   they're opening they're talking about opening stuff in the united states in brazil and india
[01:56:56.880 --> 01:57:01.920]   vietnam they're starting to spread out and china can't afford for this these are like little
[01:57:02.560 --> 01:57:07.360]   little leaks in the front of the dam yeah that that that as you know and i think that they're
[01:57:07.360 --> 01:57:11.200]   i think china is starting to see that those little leaks are starting to lead to cracks
[01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:17.360]   and if that falls apart you know it it really undermines china china's already you know they're
[01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:22.080]   already top heavy population wise they've got a whole bunch of other financial issues and if they're
[01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:26.080]   if they start getting to run away you know companies moving away and what's good for
[01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:31.840]   this is especially good for taiwan because china just can't afford to shake this that that nest too
[01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:36.640]   hard because it's part of why all these companies are moving out but being you know i mean even
[01:57:36.640 --> 01:57:43.600]   tim cook is saying you know being geologically or geographically constrained is not optimal i
[01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:48.080]   think is what he said you know so so i think that china is trying to make sure that everything that
[01:57:48.080 --> 01:57:52.720]   they do everything they can to try to hang on to these companies because they're starting to see real
[01:57:52.720 --> 01:57:57.440]   movement and i think it has more to do with taiwan than then the spactory stayin open to be honest
[01:57:57.440 --> 01:58:01.040]   i think everyone looked at you crane and just went who if this happens in taiwan we're in big
[01:58:01.040 --> 01:58:05.840]   trouble and so so i think that it has more to do with taiwan but i think everything matters to china
[01:58:05.840 --> 01:58:10.640]   at this point they're in they're in a lot of trouble in fact digitized says apple's turning
[01:58:10.640 --> 01:58:16.720]   to sam san for memory in the iphones out of south korea so yeah they were going to buy them from
[01:58:16.720 --> 01:58:24.080]   yang sie memory technologies in china um they're going they put them on hold and they're going to
[01:58:24.080 --> 01:58:28.000]   a sam san and this is this is actually because of the us government's ban against trading
[01:58:29.200 --> 01:58:33.280]   chips with chinese suppliers yeah it's getting harder and harder on a lot of different fronts

[02:03:39.440 --> 02:03:45.280]   picks of the week let's start with Jason Snell pick of the week i am going to pick uh it's a flight
[02:03:45.280 --> 02:03:50.640]   tracking app it is the best i think flight tracking app uh it's not cheap but if you travel a lot
[02:03:51.200 --> 02:03:57.440]   oh it's worth it it is called flighty it's actually free if you're flying your first flight is free
[02:03:57.440 --> 02:04:01.760]   in general but it's free for november 22nd and 23rd so if you're going somewhere thanksgiving
[02:04:01.760 --> 02:04:07.200]   yeah you can try it out it is uh it's not new but they've got a bunch of new features and most
[02:04:07.200 --> 02:04:14.560]   impressively recently they supported the um the live activities view and a live activities view
[02:04:15.120 --> 02:04:20.320]   means that you can get these amazing little um amazing little pop-ups on your lock screen
[02:04:20.320 --> 02:04:28.240]   that detail the status of your flight and i i did a a link about it at six colors um it is
[02:04:28.240 --> 02:04:33.680]   it's so good because it will tell you like it'll be in the dynamic island if you've got an
[02:04:33.680 --> 02:04:39.520]   iPhone 14 pro it'll show you where your gate is it shows you where you are in reference to like
[02:04:39.520 --> 02:04:42.960]   when it's taking off or when you're on the flight it'll tell you how long it is until you land and
[02:04:42.960 --> 02:04:48.000]   you're saying to yourself well how does it know that like if you're in an airplane mode because i'm not
[02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:53.360]   on the airplane Wi-Fi and ryan jones who is the developer of flighty pointed out something very
[02:04:53.360 --> 02:04:57.600]   clever which is if you're ever on an airplane and it's one of those things where you have to pay for
[02:04:57.600 --> 02:05:02.400]   Wi-Fi but you can get on their free Wi-Fi to like watch tv and they say free messaging you can get
[02:05:02.400 --> 02:05:07.840]   i messages too without paying if you say yes to that here's the twist that you may not know which is
[02:05:08.480 --> 02:05:13.120]   you won't just get i messages all of your push notifications come by the same path
[02:05:13.120 --> 02:05:22.000]   and live activities are updated via push notification so flighty and anyone else down the road like
[02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:27.760]   sports apps anybody else that uses uh live activities even if you're on a plane and you're not paying
[02:05:27.760 --> 02:05:33.200]   for Wi-Fi if you have one of those sort of Wi-Fi's that a lot of airlines offer where you get i
[02:05:33.200 --> 02:05:40.480]   message covered uh you will get your live activities updated live because they're all coming through
[02:05:40.480 --> 02:05:46.400]   essentially invisible push notifications so uh that's a fun little twist on what is already a pretty
[02:05:46.400 --> 02:05:51.520]   great app you know it's not cheap it's fifty dollars a year they have an eleven dollar sort of flexible
[02:05:51.520 --> 02:05:58.480]   limited family plan but if you travel a lot um i mean there is no better app that i have tried
[02:05:58.480 --> 02:06:02.960]   for this kind of flight tracking you can choose how detailed you want it to be about like is your
[02:06:02.960 --> 02:06:09.120]   gate changing uh is the is the flight changing is the the plane changing it'll let you know that
[02:06:09.120 --> 02:06:14.080]   let's you know when the flight plan has been filed and what it is there's a lot of stuff in there
[02:06:14.080 --> 02:06:19.360]   and they like trip it in some of these other places they'll let you uh forward your flight
[02:06:19.360 --> 02:06:25.040]   information to an email address at flighty and it automatically gets added to your list of flights
[02:06:25.040 --> 02:06:30.720]   lots of great stuff great app and if you're uh if you're traveling for Thanksgiving on a plane
[02:06:30.720 --> 02:06:37.680]   you could try it out for free wow i love the live activity thing it's really good it looks great
[02:06:37.680 --> 02:06:43.440]   would it be going to be a dynamic island if it yeah yeah there's another look um the you know the
[02:06:43.440 --> 02:06:48.240]   big one is is live activity on the lock screen but it also will go in the dynamic island and i was
[02:06:48.240 --> 02:06:53.280]   recently traveling and it actually showed me i looked down in my home screen while i'm unlocked
[02:06:53.280 --> 02:06:59.360]   and in the dynamic island there's a little yellow uh you know gate c22 and a little arrow saying that
[02:06:59.360 --> 02:07:03.200]   that's where you need to go which is pretty awesome so yeah it's good there it is there's
[02:07:03.200 --> 02:07:09.600]   the dynamic island in there preview wow that is really sweet 50 bucks though yikes it's not cheap
[02:07:09.600 --> 02:07:14.160]   you got to be a real serious traveler who cares about this stuff although like i said they have a
[02:07:14.160 --> 02:07:18.800]   like they have a reduced family plan sort of thing for 10 bucks a year i think that is pretty good so
[02:07:18.800 --> 02:07:24.160]   give it a try as soon as i start flying somewhere yep sounds worth it thank you Jason
[02:07:24.160 --> 02:07:29.040]   andi and i go pick of the week uh two quick ones because we're talking earlier about like having
[02:07:29.040 --> 02:07:34.080]   all kinds of different like wall plugs wall warts and like not knowing which one is ghost to which
[02:07:34.080 --> 02:07:42.400]   and so i got this tip from the adam savage uh on the tessa channel uses this wonderful it's
[02:07:42.400 --> 02:07:48.720]   called the press the presto jumbo correction pen by pentel to label things like in his shop like
[02:07:48.720 --> 02:07:53.840]   drawers and stuff like that and i discovered that it is like the perfect thing for like labeling power
[02:07:53.840 --> 02:07:59.120]   supplies and stuff like that because it's it's technically a correction pen but it's not this
[02:07:59.120 --> 02:08:05.040]   chalky stuff it's actually a very very hard wearing uh enamel white paint uh that that goes on nice
[02:08:05.040 --> 02:08:09.600]   and thick you give it you shake it's you have a ball you gotta give it a shake you gotta squeeze
[02:08:09.600 --> 02:08:13.680]   it a little bit to get it started and then uh you just write the stuff and there's no
[02:08:13.680 --> 02:08:18.160]   mistake in that uh and they're not expensive either they're like four and a half dollars each and i
[02:08:18.160 --> 02:08:23.600]   have a whole bunch of them because again the you need to you need to mark something permanently on
[02:08:23.600 --> 02:08:29.680]   on on dark stuff i also i also do have well you can you can tell like exactly where i was in a certain
[02:08:29.680 --> 02:08:36.480]   project i do have some of adapters that do have like a brother like p touch like nice fancy label
[02:08:36.480 --> 02:08:42.240]   on it but that was conditional upon my knowing where the p touch was making sure that it did
[02:08:42.240 --> 02:08:47.040]   have a hard trip in it like typing it up like dip dip dip dip dip dip dip dip dip rolling it
[02:08:47.040 --> 02:08:53.520]   up and putting it on correctly rest this is just blurt blurt great good it's labeled that's
[02:08:53.520 --> 02:09:00.960]   that's that's all i need yeah so the so pentel pentel uh presto it's like one of those things
[02:09:00.960 --> 02:09:04.800]   where i bought one then i bought lots more uh but the other they call it they call it a
[02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:10.720]   correction pen what are you correcting you're typing uh i the fact that it would mark anything
[02:09:10.720 --> 02:09:16.720]   as a correction pen i mean what is what it is correcting it's uh it's not like when you're typing
[02:09:16.720 --> 02:09:22.720]   yeah it's what like there's many other and it's quite uh maybe or maybe it's just such a limited
[02:09:22.720 --> 02:09:26.960]   product that's like they that's like you know what i mean a thousand of them in 20 years ago and
[02:09:26.960 --> 02:09:33.200]   they still have them see i i'm thinking that like we're making such a low margin on these to redesign
[02:09:33.200 --> 02:09:38.800]   the label and like retool the the assembly plan for different label i mean i see i
[02:09:38.800 --> 02:09:44.560]   as far as a correction pen goes i think that if i had one in my pocket and i was in one of the
[02:09:44.560 --> 02:09:49.280]   situations where i see one of those lines where when one of those signs where they put like the
[02:09:49.280 --> 02:09:54.720]   corrective uh postory s when the apostrophe was not necessary i would go all right let's
[02:09:54.720 --> 02:10:00.240]   let's just let's just get rid of that shake sound i like that shake sound yeah that's good it's
[02:10:00.240 --> 02:10:04.640]   it's pretty nice yeah that's that's how you know it's like some serious paint that has to be mixed
[02:10:04.640 --> 02:10:10.800]   up correctly in order to work um it's also it's also on safe kids that's called it's a joskey
[02:10:10.800 --> 02:10:15.440]   for friend it's called it's called the presto the next combination correction
[02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:22.560]   ech jumbo p m exclamation mark i do they have it on amazon i i'm i already are yeah i ordered
[02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:26.880]   you i ordered you and you can buy but i think i think i think i think this is this is this is this
[02:10:26.880 --> 02:10:32.240]   coincides with your interest health once i think you if you are like i think for you for office hours
[02:10:32.240 --> 02:10:39.120]   you should get the 12 pack uh you can uh you get 12 of them and that brings the price down to
[02:10:39.120 --> 02:10:44.080]   two dollars and sixty six cents each which is not bad guess guess what everyone's getting for
[02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:51.920]   christmas office hours this year a correction pen wow thank you what am i correcting mr lensy
[02:10:52.640 --> 02:10:57.760]   uh i will enjoy this on my trip back to 1973 i could sign up for subscribe and save i'll get
[02:10:57.760 --> 02:11:03.280]   i'll get 12 every three months even better even better boy they somebody must really run through
[02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:09.120]   these well you know it saves you it saves you like time and money like let's say you have a pair of
[02:11:09.120 --> 02:11:13.360]   black shoes but you're playing tennis oh you can just you know use up on these markers and
[02:11:13.360 --> 02:11:17.040]   congratulations now you're ready for a sudden course only stands for a song about that i think
[02:11:17.040 --> 02:11:22.960]   i see a black shoe and i want to paint it well Alex lensy your pick of the week
[02:11:22.960 --> 02:11:27.280]   so my pick of the week just came out um last week and i was really surprised that it actually
[02:11:27.280 --> 02:11:34.720]   shipped last week as well um this is knobs knobs you got it oh i'm so jealous so this is the
[02:11:34.720 --> 02:11:40.000]   stream deck and i wanted to kind of grab this so you can see it this is the this is the kind of
[02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:44.800]   the smallest stream deck but all the minis and the older ones have been six i've been about this size
[02:11:44.800 --> 02:11:49.200]   you one of the things that i noticed was how much bigger this one was and the actual buttons are
[02:11:49.200 --> 02:11:54.480]   bigger as well and so um so basically this is a stream deck it still has the same program ability
[02:11:54.480 --> 02:12:00.240]   you've got eight buttons on the top you've got a scribble you know strip here so you can actually
[02:12:00.240 --> 02:12:06.960]   oh i can't right now because i'm in the zone and then i'm in but um but basically um you can you're
[02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:12.240]   seeing that this is actual like RGB parade you know being driven back into that but you have but
[02:12:12.240 --> 02:12:16.480]   now you have these little knobs and so you can turn them you know um you can turn a lot of this
[02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:21.600]   stuff you know that's round and all now this one's set up right now for resolve and so if i hit like
[02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:26.960]   the edit page you know it's going to change you know um to what i need for the edit page right
[02:12:26.960 --> 02:12:33.200]   you know i can go back um there's a lot of i mean there are a lot of tools you know that are there
[02:12:33.200 --> 02:12:38.480]   you know so there's a here's a jog it's just usb so you you must be running the stream deck software
[02:12:38.480 --> 02:12:44.560]   on your computer must be running the stuff exactly you're running the stream deck software on your
[02:12:44.560 --> 02:12:50.080]   computer now what i did here is i bought i bought this i didn't make it i bought it i bought a whole
[02:12:50.080 --> 02:12:56.480]   collection of stream deck um profiles that will run nine different pages you know this yeah there's
[02:12:56.480 --> 02:13:01.520]   a it's probably a whole nother pick but there's a company like i was like oh this will take a lot
[02:13:01.520 --> 02:13:07.840]   of programming and it turns out that there is a um company that i can't think of the name of the
[02:13:07.840 --> 02:13:12.080]   company right now because it doesn't have the list it doesn't have their name on the thing um
[02:13:12.080 --> 02:13:18.320]   anyway the side show effects makes these for lots of different software um so uh this is side show
[02:13:18.320 --> 02:13:21.680]   effects and they they have like nine different profiles that are all the different things you need
[02:13:21.680 --> 02:13:26.320]   for resolve they have a premiere and final cut and lots of other things and so they just came out with
[02:13:26.320 --> 02:13:30.800]   them as well for this stream deck and so i just loaded them all in and they all work now another
[02:13:30.800 --> 02:13:35.440]   thing that you can do is this opens up all kinds of possibilities of changing volume uh scrolling
[02:13:35.440 --> 02:13:40.240]   through things moving your edit windows all these other things and this is what we really wanted to
[02:13:40.240 --> 02:13:45.040]   see these knobs for quite some time and so being able to have the knobs there as well as this great
[02:13:45.040 --> 02:13:51.280]   little um you see you can see as i as i scroll through here these top ones are um you know actually
[02:13:51.280 --> 02:13:56.480]   changing you know so i can just go to a different pages by scrolling across there um and then these
[02:13:56.480 --> 02:14:00.400]   you know again these are like you know just little you can see me making some adjustments here
[02:14:01.200 --> 02:14:08.320]   and so it's pretty it's pretty nifty you know it's it's a um it's a big jump forward it really feels like
[02:14:08.320 --> 02:14:14.480]   they they did really well stream deck in my in the world that i'm in like everybody has at least
[02:14:14.480 --> 02:14:20.880]   one if not a couple um and people run whole shows on them and so they've the problem has been really
[02:14:20.880 --> 02:14:25.040]   that the buttons were a little small there wasn't quite enough travel and we didn't have any uh we
[02:14:25.040 --> 02:14:30.160]   didn't have any knobs that we could that we could affect uh volume or scroll through things and
[02:14:30.160 --> 02:14:35.520]   everything else and this is fixed a lot of those things um and um i was able to part i bought it
[02:14:35.520 --> 02:14:40.160]   last week it came three days later like i was expecting well they said three to five days but
[02:14:40.160 --> 02:14:44.400]   i think it probably will be three to five months you know because it's just a just released and i
[02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:48.480]   you know i i don't i bought it on their website and it was it was there you know it just showed up 200
[02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:54.960]   bucks so it's not cheap but uh boy yeah and i think they're initially that this was these are aimed at
[02:14:54.960 --> 02:15:00.000]   like twitch streamers right but yeah it was really aimed stream deck really built up all of elgato and
[02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:07.280]   corsair who owns elgato really focused on the kind of online creator slash um the streamers and
[02:15:07.280 --> 02:15:12.480]   really built up around streamers and what's happened is that that a lot of professionals
[02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:16.800]   started using this and especially they use the stream deck software there's also another
[02:15:16.800 --> 02:15:22.000]   software called companion which is really the heavy duty version this is what most professionals
[02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:28.640]   are using are not the stream deck software profiles they're using companion um to um uh so that's
[02:15:29.200 --> 02:15:35.280]   the um so when when you start tying into companion you have very complex interactions between
[02:15:35.280 --> 02:15:41.120]   your hardware and so what's happened i think is that more professionals are getting into it and
[02:15:41.120 --> 02:15:45.840]   they're starting to serve that market that's why we have more tools bigger buttons in fact they could
[02:15:45.840 --> 02:15:50.400]   probably double this price and give us even better buttons with more travel and people would probably
[02:15:50.400 --> 02:15:53.920]   buy it you know like you know like you know like in my world because it was just like we just
[02:15:53.920 --> 02:15:58.000]   wanted to be we wanted to work and every time you push it it's going to work and everything else and
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:01.920]   but i will say that um it's uh i'm waiting for the logic one to come out because i do a lot
[02:16:01.920 --> 02:16:06.800]   editing logic and so i'm audio editing logic that's why i do the podcasting and and um i'm really
[02:16:06.800 --> 02:16:11.600]   looking forward to you know being able to make that all work but anyway it's how are the knobs they
[02:16:11.600 --> 02:16:16.000]   feel good they're pretty good i mean they're not free flowing so that you know i'm used to like
[02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:20.400]   really high quality knobs that don't have notches on them that that are just that are really high
[02:16:20.400 --> 02:16:27.120]   uh you know the kind of knobs on a lot of stuff i use are very high resolution so these aren't the
[02:16:27.120 --> 02:16:33.760]   same resolution as those um they're they're probably my guess is um they're uh indent every
[02:16:33.760 --> 02:16:38.480]   five degrees or ten degrees somewhere in that range um so it's you know you feel it turning
[02:16:38.480 --> 02:16:43.920]   and it's very specific because it has to send out those commands um but but overall i think it
[02:16:43.920 --> 02:16:50.080]   does feel like the fit and finish of it feels much better than um streamdicks in the past so so it's
[02:16:50.080 --> 02:16:56.000]   anyway it's uh it's a really good update and i think i'm hoping that we're gonna see more and more
[02:16:56.640 --> 02:17:02.560]   professional tools from them oh we use bit focus companion with our zoom iso and a stream deck
[02:17:02.560 --> 02:17:08.720]   i didn't know just i think i i think that's pretty recent i think that's that's you doing that the
[02:17:08.720 --> 02:17:14.720]   not me only thing was Andy i think Andy Andy uh came in and was like we saw a few of uh zoom but then
[02:17:14.720 --> 02:17:21.200]   i think john is absorbed it extremely quickly and he was in on sunday he started liminal which zoom
[02:17:21.200 --> 02:17:27.680]   bought and uh zoom iso has been this show for the first time ever i think right entirely on zoom
[02:17:27.680 --> 02:17:31.440]   iso and it feels much better i don't know if it i don't know if you can feel it i know i can feel
[02:17:31.440 --> 02:17:38.160]   it my picture is better sounds better uh you guys don't um the latency's gone so much down that we
[02:17:38.160 --> 02:17:42.160]   don't have people interrupting each other by accident it's really big it's a big improvement
[02:17:42.160 --> 02:17:46.400]   yeah it's really good took us a little while to dial in because we have such a weird audio chain
[02:17:46.960 --> 02:17:53.200]   uh but but we got it all working thanks to Andy john slanina our studio manager Russell Tammany
[02:17:53.200 --> 02:17:57.520]   who is our incredible IT guy uh he figured out how to get the software working we got a really good
[02:17:57.520 --> 02:18:03.200]   team team here so yeah that's cool and thank you of course Alex for suggesting it in the first
[02:18:03.200 --> 02:18:09.200]   point i'm just pointing people in the right direction yeah Alex Alex says besides office hours i kind of
[02:18:09.200 --> 02:18:14.320]   remember to plug gray matter which is a pot you said the podcast this is uh this is a podcast you
[02:18:14.320 --> 02:18:21.120]   do with uh michael krasney long time uh radio hosted san francisco and npr um does great interviews
[02:18:21.120 --> 02:18:27.680]   some amazing people i mean the quality the people you're getting it's it michael krasney's oh he knows
[02:18:27.680 --> 02:18:34.000]   everybody right yeah i mean i mean if you i mean we i mean it's it's kind of an a crazy uh uh
[02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:38.960]   uh a crazy thing when you say we're gonna talk to who you know like you know like it's it's it's
[02:18:38.960 --> 02:18:43.680]   it's so um it's pretty it's pretty awesome and the conversations are so good i mean you're
[02:18:43.680 --> 02:18:47.680]   i think a lot of us aren't used to listening to podcasts where you have someone who's literally
[02:18:47.680 --> 02:18:55.520]   done 10 000 you know 10 000 uh interviews you know 10 000 interviews asking questions and it's just
[02:18:55.520 --> 02:19:00.160]   very it's a very uh a smooth thing we had you on which was great it was fun and uh love doing that
