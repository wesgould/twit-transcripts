[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   He's back from Africa, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Mr. Alex Lindsey.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Wait a minute, I don't have to say it.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   I can sing it.

[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Hey.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Hey, Alex Lindsey, good to have you back.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Welcome.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   It's great to breathe.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   - Oh, you're in Africa. - Yeah, yeah.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   We won't do that the whole show.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Yeah, no, no.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   It's great to be back.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   It's good to be back.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Look, right?
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   I can't believe you flew in last night.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   I flew wide, drove in last night.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   I flew to LA and then drove up with my wife.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   She was with her family.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   What are you nuts?
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   She requested it.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Well, whatever.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   It's needed to have Carly the once because she's the boss.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   So, but, um, had a great time and saw a lot of technology in Africa.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   I can't wait.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   We'll hear all about it in a second.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   I also want to welcome Mr. Andy Anotko.

[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Hey, Leo.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   We're right here at Ernie Bach for Lincoln, Mercury, and boy,
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   this, if you haven't come down here yet today for your Memorial Day,
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   you're really sure we're going to be broadcasting all day long with free
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   blues and hot dogs, kids.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   I've done that.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Bring the--
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Bring the all lady in the pit slip.

[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Come on down.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   The hot dogs are hot and the deals are hotter.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   I swear to God, I've done that.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   I've done it.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   I did it at a carpet store.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   That was the most depressing point of my DJ career.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   I did it at a mall.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   A carpeteer.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Give a lot of the carpeteer.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   And, uh--
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.800]   We're only here for another 45 minutes, but you're going to get your
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.800]   shows up because who wants to see a DJ on a telephone?
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.800]   No one.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.800]   And if you're not buying carpet, and, of course, the owner is standing
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.800]   there breathing down your next thing.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.800]   Where is everybody?
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.800]   Right.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.800]   The salesman said that thousands would show up.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.800]   Well, and it depends on the market.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.800]   I mean, you know, there are-- any given market I know in Pittsburgh,
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.800]   there was, like, one radio station that if they showed up,
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.800]   it would-- half of Pittsburgh would show up.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.800]   Right.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.800]   But that was--
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:14.800]   If Howard Stern goes somewhere, people show.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.800]   Exactly.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:16.800]   Not Leo Laport.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.800]   Yeah.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.800]   I think he's going to get a lot of attention either.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.800]   Well, give it to Carve Terek.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.800]   May I help you?
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.800]   Yeah.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.800]   So, uh, golly, it's one of those times when you wish you didn't have
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.800]   to do a show because, really, we're in the lull before the storm.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.800]   All the news is about Google and, uh, and, um, a little bit about
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.800]   Microsoft.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.800]   And everyone's just complaining.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.800]   And everybody's waiting because the big, big story for us is next
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.800]   Monday, this Monday.
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.800]   That's correct.
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.800]   W.W.D.C. Steve Jobs says you won't be disappointed.
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.800]   I'm not-- I'm not-- I-- I-- I realize I was thinking about it.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.800]   I didn't feel like I-- there's not that much I needed new for my iPhone.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.800]   So I don't think I will be disappointed.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:57.800]   Well, good.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.800]   You're right.
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.800]   We already know it ain't going to be much new in there.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.800]   Unless-- Andy, you have something you'd like to add.
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.800]   I have nothing I'd like to add.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.800]   Love it.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.800]   Love Andy and not go.
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.800]   All right.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.800]   I said I loved you, Lately.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.800]   Yeah, but you know what?
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.800]   I can never hear it enough, Leo.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.800]   My mother, by the way, is in studio today.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.800]   She's the silent fourth in this show.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.800]   You can't see her because no camera is pointed at her, but, uh, she
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.800]   loves you, Andy and I go.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.800]   And she says, "Come on over for a home-cooked meal any time."
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.800]   Your mom is about nine pounds of adorable and a six pound sack.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.800]   She's quite wonderful.
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.800]   You got her.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.800]   You know it because you met her on a cruise.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.800]   I forgot.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.800]   Yeah, no, it was the most-- it was like really one of the most
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.800]   adorable things I'd ever seen because she was making you a sweater.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.800]   But she didn't want you to-- she wanted you to be surprised.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.800]   So you had to close your eyes while she was like holding it up
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.800]   against you and like sort of measuring it.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.800]   Crisis.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.800]   You guys have a good memory.
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.800]   Dang.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.800]   So Steve Jobs is going to be on stage at D8 today, the D Conference,
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.800]   Cara Swisher and Walt Mossberg's conference.
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.800]   So he might say something not.
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.800]   Yeah.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.800]   Only an email.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.800]   I think it's pretty savvy actually.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.800]   It's a good way to kind of--
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.800]   I think it's very savagely--
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.800]   At least he's taking control of the message.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.800]   Right.
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.800]   And knowing Steve, it's got to be him, right?
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.800]   Katie Cotton, Apple's PR person is a messenger, but she's
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.800]   messaging only his input, right?
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.800]   Yeah, I mean it seems like it.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.800]   I mean, when you look at the-- you can almost hear him say it
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.800]   when you see the stuff going through there soon.
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.800]   So I guess--
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.800]   We could just wrap the show up right now.
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.800]   I don't know what to say.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.800]   We could talk, we could speculate.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.800]   There have been rumors.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.800]   Well, it's more like trying to figure out why would he schedule
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.800]   such a high-profile talk just one week before he's going to have
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.800]   an entire stage to himself?
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.800]   And I think it will be interesting to see where he puts that
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.800]   sort of dividing line between these are things that I can talk
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:16.800]   about with my good personal friend, Walt Mossberg,
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.800]   whom I'm quite the buddy with because I'm just one of those
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.800]   regular guys who likes to pail around with journalists all
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.800]   time to--
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.800]   And what stuff will he keep close to the vests for next
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:30.800]   Monday?
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.800]   I hope they ask him about La La.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.800]   The other shoe dropped on La La yesterday.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.800]   We knew they were going to shut it down.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.800]   But the question is, why do they acquire it and what are they
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.800]   going to do with it?
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.800]   This was a streaming music service.
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.800]   I think that there's also an opportunity for him to continue
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.800]   his campaign related to-- he can talk more about the I-Ads.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.800]   He can also continue his campaign about why Apple's not
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.800]   supporting Flash and unified--
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.800]   That's what it's going to be.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.800]   I think that's him who stay on message.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.800]   Because that's a great platform for him to continue making his
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.800]   argument, whether people buy it or not.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.800]   Because it's a place where he needs to be getting that stuff out
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.800]   in the form of a conversation with another person as a human
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.800]   being, as opposed to on the mountaintop.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.800]   No, you're not going to get up on the stage with me.
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.800]   No, you're not going to get the microphone away from me.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.800]   I'm going to give you these pronouncements.
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.800]   And then I'm going to walk off and never see me again.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.800]   And it's a fairly safe place for him to do that.
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.800]   You know, given the people who are--
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:26.800]   Oh, yeah, they're not going to challenge him.
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:27.800]   Yeah.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.800]   With all due respect to Karen Walt, they're not going to challenge
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.800]   him too much.
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:32.800]   Right.
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.800]   I mean, they'll ask him the obvious questions that are related
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.800]   to that subject matter, but they're not going to dig into it
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.800]   too hard.
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.800]   That's always the issue with getting these great interviews,
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.800]   these great scores.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.800]   Because, you know, if Steve Jobs are sitting in this chair,
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.800]   he's not going to do it unless he knows it's going to be a safe
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.800]   place.
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.800]   And if we wanted to get him back, we know we--
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.800]   or maybe even just keep him from walking out, we can't challenge
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.800]   him too much.
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.800]   It's very tricky.
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.800]   Yeah.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.800]   And--
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.800]   Yeah, well, I mean, that's why you really can't even think of
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.800]   that.
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.800]   Every time that you get something like that, you have to figure
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.800]   that this is the last time you ever get an opportunity like this
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.800]   ever again, because after that, you have control of what happens
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.800]   while they're there in front of you.
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.800]   You don't have control of what happens after they walk away.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.800]   Right.
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.800]   So while you have control, take advantage of it.
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.800]   Just like streaming, you know, an iPad launch or something like
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.800]   that.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.800]   I figured when you're there, you're there.
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.800]   If it's on my last time, I might as well go out with a bang.
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.800]   Let's take a little break, come back with more.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.800]   I think I'd like to speculate, and there are new rumors coming
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:36.800]   out.
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.800]   We don't-- we know surprisingly a lot about the iPhone thanks to
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:40.800]   Gizmodo.
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.800]   Although, I think there is a good chance that Apple might have at
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.800]   that point shifted gears and said, well, that's not going to be
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:47.800]   the prototype we're releasing.
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:48.800]   I don't know.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:49.800]   That's maybe--
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.800]   Yeah, or we just don't know, like, what-- we know some of the
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.800]   hardware features, but we don't know how well it works with
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:55.800]   software.
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.800]   And remember, iPhones are all about the software that they write.
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:58.800]   True, true.
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.800]   The host organism for software.
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:00.800]   True, true.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.800]   And we know a little bit about 4.0, but we haven't really seen it in
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:03.800]   action.
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.800]   For instance, I have a lot of questions about the multitasking.
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.800]   I mean, I know I can run Pandora, but what else can I do?
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.800]   How else can I run in the background?
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.800]   Is it full multitasking, or is it more pseudo-multitasking?
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:14.800]   Things like that.
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.800]   So these are all questions we'll get answered on Monday.
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.800]   But I have a question to answer those of you who are wondering,
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:21.800]   they come up to me all the time.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.800]   You know, Leo, where can I go to create a wonderful website?
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.800]   Easy to use, beautiful, not looking like any other, and yet
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:30.800]   affordable.
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:31.800]   Where can I go, Leo?
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.800]   And of course, the answer I always give them is squarespace.com,
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.800]   the place to go for beautiful websites.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.800]   I do, I mean, actually I'm being a little facetious when I say this,
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.800]   but I do, in fact, send people to Squarespace all the time.
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.800]   It's a secret behind exceptional websites.
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.800]   And you can try it free right now.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:56.800]   If you go there to squarespace.com/macbreak, no credit card needed.
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:57.800]   Just sign up for an account.
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:58.800]   You'll get two weeks.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:02.800]   You can import all the data from your existing WordPress or moveable type
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.800]   or type header blogger site.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.800]   So you can see really what a site's going to look like.
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.800]   You don't have to, you know, it's not a dummy site.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.800]   This is going to be what your site will look like.
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:14.800]   Take a look at the squarespace iPhone app, the stats package, the great templates.
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:18.800]   You start with the template, but then you can customize it beautifully.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.800]   I do suggest setting up a photo gallery.
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:21.800]   They're gorgeous.
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.800]   Go ahead.
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:27.800]   Anybody who's getting started and wants to build a website for your business
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.800]   for your personal blog or any of those things.
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.800]   It just is the simplest, quickest way to put out something that looks great
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:34.800]   and works well.
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.800]   Steve Gibson broke my heart because he'd already set up his WordPress.com account.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.800]   I said, "Steve, Squarespace, what are you doing?"
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.800]   He said, "Well, I already set it up."
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.800]   I said, "Steve, you're breaking my heart.
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.800]   Breaking my heart, Steve."
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.800]   But he said, "I don't want anything that looks good."
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.800]   If you know Steve Gibson, you know that that's probably true.
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.800]   Steve's not looking for design.
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:59.800]   He wanted something that he could, you know, and the iPhone app, by the way,
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.800]   works incredibly well.
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.800]   I think it's the best blogging app out there.
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:07.800]   I just love it because I have a couple different, you know, most of our sites now
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.800]   are the front page sites are all Squarespace.
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:15.800]   And so I can log into any one of those and make adjustments separately from my iPhone.
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.800]   And every Squarespace site looks unique.
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.800]   And that's one of the reasons I like it.
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:20.800]   Here's one of their examples.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.800]   Journey of the universe.
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.800]   Look at this gorgeous site.
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:29.800]   If you know CSS and JavaScript, of course, the sky's the limit.
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.800]   But you don't have to.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:32.800]   You can get great looking sites.
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.800]   Very simply, take a look at some of the examples.
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:35.800]   It's just amazing.
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.800]   And then I strongly encourage you at least give it a try.
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.800]   If you decide to buy, very affordable.
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.800]   They started $8 for the basic site.
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:49.800]   And you'll get 10% off for life if you use the coupon code MACBRAKE.
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:53.800]   Squarespace.com/MacBreak.
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:58.800]   Great site start with Squarespace.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:02.800]   So shall I dignify these rumors?
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:03.800]   Of course.
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.800]   We got nothing else.
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:10.800]   Looking forward to seeing Steve Vomrude, you know, Katabana across the stage?
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.800]   That rumor I don't think is going to happen.
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:14.800]   In fact--
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:18.800]   Well, because Microsoft actually Twitter, like, no, we're not doing that.
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.800]   Yeah, I don't know where you are.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:25.800]   If I saw him there, I'd be looking to make sure he doesn't slip on the ice that's forming below him.
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.800]   We talked about it on Windows Weekly because that's when it leaked out.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:33.800]   And Mary Jofoli, who was on Windows Weekly last week, was one of the bloggers who repeated the story.
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.800]   And they tweeted while we were on Windows Weekly.
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.800]   They tweeted, "No, no."
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:40.800]   What do they say?
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:47.800]   Something like, "No, Steve Vomrude is not going to be speaking at WWDC, nor is he entering the World Series of Play.
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.800]   I mean, they like they--
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.800]   It's not going to be on Dancing on the Stars.
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.800]   It's not going to be Dancing on the Stars.
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.800]   It was pretty clear.
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.800]   That was about the clearest denial I have ever seen.
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:02.800]   I think it's a clearest indication that there's really so little going on on the Internet in the past couple of weeks that--
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.800]   I mean, after--
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.800]   There's so little to speculate about before E3 that just got to fill the time.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:09.800]   Any crappy rumor?
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:10.800]   It's good.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.800]   Well, it's good for traffic, you know.
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.800]   Well, and, you know, Mary Jo even said, you know, it's not credible because--
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:21.800]   She said every Apple keynote is so choreographed, minute to minute to minute.
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:22.800]   Ed Bot said this too.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:33.800]   He said, "That's why the iPhone's also in 942 in the packaging and stuff because that's exactly when the first screenshot of the iPhone appears in the keynote."
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:41.800]   And he said, "There's no way Steve Vomr is going to sit backstage and wait till his appearance at, you know, whatever it is, 927.
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.800]   He's just not going to do it."
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.800]   So there's no way they can do it.
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:49.800]   And I think that rumor is clearly not true.
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:14:06.800]   Although, remember Bill Gates did appear on Steve Jobs' first keynote when he came back and gave a whopping $150 million to Apple and the promise that this is in 1997 that they would continue to make Microsoft Office for Apple.
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:11.800]   And now, ladies and gentlemen, Apple is bigger in market cap anyway than Microsoft.
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:12.800]   There's only one company left.
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:13.800]   Exxon.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:18.800]   And at the rate that they're growing, Apple will pass Exxon possibly by the end of the year.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:19.800]   Definitely right next spring.
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:25.800]   Now, we should point out that this is market cap, which is merely outstanding stock shares times the stock price.
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:26.800]   It's all hype.
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:31.800]   It's BS because it doesn't even include privately held shares like Bill Gates has.
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:32.800]   So we don't.
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.800]   I mean, it's not a meaningful-- but it's bragging rights.
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:36.800]   And it gets you some price.
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.800]   Oh, it's just stupid.
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.800]   It's logo recognition.
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:46.800]   It's, hey, the color of my shirt is barely the color of your shirt because the color of my shirt won more games last year.
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.800]   It's stupid.
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:15:03.800]   If we weren't all that concerned when Apple's stock-- about the reflection on the quality of their products from the stock price was at 12 and 3/8, anybody who's particularly proud of this or thought that Apple was in any sort of financial trouble a month ago before this happened is just-- it's a non-story.
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:04.800]   Yeah.
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:05.800]   Two non-stories down.
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:06.800]   That's definitely an ethically--
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:07.800]   Yeah.
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:13.800]   That's something ethically-- it would be a story if I could ethically purchase Apple's stock and could have purchased it back in one of his 12 and 3/8.
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:14.800]   Yeah.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:18.800]   But because I'm in my ethical high chair, I can say that this is a non-story.
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:19.800]   Yeah.
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:20.800]   No, I agree with you.
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:21.800]   I mean, it's crazy.
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:31.800]   Of course, you make the mistake of showing your wife that you-- there's a little website called Market Talkercy, and you invested in Apple with fake stock at 13.
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.800]   You bought it at 13 with fake stock?
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:34.800]   Yeah.
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.800]   I bought a lot of it at 13 with fake stock.
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.800]   And my wife constantly reminded me, "We just put real money into that.
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:40.800]   We could have bought a house."
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:41.800]   Oh, my wife does the same thing.
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.800]   I say, "Honey, I cannot buy Apple stock.
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:44.800]   I'm trying to cover Apple.
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.800]   I can't have Apple stock."
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.800]   Well, my wife asked why I don't buy any stock.
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:52.800]   I'm like, "Well, because the only industries that I know are the ones that I'm on shows about it."
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:53.800]   But I can't--
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:54.800]   That's really true.
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:55.800]   It's really true, isn't it?
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.800]   It's kind of frustrating.
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:58.800]   Yeah.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:05.800]   Here's an interesting rumor, and I think this might be credible that Apple TV will be revved possibly on Monday.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.800]   It's an iPhone box.
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.800]   It's basically an iPhone.
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:10.800]   A big old iPhone.
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:11.800]   It'll burn TV software.
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:15.800]   Very limited storage, because everything will stream.
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:16.800]   I'm there.
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.800]   Would it run apps?
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:19.800]   I guess it would.
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:29.800]   I'll tell you, the only thing that makes me wonder is, how do you deal with resolution when you have a version that runs on a 46-inch?
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:33.800]   As we all know, iPhone apps on the iPad are far from satisfactory.
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:38.800]   If you do that, you add a third screen dimension now, which is not desirable.
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:39.800]   Yeah.
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:40.800]   That's the part.
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:41.800]   Android developers have to live with that.
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:42.800]   Yeah.
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:43.800]   It's not fun.
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:50.800]   I guess you just really have to get smart about building these apps that are a mixture of--
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.800]   I guess you'd build it almost for an iPad.
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:58.800]   You'd almost build an iPad-like application, and it would probably run fairly well on your large screen.
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:02.800]   Andy, do you have an opinion of this idea of a streaming Apple TV?
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.800]   We all use and liked Apple TV when it came out.
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:06.800]   I don't know if we still use it.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.800]   Do you still use it?
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:08.800]   Yeah.
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:21.800]   I mean, I was having conversations with people, and there's the number of us who had Apple TVs, surprisingly high, the number of people who had Apple TVs that were unplugged or just in storage was almost like one to one.
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:23.800]   People are actually still using for something.
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:30.800]   It's the perfect design for a HDTV computer as the world existed in 2003, 2004.
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:34.800]   It is not the perfect machine for how things are today.
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:38.800]   I just got an update to my Roku box that added--
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:42.800]   which used to just stream whatever was already in my Netflix queue.
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:47.800]   Now it adds full menu system, full search, full reorganizing of my queue.
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:53.800]   And now I cannot think of-- I cannot think of what I would do if that thing had a 256 gigabyte hard drive on.
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.800]   I probably wouldn't even use it at all.
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:56.800]   It really is all about streaming.
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:01.800]   I think the thing that would have to really nail is just the ability to get that price down to consumer level.
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:06.800]   If someone is at any store, it has to compete with a DVD player or a Blu-ray player.
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.800]   And Gadget says it's 99 bucks.
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:09.800]   Is that the price?
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:10.800]   Is that the right price?
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:11.800]   No.
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.800]   That would be the right price because the Roku box costs 99 bucks.
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:19.800]   I think that price-- a lot of people can see themselves purchasing that and actually making use of it.
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:20.800]   I think they can do it.
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.800]   It's an A4, a flash, 16 gigs of flash storage.
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.800]   You're not storing much on here.
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:26.800]   Right.
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:33.800]   And that's very, very similar to the architecture of Google TV, which has a small amount of local storage that's pretty much just for user settings and installing apps.
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.800]   It's not for installing content on it.
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:39.800]   But it's big enough that when you're streaming, it will make sure you'll get uninterrupted playback.
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:47.800]   So the question would be, would the next generation Apple TV, even BOGR, having an Ethernet port, are they going to do it all with Wi-Fi?
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:54.800]   The idea of it running iPhone apps, I think it's more-- I think if they were to do it that way, I have no information about this.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:19:02.800]   But if they were to do it this way, I think it would be more like the first generation phone, where all the apps they build for this are built using the standard iPhone development tools.
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:09.800]   But it is-- you're going to have to jailbreak it in order to get third-party apps on it, at least for starters, because it would be such a big problem.
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:22.800]   It seems like a very big problem to figure out how you're going to develop an application, not just for that screen size, but also for the idea that you have this five-button controller and not free and full access to the screen as a user.
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:27.800]   Well, the question is, is will you be able to integrate your iPhone as a controller for your--
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:32.800]   That's what you can do with the Google TV. You can use your Android phone as the remote control.
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.800]   I think that would be a little slaaay.
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:42.800]   I guess, I think that would be probably the solution. And I can see stuff like stuff that I've already played with, like, for instance, playing Scrabble on the home computer.
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:49.800]   I mean, on the home TV with my-- you know with friends where you have everybody's got their little iPhone in there, flipping them with that type of stuff.
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.800]   That's really sexy. Change it dramatically.
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:59.800]   Well, that seems to the definition of the thing. Now you're no longer talking about a consumer device. You're talking about an iPhone accessory.
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:04.800]   Like, no, no, I think that you have something in that iPad Scrabble works.
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:05.800]   I think you could--
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:18.800]   I'm saying that if you're saying that the user interface is going to be presented through an iPhone or an iPod touch or an iPad, now you sort of redefine it to the people who's-- someone who's walking with snorled $100 in their pocket and wanted to get something that will make their TV cooler.
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:25.800]   It's no longer a device. You simply take home and it works. Now it is an excess free for another product that you actually own. You have to have an iPhone.
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:26.800]   Well, what if it does both--
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.800]   --and he-- what if it uses an Apple remote or an iPhone?
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:37.800]   Then that becomes a sort of clumpy situation that Apple generally historically doesn't go for, but, you know, I'm ready to be proven wrong.
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:47.800]   No, I think also when we look at the people who bought iPads and iPads, for instance, I don't know the number, but I bet you that 90% of them had iPhones.
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:58.800]   If not more. You know, like when we look at who bought-- I mean, everybody that I know that bought an iPad had an iPhone, you know, it was not a-- it's a-- you know, they-- I don't think that that would be a problem.
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:06.800]   I don't think that would affect sales that much, at least at the beginning. But I definitely see what you're saying, though. It would be a complex situation as a developer.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:07.800]   I do.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:16.800]   You know, I mean, but the timing is kind of interesting, though. If they were to-- assuming that this is anywhere near a real product, it would be very, very true to form to-- I don't think that it would be a real product.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:31.800]   It would be very true to form to announce the WWDC in June so that when they release it for the holiday buying season in September, there's already apps out there for it, where they would avoid a lot of the mistakes I think they made with launching the iPad without a third party apps or without a really big library of third party apps already to go.
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.800]   Was it a mistake? They've now sold 2 million in two months.
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:35.800]   Yeah.
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:45.800]   No, no, no, they're not having any problems moving them. I'm just saying that the hoof beats are right behind them. You know, time-- everything that-- everything-- every other manufacturer was waiting to see what effect the iPad would have.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:52.800]   But when they've firmed up their own thoughts on a slate-like computer, every single one of them is falling behind Android.
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:22:14.800]   All the ones who got lots of attention at the Consumer-like product show in January, if any of them were using any operating system that was not Android, they're usually announced with either canceling their product or they're announcing that, yeah, you know, Lenovo's saying that they're-- that cool, like, clam show design that has a slate on one side and that book on the other when you remove the slate side of it.
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:19.800]   It stops being a Windows netbook and starts being a slate-- starts being an iPad-like device.
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:25.800]   Now, they said that they're no longer going to use their proprietary Linux on it. They're going to be putting Android on that little slate.
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:40.800]   So everybody's really coming behind Android. And so we have-- Apple has this, like, three, four, five-month window in which they can make sure that by the time any of these devices start shipping, they can emphatically state that, well, here are all the apps you would want to use on a slate.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:49.800]   Here is a kick butt word processor. Pages is very good, but it's not up to the standard that a lot of office users are going to be expecting, same thing with keynote.
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:59.800]   So they're doing really, really well. I just wish that the professional level apps were already not only there, but just emphatically there.
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:00.800]   Right.
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:04.800]   I had to say with a professional, I--
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.800]   You can tell I mean that because I was using my punctuation voice.
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:09.800]   No, no, I--
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:11.800]   And we came to a full stop, actually.
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:17.800]   No, no, I was just going to say that, you know, because pages-- my biggest-- I don't like what pages I heard you guys talking about.
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:19.800]   This one I was gone was the whole rotating thing.
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:20.800]   I can figure out how to get to the menu.
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:21.800]   Thank God.
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:29.800]   But for me, you know, the thing with something like pages is that I don't-- the last version of Word that I actually liked using was 5.1.
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:35.800]   And so, you know, all I needed to do-- I mean, when I write articles, I write them all on text, edit.
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:36.800]   What?
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:37.800]   Sorry.
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.800]   Oh, you finally abandoned right now for Word 5.
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:44.800]   Oh, right now. I miss right now. Where is right now? Bring it back. Bring it back.
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:48.800]   The CEO went on some good things, but, you know, just a stepping stone.
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:49.800]   Tast.
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:50.800]   Just a stepping stone.
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:55.800]   Yeah. I do think that trying to get the stuff to sync still is an issue, you know, getting stuff back and forth to the iPad.
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:58.800]   You know, you want to use it for more and getting data back and forth.
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.800]   I noticed my trip was a bit painful.
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:10.800]   You know, I made this re-- we rule spreadsheet on crops and buildings, and which one's maximized, and I did some calculations a goal per hour, and I put it in numbers, and I imported it back and forth, and you're right.
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:14.800]   It's a pain in the butt. You could do it, but you have to sync it up to iTunes and everything.
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:23.800]   But when you decide you want to start farming, just let me know, because I can tell you exactly what the best buildings to build are.
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:24.800]   Performing?
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.800]   For we rule.
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:27.800]   Yeah.
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:28.800]   For virtual farming.
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:31.800]   So, you know, I'm really trying to stay focused.
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:34.800]   My addiction focus to plants versus zombies and field runners.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:35.800]   Oh, I've already outgrown this.
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:36.800]   And I love field runners.
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:37.800]   The new maps are fun.
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:38.800]   Yeah.
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:38.800]   Yeah.
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:42.800]   I'm just trying to-- it's not-- I just try to keep it focused.
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:43.800]   Well, I'll just give you a little tip.
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:44.800]   My recommendation.
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:45.800]   I don't want to know.
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:46.800]   The tailor shop.
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:47.800]   Just-- that's all.
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:48.800]   Just say that.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:49.800]   I'll just say that.
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:55.800]   I'll just say that.
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.800]   Many people think it's-- Tom Merritt and I have this discussion.
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.800]   He believes it's the dragon's lair.
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.800]   But I have to say, no, no.
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.800]   There's no question in my mind.
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.800]   After doing the careful calculations.
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:13.800]   Now, I only bring that up because it's the first time I've imported-- created a spreadsheet on the-- actually created initially on the iPad.
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:14.800]   I've been round tripping it.
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.800]   You lose a little bit of stuff, but not a lot.
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:17.800]   It's not a perfect round trip.
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:19.800]   And by the way, it doesn't just show up.
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:24.800]   You have to import it and export it each time from the numbers on the iPad.
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.800]   So it's just kind of a pain.
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:33.800]   It's that part, that whole thing of getting that stuff in and out, getting PDFs onto it, getting-- you know, all of those things are things that I think that Apple needs to work on.
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:37.800]   And I think they need to work on them quickly because I think those are the things that I find to be really--
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:40.800]   Well, Andy, you really think that their-- the competition is coming.
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:41.800]   It's breathing out there.
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:48.800]   Well, I mean, they're not silent for-- they're not silent. They're not going to stay silent. They're definitely coming.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:51.800]   It's going on right now in Taiwan at Computix.
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:56.800]   Yeah. Well, see, my big point is just that we still don't know.
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:01.800]   Our people are just Apple selling to 20 million of these because they really didn't get the same sauce going on that device.
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:05.800]   Or is it because there's always been this gap in the computer product line that no one has filled yet?
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.800]   That people want a device exactly like this.
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:14.800]   It's shaped this size, this power. And if someone can build something like that for 150 bucks, that's what then happens.
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:20.800]   My instinct, my instinct really is that Apple did discover a new form factor.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:24.800]   And I do believe an Android-based version of this is going to be competitive.
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:29.800]   I really do. And maybe more so because it'll have a USB slot, it might have a camera, it might do flash,
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:33.800]   it might do things that Apple has turned its back on.
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:40.800]   And the advantage Android has right now, when we say it's selling 2 million units a month,
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:46.800]   that's really chicken feed compared to the 1.8 million Android phones that are being sold every month.
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:51.800]   I mean, it's a lot. It's more than the iPhone sold in the first month or two.
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:56.800]   But it's a different world. And Android, because it's iteration, I talked about this before,
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:02.800]   the fact that they can get multiple new handsets out every few months from different manufacturers,
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:07.800]   that's both a blessing and a curse. And they can update the operating system so much more quickly than Apple can,
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:11.800]   is giving them a leg up in a way that Apple's not seen this kind of competition before.
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:16.800]   Yeah, that's absolutely true. The HTC Evo phone has.
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:20.800]   I don't think it's a great phone. I'm publishing a review of it this week.
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:25.800]   But it does have the advantage of it has this really cool big screen that's much bigger than iPhone's screen,
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:30.800]   but still small enough that it will fit in a well-any man's pocket in any rate.
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:35.800]   And it really is just bigger enough to make it a really big step forward.
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:40.800]   And Apple would have to really make a both really, they'd really have to just throw the dice and say,
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:44.800]   we're going to have to guess that people love this idea because we only can,
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:48.800]   there are only going to be two or three different phones around the iPhone operating system.
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:52.800]   If we're going to give one of those slots away to this weird big screen iPhone,
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:55.800]   that's a big opportunity we will blow if we were guessing wrong.
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:59.800]   Android is like, hey, if you want to make one that's the shape of a smiley face.
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:02.800]   Try it. We don't want to import it.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:03.800]   We know what's interesting.
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:05.800]   That's the model is much more like the Microsoft model.
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:10.800]   The Microsoft model is we license software to hardware manufacturers.
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:13.800]   And that was one of the secrets to the success of Windows, don't you think?
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:16.800]   I think it was definitely a secret of the success.
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:20.800]   I think that I think Microsoft was blessed with 10 years of--
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:25.800]   Give me your iPhone. Let me hold this up next to the Evo just so that people can see the size comparison.
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:29.800]   I think Microsoft was blessed with-- That's a cute picture.
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.800]   Thanks. Little bump.
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:38.800]   And they were blessed with not having a lot of creative direction at Apple for a decade.
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.800]   You know that at the same time.
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:43.800]   Apple seeded it to them. There's no question.
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:48.800]   But I think that if Apple, it works when Apple's not moving forward very quickly.
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:53.800]   I think that the thing that Apple still does better when I talk to people about--
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:57.800]   Because I got a lot of questions when I was in Africa about Android versus iPhone.
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:58.800]   And really--
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:28:59.800]   Interesting, really.
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.800]   Yeah, I mean, people are--
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.800]   Cell phones and smartphones are very popular in Africa.
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:04.800]   That's interesting.
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:05.800]   Yeah, computers.
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:06.800]   More than computers.
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:07.800]   Everybody's got a cell phone.
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:09.800]   Everyone's really good at using it.
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:11.800]   It's quite a thing.
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:13.800]   I mean, there's a lot of people with computers.
[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:21.800]   And of course, I was speaking in a lot of Apple stores and with folks that were working with Apple distribution.
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:25.800]   So I tended to meet people who were fairly technologically savvy.
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:27.800]   But when I got a question of it, really--
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:30.800]   And this may be me being not as--
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.800]   I haven't had an Android phone.
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:38.800]   But when I play with yours, I still, when I look at it, I go, if someone was more technologically savvy,
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:43.800]   I'd be more tempted to tell them, you should really look at an Android and see if it's something that really wants you.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.800]   You know, that you really want it to work.
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:49.800]   You may find that you're much happier with that because you'll be frustrated by some of the limitations within the iPhone.
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:53.800]   But when I talk about my parents or my kids, I still go--
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:30:04.800]   I'd rather-- I think that they'd be happier on an iPhone than an Android because I just think that there's a lot of deep holes there that on the Android that would leave them more confused.
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:11.800]   And I think that that's still the advantage that Apple has when I think of people who are less technologically savvy wanting to have a great smartphone,
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:14.800]   I still think an iPhone is a better solution.
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:15.800]   I agree 100%.
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:22.800]   I think the iPhone is a much more consumer phone because Apple thinks these things much more-- much much better.
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:31.800]   Just these little touches, like, I'm sort of like sketching out a piece that's going to be coming in a few weeks about iPhone versus Android as operating systems.
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:38.800]   And I realize that all I have to do to explain the difference between two philosophies is in "Froyo" at least 2.2,
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.800]   like the very latest version of Google's own music player.
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:52.800]   Go to the very, very bottom of the screen, like the bottom, like, 1.5 inches, where you'll see one strip that has the playback buttons, you know, play, pause, fast forward, whatever.
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:57.800]   Right underneath that is a little strip that has the scrubber for the timeline of your playback.
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:04.800]   - It's actually close, huh? - Right underneath that are the master buttons for the OS, you know, home, search, back, whatever.
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:19.800]   So you have cluster together, three places where every time there's at least a lot of three chances when I want to pause, I will actually wind up fast forwarding into the dead center of this four-hour long thing that I'm trying to listen to because I've accidentally aimed a little bit too low and hit the scrubber instead.
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:33.800]   Or, like, when I'm typing email, especially on the Nexus 1, which clusters of those four application buttons too close together, I'll be trying to tap the space button and I'll accidentally hit the back button instead or the menu button and I'll be dumped into the home screen
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:37.800]   or someplace else instead of just hitting the space as I intended.
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:51.800]   So I really think that the last thing that is a second big problem though is that I can't recommend an Android phone to people, I have to recommend, well, the HTC Incredible is very good.
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:53.800]   Next one is very good.
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:32:08.800]   This one, because every single model sets up their phone in a different way, like the EVO, I like it, I like it, but they've set up, like, the browser, the button to get to the browser should be untappled everywhere with the...
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:09.800]   Do you agree?
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:10.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:11.800]   I'm all off the phone.
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:13.800]   I'm just trying to show the Nexus.
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:16.800]   This is what you were saying is actually really apt.
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:23.800]   This is unfortunately, maybe not unfortunately, HTC has their own apps for music and they've solved by the way those little issues.
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:32.800]   I like the HTC Sense UI, which does change the Google UI and I'm trying to get my Google phone to work and I have a little problem with it responding.
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.800]   I would just like to say my point, exactly.
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:36.800]   That's not the look out there.
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:40.800]   You can't do anything with that phone until you tap that button at the top and what did they do with it?
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:45.800]   They made it recessed and tiny on the edge and the same color as the rest of the plastic.
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:47.800]   All of the Droid phones do that.
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:54.800]   I think that the other thing is the Digitizer, and this is the Nexus One problem, I think, is often unresponsive.
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:33:04.800]   I do think as an app developer, it seems like it's much more complicated because I have lots of different Android phones and lots of different platforms.
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:13.800]   That's kind of what we were talking about when you have Apple TV and an iPhone that can run on iPad, iPhone, and now Apple TV.
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:18.800]   You want to be careful about creating too many SKUs because it makes it harder for developers.
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:28.800]   I think that for an Apple TV style, I think you could build apps that were really looking at the form factor of an iPad and you'd probably be fine.
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:31.800]   That resolution and so on and so forth.
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.800]   I don't know if they'd have to build a third one.
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:41.800]   There are some polish issues with Android, but you know that they're iterating so fast that I think they'll be gone rapidly, much more rapidly.
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:49.800]   My difficulty is that when I hate to see, I can appreciate when I'm testing a piece of software, a piece of hardware.
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.800]   I can appreciate the idea of where, "Oh, well, they just have a different philosophy.
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:56.800]   It's not my philosophy of how I design this, but I can see where they're growing with this."
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:03.800]   What you hate to think is that reaction where you're thinking, no one tried this before they released it.
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:07.800]   Only an idiot would have released a phone like this, so they wouldn't put that right there.
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:12.800]   They wouldn't make that step so complicated when they could have just put one button right there.
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:18.800]   I really think that there's an institutional blindness inside of Google that says that at some point we're done.
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:19.800]   We're just going to ship this.
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:29.800]   That point is about five feet short of the line in which they've developed a piece of software or a piece of hardware that normal, ordinary consumers can really resonate with.
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:32.800]   I think, "My God, this is exactly the way I expect things to work."
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:37.800]   The thing that makes Apple good at what they do is not what they put into it, but what they take out of it.
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:44.800]   That is what makes the iPhone good, and it drives me crazy at least once a day about the iPhone being limited in one way or the other.
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:49.800]   I know that the reason people, it's easy to use and the reason people find it easy to use is not because Apple put extra features in.
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.800]   It's not because they developed a new feature there.
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:55.800]   It's because they eliminated six of them that could have been there.
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:58.800]   When I look at the Android, I still think it's four gigs by geeks.
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:02.800]   There's a lot of geeks out there, and so it's selling really well.
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:09.800]   As I said, when I think of people who are getting their first smartphone and they were going from something else and they want something that does all those things,
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:12.800]   this is not the phone that I would suggest to them.
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:15.800]   I love my Nexus one, but maybe I'm a geek.
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:18.800]   But I'm looking at getting one because we are geeks.
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:23.800]   I think that I want to get an Android phone because there's a bunch of stuff on it that I want to play with.
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:27.800]   As soon as I get my new iPhone, whenever that comes out, I'm going to...
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.800]   Well, I have to admit, I can't wait to see four G.
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:37.800]   So what is Apple do to respond to what is clearly a fast moving business in the next generation iPhone?
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:38.800]   Let's talk about that.
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:41.800]   Our predictions for WWDC coming up in just a little bit.
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:42.800]   How about that?
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:43.800]   Take a break.
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:44.800]   Smoke them if you got them.
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:46.800]   Andy Inako is here from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:50.800]   So we're going to see you, Cap.
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:56.800]   That's because I can't get my hair cold and put into it like good.
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:59.800]   And you can put headphones over the big hat you wear.
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:01.800]   So that makes sense.
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:08.800]   Also, Mr. Alex Lindsey back from Africa of the Pixel Core Pixel Core.com for that great guild of multimedia artist,
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:12.800]   Pixel Core.tv for all the great Pixel Core podcasts.
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:18.800]   I'm so glad he's back because he's like our guy, our consultant without him.
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:21.800]   I don't know what cameras to buy or anything.
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:22.800]   So welcome home.
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:23.800]   Thank you.
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:24.800]   It's good to be back.
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:25.800]   Good to have you home.
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:28.800]   Briefly, we'd like to mention our friends at Carbonite.com.
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.800]   These are the backup folks.
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:32.800]   I must have Carbonite.
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:33.800]   I had a call on the radio show.
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:34.800]   It happens every week.
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:40.800]   The woman said, "Oh, I backed up all my pictures onto an external drive."
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:41.800]   Oh, good.
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:42.800]   I like hearing that.
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.800]   Then I deleted the originals.
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.800]   Oh, I don't like hearing that.
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:52.800]   Then the hard drive died and I'm told the motor is dead and that's going to cost me $2,000 to get my pictures.
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:54.800]   What can I do?
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:58.800]   Then I have to say, "Well, you're not backing up if you only have one copy, one."
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.800]   Just because it says this is the backup drive means nothing.
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:03.800]   Second of all, hard drives do die.
[00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:05.800]   Local backups have another problem.
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:10.800]   If there's a fire or flood, you can lose your original with the backup.
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.800]   Burglars come in and steal everything.
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:15.800]   That's happened to Francis IV Coppola in Argentina last year.
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:16.800]   You lose it all.
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:20.800]   You got to have, it's the 3-2-1 backup thanks to Peter Kroeg.
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:23.800]   This is the guy, the guy who wrote the digital asset management book.
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:33.800]   He says, "Three copies, an original and two backups, two different media types, hard drive and CD, hard drive and online, two different types."
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:35.800]   But one of them has to be offsite.
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:38.800]   If it's not offsite, it's not backed up.
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:40.800]   Carbonite makes all of that easy.
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.800]   Go right now to Carbonite.com.

[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:52.800]   As soon as you install it, works great on Macs, immediately starts backing up those personal files.
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:56.800]   The financial records, the email, the photos, the stuff you can't afford to lose.
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:59.800]   It encrypts if you choose, which means you're absolutely private.
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:01.800]   It uses AES-256-bit encryption.
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:02.800]   It's the best out there.
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:05.800]   You control the keys so no one else can see it.
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:07.800]   SSL, of course, for all transmissions.
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:14.800]   Even if you are an open Wi-Fi access spot and you bring there with your laptop, it's nobody's seeing what's being backed up.
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:15.800]   I promise you.
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.800]   Carbonite is just fantastic.
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:20.800]   Now, why don't you try it because, of course, it relies on your upstream backup.
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:23.800]   I'm going to put it on Abby's laptop when she goes to college.
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:25.800]   This is one thing it's really perfect for.
[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:27.800]   She doesn't have to know she's being backed up.
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:28.800]   She doesn't have to think about it.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:35.800]   But when I get that inevitable call, "Dad, I erased my paper," or "I lost my laptop," I can say, "Don't calm down.
[00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:36.800]   It's okay.
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:37.800]   We've got a backup."

[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:47.800]   Terabytes doesn't matter.
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:53.800]   If it fits on your hard drive, if it's your personal data, less than five bucks a month, and you get two months free if you use Macbreak as a coupon code.

[00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:05.800]   If you're giving a -- as I am a high school senior, a laptop for graduation in college, keep putting carbonite on it.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:07.800]   Just don't even think about it before you give it to them.
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:08.800]   Put carbonite on it.
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:11.800]   Carbonite.com.
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:17.800]   We are going to do special coverage of the WWDC keynote.
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:18.800]   We now know 10 a.m.
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:19.800]   Steve Jobs will take the stage.
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:26.800]   Alex Lindsey, you will be here in studio along with Tom Merritt who will be anchoring it because I am actually out of town that day.
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:27.800]   So I'm not going to be here.
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:30.800]   It's a real luxury for me to be able to sit in the passenger seat.
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:31.800]   Yeah, you don't have to.
[00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:34.800]   Well, you and Tom will be passengers and we'll have Eric Lanigan --
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:35.800]   Okay, perfect.
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:38.800]   --boardop because he's our designated boardop for Tom Merritt.
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:48.800]   And he does the new Tom Merritt show, which by the way launches today, June 1st, 2.30 p.m. Pacific 5.30 Eastern at live.twit.tv.
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:50.800]   And it will be a daily news show.
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:53.800]   Similar to that show, Tom used to do at CNET Buzz Out Loud.
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:55.800]   Becky Worley is going to join him today.
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:58.800]   And for three days a week, Sarah Lane will be with him as well.
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.800]   I think two days a week.
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.800]   And he's going to have newsmaker interviews.
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:05.800]   And of course, this will be the show to listen to for Tech News Daily.
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:06.800]   2.30 Tech News.
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:07.800]   How long is it today?
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:10.800]   It'll be half an hour quick in and out, 40 minutes.
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:11.800]   You will get the news you need.
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:13.800]   And then we can listen to that and just steal all his ideas.
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:16.800]   And it's going to really save us a lot of time as well.
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.800]   So I'm very happy about that.
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:23.800]   However, Monday, WWDC, Tom, and you will anchor Andy.
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:26.800]   What are you doing for WWDC?
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:28.800]   Are you going to be live blogging it?
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:29.800]   I don't know yet.
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:32.800]   It depends on what kind of hardware that's trying to bring with me.
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:37.800]   I'm intending to live blog from the event.
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:43.800]   To back that up, I actually have my Verizon Wi-Fi.
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:44.800]   I'll try to upgrade it.
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:49.800]   If you try to do AT&T in a room full of 5,000 people who are also on AT&T, it doesn't work
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:50.800]   so well.
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:54.800]   But yeah, I'm definitely going to be at the keynote and hopefully filing stuff throughout
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:55.800]   the course of the day.
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:56.800]   Great.
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:58.800]   Well, we'll be following, of course, yours.
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:40:59.800]   Don McAllister will also be there.
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:03.800]   Do you usually go to WWDC or is this because you think there's going to be a big
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:04.800]   announcement this year?
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:09.800]   WWDC has moved into the usually category for me only because it's the only time that I
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:13.800]   know for fact that Apple is going to have a big, full-dog and pony-show keynote.
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:15.800]   And so that makes it newsworthy.
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:17.800]   You know, that's it.
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:21.800]   It's funny because it's a long way to go for one thing.
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:24.800]   You get, journalists get kicked out at WWDC if you're anyone.
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:25.800]   Yeah.
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:28.800]   Well, actually, actually that's another reason why I like to go because when I go to like
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:33.800]   a week-long trade show, that's like, oh goodness, this is like being, it's like one of those
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:37.800]   man versus wild sort of week-long documentaries.
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:42.800]   But this is like, oh, no, you mean, I can't, oh, no, I can't go to the rest of this.
[00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:46.800]   I just have to bring cappuccino with friends of mine who are taking breaks from their
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:49.800]   rat face thing, throwing how to do the "oh, dang it."
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:51.800]   That we know the real reason.
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:54.800]   And it's one of my favorite cities too, for God's sake.
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:57.800]   I must, Andy, always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:59.800]   Andy, how long are you here?
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:00.800]   I'm only here for a few days.
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:04.800]   I'm coming in late Saturday at, I'm, believe it or not, I'm going to be leaving right from
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:07.800]   Mac, I'm doing Mac Break 5 in the studio on Tuesday.
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:09.800]   I'm going right from there to the airport.
[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:11.800]   My plane is like four hours after the show airs.
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:15.800]   It's waiting, it'll be fueling for you, waiting for you to walk down the bridge.
[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:19.800]   Actually, I'm having one of them twin beach crafts, like just heard part of the street outside
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:20.800]   the cottage.
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:21.800]   Nice.
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:22.800]   It's good.
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.800]   I'll walk you to the plane today.
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:26.800]   What is it that Bogart says?
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:28.800]   He says, "You're going to regret this, you're not going.
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:29.800]   Some day, show.
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:32.800]   Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but some day, show."
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:35.800]   Like, oh, this looks like the start of a beautiful friendship.
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:36.800]   So, good.
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:40.800]   So you'll be here for one week from today for our special.
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:43.800]   So what we're going to do is we're going to cover the keynote.
[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:44.800]   You know, they never stream it.
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:48.800]   I'm not there to break the rules, so I won't be able to stream it.
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:50.800]   So maybe you'll find somebody.
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:51.800]   We'll work on it.
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:52.800]   Who's in the place streaming it.
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:53.800]   Trying someone special.
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:56.800]   It will not be Don McAllister or Andy and not.
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:57.800]   No, I wouldn't.
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:42:59.800]   I wouldn't jeopardize their relationships.
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:02.800]   We'd like to find someone we don't know and jeopardize their relationship.
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:03.800]   Yeah.
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:04.800]   Some stranger.
[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:05.800]   Yes.
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:08.800]   But if you can't get audio, we've got Andy and Don and of course, every other gadget blog
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:09.800]   and everybody else will be live blogging.
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:14.800]   So we'll be able to give you the play-by-play coverage with Tom Merritt and Alex Lindsey.
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:19.800]   I think starting at 10 Pacific on Monday, what do we think?
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:20.800]   What's going to happen?
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:23.800]   That Apple TV rumor, that seems credible.
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:24.800]   I buy that.
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:25.800]   I buy a new iPhone.
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:27.800]   It's credible rumor.
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:30.800]   I don't know if it's credible for WWDC or not.
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:32.800]   It's just a mystery at this point, I think.
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:34.800]   Well, we know there'll be an iPhone announcement.
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:35.800]   Yeah.
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:37.800]   That's -- as always.
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:44.800]   What I'm curious to see is what I'm going to be sort of kept my ears wide open for is just,
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:50.800]   in my own head, how much of this got changed to make sure that they indirectly respond
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:53.800]   to Google's I/O key note from a couple of weeks ago.
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:56.800]   Which was really an anti-Apple keynote the Thursday.
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:57.800]   Right.
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:58.800]   Sometimes to Google's detriment.
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:03.800]   I'm sure that Apple would never -- wouldn't spend the entire time just lashing out of Google.
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:09.800]   But I think that they're -- I'm wondering if they didn't -- after that keynote have to sort of go back to the whiteboard and say,
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:16.800]   "This, we got to really make this point really, really well because this is a point that Google put into play and people are starting to respond to that."
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:23.800]   And we also have to add a little bit here in this section right here to make sure that we sort of combat stories about this.
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:30.800]   I think that there would be boob them to do an entire segment about great HTML 5-based streaming solutions
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:33.800]   of how well H.264 works for everything.
[00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:38.800]   And here's an example of another developer who's abandoned Flash for HTML 5.
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:41.800]   Oh, well, it looks like some of the colors coming back to your face, Josh.
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:43.800]   Wow, did you lose weight?
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:48.800]   No, no, I just have lost that haggard expression that I had as a Flash developer for the past three or four years.
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:55.800]   There is somebody signing the chat room, a rumor floating around that Apple also has Erboguena Center booked for later in the month.
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:59.800]   Would that change your thoughts about what's going to happen?
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:02.800]   I haven't seen it so I don't think I've ever seen it.
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:03.800]   Yeah, it's been booked.
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:04.800]   It was booked for a year ago.
[00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:06.800]   It was end of June, last week of June.
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:08.800]   Yeah, that's when I thought WWDC would be.
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:10.800]   Maybe they thought that's why we thought WWDC would be then.
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:11.800]   Yeah, it was the...
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:13.800]   Why would no?
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:14.800]   There's not...
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:16.800]   No, they'll just eat it.
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:17.800]   They'll eat the deposit because...
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:23.800]   Well, are any of Apple's like senior executives, like, daughters, like, having a graduation?
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:24.800]   Graduation, right?
[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:25.800]   Or a debut time ball?
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:27.800]   Graduation, of course.
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:28.800]   Exactly.
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:29.800]   It could be another announcement.
[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:31.800]   It could be another job super sweet sixteen.
[00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:34.800]   Actually, let me think.
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:35.800]   Wait a minute.
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:41.800]   Well, I think actually Steve's daughter or Steve's son and my daughter are roughly the same age.
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:43.800]   So he may be graduating from high school this week.
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:45.800]   Well, now it would be quite as abby as.
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:46.800]   Wouldn't that be...
[00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:47.800]   That would be an awesome party.
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:49.800]   I hope Abby gets an invitation.
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:53.800]   Hey, do you think Gizmodo will get an invitation to the WWDC?
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:55.800]   What do you think?
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:46:01.800]   I think they'll be like, you know, cater waiters with a suspicious looking hump with an antenna underneath
[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:06.800]   their little tecito jacket that Apple's been sort of like told to keep their eyes about
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:07.800]   for.
[00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:09.800]   I'm sorry about all the noise there.
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:14.800]   Like, Google phones just knew that this was back break quickly and would not stop making
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:17.800]   noise when they rang.
[00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:20.800]   I think I answered that call.
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:21.800]   Hey, sorry.
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:23.800]   Never mind.
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:30.800]   So iPhone, Apple TV, anything else?
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:31.800]   I mean, I think that Apple...
[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:32.800]   Oh, it's four.
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:33.800]   Yeah.
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:34.800]   I think that Apple may.
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:37.800]   Obviously, I think a large portion of this is going to be to go over the new OS4.
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:38.800]   You know, it's to really talk about...
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:39.800]   I think that's what you do.
[00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:41.800]   It's a developers conference.
[00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:42.800]   Yeah.
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:44.800]   And it's almost a sideline.
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:46.800]   Yes, we're doing the next iPhone.
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:47.800]   Here's what it is.
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:50.800]   What features we know the hardware or do we?
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:52.800]   Do we know the hardware?
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:56.960]   With the iPhone, I think that we're going to see something that looks very similar to the
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:58.800]   one that was leaked.
[00:46:58.800 --> 00:46:59.800]   I mean, I think it's...
[00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:01.800]   I don't know if it's going to be identical to that, but...
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:03.800]   There are multiple instances out in the field now.
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:06.800]   So, that's one hell of a coincidence or...
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:08.800]   That's what we're going to see.
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:09.800]   Yeah.
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:10.800]   And I think that it's...
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:12.800]   I have to admit that after looking at the pictures, I'm looking forward to having one of it.
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:13.800]   Is it the one you want?
[00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:14.800]   Yeah.
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:15.800]   Because it looks like an iPad?
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:16.800]   What is it?
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:17.800]   Why...
[00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:18.800]   My roundy one looks...
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:21.800]   Assuming that I can upgrade my 3GS to 4.0, which I think they said...
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:22.800]   That we could do.
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:24.800]   Why would I want a new iPhone?
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:27.800]   I'm going to bet that the Pixel...
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:28.800]   Better camera?
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:29.800]   Density is going to be much higher.
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:30.800]   Do we know that?
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:33.800]   Didn't they know that about the one that couldn't Gizmodo figure that out?
[00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:38.800]   I don't know if they said that or not, but the rumor is that it could be as high as 960 by 540,
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:42.800]   which would give it an incredibly dense Pixel structure.
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:43.800]   I mean, like a page.
[00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:44.800]   I mean, it would just be...
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:46.800]   On that size of a screen would be incredible.
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:47.800]   Right.
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:48.800]   And then a front-facing camera is a big deal to me.
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:51.800]   I mean, I think that the idea of being able to do eye-chats.
[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:53.800]   You know, I got a front-facing eye camera.
[00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:58.800]   In fact, maybe Andy, you and I can call each other because we've got this Evo with a front-facing
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:01.800]   freaking camera and no one to call.
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:03.800]   Well, the one thing that I'm hoping is...
[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:05.800]   I'll call you, you call me, and then we'll be done.
[00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:06.800]   We'll call it a day.
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:10.800]   If you're expecting 4G though, make it work.
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:11.800]   Yeah.
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:17.800]   Now, this is where Apple has an advantage because Google, you can use Frang or Quick or whatever,
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:19.800]   but Apple can make eye-chat be...
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:20.800]   Right.
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:24.800]   Well, and the one thing that I'm hoping though is that Apple is going to allow other third-party
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:26.800]   developers to be able to use it like Skype.
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:27.800]   So, like imagine being able to do...
[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:29.800]   Have me be able to link in.
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:30.800]   Please, I beg of you.
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:31.800]   Yeah, and that'd be awesome.
[00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:35.800]   You know, to be able to have the video skipes that we would normally have for, for instance,
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:39.800]   for this show, but being able to do it from your new iPhone.
[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:41.800]   The quality...now, this is, of course, the Evo.
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:45.800]   This isn't an iPhone, but the quality of the front-facing camera, it's 1.3 megapixels.
[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:46.800]   It's small.
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:46.800]   Right.
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:50.800]   It's not ideal, but I mean, you get a picture, but it's the framerate, it's not great.
[00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:51.800]   Right.
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:57.800]   So, what would...what wouldn't that be awesome if we could, instead of setting up a laptop,
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:00.800]   call you in the field on your iPhone?
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:01.800]   Yeah.
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:04.800]   I mean, imagine doing the coverage from like these big launch events and everything else.
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:05.800]   Right.
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:07.800]   It'd be very cool.
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:08.800]   Yeah.
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:14.800]   I thought that the rumor...I was looking through the...I read all the, you know, reading all the
[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:15.800]   articles.
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:18.800]   Well, I was reading all the articles that got sent in the show notes this morning, and I
[00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:22.800]   can't remember which one it came from, but there was rumor that I think it's a little
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:25.800]   preposterous, but I think that it would, that I, that I, but I think it would be interesting
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:31.800]   to see is the idea of having a built-in ad blocker on Safari.
[00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:33.800]   No freaking way.
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:35.800]   I was like, "Well, I already have one, so I don't really need it."
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:37.800]   You know, you know, it's like, it's like, I already blocked all my ads.
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:38.800]   And so...
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.800]   That's the same guy who made up the rumor that Balmer was speaking.
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:41.800]   Oh, was it?
[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:42.800]   Well, I don't know.
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:43.800]   Why would you put an ad blocker?
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:47.800]   If your business is I ads, well, because it would block everything.
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:48.800]   Everything but I.
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:50.800]   Well, it would, it would, it would, it's not for the iPhone.
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:51.800]   It's for the web.
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:55.800]   You know, it'd be an ad blocker on the web, you know, on Safari.
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:56.800]   I mean, I already do that.
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:57.800]   I don't know what it is.
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:49:58.800]   It's like the flash click to flash.
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:49:59.800]   It's like the flash is a good one.
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:01.800]   And I just block everything.
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:02.800]   Yeah.
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:03.800]   It's just, it's just...
[00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:04.800]   I don't want to see no flash.
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:05.800]   I just, I just, it speeds up the pages.
[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:06.800]   I mean, that's, that's why I do it.
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:08.800]   It's just because I don't want to wait for it to load.
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:09.800]   Yeah.
[00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:11.800]   But I think we're all grouped over.
[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:13.800]   I think that we're not going to see anything about desktops.
[00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:14.800]   Don't you agree?
[00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:16.800]   I think we might see some new Mac Pros.
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:17.800]   I think the Mac Pro.
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:18.800]   The Mac Pro is typically the one that comes out.
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:19.800]   One that comes out.
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:20.800]   We've been waiting and we couldn't wait.
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:23.800]   We finally bought, we had to, last week I had to buy a Mac Pro
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:28.800]   because we wanted that new extreme chip with the six cores for our video editors.
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:30.800]   But we had to have, we have a third video editor.
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:31.800]   We had to have a third video editor.
[00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:32.800]   We don't have to say for video editing.
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:35.800]   The 16 Prok or even the 8 Prok is great.
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:36.800]   We got a 16 Prok.
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:39.800]   But I also have a 24 Prok.
[00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:41.800]   I don't think we're going to see 24.
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:44.800]   And this is the thing that I thought was interesting is that I think we'll see 12 if it's going to do it.
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:45.800]   Two chips.
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:48.800]   Maybe there's a built to order 24.
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:50.800]   Maybe that might be the possibility if we see it.
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:52.800]   It would have to have four chips.
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:53.800]   Yeah.
[00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:54.800]   Which I would buy in them.
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:55.800]   Buy very quickly.
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:56.800]   Yeah.
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:57.800]   For 20.
[00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:00.800]   I mean, like the comments on desktop apps, desktop.
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:01.800]   I don't think so.
[00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:02.800]   Because--
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:03.800]   Remember that the--
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:04.800]   There's no course track sentence.
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:08.800]   And the Apple Design Awards left the Macintosh out entirely.
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:10.800]   This year at WWDC.
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:12.800]   There is no OS 10 category.
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:14.800]   It's all mobile.
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:20.800]   So I think Apple sent a very clear message to developers of where they're going.
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:21.800]   Of where they're going.
[00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:22.800]   I mean, I'm not thrilled about it.
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:26.800]   But I think the desktop's OS 10 is not--
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:28.800]   No, it frightens--
[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:29.800]   It has to happen.
[00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:33.800]   --as a person who develops-- develops on-- and does a lot of work on the desktop.
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:37.800]   I do have to admit that I think-- I still think five, ten years from now.
[00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:43.800]   I don't know if Apple is really investing anything in laptops and such bad news.
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:44.800]   Yeah.
[00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:45.800]   I don't know what--
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:46.800]   Maybe I'm an old fart.
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:47.800]   Do you think I'm an old fart for thinking that?
[00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:48.800]   No, I--
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:49.800]   You have to have a desktop to develop for these things.
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:50.800]   So developers are going to need them.
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:51.800]   And you need it for video editing.
[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:55.800]   And you need it for high-end Photoshop.
[00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:56.800]   And don't you?
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:57.800]   Well, you do.
[00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:05.800]   I mean, I think that that's the-- I mean, I think that the question is whether Apple thinks it can move all or many of those solutions to things like the iPad.
[00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:09.800]   I mean, if you're looking at the trajectory and saying, "Well, the iPad will be as fast as a--"
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:21.800]   I mean, we were-- I think we were talking about this on one of the shows, but I-- you know, that I came to the conclusion that this iPhone runs three times faster than the Mac that I used to render Star Wars shots.
[00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:22.800]   Isn't that fun?
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:24.800]   I mean, that's the thing to put it in perspective is that we--
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:25.800]   Yeah.
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:34.800]   --you know, so when we look at a ten-year trajectory, ten years ago, I was rendering shots for a feature film on a computer that was one-third the speed of my iPhone.
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:42.800]   So it's definitely something that is possible that we could see a lot of these features slowly be rolled into it, but they might look different.
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:45.800]   Anything else we want to say about that?
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:46.800]   Cookies.
[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:47.800]   Cookies?
[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:48.800]   I'm expecting cookies.
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:49.800]   That's all I'm going to say.
[00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:51.800]   And WWDC, there will be cookies.
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:53:00.800]   I will say that one thing I'm going to do with this phone is jail-breaking after being in Africa, because every person had-- like every person I saw that had an iPhone, and there's a lot of iPhones in Africa, and they're all--
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:01.800]   They're all jail-broken, right?
[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:02.800]   They're all jail-broken.
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:04.800]   Are they all unlocked as well?
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:06.800]   They're jail-broken and unlocked.
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:13.800]   Because in many of the countries that I was in, they don't have any distribution for iPhones.
[00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:24.800]   So they buy them on the gray market, they jail-break them, and everyone's swapping SIM cards as they go from country to country, and it was like, "Oh, that's really nice."
[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:27.800]   Adobe has rolled out iPad-focused magazine publishing tools.
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:29.800]   I think this is really funny.
[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:30.800]   I thought this was great.
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:33.800]   I thought this was really on the ball of Adobe.
[00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:40.800]   They can spend some time arguing about Flash, but I think that they are really grabbing a hold of this.
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:44.800]   This is what Wired-- the new Wired magazine for the iPad was made with, right?
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:46.800]   I thought this was fantastic.
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:47.800]   It's been designed.
[00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:49.800]   It was plugins.
[00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:53.800]   And you can just run your magazine through it.
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:59.800]   Since most people are using InDesign to do their magazine layout anyway, it's probably a very easy thing to do to lay out the magazine and create an iPad version at the table.
[00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:03.800]   I think that what's amazing here is that Adobe is ahead of Apple.
[00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:05.800]   Pages should be able to do this right now.
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:08.800]   This is a huge mess by Apple that Pages is not--
[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:11.800]   But nobody uses Pages for magazine layout.
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:16.800]   We should be able to do this and export it out and then be able to pipe that into Xcode.
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:18.800]   I want to do a layout.
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:25.800]   I want to make it look the way I want it to look as a book, or I want to do whatever I want to do and be able to export that to-- or a keynote and put stuff together.
[00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:30.800]   Export that to my Xcode or use that as the front interface to make it easier to develop this stuff.
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:39.800]   And the fact that Adobe-- I think it should be embarrassing to Apple that the best development tool for putting magazines on an iPad is being built by Adobe.
[00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:40.800]   Now, I don't think it's surprising.
[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:43.800]   I think that Adobe is a development tool company.
[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:45.800]   I don't think that Flash is that important to them.
[00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:46.800]   And it's important to them.
[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:53.800]   I don't think it should be as important to them as just the fact that they make great tools that create content.
[00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:56.800]   And it shouldn't matter how that content pumps out the other side.
[00:54:56.800 --> 00:55:00.800]   And I think that they're-- I think this is-- I think it's great news.
[00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:06.800]   I know we're going to be doing a lot of investigation into how to use InDesign to get some of our training products done in that way.
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:21.800]   MacIntosh, anti-virus and firewall publisher Intigo says there is a embedded spyware in some Mac shareware, but they won't say what Mac shareware it is.
[00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:24.800]   So it's not much help.
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:27.800]   I think this is more to sell copies of Intigo than anything else.
[00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:28.800]   Isn't that what they do?
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:29.800]   Yeah.
[00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:30.800]   Yeah.
[00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:34.800]   Sometimes they'd actually define cookies deposited by certain sites as spyware.
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:35.800]   Yeah.
[00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:37.800]   So they have to say exactly what they're having to think.
[00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:45.800]   We have discovered a spyware application that is installed by a number of freely distributed Mac applications and screen savers found on a variety of websites.
[00:55:45.800 --> 00:56:02.800]   A spyware OS10 opinion spy performs a number of malicious actions from scanning files to recording user activity as well as sending information about this activity to remote servers and opening a back door, which is really good news for us because now you have to buy our software.
[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:06.800]   Actually, it sounds pretty nasty.
[00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:10.800]   I don't understand why they would not say where they found it.
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:14.800]   That doesn't seem to be a very good member of the community.
[00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:15.800]   Yeah.
[00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:17.800]   I think the CEO's Professor Harold Hill.
[00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:18.800]   Yeah.
[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:20.800]   Come on, Intigo.
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:29.800]   If you really care about us, you'd say what program so we could not download them instead of trying to voice a copy of your software on a system.
[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:34.800]   So if it's that important, someone's going to buy the product for a central narrative, find out what it's doing, then sort of what everybody does.
[00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:35.800]   Right.
[00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:36.800]   Right.
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:37.800]   Right.
[00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:38.800]   Right.
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:39.800]   Right.
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:43.800]   So, Apple's iPhone production scene is pointing to impending Verizon deal.
[00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:50.800]   Any word, anybody know anything more because people now are really starting to bang the drum for Verizon iPhone.
[00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:53.800]   And it's I run into regular people on the street who say, "I hear it soon."
[00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:56.800]   I don't know why they think that.
[00:56:56.800 --> 00:57:00.800]   I've heard nothing from anybody that goes beyond, "Hey, this is what I've heard."
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:01.800]   Yeah.
[00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:19.800]   So, for a Rodman and Renshaw says in a note to clients today that Apple is ramping up iPhone production 12 million iPhones already in the supply chain for the September quarter, which is a lot considering they've only sold 50 million since the inception of the device.
[00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:26.800]   Well, it would be big because I think most people that I've talked to said, "Oh, I really want an iPhone, but I'm not going to get it.
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:32.800]   I think they're going to get it.
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:35.800]   I think they're going to get it.
[00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:37.800]   I think they're going to get it.
[00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:40.800]   I think they're going to get it.
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:43.800]   I think they're going to get it.
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:45.800]   I think they're going to get it.
[00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:47.800]   I think they're going to get it.
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:49.800]   I think they're going to get it.
[00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:52.800]   I think they're going to get it.
[00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:57.800]   CDMA is, of course, what you would need in a phone that's going to be sold on the Verizon network.
[00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:00.800]   Of course, they do CDMA anywhere else in the world.
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:01.800]   They do.
[00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:02.800]   Or all GSM.
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:03.800]   They do.
[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:05.800]   So, they do make CDMA iPhones.
[00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:09.800]   In Africa and Brazil and a couple other countries, they have CDMA.
[00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:11.800]   But do they have CDMA iPhones?
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:12.800]   Oh, no.
[00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:13.800]   No, they're all GSM.
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:14.800]   Yeah, they're all GSM.
[00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:15.800]   Okay.
[00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:18.800]   You want to bet anybody?
[00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:19.800]   Andy?
[00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:20.800]   What do you think?
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:21.800]   What's your bet?
[00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:23.800]   Is it the Verizon this year?
[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:24.800]   Yeah.
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:27.800]   It's AT&T is becoming so much of a liability for Apple right now.
[00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:31.800]   So many of the things that Google dinged Apple for were not Apple problems.
[00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:32.800]   AT&T.
[00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:33.800]   Yeah.
[00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:37.800]   So, the question is whether Apple wants to use that as an excuse.
[00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:39.800]   Nothing is an excuse.
[00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:44.600]   But as an imperative to make sure they move it on to different carriers or whether they're
[00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:48.800]   just going to use that as the big stick they used to just beat and beat and beat and beat
[00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:51.800]   and beat and beat and beat and beat and beat and beat.
[00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:53.800]   And then you're going to be able to do that.
[00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:56.800]   And then you're going to be able to do that as an opportunity to do that.
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:58.800]   And then you're going to be able to do that.
[00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:00.800]   And then you're going to be able to do that.
[00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:03.800]   And then you're going to be able to do that as an opportunity to do that.
[00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:06.800]   And then you're going to be able to do that as an opportunity to do that.
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:10.800]   And then you're going to be able to do that as an opportunity to do that as an opportunity.
[00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:13.800]   And then you're going to be able to do that as an opportunity to do that.
[00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:18.800]   And then you're going to be able to do that as an opportunity to do that as an opportunity
[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:23.800]   to do that as an opportunity to do that as an opportunity to do that as an opportunity to do that.
[00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:28.800]   And then you're going to be able to do that as an opportunity to do that as an opportunity to do that.
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:32.800]   And then you're going to be able to do that as an opportunity to do that as an opportunity to do that.
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:42.800]   And then you're going to be able to do that as an opportunity to do that as an opportunity to do that.
[00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:47.800]   And then you're going to be able to do that as an opportunity to do that as an opportunity to do that.
[00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:50.780]   I think it would batter any network.
[00:59:50.780 --> 00:59:52.420]   And I think it'll batter Verizon.
[00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:54.360]   I think Verizon is probably better positioned now.
[00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:56.620]   But, I don't know.
[00:59:56.620 --> 00:59:59.500]   I mean, AT&T has other phones besides the iPhone.
[00:59:59.500 --> 01:00:02.520]   Other networks have probably the same amount of volume,
[01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:03.600]   if not more.
[01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:06.960]   But what is it about the iPhone that AT&T can continue to
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:10.280]   say that if we were to open this one feature up for this one
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:13.140]   phone, even if it's the hottest phone out there,
[01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:14.560]   our one network can't handle it.
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:16.760]   What are they doing that Verizon isn't doing?
[01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:19.160]   What is Verizon doing that AT&T isn't?
[01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:20.080]   Well, I don't think--
[01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:20.960]   Well, I think that--
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:23.840]   No, I think tethering needs to be on its side.
[01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:27.960]   I think tethering needs to be added.
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:30.360]   I mean, I think it's incredibly frustrating that it's not.
[01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:33.560]   Especially because, Leo, even you've used the EVA,
[01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:37.160]   where it's got another Android phone that supports wireless
[01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:41.560]   tethering, wireless hotspot of sharing of the 3G
[01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:42.760]   port of the Android.
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:43.840]   Eight devices.
[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:49.360]   And by the way, the T-Mobile-based Nexus 1 does it for free
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:51.600]   because that's part of the new 2.2 of Android.
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:53.560]   I can use this like a Mi-Fi.
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:55.000]   And I have on my laptop.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000]   So it's got Wi-Fi based--
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.200]   You want to know the Mi-Fi around?
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:59.200]   And this one does eight, but you have to pay
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:00.520]   Sprint $30 a month for.
[01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:02.440]   But still, that's half the cost of a Mi-Fi.
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:03.440]   That's on the EVO.
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:04.360]   And I love my Mi-Fi.
[01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:06.160]   But I would love not to have to carry it around.
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:08.480]   Your phone becomes a Mi-Fi.
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:13.440]   And I mean, the kicker was I have my AT&T SIM card in my
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:14.720]   Nexus 1 right now.
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:18.200]   And the hotspot sharing works perfectly fine on the AT&T
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:20.080]   network from my Froyo 4.0.
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:23.200]   But have you had, as T-Mobile told you, that it's going to be
[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:25.960]   a free service?
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:28.440]   My understanding is that it's built--
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:31.000]   just like tethering is built into the iPhone operating system.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.040]   And then carriers can decide what they want to do with it.
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:36.840]   Understanding is that carriers might avail themselves of the
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:39.640]   option of making that into an extra $20 a month, a $30 a month.
[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:39.640]   Yeah.
[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:41.040]   I mean, that's what Sprint's doing.
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:42.400]   But my question is how did he do that?
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:45.360]   Because how do they know that I'm doing it, right?
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:49.160]   Well, I mean, the phones that get
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:51.440]   sold are not Nexus 1s where they're open platform.
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:52.120]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:53.120]   You can still anything on.
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:54.240]   The other phones they might.
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:56.440]   But a Nexus 1, this is an open platform phone.
[01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:58.280]   I went to Froyo 2.2.
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:01:59.160]   It worked immediately.
[01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:00.760]   I tried it with my iPad.
[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:01.680]   I was able to do it now.
[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:03.280]   T-Mobile is not the best network.
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:05.720]   I think what will be a very compelling offering is a Sprint
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:10.320]   EVO running the 4G network somewhere, not here, because we
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:11.480]   don't have it.
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:12.800]   I've just turned on the hotspot.
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:16.040]   If you want to look for it on your laptop, you can try the--
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:18.440]   Would you like to try the Sprint 3G network there?
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:18.800]   Why?
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:20.160]   Yes, I would.
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.200]   Oh, I see it there.
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:21.720]   I need to go.
[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:24.080]   The same password as Hercules.
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:24.720]   Do you remember that?
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:25.680]   Start 2K.
[01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:27.440]   Go ahead, use it.
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:31.080]   I don't mind if everybody uses my phone.
[01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:33.760]   And then you'll be surfing on the Sprint network.
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:34.840]   Isn't that wild?
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:35.320]   Yeah.
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:37.280]   Everybody's going to have to do that now.
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:38.600]   I'm not sure.
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:41.120]   Realize that when you go through the MyFi router, if you go
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:45.240]   through Sprintone 4G mobile hotspot route, you really are
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:47.680]   just a one and done sort of bill.
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:51.360]   I'm not sure if I would switch to an Android phone just
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:55.760]   because I'm saving $30 a month on the cost of a MyFi.
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:57.200]   I'm not sure they have two separate devices.
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:59.720]   I'm not sure they have the iPhone I really, really want.
[01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:02.320]   And the sort of mobile broadband I really, really want.
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:04.840]   Although Sprint's doing something really, really cool
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:07.760]   with the EVO, do you know that there's a 30-day money
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:09.200]   back guarantee on it?
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:09.680]   Really?
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:10.120]   You can--
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:10.880]   Try it.
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:11.880]   What's the risk?
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:12.880]   Yeah.
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:13.240]   Yeah.
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:17.040]   And so it was one of those things that I have to assume
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:17.560]   that I'm dumb.
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:19.240]   I didn't really understand what they were saying.
[01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:20.840]   So I had to ask the question again.
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:24.400]   So if I go into a Sprint store and I buy an EVO phone,
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:27.640]   and less than 30 days later, I decided that it won anymore.
[01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:29.600]   And I returned in good condition.
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:31.040]   There's no cancellation fee.
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:32.360]   I'm not stuck on a contract.
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:34.280]   I get all my money back.
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:35.520]   Yep, you get all your money back.
[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.520]   There's no-- you're not under contract.
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:38.720]   We'll cancel the contract.
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:41.160]   The only thing that you're on the hook for is if you bought
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:44.840]   anything via the 4G network, like if you bought one of those
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:48.480]   $30, you know, naked ladies, ringtones, or whatever,
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:50.160]   then they will still charge you for that.
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:51.600]   But that's about it.
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:53.080]   So the--
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:56.440]   Your EVO is faster than my Wi-Fi.
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:57.280]   I mean, the speed is--
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:03:58.200]   Sprint's got a pretty good network.
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:03:59.200]   2.9 megabit--
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:00.280]   Will you do the speed test?
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:00.760]   Megabit down.
[01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:04.200]   No wonder my epicurious got so slow.
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:06.360]   That's the first-- I have to admit, the very first thing I do--
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:07.360]   Do speed test, sure.
[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:09.880]   I run speedtest.net every time I get onto a new network.
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:11.240]   She's getting 2.9 down.
[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:13.360]   2.9 down, 0.58 up.
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:15.160]   And that is about--
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:20.640]   Both numbers are about 50% faster than--
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:23.360]   not twice as fast, but significantly faster
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:24.280]   than what I'm getting on my mind.
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:26.120]   Of course, my battery is now half dead.
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:28.760]   But you'd have to plug it in if you really wanted to use this.
[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:29.560]   But still--
[01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:30.080]   Right.
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:31.640]   Google has announced that it is not
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:34.720]   going to allow its new incoming employees to get Windows
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:35.600]   computers anymore.
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:39.080]   I actually found this out before it broke yesterday,
[01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:40.680]   because Colleen said, yeah, they only offered me
[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:42.560]   Linux and a Mac.
[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:44.440]   And Colleen's a big Windows user.
[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:47.000]   Google apparently worried about security issues.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.920]   No longer uses Windows at the Google Play.
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:51.680]   You know, it's interesting.
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:54.600]   I know some government agencies that actually do the same thing.
[01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:55.440]   And they--
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:56.280]   It's Linux or Mac.
[01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:57.480]   They want to touch Windows.
[01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:59.240]   God, that's got to hurt.
[01:04:59.240 --> 01:04:59.760]   Yeah.
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:02.040]   And it's got to hurt at Google because I'm
[01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:03.240]   surprised they still love for Apple.
[01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:05.520]   I'm surprised they just go Linux and tireless.
[01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:07.040]   They obviously hate Apple.
[01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:10.080]   Too many employees don't hate Apple.
[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:10.720]   There was--
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:13.040]   Someone I was talking to in a government agency said the Mac
[01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:15.360]   was actually-- to them, they considered that the most
[01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:15.640]   secure.
[01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:16.440]   And they're using BSD.
[01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:18.120]   I mean, they're using the shell all the time.
[01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:19.800]   They're not really using the OS.
[01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:23.760]   And they said that from their perspective, the OS 10
[01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:27.200]   was the most secure platform that they had to work in.
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:30.000]   I didn't mention anything until it was publicly available,
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:30.360]   Colleen.
[01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:33.760]   I hope I don't get you in trouble.
[01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:35.960]   Nope, too late they're going to make her use Linux.
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:36.920]   Oh, no.
[01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:38.800]   I wonder what she chose if she chose Mac.
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:41.280]   I think she'd probably choose Linux over Mac.
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:41.800]   Yeah, probably.
[01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:42.120]   Yeah.
[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:43.840]   Eyes-eye with the new one too is fantastic.
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:45.400]   I missed that whole--
[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:46.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:46.760]   I missed the menu.
[01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:47.480]   I knew she worked for it.
[01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:48.360]   She worked here.
[01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:49.840]   And then I was like, because you were asking about some
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:50.320]   technical stuff.
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:52.920]   And I was like, what does she say?
[01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:54.680]   She got a great job at Google.
[01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:55.160]   Wow.
[01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:55.680]   Congratulations.
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:57.720]   She's a video streaming engineer at Google.
[01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:58.200]   Wow.
[01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:01.200]   And with management training, and we've
[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:02.600]   hired Ken Sheberts into her place,
[01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:05.480]   her and Jammerby and Burke are going to fill in a lot of the
[01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:06.760]   hands-on stuff.
[01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:10.160]   Ken's our web designer who's doing a new beta for us.
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:12.680]   So I'm thrilled for her.
[01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:14.520]   Couldn't be happier.
[01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:16.040]   We'll miss her on our laser tag team.
[01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:16.720]   But--
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:19.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:21.480]   No, I will miss her in many, many, many ways.
[01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:26.000]   But she told me when I hired her, I'm going to Google.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:26.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:26.960]   That was a good one.
[01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:27.440]   That was just a good one.
[01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:27.960]   That was just a good one.
[01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:28.960]   That was just a good one.
[01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:31.360]   We're going to come back in just a moment with our picks
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:35.440]   of the week from Andy Inacco, the Chicago Sun Times, Alex
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:36.920]   Lindsey of the Pixel Core.
[01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:38.080]   Merlin Mann has the week off.
[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:38.840]   I'm Leo LePorte.
[01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:42.040]   And we've got to mention our friends at audible.com right
[01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:42.320]   now.
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:44.800]   This is a wonderful place to get audio entertainment
[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:50.000]   of all kinds of 75,000 titles, books, radio shows,
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.520]   performances, speeches.
[01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:54.640]   They do a whole big pro bono thing.
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:58.080]   If you are a member, you can go to the Free for Members page.
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:02.880]   And they've got excerpts now of many, many books.
[01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:06.000]   When the debates happen, the presidential debates,
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.640]   they'd offer that pro bono.
[01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:10.240]   There's a lot of really, really great stuff.
[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:11.440]   Free interviews.
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:13.800]   And when you're on lots of 10-hour flights, they're awesome.
[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:14.560]   Yeah.
[01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:15.360]   Get the little ones.
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:15.760]   Yeah.
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:16.920]   For free, stock up.
[01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:18.520]   But I'll tell you what we're going to do right now.
[01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:20.800]   We're going to make it possible for you to get a book.
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:21.480]   Absolutely.
[01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:25.600]   Free all you have to do is go to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:28.840]   Because we know, and we tell all our advertisers,
[01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:30.360]   we got a smart audience.
[01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:32.880]   And the best way to get them to try your product
[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:36.320]   is to give them a free sample.
[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:38.960]   Because if you've got a great product, they'll know it and love it.
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:42.720]   It plays on the iPad, iPod, iPhone, of course.
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:48.480]   All the Zoom, the Kindle, a lot of GPS devices, the iRiver,
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:51.120]   the Sans-- there's 500 devices.
[01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:53.400]   You can listen to great audible literature on.
[01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:55.720]   And if you don't have time to read, audible,
[01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:57.480]   we'll do the reading for you.
[01:07:57.480 --> 01:07:59.320]   It's just-- I love it.
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:01.080]   It's a luxury to me.
[01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:02.680]   So Andy, what have you been reading lately?
[01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:04.560]   You got a recommendation for us?
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:06.160]   I got a weird one this time.
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:08.320]   I was listening to one of my favorite podcasts,
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:10.720]   which is the Creative Screenwriting Podcast.
[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:13.760]   Wonderful, wonderful interviews with directors and filmmakers,
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:16.120]   and mostly screenwriters, and one
[01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:17.800]   of my favorite favorite podcasts.
[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:21.080]   And the guests on the show was George Romero,
[01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:25.480]   the electric producer of Night of the Living Dead.
[01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:28.880]   And I did not know that he had produced an audio book,
[01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:31.840]   like an audio dramatization of Night of the Living Dead,
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:34.080]   narrated by George Romero himself.
[01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:35.120]   You can.
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:37.120]   And a full cast.
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:39.760]   And sure enough, it is available on Audible.
[01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:44.360]   It is-- I've given it a listen.
[01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:46.720]   I really had to download this one.
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:49.760]   And if you're looking for the subtle--
[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:53.680]   that's kind of subtle nuanced presentation in which you--
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:55.360]   everything is filled with subtext,
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:57.880]   and you get to sort of flesh out the story a little bit.
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:08:59.240]   This isn't that thing.
[01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:02.400]   This is the sort of thing that you play driving on your way
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:05.320]   to a Halloween party, because it's nothing but--
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:08.120]   And then there's darkness filled.
[01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:10.320]   There was a creep that unfolded them.
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:12.560]   They're far more chilling than the mist.
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:14.000]   I like that, though.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.280]   Let me play a little bit of it.
[01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:17.040]   And that's the other thing you do at audible.com,
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:18.240]   a sample, any book.
[01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:21.240]   Get the car started.
[01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:24.360]   Barbara ran, but Johnny didn't.
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:26.800]   He was too busy fighting the man.
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:29.200]   If man it was.
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:29.960]   A man with--
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:32.560]   Who knew the George Romero sounded un-camly like George
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:34.560]   Decay?
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:36.600]   Yes, this is great.
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:38.080]   You learn from the master, Leo.
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:39.960]   What can I tell you?
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:41.600]   Now, there's only one downside to it.
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:44.160]   You know that I'm a big fan of just sticking it to the man.
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:45.760]   And if you're going to get your free book,
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:48.960]   or you're on the gold plan where you get one title every single month,
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:52.440]   go for the one that's like 10, 20, 30, 40 hours with it.
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:53.800]   This one is less than an hour.
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:55.120]   It's 56 minutes long.
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:56.280]   So let's give a little--
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:59.280]   I'm going to use one of my credits of--
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:01.440]   I'm going to use one of those books that I selected
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:03.160]   because it was 17 hours long.
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:06.280]   I'm ratcheting it that back to as though we're 16 hours long.
[01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:06.800]   Yes.
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:08.640]   And so using the surplus to--
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:11.480]   You've earned the right to do that, Andy.
[01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:12.320]   It's OK.
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:13.240]   It is over the top.
[01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:14.520]   This is not something that you would
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:18.480]   want to have those nice silicone inside the ear,
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:20.080]   seal the ear of headphones.
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:23.080]   Because a lot of screaming and a lot of crunching.
[01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:26.600]   I just added to my wish list one of my favorite novelists
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:27.480]   is William Gaddis.
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:30.080]   And they have done an audio version of--
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:32.960]   I just loved this book when I read it, JR.
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:35.040]   And this is 37 hours, 46 minutes.
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:37.160]   So if you wanted it for one credit.
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:39.360]   So you could see, maybe an hour if you're
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:41.080]   Night of the Living Dead material.
[01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:45.160]   If you're a fan of Pulitzer Prize winning literature,
[01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:48.360]   maybe JR for 37 hours and 46 minutes.
[01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:50.320]   But either way, you get it for free.
[01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:52.280]   So between the two of us, 16, 17 hours?
[01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:52.800]   There you go.
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:53.560]   That's our 18 hours.
[01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:54.920]   There we go.
[01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:57.480]   JR was a difficult read.
[01:10:57.480 --> 01:10:58.800]   I don't know how it would be as a listen,
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:00.120]   but I cannot wait to listen to it.
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:02.480]   It's one of my favorite books of all time.
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:09.680]   And if they'll finally do David Foster Wallace novels,
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:10.520]   you know, that's really--
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:12.000]   Oh, God.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:15.000]   Who's going to do Infinite Jest as a audiobook, right?
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.680]   You could be driving a Prius, and you
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:19.080]   would blow a bigger hole in the ozone layer driving around,
[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:21.400]   trying to listen to all of Infinite's jest.
[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:24.200]   And you would have got a Humvee pickup truck.
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:28.480]   I can't understand why they haven't recorded that.
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:29.720]   Someday, perhaps.
[01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:30.880]   Someday.
[01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:35.520]   Our pick of the week, the night of the living dead.
[01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:36.400]   It's free.
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:39.120]   Just go to audible.com/macbreak and pick that up.
[01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:41.840]   But if you want something else, of course, there's 75,000 great
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:43.360]   titles waiting for you.
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:45.240]   A world of great literature.
[01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:47.760]   I just-- I think this is one of the best sites in the world.
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:50.720]   I just spend a lot of time even browsing around.
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:53.520]   I can't wait to this new David Kirkpatrick book about Facebook
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:53.960]   comes out.
[01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:56.320]   That's going to be a blockbuster.
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:59.520]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:02.080]   We thank them so much for their support of all the Twitch
[01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:03.320]   network.
[01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:05.080]   It's time for our picks of the week.
[01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:07.200]   And I'm going to give you a kind of an obscure one right
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:08.600]   out of nowhere.
[01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:10.520]   I was reading Hacker News this morning.
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:14.400]   And I saw this software had been released.
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:19.280]   And I said, hey, this sounds really very useful.
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:23.160]   It's called Colitis Scope from colitiscopeapp.com.
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:27.120]   Have either of you heard of Colitis Scope?
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:28.520]   Is this the one where you can--
[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:29.640]   It lets you--
[01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:31.200]   It's a beta.
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:32.840]   You can try it for free, by the way.
[01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:35.920]   It's the one that lets you do check.
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:38.240]   The difference is it's kind of like a--
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:39.240]   Oh, that's the wrong picture.
[01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:40.000]   There it is.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.760]   Diff in Unix.
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:43.280]   But it does it graphically.
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:45.760]   And it doesn't just do it for text files.
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:48.160]   It does it also for images.
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:50.000]   So if you've got two text files and you
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.080]   want to figure out what the differences are,
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:55.000]   it puts them side by side and highlights them.
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.080]   Very handy.
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:57.680]   But it will also do it with pictures.
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:12:59.840]   So what if you've modified a picture
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:02.880]   and you want to figure out what are the modifications
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:04.080]   to this picture?
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:05.200]   You can see the difference.
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:08.520]   It'll highlight on the screen where the differences are.
[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:11.760]   Or you can do a split screen and see the differences.
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:13.280]   And it really is--
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:15.320]   For somebody who does a lot of photo retouching,
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:16.320]   this would be very handy.
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:18.680]   For anybody who does a lot of programming,
[01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:19.400]   this would be handy.
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:21.680]   And frequently, I modify our website files.
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:23.720]   And I can't remember what is different.
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:27.720]   But it also has built-in GitHub SVN check-in.
[01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:32.640]   So if you are using a versioning system,
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:35.160]   this is a really great tool.
[01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:39.320]   It is not free, but you can try it for free.
[01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:44.800]   At colidiscopeapp.com, colida scope--
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:46.880]   and how do you spell colida scope is the question--
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:51.440]   colidoscopeapp.com.
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:53.720]   I think it's 29 euros to buy here.
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:54.840]   There it is.
[01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:57.520]   So a very neat program.
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:02.680]   It lets you compare changes in text files, images,
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:05.600]   and then use mercurial get or subversion
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:07.000]   to complete your workflow.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.440]   What a cool idea.
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:13.280]   And I might add that I was going to recommend this last week.
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:15.040]   Remember, we were a little short on time.
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:17.840]   But I have been using Chrome, which is now out officially
[01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:19.880]   for Mac and Tush.
[01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:23.760]   And while I do love Safari, I have to say Chrome is my now,
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:26.680]   my browser of choice on the Mac.
[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:30.480]   It's just-- maybe I'm a Google fanboy, but it's just fast.
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:31.840]   It's very slick.
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:33.880]   It has a lot of the features that I look for in a browser,
[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:35.680]   like bookmark syncing.
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:38.920]   And the extensions on Chrome are very extensive now.
[01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:41.120]   They really beefed those up.
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:45.160]   So if you're a Mac user, we've got now three really great choices.
[01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:48.960]   Firefox, which has gotten to be a little bit slow.
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:51.840]   Safari, which still I think is a frontline browser.
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:56.120]   But Chrome is winning my heart on all the platforms I use.
[01:14:56.120 --> 01:14:58.960]   Alex Lindsay, your recommendation, my friend.
[01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:02.120]   My recommendation for the iPhone is--
[01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:05.520]   so a friend of mine released a new application.
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:07.080]   And it's really fun.
[01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:09.320]   So a lot of us-- it was funny when I was in Africa,
[01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:11.040]   I was talking to someone at the airport.
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:12.760]   I looked down and he had a whole gun.
[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:14.480]   You've seen these little plastic cameras.
[01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:16.440]   The cheap Russian cameras, they don't make them anymore.
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:17.160]   They don't make them anymore.
[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:19.160]   But it's like there's this artist--
[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:21.080]   They give you a unique look.
[01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:22.240]   And it's a random look.
[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:23.560]   You don't know what you're going to get next.
[01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:25.160]   You don't know how it's going to come out.
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:28.800]   So that's what makes it from a certain artistic point of view.
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:30.880]   That's what makes this work.
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:34.880]   And so anyway, there is a new application out
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:36.600]   for the iPhone called Plastic Bullet.
[01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:38.880]   Now this is made by Red Giant Software.
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:41.960]   And it is the little--
[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:44.320]   is this related to Magic Bullet video editing?
[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:44.960]   Yeah.
[01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:48.480]   And so Stu Mashwitz is the creative director behind this.
[01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:49.240]   And hold on.
[01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:49.600]   Let me--
[01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:51.480]   Alex is going to take a picture of the picture.
[01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:52.160]   All right, you're ready.
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:53.200]   So there we go.
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:55.760]   And--
[01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:57.280]   All right, so here we got a picture.
[01:15:57.280 --> 01:15:57.760]   OK.
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:00.040]   And I know you guys are just some of you who are just listening.
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:01.560]   For those of you listening at home--
[01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:03.560]   I just took a picture of Leo being goofy.
[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:07.240]   And so here's what you have is it gives you a bunch of random--
[01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:08.960]   Here I can hold it up here if you want.
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:10.000]   All right.
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.320]   So it gives you three different--
[01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:12.640]   Look, four.
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:15.440]   Now if you don't like it, just hit the top corner.
[01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:16.560]   Just hit that again.
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:18.160]   So this is completely random.
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:20.200]   It's like, yeah, well, there's a lot of--
[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:21.400]   it does a lot of what typically--
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:22.560]   Oh, this is fun.
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:23.560]   It's really fun.
[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:24.840]   This is just another little filter.
[01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:26.000]   And it just gives--
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.560]   oftentimes you'll just find yourself
[01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:29.560]   to kind of a very classic--
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:31.560]   just something fun that you can use that is--
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:33.480]   So it isn't always a whole good look.
[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:34.600]   It's just a kind of--
[01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:36.320]   yeah, it just really gives you the--
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:38.320]   but it just kind of-- this is what these kind of cameras
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:39.440]   would do with the exposure.
[01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:40.680]   The folks that--
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:45.000]   I mean, Magic Bullet is an incredible plug-in for--
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:45.640]   Yeah.
[01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:48.040]   And there's bullet-- and there's looks, and there's photo looks.
[01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:50.280]   And there's a lot of different ways
[01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:51.200]   of putting this together.
[01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:51.720]   And it--
[01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:52.520]   Final cut.
[01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:55.520]   So there's a lot of other things that you can find at Red Giant.
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:57.520]   But this one is a fun little application.
[01:16:57.520 --> 01:16:59.520]   I think it's either 99 cents or 199 or something like that.
[01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:01.520]   And it's just a great--
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:03.520]   So they have an Android version?
[01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:05.520]   I don't know.
[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:07.520]   I don't know if they have an Android version.
[01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:08.520]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:09.520]   So-- but it's just--
[01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:13.520]   It's just such a fun little-- and I found myself shooting stuff
[01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:16.520]   in Africa and stuff.
[01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:18.520]   And you can, of course, you don't have to shoot something.
[01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:19.520]   You can-- it's something you might have--
[01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:20.520]   It's something--
[01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:21.520]   You can take existing photos.
[01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:22.520]   And just kind of run this.
[01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:24.520]   But you just don't know what the--
[01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:27.520]   I mean, is it completely random so there's an infinite number?
[01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:29.520]   Or are there just kind of a subset of different looks?
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:33.520]   Well, it's-- there's a-- I think that it's a randomly interacting--
[01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:34.520]   There's a lot of subsets of--
[01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:36.520]   So there's sliders that they're just applying.
[01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:37.520]   But it really--
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:38.520]   But--
[01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:39.520]   This is neat.
[01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:40.520]   It's-- I have found--
[01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:42.520]   Now if they would just put a better camera in the iPhone,
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:43.520]   it would really--
[01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:44.520]   Right.
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:45.520]   Maybe that's what's next.
[01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:47.520]   Well, I'd love to see-- I mean, I think Apple's going to put
[01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:48.520]   a better camera in.
[01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:51.520]   But anyway, it's a fun little-- really fun little application.
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:52.520]   And it's an easy buy.
[01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:53.520]   It's not just the whole guy.
[01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:54.520]   It's the Lomo and the--
[01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:55.520]   Yeah.
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:56.520]   Deanna.
[01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:57.520]   And it just-- it just really--
[01:17:57.520 --> 01:17:58.520]   I'm just saying that's a good example.
[01:17:58.520 --> 01:17:59.520]   What?
[01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:00.520]   It's a fun little product.
[01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:01.520]   Yeah.
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:02.520]   It's a fun little product.
[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:04.520]   And it's just-- and I think it's-- I think it's like 99 cents or buck 99.
[01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:08.520]   This is definitely one that is just really easy to throw on your iPhone.
[01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:09.520]   So definitely check that out.
[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:11.520]   Plastic Bullet from RedGiantSoftware.
[01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:12.520]   Yes.com.
[01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:13.520]   And it's cheap.
[01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:14.520]   Yeah.
[01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:15.520]   Cheap.
[01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:17.520]   And do you not go-- you're a pick, my friend.
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:19.520]   I have something for the iPad.
[01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:22.520]   I'm still sort of looking for a good case for the thing.
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:26.520]   I can't find one that really behaves the way I want it to.
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:30.520]   I want something so I can carry it around or that, you know, add 40 million more fingerprints
[01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:36.520]   to it, to protect it from getting scratched, and be convenient enough that it's just not
[01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:40.520]   a big pain in the butt and add all this bulk and all this heft and all this thickness.
[01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:43.520]   I mean, it's a beautiful-- and iPad is just a beautifully, beautifully designed thing.
[01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:46.520]   And I think that when you have to hard mount it and set the stupid stuff,
[01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:52.520]   and set the stupid, like, Soviet style, you know, Wilbur's picture frames for the thing,
[01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:53.520]   just to say that you put a case on it.
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:56.520]   I think that sort of blows the whole deal.
[01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:59.520]   So I'm sort of getting close to things that I like.
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:04.520]   Newer technology has this thing called the New Guard Clear and the New Guard Letter.
[01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:07.520]   Believe it or not, this iPad is actually in a case right now.
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:14.520]   It is this clear, like, shiny, carbonate shell that is absolutely precision molded to the
[01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:17.520]   powers of the back of the iPad.
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:18.520]   And it just clips on.
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:21.520]   There's no, like, Alaskics, there's no rubber, there's no nothing.
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:27.520]   It's just all the corners just sort of clip in to such an extent that if you want to take
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:32.520]   this off, you can take it off without breaking it, it's just that it will not fall off on
[01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:33.520]   a cord.
[01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:37.520]   And when you're using it, and this is the big problem that I have with so many cases,
[01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:42.520]   when you have it in your hands, it doesn't feel like you've got this extra skin on it.
[01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:43.520]   Right, that's the use of the Black version.
[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:45.520]   Yeah, and then they make a rubber one too.
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:46.520]   I don't know about it.
[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:49.520]   Well, see, that's not going to be kind of insulating.
[01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:53.520]   They make a silicone version, and that one I don't like because it's not the only one
[01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:58.520]   like that I've seen, because the edges of it just sort of like, they can't really, it
[01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:03.520]   doesn't like rubber band and just stick to the front of it very, very closely.
[01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:07.520]   So when you put it in, you have sort of a flappy sort of thing going on on all sides of it.
[01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:10.520]   That's sort of, it feels like the loose skin all around the edges.
[01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:13.520]   It's kind of like a foreskin for your iPad.
[01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:18.520]   That's not certainly not something that I said, but okay.
[01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:24.520]   Going for another demographic here, but again, I realize that now that you have a million
[01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:28.520]   dollar payroll, you gotta go for whatever we can, exactly.
[01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:33.520]   But, but, and I also, I'm concerned when I see these silicone cases that they might be keeping
[01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:38.520]   a lot of that heat in, you know, I mean, I, yeah, I don't know about that.
[01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:43.520]   It's, I've never had my iPad feel warm in my hands if, when I, you don't have any using
[01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:44.520]   it for about an hour or two.
[01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:47.520]   So I, I'm guessing that's pretty safe.
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:48.520]   So you like the shell though.
[01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:50.520]   I mean, the shell would be protective.
[01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:54.520]   I like the shell because it's, it will, well, it's, it's, I don't think it's really drop protecting
[01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:55.520]   it.
[01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:58.520]   It's so much as the fact that it'll protect the back of it from getting all scratched and
[01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:00.520]   scuffed up because we don't have something on it.
[01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:02.520]   If you're okay with the gang, it will scratch in the back.
[01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:03.520]   That's okay.
[01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:04.520]   It's so, it isn't effective performance.
[01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:07.520]   The other cool thing is that it is perfectly clear.
[01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:12.840]   So again, if you, if you like to, if you want to keep your iPad looking nice and pretty so
[01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:16.280]   that when the next generation comes up next year, you can need to sell it or give it away
[01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:19.720]   to somebody without even so you're giving them something that's been, it looks like someone's
[01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:20.720]   given birth to it.
[01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:22.520]   I mean, this, this will protect it.
[01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:26.640]   And also because it's clear, like if you have these window, window clings or something like
[01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:28.880]   that, you can just sort of stick it to the face of that.
[01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:32.840]   And now you have, you know, the silhouettes from Mystery Science Theater 3000, just beating
[01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:38.640]   it from the back of your thing, of your, of your iPad there because it will look like
[01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:41.200]   it's just like sort of embossed onto this plastic here.
[01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:45.800]   So I, I, that's the other, the other important thing about putting an iPad in a case for me
[01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:49.120]   is that you need to, I really think that if you are in this for a social group with lots
[01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:53.880]   of people who have the more, like tech conferences, it's a really good idea to differentiate your
[01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:58.320]   iPad somehow so that someone doesn't pick up the wrong one or if you go through report
[01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:01.800]   security, actually don't, you know, that's not a big problem because you don't have to
[01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:02.800]   take it out of the bag.
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:06.200]   But it's, it, when you have a, ten of these in the room that all look identical, you need
[01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:10.000]   to have something on that to make it look a little bit different from the rest.
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:14.240]   And so this is a cheap 25 buck way to not only protect the back of the thing, but also
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:19.240]   allow you to sort of customize your iPad pretty well without permanently marring the back
[01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:20.240]   of it.
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:21.240]   So I like it.
[01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:22.880]   Again, when you put it on, it becomes completely invisible.
[01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:26.880]   And that's exactly to both, to both site and both, and to touch.
[01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:29.280]   And that's the reason why I look at it.
[01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:30.680]   So you're going to use a clear one.
[01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:32.880]   I have to, I have a clear one somewhere too.
[01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:33.880]   Yeah.
[01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:34.880]   Yeah, you want to try a song?
[01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:35.880]   Yeah.
[01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:38.240]   You know, I, I have yet to find the perfect solution for the iPad.
[01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:39.240]   I have a big bulky case.
[01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:41.400]   I know it's Alex, you're using the Apple case.
[01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:45.720]   You know, I, I keep on looking at the other cases, but I, for me, the, the, the, the Apple
[01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:48.440]   case is, is just the smallest one and it doesn't.
[01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:52.000]   And I got to say that the, you know, even though I thought it was silly one and started
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:56.760]   just this little angle that Apple figured out here when I'm having the accepts, it tilted
[01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:57.760]   up.
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:22:58.760]   Yeah.
[01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:03.200]   And I think it's a big thing in my backpack.
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:22.580]   The problem is that my iPad co-exists with my laptop in the sleeve, in my cotta bag.
[01:23:22.580 --> 01:23:26.120]   And so right now, if it got any thicker, it would be proper.
[01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:27.320]   You know, this one is really nice.
[01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:28.320]   I do like this leather.
[01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:29.320]   It's got a tilt up.
[01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:35.560]   I mean, and I do like the fact that this one doesn't, I, I, I am, I, I, I definitely
[01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:38.600]   believe that to have a case that closes it and I have to admit it is mostly because in
[01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:42.680]   Africa, oftentimes I was in, in the country, I was probably one of only 10 people that
[01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:43.680]   had an iPad.
[01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:44.680]   Yeah.
[01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:47.880]   You don't want anything to look like an advertising that was not something that I was entirely
[01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:48.880]   excited about.
[01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:54.920]   I wish I had a hearing the iMac, but my friend Carrie sewed me a custom like iPad sleeve
[01:23:54.920 --> 01:23:59.840]   out of flannel that still like the best I've ever used because it's a nice little, it's
[01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:01.160]   a nice slip case.
[01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:05.480]   It gives it something, I don't feel as though I'm, I'm exposing it to Dustin, I'm just carrying
[01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:06.480]   it around.
[01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:10.160]   I don't feel like an idiot when I want to walk into the Chipotle, Chipotle, whatever,
[01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:13.760]   carrying it and it has a little pocket for my MiFI too.
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:15.920]   So that's a little piece of wind.
[01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:18.760]   So I'm just hoping for something commercial that's as good as that until then I'm going
[01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:21.360]   to be using the homemade solution.
[01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:26.000]   Fennel, it's like jammies for your iPad.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:29.040]   Well some great recommendations there, gents.
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:30.600]   Thank you very much for being here.
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:35.920]   We'll see you next on Monday for our live coverage of WWDC.

[01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:40.520]   Exciting times.

[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:31.880]   Andy and not co when do you leave?
[01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:32.880]   You said the weekend.
[01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:33.880]   Yeah.
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:37.600]   I'm leaving Saturday afternoon at rural rent or I get one day in San Francisco.
[01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:42.040]   I get one day at WWDC one day in Paluma and then I am out of there.
[01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:43.040]   Sounds perfect.
[01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:44.040]   Perfect.
[01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:48.040]   So I'm just going to say your San Francisco privileges have been revoked.
[01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:49.760]   You're out of here.
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:52.120]   And it's great to have you back Alex Lindsay.
[01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:55.000]   I really appreciate your input as always.
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.920]   We tried to run the show with that show but we just couldn't.
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:25:57.920]   Oh it's fun to be back.
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:01.160]   It's got a green screen studio we want to build with you somewhere.
[01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:02.160]   I'm ready.
[01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:03.160]   I'm just going to find a location to do that.
[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:04.160]   I'm ready.
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:05.160]   Yeah that would be for the iPad show.
[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:06.160]   That would be great.
[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:08.160]   Sarah and I are going to do it in this office.
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:11.160]   Well what we thought you know I really wanted to do an iPad show.
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:12.600]   I mean just begging to be done.
[01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:15.840]   What we thought we'd do is upgrade a little bit from what we do here at Macbreak Weekly
[01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:19.880]   which is simply a studio with us sitting around some via Skype, some in studio and do
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:20.880]   it out in the field.
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:25.160]   So what we want to do is have a green screen cove here that we can demonstrate the apps
[01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:31.080]   in and do some stuff in as produced pieces and then go out in the field with a live view
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:35.920]   which is our new really cool box that we it's what we used at CES and South by Southwest
[01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:37.080]   is what we're going to use at E3.
[01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:38.920]   Well let's us go out in the field using 3G.
[01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:39.920]   You played with it.
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:41.880]   We're going to Cinegier with it.
[01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:42.880]   We have one too.
[01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:43.880]   This week.
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:44.880]   Yeah.
[01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:47.800]   So we're going to take that out in the field and Sarah and I will do our live show kind
[01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:50.000]   of live from the field with these rolled in pieces.
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:51.000]   That's the theory.
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:52.000]   We'll see if it works.
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:53.000]   Sounds fun.
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.000]   But that's going to launch pretty soon.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.440]   We're working on that right now in fact Sarah's in the other room working on it.
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:57.440]   Fantastic.
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:26:58.440]   Yeah.
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:26:59.440]   So that's exciting.
[01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:00.440]   Watch for that.
[01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:01.440]   iPad today it's going to be called and then we'll watch sometime in the month of June.
[01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:02.440]   Fantastic.
[01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:03.440]   Thank you everybody.
[01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:05.440]   Now back to work.
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:06.440]   Break time is over.
[01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:22.360]   [Music]
