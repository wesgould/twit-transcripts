[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   This is MacBreak Weekly, the show that covers everything that's going on in the world of Apple.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   And really today there is nothing but the iPad. Nothing but the iPad going on.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Starting from my left, Mr. Alex Lindsay is here for the Fixacore.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   I don't have an iPad yet.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   I just want to point that out.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Okay, what we're going to do is we're going to narrow it down.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   So Alex does not.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Also joining us today from Liverpool, England.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   He's so excited about the World Cup coming up.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   I'm stereotyping. Mr. Don McAllister.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   I live. I could see it.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Good to see you from ScreenCastsOnline.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   That's the one.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   That's the one.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Yeah, I haven't got an iPad either.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   And you don't have an iPad, so I don't have any people to come up with a cuss house iPad.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   I don't have an iPad, so there's only one person who could possibly have an iPad in the bunch.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   We don't have a dog.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   We don't have a dog.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   We don't have a dog.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   And the Enocha, as he was making out with a...
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   It's a good dog.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   With a tag on its ear.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   I'm going to get you a biscuit.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   You're such a good dog.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   He's great. He's great patient.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Bestest dog ever.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   He's a great person.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   He's so good for us now because he has an iPad and we don't.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Huh?
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   What's that, Buster?
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   That's right.

[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Yes.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   You're good.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Yes.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   You're good.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Yes.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   You're good.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   You're good.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   You're good.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   You're good.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Okay.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   There you have it.

[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Annie once again from the Chicago Sun Times in the celestial waste of bandwidth.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Merlin Mann has the day off.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   He's on assignment.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Looking for an iPad.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Yeah, probably.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Do you think, who do you think has an iPad?
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.400]   Do you think that David Pogan want Mossberg and an Abig, an Abig, an Abig, an Abig, an
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.400]   iPad?
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.400]   Yes, not that I'm bitter.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.400]   They probably do, right?
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.000]   Annie, you're an actual journalist as opposed to those of us who play them on the radio.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Yes.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.640]   Do you think that Apple has seeded some of the premier press with an iPad so that they can
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.640]   get their review out?
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.640]   Buster.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.640]   Buster?
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.800]   I'm going to have to.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.800]   He has trouble opening the jar himself.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:19.800]   I'll be right back.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.800]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.800]   It's oh dear.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.800]   Okay.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.600]   I guess it's like I think no words need to be spoken on that.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.120]   I think it's like skull and bones.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.120]   If you say the words he has to get up and leave, it's in the Apple NDA.
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.920]   So I'm thinking, I think he might happen to have one.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.920]   It's a good happen.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:39.920]   I saw the videos.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:40.920]   Have you seen the videos?
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.320]   No, there's videos online.
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.320]   Yes.
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.600]   So there's videos Apple has posted the videos of kind of like their how to use it and how
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.520]   easy it is to use.
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.520]   And it is.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.280]   I'm at the Apple site now, a magic and revolutionary, a magical.
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.280]   I'm training.
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.880]   Wow, that's an interesting selling point.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.960]   It's magical.
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.760]   Expelliarmus.
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.760]   Nothing happens.
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.760]   Wait, wait, wait.
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.760]   You have an iPad.
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:05.760]   That's right.
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:06.760]   Good boy.
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.280]   Remember, he's going to be more of these later on.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.080]   Boy, good boy.
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.680]   That's sad when a good man goes crazy.
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.680]   I'm sorry, Leo.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.680]   We're saying something?
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.680]   Nothing, nothing at all.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.520]   Just looking at the iPad on the Apple website, this is a new tagline.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.520]   I don't remember this tagline, a magical and revolutionary product at an unbelievable
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.520]   price.
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.960]   So it's magical, revolutionary and unbelievable.
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.800]   So Apple saying that we cannot believe any information they posted on their site.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.960]   Yeah, I really wouldn't use the word unbelievable in a slogan, would you?
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.120]   When they say how well it'll work in these situations and how nice the interface is,
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.480]   we're not to believe any of that.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.480]   No.
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.480]   They've been just a disclaimer.
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.480]   They've legal cover now.
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.400]   Well, they say the price is unbelievable, but once you use the word unbelievable, I
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.520]   think I think it's safe to not believe anything.
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.240]   So now they've got these guided tours online.
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.760]   This is what you were talking about.
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.760]   So which one?
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.760]   Oh my God, you can drink coffee while using it.
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:03.760]   Look at that.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.760]   Look at this.
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.760]   A mug.
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.760]   Look at Keena.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.760]   Keena.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.760]   Okay, this is the one Alex says he's actually going to do his presentations.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:10.760]   I'm going to test my presentations.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:11.760]   For NAB.
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:12.760]   They work.
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.960]   I'm going to do my presentations NAB off my iPad.
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.360]   So did you order the VGA dongle?
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.760]   Keena on iPad has the most powerful presentation application ever made for a mobile device.
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.760]   Oh, come on.
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:23.760]   The superlatives are driving me nuts.
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:24.760]   Just for iPad.
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.160]   It makes it easy to create incredible presentations with photos.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.160]   Incredible.
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.160]   Okay, so far we've got incredible animations.
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.160]   Incredible animations.
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.160]   Just the touch of a finger.
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.660]   Look, I just, I don't need him to say anything.
[00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:35.660]   I need work to get started.
[00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.960]   Okay, we'll turn his sound off.
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.560]   Sometimes it seems as though these are being narrated by Jets fans.
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.760]   It's just so awesome.
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.560]   It's unbelievable.
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.360]   It shows you all of your presentations with a large preview.
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.360]   Yeah, right.
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:57.520]   Do you think they do like they do like they did with the iPhone and get really big hand
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:03.400]   models to make it a rather you'd want a small hand model to make it look bigger, right?
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.400]   Yeah, like your hands are too big.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.000]   And the iPhone they had big hands to make it look smaller.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Mm hmm.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Shows you other things.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.920]   The other question I would have is that they don't really have to give this actor like
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.920]   a working thing.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.560]   They could just give them a blue screen mock up or a square and simply say, I want you
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.240]   to start your finger there and drag it down there.
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.960]   Then I want you to tap that and tap that there.
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.880]   I'm always curious about how these videos get produced given the level of secrecy that
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.000]   Apple keeps this device under.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.240]   You know, it's one of those things that when we do a lot of these, this kind of stuff.
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.320]   This looks so clear and crisp.
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.320]   It would be very painful.
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:47.760]   It would definitely be possible with the right budget to do any of this stuff in post.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.640]   But if I could, I would do everything I could to make it work.
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.000]   How can they make it look that good?
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   It's true.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Well, you could do it.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.240]   The problem that you get into is what you're going to be afraid of is that it isn't the
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.240]   way I am.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.240]   It's not going to match his hands.
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.240]   Won't want.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.360]   Well, the way I animate it won't be identical to the way it actually works.
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.400]   And then people will be like, "Rang, rant."
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.320]   So it's easier to get this really cool.
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.880]   You gotta think it's real.
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.520]   So you want to resize it here and then you tap that one and it automatically sizes them
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.520]   to the same.
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.520]   Oh, okay.
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.520]   I want that.
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.560]   So there's a lot of little features in there that are better than keynote.
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.840]   I do a lot in keynote.
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:26.720]   It sounds like people should watch these videos because I mean, who would have discovered
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.720]   that?
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:28.720]   Yeah.
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.720]   No, no, look at this.
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:30.720]   Oh.
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.720]   Oh.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.720]   Oh.
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.080]   So, it touches a unique interface and Apple's never done touch before.
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.720]   And there's things that are on the iPhone and iPod touch.
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.720]   Right.
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.720]   But not on a desktop.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:45.920]   And so to see a keynote with a touch interface really kind of shows what touch me.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:46.920]   Yeah.
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.640]   I mean, I was watching this today and the thing that really amazed me, and I've seen the demos
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:56.120]   before, but it just looks so advanced compared to a Mac, even though it's a simpler idea,
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.960]   you know, using your fingers and just manipulating stuff with your fingers, it actually seems
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:00.960]   more advanced.
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:01.960]   Yeah.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:06.600]   And I'm sort of wondering if people start using the iPad, whether or not, you know, you would
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.160]   imagine that there'll be a halo effect and they'll go, you know, they want to switch
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.160]   to the Mac.
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.160]   Actually, it's not going to be disappointed.
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:15.040]   It's actually a, it could be a downward step because, you know, they've got this.
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.640]   Do they have to do so?
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.320]   Maybe a conspiracy theory here, the reason we haven't seen MacBook Pros is because they
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.640]   will be touchscreen and they're waiting until, because if they made it touch, then they could
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:29.640]   put these features into, you know, they have to have multi touch on the screen, right?
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:30.640]   I don't know.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:31.640]   I mean, I mean, Apple doesn't have to.
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.840]   Apple doesn't do things in a half way.
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:37.520]   I mean, they had so many opportunities to do a tablet Mac that just, those just simply,
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.480]   we're going to repackage a MacBook and a tablet and a touch interface.
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.480]   They didn't do it.
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.760]   And we're not going to do that.
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.600]   So I don't know if they, if they ever did it.
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.520]   I really think it really does look like they have two different product lines going on
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:49.520]   there.
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.520]   Conspiracy theory number two.
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:55.840]   They, yeah, they have two product lines and one is going to slowly eclipse the other.
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.320]   And it's not the one we want.
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:02.160]   Now, I think absolutely that the touchpad, the iPhone and the iPad is the future of Apple.
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:08.080]   I think that their desktop Mac, I think most of us will have a long time to get to play,
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.920]   you know, continue to use our Mac Pros and our MacBook Pros and everything else.
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:18.280]   And, but I think there's maybe, you know, 10, maybe a 10 year cycle before we're more
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.280]   moving towards this.
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.520]   I think this is really the beginning of a new kind of computing.
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.240]   And I think it is the future.
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:28.920]   Only the video definitely makes it look like this works far better than any Android device
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.440]   I've ever seen.
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:37.480]   I mean, I just, I have no confidence really in their ability to get any in Google's ability
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:42.280]   to translate this interface from something that is simply functional and practical to
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:45.160]   something that really, really works exceptionally well.
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:49.680]   I think this is the price of settling.
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:55.760]   So, what about you, Don, you do screencasts online, you do a lot of Mac screencasts.
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:01.120]   I can imagine you looking at this saying, this would be a nice way.
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.880]   Yeah, nice little feature.
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.200]   Yeah, I can't wait.
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.800]   I mean, there's a technical thing I need to get over as to how we actually capture the
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:07.800]   video.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:08.800]   Right.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.720]   I'm hoping I can do that with a hardware device so I can actually capture the video coming
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:11.720]   out of the machine.
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:15.240]   But until we actually get one and we can understand, you know, how that's going to work and do
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.240]   that.
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.720]   Because I don't know whether you're going to be able to see the interface.
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:18.720]   That's the thing that I'm not sure.
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.720]   It appears.
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.000]   I ordered that VGA dongle.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.880]   It's going to arrive Saturday when my iPad arrives.
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.320]   Believe me, first thing I'm doing is plugging it in to see what I can get.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.400]   I don't think you're going to see the interface.
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:33.200]   I think what's going to happen is that it's going to be applications can output an output
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.200]   of function.
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:39.760]   Every time we've seen them connect it to a TV, there's something different on the iPad
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:40.920]   than there is on the TV.
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.680]   So I don't think it's ever mirroring the TV.
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:43.680]   Okay.
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.000]   So when you were looking closely at Steve's presentation, there was something else on that
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   thing.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.440]   When you hit it, it was sending something different.
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:55.040]   Like when you watch the keynote one, what it does is it sends the presentation forward,
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.680]   but they're seeing something completely.
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:59.320]   You're seeing the controller on your--
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:03.080]   Well, but that you can do with keynote anyway, which is, you know, I mean, I would do it
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.080]   on a--
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.080]   I don't think it's mirroring.
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:08.680]   I don't think it'll mirror the interface because the iPhone doesn't mirror the interface.
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.720]   But the iPhone doesn't have video out.
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.120]   They don't have that dongle.
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.080]   You should be able to do video out, I think, on it.
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.080]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.080]   They sell a dock to VGA.
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.400]   I believe so, yeah.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.280]   Oh, that's news to me.
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.280]   But it doesn't do that.
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:23.280]   I don't think that--
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:24.280]   But it, like, plays your videos.
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.000]   The iPhone 1 isn't a VGA dock.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   No, no, it's a little plug.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.600]   It's a plug that goes on the top.
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.960]   It's just going to have-- that's also available on the iPad.
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:32.960]   This is something different.
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.520]   This is a dock connector to VGA.
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.480]   And so the real question is, what are we going to see?
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.480]   Andy, you've got one.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.480]   What do you think?
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.480]   Moving right along.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:42.480]   I keep trying.
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.480]   Let me put it like-- let me put it back to the end.
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:47.960]   Let me put it this way.
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.720]   I'll explain something very, very carefully that.
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.840]   I think that as soon as I say this, everybody
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.720]   will understand the correctness of this statement,
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.360]   knowing me very, very well.
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:57.880]   Two things.
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.880]   Number one, either I have one and I don't.
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.720]   If I didn't have one, especially like four days
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.000]   before the release, I really want people to think
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:06.560]   that I have one.
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.600]   Because if they think I don't have one,
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.480]   that's not as fun as people think that I have one.
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.240]   It makes me look like a really big guy.
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.200]   If I make people think that I have one.
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:18.440]   Number two, I make this pledge to everybody.
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.320]   Everybody in this conversation, all these listeners,
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:24.000]   and all these viewers that I guarantee you that the moment
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.080]   that I have an iPad, the moment that I'm
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.560]   free to talk about having an iPad, which may not be both true
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:35.200]   until April 3, I'm going to be such a total about it.
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:40.000]   I mean, if I had the ability to, like, any time before the release
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.120]   date on Thursday, prove that I have an iPad and other people
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.840]   don't, you will see me--
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.800]   I'll make like an iPad cod piece and mark down the middle
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:51.040]   of the street singing like a very song if I have one.
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.960]   You don't--
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.000]   I am that small and petty.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.440]   Odd piece related, but I mean, just in terms of ego.
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:57.800]   So--
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:58.960]   Yeah.
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:12:59.960]   So it would be--
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:00.960]   It would be so hard.
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:04.960]   I'm perfectly happy with people believing that I have one.
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.360]   Because, again, if I don't have one,
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.320]   doesn't that make me look good?
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.120]   I do have two minutes to be very hard.
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.200]   Oh, look.
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.280]   Oh, National Geographic.
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.440]   I thought he was going to make the little National Geographic
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.800]   icon that we were going on and on about that.
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:17.160]   He didn't.
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.360]   He didn't.
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.800]   So is anybody watched these videos and learned anything
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.800]   from them that we didn't know before?
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.080]   I learned how to scale two images.
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:25.720]   Yeah, that's cool.
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.680]   Yeah, I was like, hang around.
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.840]   I was glad to see the presentation in keynote
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.400]   that you do have many presentation modes.
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:34.200]   So present his mode, although it's quite simplified,
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.200]   compared to keynote.
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.640]   But did you notice at the beginning of that one,
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:37.960]   how easily he picked it up?
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.760]   I think that's going to be a crucial selling factor.
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.480]   It seemed to levitate this weapon, to be honest.
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.200]   He jumped into his hand.
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.720]   Let's watch that again.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.280]   It leaps into your hand.
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.000]   OK, there it is.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.440]   There's the cup of coffee.
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:52.760]   And now watch.
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.840]   It's just with almost like one finger he lifted that.
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:56.320]   That's right.
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.400]   That's right.
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.240]   Cold fusion.
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:01.760]   It's possibly light at an unbelievable cost.
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:02.360]   It's unbelievable.
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.200]   It's amazing.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.720]   See, there's no audio in this.
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:07.920]   You can't hear the hovercraft.
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:11.280]   Oh, fans, look at that.
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:12.840]   Sorry, Andy.
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.640]   Going back to the unbelievable price.
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.240]   We still don't believe it here in the UK,
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.520]   because we still haven't got a price for it in the UK.
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:21.560]   We're still priceless and release dateless, as well.
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.640]   They just say it's the late April.
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:24.600]   But still no price.
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.320]   And I think I read somewhere yesterday
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.240]   that they're not actually going to announce the price
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.280]   until the release date itself.
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:31.880]   So there's a possibility that we won't even
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.120]   be able to pre-order over here.
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.160]   So we just have to get, turn up the store and buy it
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.560]   when it's released.
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.480]   Yeah, just a bit of shame.
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.480]   There's some online columnist in Australia
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:44.360]   that is going to be acting as an iPad mule.
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.920]   That he's going to be at the fifth avenue store,
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.920]   buying as many as he can possibly carry back to Australia.
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:51.200]   He's already checked with Customs
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:54.280]   that it's OK for them to bring 12 iPads back.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:57.560]   I think the last I checked, he's had an orders for 14
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:58.760]   and was cutting it off there.
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.920]   So he's going to be having this huge brick of iPads
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.360]   on the way back.
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.120]   Well, I'll meet him at the 5,000.
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.360]   He still has a phone.
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.360]   It's a funny as well.
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:09.680]   It's a fun bit of roulette because between the American economy
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:11.720]   and the UK economy, it's hard to know who's going to get
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:14.880]   screwed on the exchange rate by the time you actually buy it.
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:19.520]   This is, boy, it looks desirable.
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.920]   Oh, there's a little video playing back.
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.360]   That is one hell of a shin.
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.360]   Oh, baby.
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.760]   More shin, please.
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.800]   Nice shin, fella.
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:32.760]   He's wearing Steve's blue jeans and black turd neck.
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.240]   Now you do realize with all these videos
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.440]   that you can't say, but between each person's leg
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:39.520]   is a huge stick, a huge hole at that hole.
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.520]   Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.080]   Hold on, hold on.
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.280]   Oh.
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:48.840]   No, the actual-- the iPad itself doesn't move.
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.000]   It's permanently fixed in that position.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.120]   And even when they rotate, you're right.
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.120]   So you're right.
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.000]   See, they must have actually secured it
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.240]   with some sort of jig that's hidden by the iPad
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.520]   and the legs of the iPad.
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:00.360]   You're absolutely right.
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.280]   Here's a guy, because of screencast online,
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:04.200]   who knows, who knows.
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:05.000]   Yeah, look at it.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.800]   See, like even a rotating head.
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.880]   See, it moves slightly, but there's no way you can hold it
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.440]   that steady and just with your normal hands.
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:13.720]   It's more than just one of the other ones
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.000]   when it's absolutely rock steady
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.800]   while they're actually showing you.
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.560]   I think at one point, they actually take both hands off.
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:22.360]   This almost looks--
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:23.200]   How are they doing it?
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:29.160]   Maybe he did it for real and then they somehow add--
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.160]   Yeah.
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.240]   Maybe what they did.
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:35.000]   Since we know that because of the keynote demo in January,
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.840]   there's somewhere there is the ability
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.000]   to at least wire up one of these
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.560]   so that it can mirror it's output elsewhere.
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:41.880]   Maybe they shot it for real.
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:44.280]   They captured the video and then they simply put the video
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:45.120]   back in underneath.
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.120]   There you go.
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:46.640]   Yeah.
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.800]   Can I do that with the hands--
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:49.800]   I mean, you could theoretically--
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.680]   I mean, you could shoot this with a display.
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:55.400]   If you lit it perfectly, I mean, it could be a lot of light
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:56.240]   on him.
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:59.160]   You could theoretically set it up so that it would look like that.
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:03.120]   But look how steady the surface, the pad itself is.
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:03.960]   I don't-- I mean, who cares?
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.640]   OK, moving on because I mean, after all,
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:08.280]   that's not the most important issue here.
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.040]   What is the most important issue?
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.480]   That it's coming out on Saturday.
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:12.720]   Coming out on Saturday--
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:13.720]   You're getting two?
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.240]   Four.
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:19.720]   I ordered two and one of my staff ordered two.
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.120]   We had them shipped here.
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:22.840]   I'm hoping-- some people have already
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:24.040]   gotten their shipping announcements.
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:27.160]   Let me see if I've gotten anything from Apple today.
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.160]   I'm going to the store.
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.880]   Yeah, you can't do that now.
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:32.880]   If you order now, you get--
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:33.880]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:35.000]   Don't come until April 12th.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.240]   I have an appointment.
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.680]   I was really pleased.
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:40.280]   I was in New York last week.
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.760]   And of course, I had to make a detour to the Fifth Avenue
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.400]   Apple store because I felt as though if anybody was already
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.600]   camped out like a week and three or four days in advance
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.160]   to get their iPad, a device that could have been delivered
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:54.120]   free to their door exactly that morning,
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.720]   I would have to find out something about these people.
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.760]   Because these people need to be marketed to,
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:00.160]   marketed to with extreme prejudice.
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:05.600]   Because these people would be absolutely die hard, hardcore
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:06.600]   fans.
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:08.840]   But no one was there thankfully though.
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:10.880]   I guess I'm not going to have to go to the store
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:18.760]   because Lucky here delivers by April 3rd iPad Wi-Fi 16 gigabytes.
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.160]   Delivers by April 3rd.
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:20.680]   Exactly.
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:21.320]   Exactly.
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:22.320]   So many people are outside.
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.320]   Bye.
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:24.640]   Could be April 2nd.
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:25.140]   Could be.
[00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.160]   Well, people are getting shipping notices that they're going out.
[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.760]   I mean, it could theoretically get here earlier than it would be.
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.000]   Let me track this shipment.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   How have they done this before?
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.600]   Yeah, they did it to me every year they do this to me.
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:36.960]   Because they don't get the data.
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.600]   And then at least they call FedEx and say,
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:42.720]   you know that thing you've got tracking number.
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.000]   I could pre-sign for it.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.640]   Oh, it's UPS shipped on March 29th.
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.600]   So they're going to-- I wonder where it was shipped from.
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:49.040]   Where is it?
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.080]   Can you track it?
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:51.120]   It's just sitting in a factory.
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.280]   Is it sitting?
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:52.880]   Can we rob?
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:53.760]   It's in Louisville.
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.100]   It was shipped from Shenzhen, China.
[00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:57.100]   Wow.
[00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:57.780]   $329.
[00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:59.420]   It arrived in Louisville.
[00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:03.940]   And then UPS internal activity is going on right now.
[00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:06.820]   That means, ooh, look at Leo's iPad.
[00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:07.740]   This is great.
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.340]   Let's make sure there's no drugs or fur smuggled
[00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:11.740]   inside of this iPad.
[00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:15.260]   So everyone wants to get some iPads.
[00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:17.820]   Louisville, Kentucky, turns out the place to go.
[00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:20.980]   Look at status exception.
[00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:24.420]   Your shipment is currently within the UPS network.
[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:27.140]   However, an unforeseen event has occurred,
[00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.740]   which could result in a change to the scheduled delivery date.
[00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:33.700]   Like Steve said, don't give it to him yet.
[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:36.920]   So it is currently as of 330.
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:37.620]   Is that today?
[00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:38.260]   What day is today?
[00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:39.540]   330, right?
[00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:40.060]   It is.
[00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:43.100]   It is currently sitting in Louisville,
[00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:45.540]   along with about probably 240,000 other.
[00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:46.700]   How many do you think?
[00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:48.860]   The pre-orders-- nobody knows.
[00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:52.300]   Obviously sold out because April 12 is now the ship date.
[00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:54.100]   But how many, I guess, is the question.
[00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.380]   How many did they make ahead of time for that first?
[00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:57.500]   The rumors were 300,000.
[00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:59.060]   That's what I heard, too.
[00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:01.100]   And that might match kind of well
[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:02.420]   with what the bloggers are saying.
[00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:04.180]   There's that blogger who used the serial numbers
[00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:06.820]   and calculated pre-orders of around 240,000.
[00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:11.860]   Yeah, it's difficult to say, though, isn't it?
[00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:13.900]   I mean, an apple is so sappy that they wouldn't actually
[00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:15.380]   give you sequential serial numbers.
[00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:18.060]   And they'd find out some way of making sure
[00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:20.100]   that you couldn't actually work it out.
[00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:24.100]   But it still amazes me just how many they will have shipped,
[00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:27.740]   though, to people who are still taking anything on spec.
[00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:28.740]   We still haven't touched it.
[00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:31.980]   Although some-- I defer to those who have touched it in the room.
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.580]   But everybody else, there's only a couple of hundred people
[00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:35.220]   that have.
[00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:37.060]   We're just taking it on spec.
[00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:39.540]   Here's the worst part is I would have ordered one.
[00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:42.860]   I would have ordered an iPad without seeing one.
[00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:45.420]   If Apple had said, you have to order it.
[00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:48.340]   It'll come in six months and give us the money.
[00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:50.380]   I would have put the order down.
[00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:51.020]   Yeah.
[00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:53.180]   Because you know that-- you just know--
[00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:54.820]   I mean, I know how much I use my iPhone.
[00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:57.020]   I know if it's just a bigger iPhone to me, I'm happy.
[00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:58.100]   You could be disappointed.
[00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:59.580]   But you know, I'm glad I have a nuke.
[00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:00.740]   I'm glad I have a freaking newton.
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.780]   I'm glad I had a freaking cube.
[00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:03.780]   Right.
[00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:05.020]   I mean, I would have--
[00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:06.820]   If I'd had Elisa, I would have been happy.
[00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:09.780]   So even the flops-- I'm trying to think of what
[00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:11.260]   is the worst flop.
[00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:13.500]   Is there anything Apple's made that was such a flop
[00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:16.260]   that you wouldn't be just kind of glad to have one just--
[00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:17.220]   It was the earphones.
[00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:17.780]   The in-ear--
[00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:18.940]   Oh, yeah.
[00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:20.860]   The iPod Wi-Fi.
[00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:22.220]   Yeah.
[00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:23.860]   I have a high-- it wasn't that bad.
[00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:26.420]   It wasn't great, but it wasn't bad.
[00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:28.500]   But the headphones were crap.
[00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:29.460]   10 hours battery life.
[00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:30.620]   Do you think?
[00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:33.180]   Could it be?
[00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:34.820]   What's our guess by the end of the year?
[00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:36.660]   How many will Apple sell?
[00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:40.420]   I have-- I'm in a bet with John C. Devorek and a fella
[00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:43.060]   in the chat room that $5 million.
[00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:44.300]   Which is-- You're saying $5 million.
[00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:46.020]   Which is-- I thought was very high,
[00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:48.580]   and it would be very high for any consumer electronics device.
[00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:50.980]   But now the analysts are saying--
[00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:52.660]   As some analysts are saying, $8 million.
[00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:54.340]   I'm going to say $8.6 million.
[00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:54.940]   Shays.
[00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:56.020]   $8.6 million.
[00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:57.060]   That's my call.
[00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:58.260]   You got to be exact.
[00:21:58.260 --> 00:21:59.020]   $8.6.
[00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:00.900]   $7.3.
[00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:02.780]   I guess I want to win that bottle of wine from John C.
[00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:04.580]   Yeah, how about you, Andy?
[00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:06.060]   I don't see-- I don't know.
[00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:08.740]   It's such a game of incomplete poker.
[00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:10.980]   I would guess low millions.
[00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:15.860]   I'd be pleased and surprised if it did more than $5.
[00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:18.500]   Only because this isn't like--
[00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:21.620]   It has an advantage that the iPhone doesn't have in that.
[00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:23.980]   You buy it, and then you're out, and you're done for $500.
[00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:24.780]   No contract.
[00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:27.860]   But it has a disadvantage that the iPhone has.
[00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:30.380]   It doesn't have, which is the fact that people can't--
[00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:31.940]   People know what a phone is, and people
[00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:33.260]   know that they need a phone.
[00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:35.420]   People don't know what an iPad is, and they don't necessarily
[00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:36.860]   know that they need an iPad.
[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:37.940]   So--
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:40.540]   I think it's going to take a little while before they
[00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:42.620]   see enough of these in the field.
[00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:44.380]   I mean, Alex and I are both in the same boat,
[00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:46.820]   where we are going to be on a plane on April 4
[00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:49.380]   with iPads, pretty much sure that we will not
[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:51.140]   get a lick of sleep or a lick of our own time,
[00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:53.260]   because we're going to be giving iPad demos.
[00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:53.860]   Yeah, that's the thing.
[00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:55.860]   The drool factor on this is very high.
[00:22:55.860 --> 00:23:00.380]   I mean, I'm going to be on like six flights the following week.
[00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:03.900]   So according to Mashable, Asian suppliers
[00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:05.820]   have revised their shipping forecast-- actually,
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:08.380]   this is according to Morgan Stanley's Katie Huberty.
[00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:11.260]   Asian suppliers have revised their shipping forecasts
[00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:11.980]   for the iPad.
[00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:17.660]   They now expect to ship between 8 and 10 million,
[00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:20.660]   not in the first year, but by the end of 2010,
[00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:24.900]   in the first seven months, six months.
[00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:28.740]   And I do think that if those numbers turn out to be correct,
[00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:30.860]   we really are looking at a real revolution.
[00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:32.820]   A million a month, basically, they're saying,
[00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:33.820]   somewhere around there.
[00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:35.740]   Maybe more.
[00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:37.780]   We have a guaranteed revolution in that.
[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:39.500]   So many companies are getting behind this.
[00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:41.860]   There is not a major mobile computing manufacturer
[00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:44.460]   that does not have a plan to do some sort of a slate
[00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:45.700]   or some sort of a tablet.
[00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:46.780]   We're going to have Windows devices.
[00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:48.340]   We're going to have Android devices,
[00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:50.180]   and now we're going to have an Apple device.
[00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:53.420]   So even if people don't find that the iPad is to their fancy,
[00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:54.820]   the next time they have a few hundred bucks
[00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:57.660]   to spend on a computer, they now have an alternative other
[00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:58.340]   than a netbook.
[00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:00.260]   Now they have this very, very nice little device that
[00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:02.380]   all kinds of different companies are going to start a sport.
[00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:05.420]   You know, when I get older, my son actually--
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:07.300]   and he's six or seven years old, I'm going to be like,
[00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:10.300]   yeah, back when you were a baby, they used to have these things.
[00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:11.340]   You were called keyboards.
[00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:13.100]   And you were like, pop on them.
[00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:14.260]   And I said this to Jennifer.
[00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:15.940]   She said, because we were going on a trip on Sunday,
[00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:18.580]   and she said, pack a book, and I packed the Kindle.
[00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:21.620]   And I said, well, this is my last weekend without an iPad
[00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:22.860]   for the rest of my life.
[00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:26.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.460]   Because tonight we're all going to die.
[00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:31.180]   It's going to be that hard with you.
[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:33.020]   I'm going to get hit by a bus.
[00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:36.900]   But I guess what I was sensing is that just the potential,
[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:38.820]   not the guarantee, and I want to be really clear.
[00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:40.260]   We don't know.
[00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:43.020]   But the potential is here for--
[00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:46.620]   just as when the iPhone came out, there was this revolution.
[00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:47.780]   There's something significant.
[00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:51.660]   Now I like K-Chep in the chat room, Ken Sheperson, who said,
[00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:54.620]   it's an unbelievable revolution.
[00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:56.740]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:57.580]   He might be right.
[00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:58.660]   But--
[00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:02.060]   You know, I just-- the potential is here for something
[00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:04.460]   significant to change and how we think about technology.
[00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:06.540]   I mean, like in all-- a lot of my favorite applications,
[00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:09.340]   plant versus zombies, is supposed to come out at the same day.
[00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:10.900]   You know that I'm going to be living on that for--
[00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:12.340]   Omni-Graftful is going to be--
[00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:14.420]   it looks like it's going to be coming out.
[00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:15.380]   So that's the next question.
[00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:17.820]   Is how much are you going to spend that application?
[00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:21.220]   No, I've already budgeted like $200 for the first week.
[00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:24.220]   10 bucks for pages, keynote, and numbers.
[00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:26.060]   That's 30 bucks.
[00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:29.740]   Probably about $5 or $6 for plants versus zombies, HD.
[00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:30.220]   Why something like that?
[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:32.300]   And I think that-- I think Omni-Graftful is a--
[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:33.340]   It's going to be 30 bucks.
[00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:34.500]   He'll probably-- they'll probably--
[00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:35.500]   Yeah, it's $30 for that.
[00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:38.540]   I think so much in Omni-Graftful that I need to--
[00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:40.580]   like being able to have it on my iPad and be able to--
[00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:41.700]   I mean, the thing that I've noticed
[00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:43.140]   is that I'm-- with my iPhone, I've
[00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:45.580]   been much more willing to leave the house without my computer.
[00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:49.180]   With my iPad, I think that it's going to become--
[00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:53.180]   I only bring my computer when I have to do real production.
[00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:53.680]   Yeah.
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:54.980]   That's another point as well.
[00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:57.260]   I mean, people have always said that the iPads are,
[00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:00.020]   you know, consumption devices to consume your media.
[00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:01.780]   But I think when people start to use it,
[00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:03.780]   when they start to use it, when they see
[00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:06.180]   the power of the computer built into the iPad,
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:08.820]   that it is going to start to become a production machine.
[00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:10.620]   And we'll see lots more applications that will enable you
[00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:12.460]   to produce content on the iPad.
[00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:13.340]   There's not the mobility.
[00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:14.660]   You've got the lightness.
[00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:15.620]   And you'll be able to produce content.
[00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:17.340]   I have to say-- and we've been talking about this a little
[00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:21.340]   on this week in Google because Jeff Jarvis covers journalism
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:22.740]   and the changing face of journalism.
[00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:25.380]   He believes-- and I think he's not far wrong, really--
[00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:27.700]   that one of the reasons content companies like the Wall Street
[00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:29.980]   Journal love the iPad so much is it gives them a chance
[00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:33.460]   to kind of try to grasp back that--
[00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:34.700]   Premium.
[00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:38.020]   But the dying idea that their content is something--
[00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:39.660]   that the web doesn't change everything
[00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:42.460]   and that their content is somehow special and packaged.
[00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:45.300]   And he believes it's-- yeah, of course,
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:48.260]   all of these content companies love the idea of a closed channel
[00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:50.820]   and $17.99 a month for the Wall Street Journal,
[00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:53.660]   which is what the journal says they're going to charge.
[00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:54.460]   And I think--
[00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:57.740]   But ultimately, the web, which is free and free-flowing,
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:59.300]   is the future.
[00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:01.780]   And so this is kind of anachronistic.
[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:06.020]   But I think that the only thing about that is that I think
[00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:08.140]   that they could make the case if they're really
[00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:11.580]   putting unique content, not just the same content repackaged,
[00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:14.420]   but unique content that you can only get through your subscription
[00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:14.980]   to the--
[00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:19.060]   I mean, Don has a unique content that he provides
[00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:21.460]   for a subscription and people are willing to pay it.
[00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:24.260]   We have a subscription that we provide for people
[00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:26.740]   at the Pixelcore, that people are willing to pay extra
[00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:29.060]   because they want that specific kind of content.
[00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:31.660]   And so the thing is is that people will pay for this thing
[00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:35.540]   if you create unique content that is not easily found
[00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:38.140]   somewhere else, not the same quality somewhere else.
[00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:40.460]   And I think that it can be done.
[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:42.020]   It's just that they have to go-- if they're
[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:44.220]   going to go down this path, they have to go full force.
[00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:48.260]   They have to make the experience of the Wall Street Journal
[00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:50.260]   better than anything that you'd ever want on paper,
[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:52.220]   better than anything that you'd want on the web.
[00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:53.140]   And I think they can do that.
[00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:54.660]   But they have to-- I mean, they're not
[00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:55.620]   going to be able to mess around.
[00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:57.660]   If they do this halfheartedly, I think they're
[00:27:57.660 --> 00:27:58.460]   going to be screwed.
[00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:00.500]   It goes well with the French press, by the way.
[00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:02.660]   The French press--
[00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:03.420]   Oh, yes.
[00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:04.380]   Oh, you got it.
[00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:05.140]   Oh, yes.
[00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:06.660]   There's a lot of coffee involved.
[00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:07.860]   I think that what they're doing is
[00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:09.900]   they're pushing the idea of morning.
[00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:12.420]   It's a morning thing.
[00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:13.420]   I'm sorry.
[00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:15.340]   Oh, no, I was going to say--
[00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:18.460]   I mean, I don't think necessarily the web is where
[00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:20.860]   you have to publish newspapers and periodicals.
[00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:23.580]   I think that they're taking advantage of a new opportunity
[00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:25.140]   and that the consumer base is now being
[00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:28.620]   trained that professional, expensive to produce content,
[00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:32.820]   like books, can be packaged, sold under DRM as a download.
[00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:35.340]   And you will not be able to do anything you want to do with it,
[00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:37.260]   nor will you be able to get it for free.
[00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.540]   That's the lesson that consumers are starting to learn.
[00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:40.900]   They're starting to be trained by,
[00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:43.140]   not for all the content that's available online,
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:45.700]   but for things that they associate with professionally
[00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:48.100]   produced, expensively produced content.
[00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.220]   So this is an opportunity, especially
[00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:53.020]   with a publication like the Wall Street Journal,
[00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:55.140]   who stops selling themselves as a web service
[00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:57.500]   and starts selling themselves as a digital ebook.
[00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:01.580]   The Wall Street Journal is going to have a better chance
[00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:05.220]   of success than most because people don't necessarily
[00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:07.700]   buy the Wall Street Journal because they want to be entertained.
[00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:09.100]   They see it as a business expense,
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:11.180]   as a resource of information, something
[00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:13.660]   that they can make money off of if they buy this thing.
[00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:16.220]   What's going to be interesting is when you have big, big,
[00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:18.420]   national, and international scope papers,
[00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:20.820]   like the New York Times, when they move to that subscription
[00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:24.540]   model, will there be enough people willing to spend upwards
[00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:27.580]   of 80% of the regular subscription price just
[00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:29.220]   for the purpose of getting digital downloads
[00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:30.780]   of the complete issue every month?
[00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:32.780]   I think another big opportunity is for local papers
[00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:35.220]   because they're not going to have the ability to really sell
[00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:36.340]   as digital downloads.
[00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:39.420]   And that's where they can make the case that local advertisers,
[00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:42.340]   there is nobody that's going to be covering local politics
[00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:44.540]   the way that we do because the New York Times has suddenly
[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:47.340]   abandoned the entire world and put Gompa in a paywall.
[00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:48.340]   We are the real web.
[00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:49.820]   We are where you want your ads to be.
[00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:53.020]   So it's one of those fights that we're just going to see who wins.
[00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:56.900]   Somebody in the chatroom saying, well, these content companies
[00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:59.140]   are going to wait and see and they're not.
[00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:00.220]   That's the thing that's interesting.
[00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:01.220]   They're jumping now.
[00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:03.260]   I think what we're going to see is that the free stuff
[00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:05.140]   that you get on the web is going to be the same stuff
[00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:06.740]   that you get in the paper.
[00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:08.460]   I don't think anything's going to change with CNN
[00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:10.740]   or New York Times or anything else on the web.
[00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:12.460]   They'll continue to put that content up there.
[00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:14.380]   But I think what you're going to, if they're smart,
[00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:17.820]   what you're going to see is a lot of extra content,
[00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:22.820]   a lot of higher quality content going into the iPad version.
[00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:26.100]   And I think when you see stills on the web,
[00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:27.620]   you're going to see more video.
[00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:28.780]   You're going to see deeper interviews.
[00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:30.940]   You're going to see deeper extras.
[00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:32.940]   I think that there's going to be a lot there
[00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:34.340]   that people who are very passionate about
[00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:36.860]   whatever that subject matter is can dig into
[00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:38.180]   and where we're going to pay for it.
[00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:39.020]   - I think it was there.
[00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:40.020]   I'm just going to do that.
[00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:40.860]   Sorry, go ahead, John.
[00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:42.540]   - Give Don a chance because he's going to go over.
[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:44.420]   - No, I was going to say people were disappointed
[00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:49.220]   at the launch when there was no real solution for magazines.
[00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:50.620]   I mean, there was the magazine application.
[00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:52.140]   I think it was the Wall Street Journal
[00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:54.060]   that came along and shown and people sort of saying,
[00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:56.980]   well, as every magazine now got to create
[00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:58.580]   their own application to deliver a magazine.
[00:30:58.580 --> 00:30:59.980]   And one of those might actually,
[00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:02.380]   that's quite a good thing because it gives the magazine
[00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:04.140]   publishers the chance to differentiate themselves
[00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:04.980]   between other articles.
[00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:06.780]   I mean, content is content,
[00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:08.980]   but the presentation of the content is also a big selling
[00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:09.820]   point as well.
[00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:11.060]   I mean, if you go into a magazine store,
[00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:12.700]   you see all sorts of magazines printed on different
[00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:15.380]   quality paper, different fonts, different methods
[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:16.500]   of presentation.
[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:19.060]   So really, the iPad is just the canvas for them
[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:21.780]   to produce their applications to deliver their content
[00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:23.100]   in the best way that they see fit
[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:25.620]   and to differentiate themselves from other content providers.
[00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:29.220]   So in some respects, Apple sort of hasn't given them
[00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:32.420]   a boilerplated type delivery mechanism for their newspapers.
[00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:34.020]   Yes, they've got the delivery mechanism in, by the way,
[00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:36.220]   they can get the bits and bytes down to the device.
[00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:37.580]   But they've left it to the content producers
[00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:39.180]   to actually develop their own applications
[00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:41.860]   to make these products that people will want to buy
[00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:43.780]   because they'll be valued to them.
[00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:46.060]   Well, and I think that there's a huge advantage for Apple
[00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:47.780]   that way, because if you develop your application
[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:50.220]   for the iPad and it becomes 80% of your sales,
[00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:53.180]   how much are you going to spend on the other devices?
[00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:55.780]   You know, that's the things, if Apple gets a head start
[00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:58.420]   and they've built all this work and most of their money
[00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:02.900]   is coming from the iPad, I think it blunts their interest
[00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:04.340]   in going into other platforms.
[00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:07.540]   The other thing is that one thing that I'm hoping to see
[00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:10.220]   is that pages, which you can add video,
[00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:11.500]   you can add all these other pieces.
[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:14.580]   What I'd love to see is if pages was able to export
[00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:19.580]   some kind of ebook document that incorporates multimedia,
[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:22.100]   it seems like a natural thing for pages
[00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:23.740]   to be able to export to the iPad.
[00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:26.900]   You can build a document in pages and export it out.
[00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:29.700]   Like it's all formatted, that includes the video.
[00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:30.540]   That would be--
[00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:32.700]   We don't know, but I suspect it's just CSS.
[00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.540]   You know, it's just the usual stuff, CSS.
[00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:36.980]   And since HTML under the code, and people know how to do this,
[00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:39.500]   it's basically building a fancy web page, I'm sure.
[00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.020]   And I think people know how to do this pretty well.
[00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:42.660]   And there are tools, there are lots of tools.
[00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:45.380]   What's easy about it is there's only one browser.
[00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:46.940]   Right, I hate browsers.
[00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:50.780]   I have to say looking, I've been watching this video
[00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:53.420]   on reading on the bookstore, and it just looks compelling
[00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:54.780]   compared to the Kindle especially.
[00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:56.100]   I mean, it's got all the features of the Kindle,
[00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:58.700]   but it just really looks compelling.
[00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:01.500]   I think that's fascinating to me too,
[00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:04.620]   the fact that this is the one, every book reader
[00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:08.900]   that I've tried out has, it's Jekyll and Hyde.
[00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:11.340]   It has the commercial bookstore,
[00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:13.300]   and it has the ability to read EPUPS,
[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:15.460]   or somewhat getting your own documents onto it.
[00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:16.900]   And you really, really want the ability
[00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:19.780]   to put any arbitrary unlocked file on it,
[00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:21.980]   but you also want to be able to get commercial content
[00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:22.820]   that you like.
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:23.660]   Well, we know now you can, right?
[00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:26.140]   Because they've said that they're gonna put Gutenberg on there.
[00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:30.460]   Well, the whole point, well, it actually even three weeks ago,
[00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:33.620]   when they updated the pages for iPad even a few weeks ago,
[00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:37.420]   they said that iBooks will let you use EPUB files
[00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:38.940]   and add that to the library.
[00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:40.820]   But the point is that you have to choose,
[00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:42.580]   every time you buy a commercial e-book reader,
[00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:45.060]   you have to choose, do I want to cast my lot
[00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:45.940]   with the Amazon store?
[00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:49.580]   Do I want to cast my lot with a Barnes and Noble store?
[00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:51.020]   All these other sort of things.
[00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:54.500]   With the, because Kindle, Amazon has already said,
[00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.420]   we're gonna be coming up with an iPad reader,
[00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:57.740]   and now we have the iBook store.
[00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:59.900]   I'm sure that every other commercial bookstore
[00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:01.780]   selling digital content will fall into line.
[00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:03.760]   This is the one electronic book reader
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:06.060]   that will read every single electronic book
[00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:07.780]   that's available right?
[00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:08.780]   Not maybe not most--
[00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:10.620]   In other words, in other words, game over.
[00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:14.180]   Well, if you got 500 bucks in your pocket, game over.
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:14.980]   That's the one you want.
[00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:15.820]   Yeah.
[00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:20.820]   Someone tweeted me that Seton Hill, I guess,
[00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:22.860]   is now is already getting ready
[00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:26.180]   to supply all their students with iPads.
[00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:27.020]   Seton Hall.
[00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:28.140]   Yeah, that's inevitable.
[00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:30.420]   Yeah, that's a high school in,
[00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:31.860]   Seton Hall's a high school in New York City.
[00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:34.540]   Yeah, I decided to stop buying books about two months ago.
[00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:36.020]   So when the iPad came out, I said, "Right, that's it.
[00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:37.220]   "I'm not buying any more paper books.
[00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:38.780]   "I'm gonna wait for the iPad."
[00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:39.980]   And there were a couple of books that I wanted,
[00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:42.500]   and then when the Kindle for the iPad was announced.
[00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:44.660]   So you're right, those three or four books that I want,
[00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:45.780]   I'm gonna buy it by Amazon,
[00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:48.780]   because now I can actually have it on my Kindle app,
[00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:51.020]   on the phone, on my Kindle on my Mac,
[00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:52.660]   and also there's now a Kindle iPad.
[00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:53.580]   It is Seton Hill.
[00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:54.740]   It's not Seton Hall.
[00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:55.980]   Seton Hall, which is a university,
[00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:56.980]   I'd never heard of Seton Hills.
[00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:58.100]   Heaton Hill is another,
[00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:01.260]   a private Catholic institution in Greensburg, Pennsylvania.
[00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:02.780]   I've been there, that's why I didn't say anything,
[00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:03.620]   but I've been to Seton Hill.
[00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:06.420]   I was like, I was like, I think it's Seton Hill.
[00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:07.580]   It's a private college for people
[00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:08.860]   who can't spell quite right.
[00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:10.220]   (laughing)
[00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:11.380]   Okay, apologies.
[00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:12.380]   It's not Seton Hall.
[00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:14.260]   All right, moving right along.
[00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:15.220]   Maybe Seton Hall will do it.
[00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:16.740]   I imagine that quite a few will follow.
[00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:18.580]   What's interesting is it's a small university,
[00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:19.700]   it's a really nice university,
[00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:20.780]   but it's a small university.
[00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:24.460]   It's not one we've seen, I don't think in the past.
[00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:25.700]   And so, like I said, already received,
[00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:27.220]   they already do 13-inch MacBooks.
[00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:28.860]   So, and I think we're gonna see this,
[00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:30.900]   a lot of those universities that we're doing 13-inch,
[00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:33.020]   the next rev, instead of using MacBooks,
[00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:34.540]   I think all of them are gonna be iPads.
[00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:36.940]   I think there's massive advantages in this.
[00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:38.300]   Right.
[00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:39.620]   Very, very interesting.
[00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:42.260]   All right, moving along.
[00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:43.660]   I, by the way, the number of people
[00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:45.460]   who are selling us in the chat room over and over again,
[00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:47.540]   oh my God, you're not gonna be able to get your iPad
[00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:49.140]   because Taiwan-based Elon,
[00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:51.540]   menu microelectronics has filed a complaint
[00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:53.260]   with the ITC alleging Apple
[00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:54.980]   infringing on its past patents
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:56.540]   and violating the tear effect,
[00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:59.060]   seeking a ban on imports of the iPad.
[00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:02.060]   You don't think so, Andy?
[00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:03.780]   Somebody wants a free T-shirt.
[00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:06.020]   (laughing)
[00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:08.660]   Dude, it'll cost us the cost of one stamp.
[00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:11.140]   You know, they just give us like a free iPod dock connector.
[00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:12.540]   It's something we didn't have before.
[00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:13.940]   It's worth the risk.
[00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:14.780]   It's God.
[00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:15.620]   So, it cracks me up.
[00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:17.660]   Look, one of the things that we don't cover
[00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:19.100]   very often in this show, there's a couple of things.
[00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:21.060]   One is rumors we've tried not to cover too much,
[00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:23.580]   although it's kind of hard with the way Apple sits
[00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:25.420]   on things not to do rumors.
[00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:27.980]   But the other one is lawsuits.
[00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:30.260]   I would love to see a count of how many lawsuits
[00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:33.700]   currently are flying back and forth between Apple and others.
[00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:38.060]   And it's virtually meaningless to say there's a lawsuit.
[00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:40.980]   At this point, it's certainly meaningless to say
[00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:42.980]   that the iPad will be held back.
[00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:44.780]   Apple didn't have a, and the other thing is Apple,
[00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:46.300]   I mean, they have so much money riding on this.
[00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:48.500]   I mean, they didn't have the iPad trademark.
[00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:49.900]   You saw the Fujitsu gave it up.
[00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:52.500]   Yeah, they, I'm sure that there was some truck of cash
[00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:54.820]   that went to Fujitsu.
[00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:57.620]   Yeah, we don't know how much,
[00:36:57.620 --> 00:36:59.980]   but Fujitsu amazingly, surprisingly,
[00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:01.100]   gave it up last week.
[00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:01.940]   What a shock.
[00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:03.780]   We don't have anything that we're doing with this,
[00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:05.780]   and they're willing to pay us hundreds
[00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:06.820]   or tens of millions of dollars.
[00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:08.100]   I mean, how much does Apple have in the bank?
[00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:10.580]   I don't worry about that kind of thing too much.
[00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:11.420]   Here's a lot.
[00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:12.260]   Take a dollar, get out of here.
[00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:13.100]   A lot riding on this.
[00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:14.860]   Interesting, another one, an interesting article
[00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:17.180]   from vouchercodes.co.uk.
[00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:19.820]   I don't know, maybe you know this site
[00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:22.020]   since it's in your neck of the woods.
[00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:23.620]   Right, I think I've seen people.
[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:24.860]   But what they did, which is interesting,
[00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:26.900]   is a little chart of the real cost
[00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:28.180]   based account for inflation,
[00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:30.900]   which is easy, anybody can do this, of Apple products.
[00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:32.540]   So if you bought the Apple one, for instance,
[00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:36.620]   which was $666 in 1976 today,
[00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:41.620]   that's $2,540, $10, $21,000.
[00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:47.900]   The first Mac portable in 1989,
[00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:50.580]   which sold for a ridiculous $6,500,
[00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:53.580]   that's worth really, today's money, $11,000.
[00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:56.020]   The Newton message pad, $1,000.
[00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:59.220]   The first iPad, which iPod rather in 2001,
[00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:02.180]   was $400, is roughly the same
[00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:04.020]   as what the iPad costs today.
[00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:07.220]   - A little more bang for your buck now.
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:09.740]   - Yeah, I mean, I think that's the point.
[00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:12.140]   A lot of people, it's funny because we had predicted
[00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:14.220]   much higher prices for the iPad.
[00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:15.620]   And when the price came out,
[00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:17.260]   because our expectations were so high,
[00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:18.860]   we said, wow, $4.99 is a good price.
[00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:21.580]   Then the rest of the world said, wow, that's a lot.
[00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:23.220]   But look at what the first iPhone costs,
[00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:25.660]   look what the first iPod cost, it isn't a lot.
[00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:26.780]   It's right in there.
[00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:31.340]   It's, I think, a compelling price.
[00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:36.140]   - Yeah, again, I mean, they beat it by $1, but they beat it.
[00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:38.340]   I think that if it had been $549,
[00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:40.140]   a lot of people would have to wait
[00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:42.860]   until they can make a really compelling argument
[00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:44.100]   for why they need one.
[00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:45.140]   This is within reach.
[00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:47.540]   It's also, I think the other important thing is that
[00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:50.540]   you wanna be just close enough to these $280 book readers
[00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:52.620]   to make someone think, well, what if we just waited
[00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:55.020]   another month, scraped up another $130,
[00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:56.180]   and went for the iPad?
[00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:58.580]   - We're gonna take a break, come back with more.
[00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:01.220]   There's a lot more news, including the weird meeting
[00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:04.500]   between Steve Jobs and Eric Schmidt at a coffee bar
[00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:07.780]   in Palo Alto last week,
[00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:10.540]   which we've talked about on every show except this show.
[00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:14.140]   But we will talk about it on this show as well
[00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:15.020]   in just a little bit.
[00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:17.580]   But first, I wanna get you some cash
[00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:22.580]   for your used gadgets at gazelle.com/macbreak.
[00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:27.220]   Gazelle is the place where you can recycle
[00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:29.680]   and resell your smartphones, your MP3 players,
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:31.740]   your laptops, gaming consoles.
[00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:35.380]   They figure that you listeners at Macbreak weekly
[00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:37.020]   probably have more junk lying around
[00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:39.380]   than you know what to do with, I know we all do.
[00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:40.220]   And what do you do with them?
[00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:41.780]   You hand them down, maybe you go on eBay
[00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:42.900]   and spend some time selling them.
[00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:43.780]   What about this?
[00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:48.780]   G-A-Z-E, double L-E.com/macbreak.
[00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:54.660]   Enter the make and model of your used gadget.
[00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:56.660]   See how much gazelle offers for it.
[00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:59.300]   Once you accept their offer,
[00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:00.180]   you enter your mailing address.
[00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:01.700]   Gazelle sends you a box to send it in.
[00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:03.100]   In most cases, they pay for postage.
[00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:04.340]   Now somebody sent me a note saying,
[00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:06.380]   well they didn't pay for postage for my G5 tower.
[00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:07.940]   Well, okay.
[00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:09.420]   That might have been a little pricey.
[00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:12.420]   But for you, the smaller stuff they pay for postage.
[00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:13.740]   You select the payment method you want,
[00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:14.980]   which is cool, PayPal, check,
[00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:16.580]   or an Amazon or Walmart gift card.
[00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:18.060]   In fact, if you use the Amazon gift card,
[00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:19.380]   you get 5% more.
[00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:21.820]   You can also ask Gazelle to donate
[00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:24.020]   the value of your gadget to a charity.
[00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:25.940]   And now here's a cool thing.
[00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:28.700]   But this is only if you go to gazelle.com/macbreak
[00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:30.380]   and are in your Kindle.
[00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:31.420]   If you've got an old book reader
[00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:33.380]   that you're now thinking, it's time to sell it.
[00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:36.940]   They're gonna send you a free Zag invisible shield
[00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:38.660]   for your new iPad as an extra bonus.
[00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:41.860]   But you've got to mail in your ebook reader within 30 days.
[00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:47.220]   And they've got a special deal just for Mac.
[00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:49.620]   This is, don't tell anybody, okay?
[00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:51.740]   This is just for you who listen to Macbreak weekly,
[00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:52.980]   it's a little reward for you.
[00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:55.980]   You can your nook, your Kindle, any other ebook reader.
[00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:59.060]   Let's see, does my Kindle One Power on successfully?
[00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:00.420]   Yes, is it free of water damage?
[00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:01.660]   Yes, it's in excellent condition
[00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:03.460]   'cause I only used it for a little while.
[00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:04.860]   I have all of the parts.
[00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:07.460]   Calculate the price.
[00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:09.700]   And it says this is what they'll pay you.
[00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:12.140]   Now, of course, $107, that's good.
[00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:13.460]   Now, of course, the deal is,
[00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:18.500]   if it is worse condition than you say and so forth.
[00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:20.740]   Notice, by the way, the price of the Kindle is plummeting.
[00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:22.340]   (laughing)
[00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:23.860]   They have this graph.
[00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:27.100]   Since June of last year, it's gone down 50%.
[00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:28.020]   No.
[00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:30.500]   Wonder why, what could that be?
[00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:31.340]   No pressure.
[00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:33.660]   (laughing)
[00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:35.220]   Because they know that the next edition
[00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:37.140]   of the Kindle is gonna be even more awesome.
[00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:39.500]   (laughing)
[00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:41.260]   Make sure you use the Macbreak bonus code
[00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:43.140]   to get that free protector for your iPad.
[00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:44.260]   Now through April 15th,
[00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:46.420]   I think that's a very funny promotion.
[00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:50.500]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com/Macbreak.
[00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:52.860]   Don't forget the Macbreak coupon code,
[00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:55.140]   the bonus code to get their Zag invisible shield.
[00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:56.460]   Don't just sell it, G-Z-E-L-E.
[00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:58.020]   And I really wanna underscore this
[00:41:58.020 --> 00:41:58.980]   'cause a number of people have written to me
[00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:01.580]   and said they've done this and they've been very happy.
[00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:03.340]   If you're a business school or organization
[00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:08.340]   and you want to raise money for your private,
[00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:09.700]   I'm sorry, that's the wrong one.
[00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:10.540]   Let me go here.
[00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:13.340]   If you want to raise money for your nonprofit,
[00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:17.900]   G-Z-E-L will give you a personalized gadget drive web page.
[00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:20.140]   Donors send in the gadgets.
[00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:21.260]   It's easy to get them to do that
[00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:22.260]   and then you get the money.
[00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:24.260]   And I think that's a great, great thing.
[00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:27.780]   So if you've got an extra gadget to get rid of,
[00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:31.540]   gazelle@gaz-e-l-l-e.com/Macbreak,
[00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:34.340]   we thank them so much for their support at Macbreak Weekly.
[00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:38.220]   So we talked about this now on almost all of our shows.
[00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:39.900]   We're the last ones to talk about it
[00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:42.660]   but I think it's Apropos.
[00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:46.460]   Eric Schmidt and Steve Jobs, hob-nobbing
[00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:49.700]   at a coffee bar in Palo Alto.
[00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:50.540]   Did you see the pictures?
[00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:51.740]   It's like a photo op.
[00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:52.860]   That's what I thought.
[00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:53.980]   Yeah.
[00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:57.740]   I find it hard to believe that they might just happen
[00:42:57.740 --> 00:42:58.580]   to meet up.
[00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:03.580]   Also, you know, when was the last time you saw
[00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:08.580]   a candid picture of that man that was not like as part of,
[00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:11.100]   he walked through Mac world expo floor
[00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:12.660]   or he was at this press event.
[00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:15.660]   When was the last time anybody caught him at a time
[00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:18.220]   when he did not expect to be photographed?
[00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:19.900]   They were sitting outside.
[00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:22.300]   When I think of Steve Jobs, I think of that,
[00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:23.740]   I think from the born identity where he goes,
[00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:25.580]   he made his first mistake and he goes,
[00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:27.420]   they don't make mistakes, they don't do random.
[00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:28.260]   Yeah.
[00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:29.340]   Yeah, there's always a plan.
[00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:30.780]   There's always a, you know, he goes,
[00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:31.940]   who's controlling him now?
[00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:32.860]   Scary version?
[00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:33.700]   Yeah.
[00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:34.540]   That's the best.
[00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:36.500]   You're sitting, I mean, two gazillioners sitting out there
[00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:38.980]   in the middle of the street having a cup of coffee each.
[00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:42.380]   You think the beat surrounded by protectors or whatever
[00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:44.380]   but it's very strange to have them.
[00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:45.460]   There's Steve has that covered.
[00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:47.260]   He dresses like a beat poet, so.
[00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:50.300]   Yeah, that's funny because, you know,
[00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:51.940]   he's wearing the black turtleneck.
[00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:53.140]   And the black socks with the tennis shoes.
[00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:57.100]   Black socks, tennis shoes, blue jeans, the Steve standard.
[00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:59.420]   Now, his motto, I thought, had a little fun with this.
[00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:02.780]   They got a body language analyst who used to work
[00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:06.340]   for the ATF, Janine Driver, to analyze the photo
[00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:07.500]   and compare it with other photos.
[00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:08.500]   She made a couple of notes.
[00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:11.300]   First of all, Steve Jobs left leg over right leg crossed.
[00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:14.140]   He says, "This is not typical for Steve.
[00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:15.900]   "He tends to sit with his legs open the only other time.
[00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:17.340]   "We've only other picture we could find of him
[00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:20.460]   "with leftover right was sitting with Bill Gates.
[00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:23.980]   "That means this is his guarded position.
[00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:25.180]   "He's not really comfortable.
[00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:26.660]   "But the best part was, she said,
[00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:29.020]   "Note Eric Schmitt's shoulders.
[00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:30.220]   "They're hunched."
[00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:31.740]   See how they're hunched like that?
[00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:35.260]   He said, "We only see this with criminals
[00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:36.980]   "who are faced with law enforcement.
[00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:40.100]   "My conclusion says Janine Driver of the ATF.
[00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:43.100]   "Eric Schmitt is terrified of Steve Jobs."
[00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:47.820]   I bet they didn't plan on that with a photo op.
[00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:49.660]   - Is this woman the CEO whisper or something?
[00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:50.660]   (laughs)
[00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:52.260]   - Then there was a lot of question
[00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:54.340]   about the black thing in front of them.
[00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:56.260]   What could that be?
[00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:58.060]   - Well, it turns out it's just a menu.
[00:44:58.060 --> 00:44:59.740]   (laughs)
[00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:01.660]   - Bill. - And finally,
[00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:05.180]   a little more sleuthing turned up
[00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:07.140]   that this coffee shop, Calofia,
[00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:09.540]   is owned by a former executive chef at Google.
[00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:14.620]   So I'm thinking, this was planned.
[00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:16.140]   I mean, you don't think that Steve's shop
[00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:19.020]   and fraternal ex happens to walk into this coffee shop.
[00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:19.860]   There's Eric.
[00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:23.540]   Hey Eric, let's go sit outside on the sidewalk
[00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:25.940]   and have a cup of coffee.
[00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:29.660]   - I mean, the press has been going a bit strong
[00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:32.780]   on the Google, well, the main personal as well,
[00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:35.700]   there's been lots of articles about the animosity
[00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:37.180]   between Google and Apple,
[00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:39.500]   but more specifically between the two CEOs,
[00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:41.140]   with Eric being on the board
[00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:44.140]   and then the Google phone coming out, et cetera.
[00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:47.140]   And the press has tried to make it a very personal thing
[00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:48.500]   between the both CEOs.
[00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:50.740]   So this is probably a really easy way.
[00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:53.340]   Forget about press releases, forget about the denials
[00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:55.860]   and whatever, let's just go somewhere in public,
[00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:57.700]   have a cup of coffee and then that will
[00:45:57.700 --> 00:45:59.340]   trumpet the end to those particular rumors
[00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:00.300]   and we'll just get on with it now.
[00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:01.940]   So that might just be that.
[00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:03.700]   - Who wears black socks with tennis shoes?
[00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:04.860]   Come on really.
[00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:05.820]   I mean, let's be honest.
[00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:08.940]   - Well, the interesting thing is as we look at this,
[00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:12.620]   it's interesting timing because the rumors
[00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:15.220]   that are starting to build up is that next week,
[00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:18.820]   we may see an ad network from Apple.
[00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:20.780]   - Yeah, I mean, it's very clear that Apple is doing
[00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:22.500]   everything they can to go after Google.
[00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:26.220]   They tried to buy AdMob, didn't they let inexplicably
[00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:27.980]   let the 30 day.
[00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:28.820]   - 45 day.
[00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:30.900]   - 45 day waiting period expire,
[00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:32.620]   Google immediately snaps up AdMob
[00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:34.300]   for more than Apple was offering.
[00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:35.300]   - Right.
[00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:36.620]   - Basically stealing it from them.
[00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:39.380]   So Apple bought another kind of also ran company
[00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:42.700]   and now is reportedly gonna do a mobile ad network.
[00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:45.300]   - I mean, it could be going right after Google.
[00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:48.140]   - Well, and the thing is, they could be,
[00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:51.820]   I think that they'll do it in the Apple way,
[00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:55.900]   which is more refined, more designed, more focused
[00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:59.060]   than text search items.
[00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:01.300]   And again, it doesn't have to be,
[00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:03.060]   it doesn't have, they don't have to get a majority.
[00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:07.180]   The issue is in the same reason that iPad and iPhone
[00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:09.260]   consumers are very valuable is the same way
[00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:10.980]   that when you open up a magazine,
[00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:14.500]   I get like LL Bean and Travel Smith and whatever,
[00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:16.380]   all those magazines at home.
[00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:18.620]   And the whole front, the front three quarters
[00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:20.460]   is women's stuff.
[00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:21.300]   Why is that?
[00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:24.140]   Because they buy more stuff and they spend more money
[00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:25.700]   on each piece of that stuff than the men do.
[00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:27.260]   So we get shoved into the back.
[00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:30.260]   In the same way, people who buy iPads and iPhones
[00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:32.260]   buy more stuff and they spend more money,
[00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:36.420]   they are very valuable segment of the market.
[00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:40.140]   And Apple really owning that and shutting other people out
[00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:45.140]   theoretically could really be a problem five years from now,
[00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:48.260]   10 years from now for these guys.
[00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:51.100]   In the same way that everyone thought
[00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:54.500]   that it was a big deal that, oh, Apple needs flash.
[00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:57.300]   And now it's really much more of an Adobe needs flash
[00:47:57.300 --> 00:47:59.460]   to be on the iPhone.
[00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:00.740]   - Some other stories real quickly,
[00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:03.460]   10 point snow leopard, new snow leopard update,
[00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:04.780]   not for other versions of leopard.
[00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:05.940]   They took the blood out.
[00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:07.340]   - Yeah, they took the blood out evidently.
[00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:09.660]   There's no more blood in the snow leopard.
[00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:11.740]   They only have one machine with snow leopard on it.
[00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:14.060]   So I didn't see an update.
[00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:16.460]   But what's in this, besides the,
[00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:18.100]   there is blood in snow leopard, what are you talking about?
[00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:19.940]   - So there was, there was evidently a report of,
[00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:21.940]   if you look at the side by side images,
[00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:25.620]   the new snow leopard, there was a trace amount of blood.
[00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:27.100]   - In the leopard's mouth?
[00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:28.020]   Like it just ate something?
[00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:28.860]   - Like it just ate something.
[00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:29.700]   - You know, it must have just eaten.
[00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:30.700]   - I mean, you know, if you're gonna take a picture
[00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:32.300]   of a leopard, you're gonna be happy.
[00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:33.460]   You want him to be happy.
[00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:34.460]   He's a snow leopard.
[00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:35.540]   - You get them close to him.
[00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:37.300]   You want him not to be hungry because,
[00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:39.220]   you know, the photographer will look tasty.
[00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:40.460]   - So you can, the photographer could operate
[00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:42.140]   that camera one handed, a one hand.
[00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:45.060]   - Yeah, so, so the, so it, so evidently the,
[00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:49.420]   the tiger had been fed recently or had eaten recently.
[00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:52.340]   And, and so that they didn't quite catch that
[00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:53.180]   the first time around.
[00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:54.860]   And so they caught it on this rev.
[00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:55.700]   - So funny.
[00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:56.940]   - Although I kind of like the,
[00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:58.780]   I think the blood was kind of, you know.
[00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:03.020]   - So 10.6.3 more to the point eliminated quite
[00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:04.060]   a few security flaws.
[00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:05.580]   And there is an update here.
[00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:07.340]   Let's just, this is, I don't see the blood.
[00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:08.700]   So we're gonna zoom in.
[00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:11.140]   See if you, oh, well, maybe, I don't know.
[00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:15.300]   Okay, left the new leopard.
[00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:16.780]   Right the old leopard.
[00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:17.860]   - Okay.
[00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:19.740]   - Where's the blood on his lips?
[00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:21.380]   - On the corner of the mouth on the right there.
[00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:22.300]   - Yeah.
[00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:24.900]   - Yeah, they certainly have changed something.
[00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:25.740]   Same picture.
[00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:28.260]   They've, you know, it looks like they just went in a,
[00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:31.380]   Lightroom and just touched it up or aperture, I guess.
[00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:33.300]   - No, but I think it's on the, on the right side.
[00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:36.700]   - Yeah, there's a little blood in the corner of the mouth there.
[00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:37.540]   But that's not blood.
[00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:39.260]   That's just leopard lip.
[00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:40.580]   - It's leopard lip.
[00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:41.500]   It's got a bigger lip.
[00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:42.940]   They, you know, they did the same thing.
[00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:43.780]   They did the K-Moss.
[00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:45.540]   They just shrunk the lip a little bit there.
[00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:46.380]   - Exactly.
[00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:47.460]   - Yeah, that's it.
[00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:48.300]   They made it, you know what?
[00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:49.220]   They made them smile.
[00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:52.620]   - You feel, he looks a little bit more like a smile.
[00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:54.100]   - He's probably just back to kill.
[00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:54.900]   I think he's smiling too.
[00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:56.340]   (laughing)
[00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:58.020]   - More to the point.
[00:49:58.020 --> 00:49:59.860]   - Who you Mr. Snow Rabbit.
[00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:01.700]   - You did.
[00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:02.540]   - You get the hell off my lawn.
[00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:03.380]   - You did.
[00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:06.860]   - More to the point that quite a few updates,
[00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:09.180]   besides the blood security updates,
[00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:11.220]   which also be available for other versions,
[00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:13.980]   but just not as a 10.6.3 update.
[00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:18.300]   This is a 92 vulnerability patch here.
[00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:20.800]   A third of them critical vulnerabilities.
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:23.780]   Holy cow.
[00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:26.100]   10.5 and 10.6 will get this.
[00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:30.080]   This is the largest patch ever in the history of Apple.
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.400]   - Wow.
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:35.320]   - It was about 430 megabytes, I think.
[00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:36.160]   The actual patch.
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:37.160]   - Well, mind, you know,
[00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:38.080]   combo was even bigger.
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:41.080]   - Mine was 270, I think.
[00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:42.680]   So I guess it just depends.
[00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:45.400]   Today's security roll-up fixed flaws
[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:47.000]   in 42 different applications
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.240]   or operating system components
[00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:50.040]   from AppKit and application firewall
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:52.240]   to Unzip and X11.
[00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:54.240]   18 of the vulnerabilities were specific
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:55.920]   to the older Leopard operating system.
[00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:58.040]   29 specific to Snow Leopard,
[00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:00.360]   remaining 45 affected both.
[00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:05.720]   Unbelievable, huge, huge patch.
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:10.640]   More than 40% were accompanied by the chilling phrase,
[00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:14.600]   may lead to arbitrary code execution,
[00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:16.680]   which is of course, if you know about security,
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:17.840]   not something you want.
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:22.280]   Nine quick time patches.
[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:24.920]   Nine, all rated critical.
[00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:27.000]   This, it seems like Apple's been saving up.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   - Yeah, it was a huge thing.
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:30.840]   - Yeah.
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:35.640]   - You know, it's that they might have been,
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:37.200]   a lot of them might have been related.
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:39.120]   - You know, it's interesting.
[00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:40.960]   They do that Pwn to own,
[00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:43.280]   Kansec West does this in Vancouver every year
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:46.160]   and Charlie Miller, who's always there every time,
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:47.600]   won again.
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:49.400]   And I think the only browser
[00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:51.800]   that didn't get hacked was Chrome.
[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:54.920]   Safari fell first and he did it again
[00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:56.880]   and he says Apple has not patched
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:59.640]   the vulnerability I used on Wednesday.
[00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:02.880]   The Pwn to own bug is still there.
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:03.960]   - Wow.
[00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:04.840]   I think, well, the thing of anything,
[00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:07.560]   it sort of underscores the correctness
[00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:10.680]   of the rationality of Apple's approach sometimes
[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:12.040]   about sandboxing everything
[00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:14.280]   and limiting what one program can do
[00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:17.520]   with the opportunities to interact with other programs.
[00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:20.120]   The thing that Chrome did,
[00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:21.720]   that made Chrome so successful was the fact
[00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:24.080]   that everything is so completely and tightly sandboxed.
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:26.080]   You can get into one tab,
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:27.960]   malicious code, get into one tab of the browser,
[00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:30.680]   but it can do nothing to influence any other tab.
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:34.640]   So, I mean, if you're digging for a scrap of pride
[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:37.600]   as an Apple user to come out of this,
[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:39.760]   it's that, well, maybe there is an upside to this idea of,
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:42.800]   well, we're not gonna allow random apps to have access
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:44.840]   to any directory in the system.
[00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:46.400]   We're not gonna allow just arbitrary code
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:48.360]   to be loaded onto the device, that sort of stuff.
[00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:49.200]   - Right.
[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:50.840]   - Actually, I have to vote after that.
[00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:54.600]   That entire big update, everyone actually seen one change
[00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:57.760]   to the OS, one visible change.
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:01.720]   And I've gotta give @Vinco on Twitter.
[00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:02.560]   He's the one who spotted that,
[00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:04.000]   so I just picked it up on his tweet.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.040]   But if you're looking quick time X,
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:07.200]   now if you try to fast forward anything, you can quick time X,
[00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:09.480]   you've got a tiny little times two or times four
[00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:11.360]   indicated in the top right hand corner,
[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:13.680]   left hand corner of the quick time X window.
[00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:16.320]   And for that enormous cryptic security patch
[00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:17.960]   and bug fix release,
[00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:19.560]   that's the only thing I've actually been able to see
[00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:20.480]   physically on the server.
[00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:25.120]   - Well, no stuff going on in the line operating system.
[00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:27.600]   - And you have to say that pretty typically
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:30.880]   when Apple ships like a new iPod or new anything,
[00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:33.000]   they do a big update to prepare for that.
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.640]   And I presume that some of these quick time,
[00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:37.800]   well, I mean, some of them are patches for security flaws,
[00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:40.360]   but presumably iTunes and quick time
[00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:42.880]   receive some updates for the iPad, right?
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:44.400]   Or maybe not.
[00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:46.000]   - Well, there should be a new version of iTunes,
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.400]   we think, but before Saturday anyway,
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:51.360]   before for the iPad to cope with all the books, et cetera.
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:54.080]   - Yeah, the Mac rumors is saying nine one
[00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:56.720]   will support eBooks.
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:57.560]   That's nice.
[00:53:57.560 --> 00:53:58.560]   So we'll be able to do eBooks on the desktop
[00:53:58.560 --> 00:53:59.400]   as well as on the iPad.
[00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:00.240]   - That's cool.
[00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:01.360]   - That'll be great.
[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:03.440]   The audio books entry and iTunes will be replaced
[00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:07.440]   with a books section meant to encompass both audio and eBooks.
[00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:11.240]   Content management for portables like the iPad and iPhone
[00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:12.720]   will also be changed in order to allow users
[00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:15.940]   to sync e-book content to their devices more easily.
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:21.840]   Geniuses, the Genius mixes will allow users
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:24.040]   to have a bit more control over them in the update.
[00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:25.520]   This is all a rumor from Mac rumors.
[00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:28.680]   Currently, the only functionality is a simple play pause
[00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:31.920]   over the album art and iTunes nine one users
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:34.040]   will be able to rename mixes and rearrange them,
[00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:36.240]   drag and drop, that'll be nice.
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:37.680]   You'll also be able to delete the stuff
[00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:39.360]   in the Genius mix you don't like.
[00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:45.600]   iPod shuffle users have long had the ability
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:49.880]   to have iTunes auto convert songs to 128 bit,
[00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:51.400]   kilobit AAC.
[00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:55.800]   iTunes nine one apparently will bring this optional feature
[00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:58.360]   optional we should say to other iPods as well
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:01.680]   to shrink your iPod library.
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:02.920]   - Yeah, we got a lot of comments from people
[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:05.560]   who are displeased with the iTunes plus format
[00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:07.400]   because it's 256.
[00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:08.240]   - Huge.
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:09.080]   - Yeah.
[00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:11.160]   So you know, it literally is double the size of the files
[00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:13.640]   from the standard 128 and a lot of people
[00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:15.640]   for their portable device, they don't really want to have that.
[00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:17.600]   So they don't need the quality because they can't actually
[00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:19.080]   tell the difference on your home system
[00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:21.040]   when you've got it connected to a decent stereo, great.
[00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:23.720]   But yeah, the rumor is that you'll be able to convert
[00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:26.120]   on the fly so that you can, you know,
[00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:29.080]   push over and lower bit rate versions of your music
[00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:32.680]   to your portable device and get more stuff on it basically.
[00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:35.200]   - I'd love to see that feature just expanded in general.
[00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:37.080]   There's so many times when they'll tell me that
[00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:39.840]   if I've ripped a DVD or just recorded something off the air
[00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:42.920]   that this file can not be synced to your device
[00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:44.720]   because it's an incompatible format,
[00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:47.360]   I'd love to, I'd love there for there to be a third button
[00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:51.120]   saying, well, just do what you can, convert it as it will
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:52.520]   because I just want that to,
[00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:53.960]   I just keep putting it off and putting it off.
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:56.120]   I just don't go through my library to look for things
[00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:58.200]   that do not sync properly and then convert them
[00:55:58.200 --> 00:55:59.720]   into the proper formats.
[00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:03.440]   - Here's some really good news for people,
[00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:05.840]   you've been asking about this, Alex.
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:07.960]   According to Digital Beat,
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:10.880]   the self-publishing service Smashwords has signed a
[00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:12.720]   distribution deal with Apple to put books
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:15.600]   on the iBook store, they'll be like the CD Baby.
[00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:16.920]   - Right, so a clearing house.
[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:18.440]   - Yeah, so you'll be a clearing house,
[00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:22.720]   so anybody who wants to publish to the iBook store
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:25.280]   will be able to do that through Smashwords.
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:29.080]   - And Apple does this mostly because they don't want to
[00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:31.120]   write individual deals. - Individual deals.
[00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:33.200]   - They just don't want to deal with individuals,
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:36.400]   they'd rather somebody else manage that for them.
[00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:38.680]   - Dean Takahashi writing for Digital Beat says users
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:40.640]   will be able to submit their works to Smashwords
[00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:42.640]   through a simple process that involves uploading
[00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:44.680]   a Microsoft Word file,
[00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:48.920]   selling, setting the price and deciding where the book
[00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:50.800]   is to be published, the company's also reportedly
[00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:53.000]   adding support for ISBN numbers.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:58.200]   So you'll be given an ISBN when you submit,
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:56:59.040]   which is kind of cool.
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:00.880]   - It's gonna be really interesting to see,
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:06.440]   whether authors will start to really just go out,
[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:07.800]   they're not getting published,
[00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:10.640]   this is really the huge marketplace.
[00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:14.040]   - Yeah, but not if it doesn't allow you to
[00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:15.920]   co-proose a really quality product,
[00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:18.160]   I can spend like three, four months putting together
[00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:19.880]   what I feel is a really, really good book,
[00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:23.120]   but if the product that my customer buys,
[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:26.440]   installs on the iPad, it looks like a big Word document,
[00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:28.440]   I'm not sure that that's something that I want to do.
[00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:29.800]   - That's a little disappointing.
[00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:31.600]   - Yeah, I mean, is it converting that Word document
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:34.120]   or is it, that's the point.
[00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:36.600]   - I mean, if there's a markup language that I can use,
[00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:38.560]   if it allows me to download a style sheet,
[00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:39.400]   that simply says,
[00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:40.920]   you can modify these styles,
[00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:43.240]   but as long as you make sure that you have the header style
[00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:45.520]   this way, the body text is styled that way,
[00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:48.600]   we promise you that it'll look good on the device.
[00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:52.080]   The other aspect is the idea of producing your own reader app,
[00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:55.280]   which is something that I've been looking into,
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:57.440]   which is cool because it allows you to build the app
[00:57:57.440 --> 00:57:59.520]   and the features that you actually really, really want.
[00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:00.640]   - It would certainly mean, right?
[00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:04.680]   - I mean, I mean, we're, I have a title of the iPad book,
[00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:07.600]   I'm not rather, I'm not allowed to share it right now,
[00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:08.760]   because we have to like, you know,
[00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:10.600]   make sure that no one else steals it,
[00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:13.040]   but then now we're talking about how we want
[00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:14.160]   the ebook version of this to be,
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:15.080]   and I've got all these ideas,
[00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:16.840]   and what if we add this, and what if we do that?
[00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:18.240]   What if we, yeah, we can do that, we can do that.
[00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:19.640]   Sure, let's try to do that.
[00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:21.400]   So that's the exactly the sort of way
[00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:23.040]   that we're gonna be bringing content forward,
[00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:25.000]   not by simply saying, you know, this Word file
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:26.240]   that I was gonna have typeset,
[00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:28.360]   well, why don't we just throw that into a placeholder
[00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:30.120]   and make it into a book reader instead.
[00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:31.120]   You know, I really wanna see people
[00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:32.920]   just make things that go beyond books.
[00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:35.040]   I don't think that a Word file is gonna do it.
[00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:35.880]   - Yeah.
[00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:38.960]   - So here's some good news.
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:40.380]   This is something that I was kind of
[00:58:40.380 --> 00:58:43.720]   in visualizing as a use for the iPad.
[00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:47.040]   I wanna put a sling player on the iPad,
[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:49.440]   and be able to watch TV for my sling box.
[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:50.320]   - Yeah.
[00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:53.040]   - So sling says we won't have it out in time
[00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:58.040]   for the iPad ship date, but we are working on it.
[00:58:58.040 --> 00:59:00.120]   And you will have to have one of the newer sling boxes
[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:02.440]   that does H.264 encoding, of course,
[00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:03.960]   'cause they can't support Flash.
[00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:07.080]   So that's good news.
[00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:12.080]   - This is according to zatsnotfunny.com.
[00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:17.320]   So that's gotta be incredible.
[00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:19.400]   - I always wondered, like, you know,
[00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:21.600]   not that I feel as though, like guys like us,
[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:24.160]   like, you know, it's impossible for us not to know
[00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:25.800]   about something that's going on,
[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:28.240]   but I'm always amazed when I hear a story,
[00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:31.160]   like Steve Jobs rumored to like be working
[00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:33.120]   on new slate device that will be called iPad,
[00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:34.360]   like, wow, who got that?
[00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:36.760]   Mac OS rumors, Apple Insider, Mac world?
[00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:41.320]   - No, it got Dave and Jod's awesome Xbox Live rumors page.
[00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:43.280]   Like, how did you get that?
[00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:44.600]   - Yeah.
[00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:47.400]   - We just don't, we don't do the dumpster diving Andy.
[00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:48.760]   That's the problem.
[00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:50.600]   - Of course you see, that's our problem.
[00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:52.160]   Our hands are too clean.
[00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:53.600]   Either we have to be full.
[00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:54.800]   - You gotta get dirty.
[00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:56.560]   That's not funny.
[00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:59.600]   - It's been a while since we've felt an enemy's throat
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:00.920]   within our hands.
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:03.240]   Heard that pop of a trachea collapsing, you know?
[01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:05.360]   - So just take this with whatever grain of salt you choose.
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:07.840]   I recently checked in with my former sling peeps
[01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:08.920]   regarding mobile clients,
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:11.240]   specifically Codex and Resolution.
[01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:14.360]   He says an Android client is on tap for this summer.
[01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:16.440]   And I wondered if they're sticking with WMV.
[01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:17.560]   Oh, that's what it is, not flash.
[01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:21.840]   WMV video streaming or moving to h.for this platform.
[01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:25.480]   While I wasn't able to get a definitive answer on Android.
[01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:28.200]   From my cousin, oh, now see, now I'm getting upset.
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:31.680]   Mobile product manager at sling is David Eiler.
[01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:33.440]   That's my cousin.
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:38.440]   So I guess I just need to dig a little deeper, huh?
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:39.880]   Dave, hey, David.
[01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:42.480]   Cousin Leo's here.
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:46.760]   He says they're actively moving towards h.for.
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:49.120]   Probably if I return his calls, I'd know this.
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:52.560]   They're actively moving towards h.26.
[01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:53.680]   He is my Facebook friend.
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:55.800]   Maybe he could have just sent me in.
[01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:58.840]   Which requires a newer, more capable place shifters.
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:00:59.680]   I don't know what that means.
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:01.600]   Also, really no surprise they're going to the Silverlight
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:03.640]   route for Windows Phone 7.
[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:05.120]   He says in regards to resolution,
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:07.680]   I don't believe sling media has taken mobile client video
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:10.200]   resolutions, but beyond 320 by 240,
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:12.640]   which of course would be very low res on the iPad.
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:15.880]   He says due to processing power memory bandwidth
[01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:17.480]   and battery life, but here comes the iPad
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:20.200]   and I don't want a pixel doubled iPhone sling player app
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:22.160]   on that large screen, neither do I.
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:25.560]   Fortunately, sling has confirmed they're prepared
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:27.160]   to accommodate me with something a bit better
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:30.440]   someday quoting cousin Dave.
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:32.360]   When it makes a noticeable difference in quality,
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:34.520]   we will definitely provide higher resolution streaming.
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:37.720]   The iPad is a good example of a device
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:39.040]   where we are hard at work on this,
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:41.080]   but unfortunately it won't be there at the April launch.
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:43.120]   And of course, Apple has to approve.
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:46.960]   But without AT&T being in the mix, why wouldn't they?
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:51.160]   It was AT&T that blocked 3G sling
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:52.560]   for a long time on the iPhone.
[01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:53.400]   - Right.
[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:56.960]   I mean, it's so many opportunities.
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:58.160]   - One more story, one more story.
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:01:59.400]   Then we're going to go to our picks of the week.
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:00.920]   And this is from the Wall Street Journal,
[01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:02.200]   so it must be true.
[01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:05.000]   - Well, of course, everything they say is the truth.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.520]   The world and an expensive.
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:07.360]   - It's expensive truth.
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:10.680]   - Yukari Iwatani Kane and Singh Itzai
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:15.200]   and Niraj Chef called my cousin and asked him.
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:16.800]   And apparently it's true.
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:21.800]   Apple plans to begin introducing a new iPhone
[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:23.960]   that could allow you as carriers other than AT&T
[01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:26.680]   to sell it a CDMA version.
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:30.080]   Now, you will hear on mainstream media people saying,
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:31.280]   "Verizon, verizon, verizon, verizon,
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:34.600]   "this Wall Street Journal article does not say verizon.
[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:36.760]   "It merely says CDMA."
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:41.000]   With Apple developing a phone.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.360]   Now, by the way, Apple has used the journal
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:48.240]   numerous times in the past to float stuff like this.
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:50.800]   And I don't think the journal's real, I mean,
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:51.640]   what do you say, Andy?
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:53.200]   You're the newspaper guy.
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:54.560]   They're not going to publish a story like this
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:57.480]   unless they feel fairly confident it's true.
[01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:00.120]   - Yeah, because if there's one thing
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:02.640]   that a big newspaper like that gets is that
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:05.680]   you can't put a story like that out before you convince
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:08.160]   a great number of people at much higher pay grades
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:09.880]   than you that's actually true.
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:11.720]   Which means it doesn't mean they don't get anything wrong,
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:13.400]   but at least you know that this wasn't just someone
[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:15.800]   who put two and two together and decided to go with it.
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:17.440]   This was someone who had to convince another guy
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:19.360]   who probably had to convince another guy.
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:21.360]   Again, that doesn't mean that I absolutely believe it,
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:23.280]   but it makes a lot of sense.
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:24.880]   It's a natural flow for it.
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:27.000]   It's a source that is known,
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.640]   definitely knows the legal repercussions of saints
[01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:30.920]   when that's not true.
[01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:32.400]   So I don't doubt it.
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:34.360]   I don't believe it, but I don't doubt it.
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:35.680]   - AT&T's comment.
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:38.440]   - I love this.
[01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:42.000]   - AT&T says, "There's been lots of incorrect speculation
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.200]   "on CDMA iPhones for a long time.
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:45.360]   "We haven't seen one yet."
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:48.160]   And only Apple knows when that might occur.
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:49.640]   (sings)
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:52.840]   - So you should buy an AT&T one now.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.440]   - Our map is colored blue.
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:56.720]   Their map is colored red.
[01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:00.240]   Blue like the ocean, red like fire.
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:01.600]   (laughs)
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:02.840]   I'm just standing fine.
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:05.560]   - Separately Apple plans, this is again the journal.
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:07.560]   Apple plans to release a new version
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:09.280]   of its current iPhone this summer.
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:11.920]   Apple, you know, normally in March is when Apple says,
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:13.080]   but they got the iPad thing
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:14.640]   and they're gonna wait a lot out of the way, I'm sure.
[01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:15.680]   - Well, they do it every year.
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:19.280]   It seems like we get a new iPhone at the end of every June.
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:20.120]   - I'm just gonna read this.
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:22.160]   This is what the Wall Street Journal says.
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:25.360]   - Separately, Apple plans to release a new version
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:26.880]   of its current phone this summer.
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:29.520]   Continuing its practice of annual upgrades
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:31.800]   at about the same time of year said,
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:34.680]   "People briefed on the matter.
[01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:37.200]   "The model is likely to be thinner
[01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:39.520]   "and have a faster processor.
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:42.680]   "Two people familiar with the device said."
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:44.200]   - All these people who are familiar.
[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:45.040]   - Well, that makes sense.
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:46.920]   It should have a Snapdragon or something of the equivalent
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:48.920]   of Gigglehertz processor, right?
[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:52.960]   Maybe the same processor in the iPad, you think?
[01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:55.480]   - That custom, wow.
[01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:56.320]   - That would be-- - That would be--
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:57.240]   - The remote, same family, possibly.
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:59.960]   - Yeah, it's an ARM SOC, right?
[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:01.840]   - I think it's gonna be fueled by the need
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:05.240]   to upgrade the display because the iPhone display,
[01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:06.400]   I think it looks perfectly fine
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:08.240]   compared to all of its modern competitors,
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:10.520]   but it's gonna start to look a little bit shabby
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:12.400]   because it was lower resolution.
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:14.160]   So I think that there,
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.880]   if there's the next thing that's on the hit list
[01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:17.960]   is gonna be improving the display a little bit.
[01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:21.320]   But the idea that now you have a display
[01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:23.800]   that might be, have four times the square footage
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:26.000]   means you probably have a better processor
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.960]   just to push all those pixels around, so.
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:30.760]   - Yeah, do you think they'll do a AMOLED screen
[01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:34.280]   and as the Nexus One and some other phones are doing?
[01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:35.880]   - I don't know, I think there's a reason
[01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:38.120]   why they chose technology that they chose for the iPad.
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:38.960]   - Right.
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:40.480]   - So.
[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:41.800]   - And I agree with you, in fact,
[01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:42.920]   there are better screens out there,
[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:46.240]   the Nexus One, the Droid all have higher resolution screens.
[01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:50.200]   The new EVO is incredible, 4.3 inches.
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:52.360]   Higher resolution, the problem is they don't really
[01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:53.240]   do anything with that.
[01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:54.560]   All they do is,
[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:57.480]   if that's one of the problems I had with the Nexus One,
[01:05:57.480 --> 01:05:59.680]   that it's a much higher definition screen,
[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:01.120]   but they didn't upgrade the fonts
[01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:03.800]   to make them more readable for that display.
[01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:06.320]   Now, these thin characters that kind of looked okay
[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:08.280]   at lower resolution, now they, in many cases,
[01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:09.680]   they just sort of disappear
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:12.040]   because they were just hairline thin in places.
[01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:14.040]   So I'm looking forward to seeing what Apple would do
[01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:15.360]   with a real high resolution,
[01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:16.840]   high definition pocket size display.
[01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:18.560]   They definitely make a little much more use of it.
[01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:21.160]   But they're the kings of typography on mobile devices.
[01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:23.320]   They make sure that fonts are readable,
[01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:24.400]   render correctly,
[01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:26.560]   and that there's their appropriate situation.
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:30.160]   - I'm wondering if I must have a, sorry.
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:31.000]   - Go ahead.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.920]   - They must have, well, I just wonder what they do have
[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:35.880]   in the pipeline because we've heard, absolutely,
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:37.200]   I know they never tell us anyway,
[01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:39.640]   but there's been absolutely nothing to do with the new phone,
[01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:41.520]   but also were the new version of the OS software
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:43.440]   as well as version 4.
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:46.040]   So, as they said, get the iPad out of the way
[01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:48.880]   and then line up, start up the expectation for the iPhone.
[01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:51.680]   And I think it's interesting
[01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:53.840]   because now they've got the iPad,
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:54.960]   which is a mobile device.
[01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:56.360]   I mean, when they brought out the iPhone,
[01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:57.200]   other than the iPad,
[01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:59.160]   they didn't really have a mobile computing device
[01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:00.840]   or the laptops, obviously.
[01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:03.240]   But now there are some sort of overlaps
[01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:05.560]   between the iPhone and the iPad.
[01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:06.480]   It's gonna be interesting to see
[01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:08.960]   how they position both devices now
[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:11.480]   because they both are primarily mobile devices.
[01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:13.840]   Now, obviously, they don't want to make the iPhone any bigger,
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:16.320]   obviously higher resolution probably on the screen,
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:18.640]   but they'll probably want to start, you know,
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:22.040]   HD video cameras, better iChat facilities,
[01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:23.040]   possibly stuff like that,
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:25.520]   but they will be trading a fine line to make sure
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:27.640]   that they're clearly differentiating between the iPad
[01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:29.400]   and its capabilities and the iPhone as well.
[01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:31.480]   - Well, I think that from a developer's point of view,
[01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:33.560]   isn't there an issue with trying to make sure,
[01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:35.320]   I mean, it would be easier if, for instance,
[01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:36.680]   the iPhone was running at something
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:38.640]   that was near the same resolution as the,
[01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:41.200]   I mean, it'd be really tiny, but if it was really sharp
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:43.800]   and you could see the interface, you know,
[01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:46.800]   you might have us be able to do a similar development
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:47.640]   for both of them.
[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:49.040]   I think one of the problems you're gonna get into is,
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:53.200]   you know, you're gonna end up buying apps for each one,
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:54.680]   you know, for the iPad and the iPhone.
[01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:55.880]   I think that's gonna be the issues
[01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:58.240]   'cause I don't think you can really,
[01:07:58.240 --> 01:07:59.920]   at the beginning, all these apps are gonna run on both,
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:01.440]   but I think you're gonna want to customize them
[01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:02.640]   for the iPad.
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:05.720]   Having more resolution and more power in the little iPhone
[01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:09.880]   just makes it more, you possibly do a dual release
[01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:11.560]   that is probably a little closer.
[01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:15.440]   I gotta turn my mic on.
[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:16.720]   (laughs)
[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:18.160]   (mumbles)
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:22.040]   Faster forward, the Rob Pergararo column
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:23.560]   in the Washington Post says,
[01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:26.520]   the iPhone probably isn't coming to Verizon just yet.
[01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:30.080]   And John Gruber, by the way,
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:32.000]   called the Wall Street Journal entry
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.600]   into the iPhone Rumor's Game Lame.
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:36.840]   (laughs)
[01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:37.760]   He's so grouchy.
[01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:43.320]   Actually, the Washington Post said it was cautiously phrased
[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:45.000]   and I think that might even be more accurate.
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.920]   They didn't really say much,
[01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:51.360]   except it appears to be, could be, might be, is possibly.
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:55.600]   We have been hearing,
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:59.360]   and this is what Rob points out in the Washington Post.
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:01.640]   But hearing these rumors about Verizon
[01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:05.440]   for a long, darn time, since 2007,
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:07.320]   even Verizon kind of fueled the fire,
[01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:08.560]   its own executives saying,
[01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:11.880]   yeah, we're gonna get the iPhone a couple of years ago.
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:18.520]   He doesn't have any reason to be skeptical,
[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:22.680]   except that we've seen this for a while.
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:24.280]   It's possible sprint.
[01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:27.280]   I mean, CDMA doesn't have to be Verizon.
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:32.280]   I can't imagine though, that if Apple moves or adds to AT&T
[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:33.920]   that they would go to sprint.
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:36.440]   And certainly everybody--
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:37.800]   Yeah, it's the strong one.
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:40.080]   No, sprint, the also ran.
[01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:40.920]   You also ran.
[01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:42.000]   Except if you were in Las Vegas.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.880]   Yeah, but sprint's got some, like this EV,
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:48.480]   oh, this new HTC phone, the EVO, which is on 4G
[01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:49.600]   and is a beautiful phone.
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:51.200]   That's the one with a 4.3 inch screen.
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:54.640]   It's running two point zero, do it one rather.
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:56.720]   What's the point of having 4G if it can only work
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:58.400]   in cities that you don't live in and never visit?
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:09:59.240]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:00.720]   That's why I didn't order one.
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:04.240]   It's, they show a spunk and it seems like a really hot handset.
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:05.760]   Spunky sprint.
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:06.760]   Yeah.
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:08.400]   I'll see.
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:11.120]   The other flip side of that is that no one really cares
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:13.760]   that there's no coverage in Oram, Utah.
[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:16.680]   You know, they care that there's coverage in Walpole, Massachusetts
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:18.720]   and they care that there's coverage in New York and San Francisco,
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:21.120]   the places where they live, work, and visit sometimes.
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:22.520]   So maybe it's not that big of a deal.
[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:24.760]   So if they look at that map and they realize that there's plenty
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:27.640]   of 4G wherever I'm ever likely to go
[01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:29.280]   and there'll be 3G everywhere else.
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:30.440]   OK.
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:33.560]   Currently it's in Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho,
[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:34.880]   Illinois, Maryland, North Carolina.
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:37.000]   That's can't be right.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.840]   I can't be right.
[01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:41.840]   They just want to make sure that no tech columnists will ever
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:45.240]   have a chance to try it out until they've had two years
[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:46.320]   worth of experience.
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:47.600]   That's being error here.
[01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:50.520]   We're rolling out 4G coverage as quickly as we can.
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:53.200]   Pick a state and then city to view coverage in that area.
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:55.280]   So I'm looking at the dropdown.
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:56.600]   Here's the states.
[01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:59.520]   Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Maryland, North Carolina,
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:02.240]   Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Washington.
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:04.440]   Well, it's got Pennsylvania.
[01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:06.560]   So do you want me to see if Pittsburgh is on the list?
[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:09.000]   I don't see California on that list.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000]   I don't see Mads that choose it's on that list.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.240]   And I definitely don't see Liverpool on that list.
[01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:15.800]   That's weird because I believe that they were testing 4G
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:16.760]   and Boston.
[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:17.080]   I know.
[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:18.680]   That's what I'm doing wrong.
[01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:19.680]   Maybe they just set up a--
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:20.960]   Maybe it's the same sprint.
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:23.520]   Is this plucky little Elsa ran sprint that I'm-- yeah,
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:24.760]   sprint.
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:28.720]   Turbocharge your internet with 4G and select cities.
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:29.640]   Let's see.
[01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:30.560]   Select the state.
[01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:31.880]   The god of the city gets selected.
[01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:33.560]   Apparently nothing in California.
[01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:37.280]   OK, well, I guess I won't be buying the Evo.
[01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:41.240]   You know, this is the problem.
[01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:43.240]   You kind of go to Verizon and you're not going to go.
[01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:44.880]   Where else would you go?
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:46.880]   You got to go to Verizon.
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:48.880]   The other difficulty presented by this phone
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:50.720]   is that I think that now I almost
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:53.520]   lost count at the different flavors of Android phones
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:54.520]   are out there right now.
[01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:56.120]   It's kind of control.
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:59.680]   If I buy this new phone, what branch of the marketplace,
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:02.560]   am I going to be able to get applications that will really,
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:03.720]   really support it well?
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:07.560]   Or is it going to have to be the tablet store, the mini
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:10.560]   tablet store, the Google G1 style--
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:15.000]   the T-Mobile G1 style store, the 2.0 store, the 1.6 store.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.280]   They really need to start getting these--
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:20.040]   they need to start getting all these cows that have been
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:22.960]   out of the pasture, corral them back into one big place
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:26.080]   where the marketplace seems manageable.
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:27.720]   The last time I recommended an application
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:29.320]   to a friend of mine who's an Android user,
[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:31.920]   it just absolutely didn't work because it's not available
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:33.960]   for his devices, it's not compatible, it doesn't work.
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:35.440]   That's frustrating as hell.
[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:38.200]   Even Google is releasing like the Google Buzz widget only
[01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:39.640]   works at 1.6 and later.
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:42.120]   So half the Android handsets, including its own G1,
[01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:43.080]   won't use it.
[01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:45.280]   Well, that's going to be the issue.
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:46.480]   That's making sure.
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:47.400]   1.6 is OK.
[01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:50.480]   The problem is that 1.6 and above is OK.
[01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:53.160]   The problem is-- one of the problems is 2.0 and above,
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:55.000]   where you're stuck with a 1.6 handset,
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.840]   and you keep asking your carrier, yes,
[01:12:56.840 --> 01:13:00.120]   I'm told that this OS works just fine on my handset.
[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:02.440]   When will I be able to download it?
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:03.400]   And they say, we don't know.
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:04.200]   We're still looking at it.
[01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:05.840]   You sure don't want to buy a 2.1 phone?
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:06.680]   We had them for sale.
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:09.320]   It only cost you $40 upgrade fee plus a $300 replacement
[01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:11.160]   handset cost.
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:13.240]   By the way, somebody in our chat room scooter X
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:15.920]   is saying Android 2.1 is now finally today,
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:19.880]   as of today, rolling out for the droid, which
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:22.120]   will make a lot of people very happy.
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:25.600]   All right, this is our last Mac break weekly before--
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:29.200]   our last non-IPAD Mac break weekly.
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:31.360]   Starting next week, all of us will
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:35.920]   join Andy in having an iPad.
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:39.520]   Buster, you could stop for 10 minutes.
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:41.440]   You know, the reason we give Andy this hard time
[01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:44.400]   is because when the iPhone 3GS came out,
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:46.200]   he did, in fact, get it ahead of time
[01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:52.880]   and had the amazing, born-like, Hutspa
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:55.480]   to use it in Studio.
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:57.400]   And did this whole sleight-of-hand thing
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:00.960]   where he took out the 3G and said, oh, see, it's cracked.
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:01.840]   And then he switched.
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:03.400]   And they put it in his pocket.
[01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:06.960]   And he pulled out the switched cases,
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:08.960]   put the new 3GS in the same case.
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:11.120]   So we would think it was the one he showed us,
[01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:15.320]   pulled it out, took a picture.
[01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:16.400]   Not that we're bitter.
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:17.560]   Not that we're bitter.
[01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:21.600]   OK, let's rebind and make sure that I only did that
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:25.360]   because the 3G and the 3GS are visually identical.
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:26.240]   That I could use it.
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:28.080]   I was actually using it in the streets of San Francisco
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:31.600]   like all week long because I wanted to take pictures and video
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:34.240]   and try out those features and have something substantive
[01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:36.000]   to say.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.600]   The iPad would be a totally different thing.
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:43.600]   So I mean, that's why I'm having to do this test
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:47.960]   like two weeks ago because I wanted to start to figure out,
[01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:51.000]   well, what's going to be like to carry around an iPad
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.120]   because I had no idea.
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:53.520]   So I still had my mock-up.
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:55.680]   And I actually carry it like one of those--
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:57.280]   when they want to teach a junior high school kid,
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:14:59.360]   please don't get a baby because it'll ruin your life.
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:03.080]   It's a lot more work than you think it'll be on TV.
[01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:05.920]   And so they make these kids like carry a 5-pound sack of flour
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:07.920]   and keep it safe for like a four-hole week.
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:12.320]   I was carrying this as my 5-pound sack of flour iPad
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:14.040]   for an entire week just to figure out
[01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:16.480]   what would it be like to make sure that if I wanted to use this
[01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:19.480]   as my carrying around machine, how would we be able to use it?
[01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:21.120]   How was it when you had to change its diapers?
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:23.000]   Was that OK?
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:26.720]   Well, Colonel Panic right in the middle of a theater.
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:27.800]   I got a lot of dirty looks.
[01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:31.920]   But you understand that the responsibility--
[01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:35.720]   you've been placed by God for this responsibility in your hand.
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:36.960]   This is a precious responsibility.
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:38.040]   Exactly.
[01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:38.840]   I can't wait.
[01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:39.360]   I'm sorry.
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:41.200]   I'm trying not to be a cheerleader.
[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:42.520]   I could have been a real one, you know.
[01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:43.680]   And he's only pretending-- he could--
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:44.880]   they could inside that couple.
[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:45.880]   That could be a real one.
[01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:47.640]   What I did was I raised this open--
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:49.480]   insert the iPad inside it.
[01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:50.680]   He could totally do that.
[01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:51.920]   I wouldn't put it past him.
[01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:54.880]   The guy is amazing.
[01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:56.600]   If we're a real iPad, could I do this?
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:56.920]   He says--
[01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:57.840]   All right, stop that light.
[01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:01.280]   Yeah, clunk, clunk, clunk.
[01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:03.520]   And days for the record--
[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:06.720]   and this would be true if I had one or if I did not have one.
[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:09.760]   I am pretty tired of friends asking me if I have one.
[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:13.840]   I'm pretty tired of people saying, oh, you told me
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:17.080]   that you were reading this week's copy of People Magazine.
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:18.440]   Do you still have it in your bag?
[01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:19.440]   Said, yeah, here it is.
[01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:22.840]   Like, oh, could you open up your bag really, really wide
[01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:25.840]   so as you pull out your copy of Time Magazine or People Magazine?
[01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:26.360]   Oh, God.
[01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:28.800]   You know we're just messing with you, Andy.
[01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:31.320]   Oh, believe me, I'm very aware that you're messing with me.
[01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:32.440]   It's just fun.
[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:33.440]   It's just for fun.
[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:34.440]   I'm just--
[01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:34.440]   I'm just--
[01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:35.440]   I'm just--
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:36.440]   I'm just--
[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:37.440]   I'm just--
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:38.440]   I'm just--
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:39.440]   I'm just--
[01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:43.520]   I don't know, Ed Begg and David Pogue and Walt Mossberg.
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:46.800]   So I have to pick on you.
[01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:47.520]   That's all right.
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:49.920]   Mankind is born into trouble, just as surely as the sparks
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:51.040]   fly upward.
[01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:52.040]   Wow.
[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:53.040]   That's--
[01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:56.840]   Book of Job, hello, and testament.
[01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:59.000]   All I know is Jesus wept, and I'm about to weep.
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.120]   We're going to take a break and do our picks of the week
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:04.400]   in just a bit, but before we do, we should mention our good friends
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:07.400]   at audible.com and make this show possible.
[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:08.160]   We love Audible.
[01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:09.520]   We know you will love Audible too.
[01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:12.200]   If you haven't tried it yet, I got an email from somebody.
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:13.760]   I have to say, it kind of broke my heart a little bit.
[01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:14.760]   He said, I'm sorry.
[01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:16.560]   I'm going to stop donating to your podcast.
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:17.920]   I stopped listening to your podcast
[01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:19.800]   because I became an Audible subscriber.
[01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:22.560]   And now all I do is listen to audiobooks.
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:23.760]   Kind of--
[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:26.960]   I think he's kind of ironic, isn't it?
[01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:28.000]   That's all right.
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.040]   Hey, dude, it's fine.
[01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:31.960]   Just come back after a while.
[01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:32.960]   You come back.
[01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:34.080]   Audible, I can blame him.
[01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:36.560]   Audible, you look at-- you could listen to us goof around,
[01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:39.440]   or you could listen to great novels
[01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:41.320]   from the best minds in history.
[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:43.200]   You could listen to science fiction
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:46.000]   from some of the best imaginative writers in the world.
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:50.640]   You could read history or mysteries or thrillers or--
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:55.160]   I mean, Audible is a 70,000 book store.
[01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:56.560]   It's pretty hard to compete against.
[01:17:56.560 --> 01:17:57.280]   It's the future.
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:17:58.560]   It's the future, man.
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:00.920]   Plays on your iPad, your iPhone, of course,
[01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:02.800]   you're all your Apple devices, but also
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:06.840]   on your Microsoft devices, on your Kindle 2.
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:10.480]   It also plays on many GPSs and the Sansa and the Iraver
[01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:11.400]   of a whole bunch of devices.
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:14.080]   If you go to audible.com and click the device center
[01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:15.640]   at the top of the page right there,
[01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:16.720]   you'll see a list of devices.
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:17.160]   Do check.
[01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:18.320]   Make sure to play back on your device.
[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:22.440]   Of course, your computer, it will always play back on that.
[01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:25.440]   The nice thing about this is you can go browsing around
[01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:29.560]   on audible.com, pick a book, and within a minute or two,
[01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:32.160]   have a high quality audio version of it
[01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:34.240]   downloaded to your computer or on your device.
[01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:38.760]   And I mean, it's just a great way to read when you wouldn't
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:41.960]   normally be able to read, to keep up with your reading,
[01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:44.480]   to get your mind working again.
[01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:46.560]   If you go to audible.com/macbreak,
[01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:47.880]   get your first book free.
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:49.800]   You'll be signing up for the gold account, which
[01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:50.400]   is a book a month.
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:51.760]   But if you get your first one free,
[01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:53.320]   that's kind of nice to cancel at any time.
[01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:57.320]   So it's kind of a good way to listen and see
[01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:59.360]   if audible is right for you.
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:02.320]   Andy and notco and I, and I guess you two Alex
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:03.600]   are big audible fans.
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:07.800]   I don't-- someone wanted to send me a book to read.
[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:10.160]   And I looked at him, I said, I don't read.
[01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:10.480]   I just don't.
[01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:11.280]   Who has time?
[01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:11.760]   I don't read.
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:12.800]   I listen to my car.
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:13.680]   I listen to Jim.
[01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:15.200]   I listen when I'm cleaning house.
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:16.680]   I listen to go to sleep at night.
[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:18.680]   I'm listening to audible all the time.
[01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:20.480]   Yeah.
[01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:21.520]   It's different than UK.
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:22.120]   I don't know.
[01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:24.560]   Are you an audible listener?
[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:26.160]   Not really, to be honest, no.
[01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:27.880]   We do have audible here in the UK.
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:28.280]   You do.
[01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:28.640]   But you know what?
[01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:30.320]   You don't have which kills me.
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:32.440]   And I apologize because we've recommended this book so
[01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:32.920]   many times.
[01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:33.920]   It's such a great book.
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:37.560]   Daniel Suarez is demon and the new one Freedom TM.
[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:38.480]   Right.
[01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:38.840]   OK.
[01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:40.360]   Penguin, for some reason.
[01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:43.600]   Penguin audio does not offer it in the UK.
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:46.160]   You have to come here when you're picking up the iPod.
[01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:48.640]   Pick that up as well because it's such a good book.
[01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:50.800]   Andy, what are you listening to these days?
[01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:53.720]   I've made sort of a weird selection
[01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:57.720]   because oftentimes when I talk about my picks,
[01:19:57.720 --> 01:20:00.320]   I talk about, well, the 41-hour audiobook
[01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:03.520]   that I downloaded last week, I'm only about eight chapters in.
[01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:06.440]   So I'm going to be listening to that for the next three weeks.
[01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:07.120]   So I just--
[01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:09.440]   You don't have to listen to a new book every week.
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:11.440]   You don't have to listen to a new book every week.
[01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:13.840]   But I try to make sure that I'm recommending it.
[01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:15.000]   If I've been listening to it, I want
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:16.800]   to make sure that people know that, hey, this
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:18.800]   is one I've actually listened to as opposed to one
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:21.000]   that I've read or one that I read the previous day.
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.320]   OK, that is on my wish list.
[01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:24.160]   I've got one more credit left.
[01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:25.880]   I think I'm going to spend another one.
[01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:28.480]   So the one that caught my eye this week--
[01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:30.160]   and I've been reading the pages that
[01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:32.600]   are available from this on Google Books.
[01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:35.880]   It's called Life Stories Profiles from the New Yorker.
[01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:38.280]   The New Yorker does really great profiles of people.
[01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:41.280]   They're part biography, part tutorial on what
[01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:43.400]   kind of job they do and how it gets done.
[01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:47.120]   But it's extremely vivid writing about what
[01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:50.040]   it's like to be this person, what they find is important,
[01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:51.960]   where they are, and what they've been doing when
[01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:54.200]   it was time for a New Yorker writer to come over
[01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:56.000]   and start documenting his life.
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:00.520]   And it's a pretty wide collection of different people.
[01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:02.480]   I'm just going to read from the Audible page.
[01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:05.160]   You've got the profiles of Richard Pryor, Marlon Brando,
[01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:09.720]   Catherine White, the artist, Isadora Duncan.
[01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:12.040]   The one that really got me was a piece called The Man Who
[01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:14.680]   Walks on Air, which was a profile of Philippe Petit.
[01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:18.080]   He was the tightrope rocker, most famous
[01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:21.080]   for doing a pirate job where he strung a cable
[01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:23.320]   between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center,
[01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:25.760]   Wilma's just nearly being finished, and tightrope walk
[01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:28.400]   back and forth across the Twin Towers.
[01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:30.240]   And so it starts off--
[01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:33.240]   I read almost nearly that entire story via Google Books--
[01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:36.600]   and just starts off with him being so serious about suddenly
[01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:38.680]   everyone telling him you should do a tightrope walk
[01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:39.840]   across the Grand Canyon.
[01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:41.320]   So he made this project to figure out
[01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:43.920]   if there was any way or shape or form he could actually do it
[01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:46.200]   and being really discouraged and finding out exactly how
[01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:48.600]   much money he could spend on a plane just to scout places.
[01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:51.120]   He was spending days and days and days.
[01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:53.120]   The whole start of the piece is when he finally
[01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:56.320]   finds this one spot that has exactly the right sort of scale
[01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:59.120]   and drama, but also has the technical requirements of,
[01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:00.360]   will I be killed doing this?
[01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:01.160]   No, great.
[01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:02.760]   Let's talk about that then.
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:05.080]   So it seems like a really great choice,
[01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:08.520]   because it's sort of a done-in-one sort of collection
[01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:12.400]   as a collection of about 12 or 14 different little books.
[01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:14.440]   It means that if you've got a one-hour commute,
[01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:16.160]   you could start it when you pull out of the driveway
[01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:19.080]   and finish it by the time you get back home at the end of the day.
[01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:21.880]   It's nine hours and 48 minutes.
[01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:23.520]   It was published about 2001.
[01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:25.120]   So anybody who might have been born after that,
[01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:26.840]   they're not going to be profiled or got famous after that.
[01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:30.720]   You will not be finding a Lady Gaga interview in this collection.
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:32.880]   I would very much like to see what the New Yorker would have
[01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:35.200]   to say profiling Lady Gaga as privacy.
[01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:36.520]   I'd love to read that, yeah.
[01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:37.920]   We'll see about the hats, I think.
[01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:39.920]   Yeah.
[01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:42.120]   But yeah, I really enjoyed--
[01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:44.400]   I've probably read about two or three chapters of this book
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:46.720]   by now, and that was enough to sell me on the audiobook.
[01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:50.280]   I actually is probably enough that when I get access
[01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:52.680]   to the iBook store, when I get access to that sort of stuff,
[01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:53.880]   I'm definitely going to look for this.
[01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:55.640]   It seems like also a good one to read.
[01:22:55.640 --> 01:22:56.880]   There's so many of these books where I might
[01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:59.760]   have bought two or three editions, because I enjoy the audiobook
[01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:02.000]   and I enjoy the audiobook so much that I want to be able to read it.
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:05.520]   And oftentimes, just in reverse, even though I read this book,
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:08.200]   I suddenly want the ability to listen to it in the car.
[01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:09.640]   So there's probably going to be a lot of cry stuff.
[01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:10.560]   I do that all the time.
[01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:11.800]   It's fine too.
[01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:12.800]   Yeah.
[01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:14.400]   That reminds me-- we don't talk about it enough,
[01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:18.400]   but you can actually subscribe to an audio version of the New Yorker
[01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:20.880]   on audible.com.
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:24.560]   So there's a ton of New Yorker material on audible.com, which
[01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:25.200]   is great.
[01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:27.520]   Other periodicals, too-- New York Times and the Wall Street
[01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:32.600]   Journal-- this is audible as more than just books.
[01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:36.480]   It is a large variety of audio content, including scenes.
[01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:38.760]   Yeah, I mean, one of my favorite podcasts
[01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:40.840]   was the Ricky Gere's Show podcast.
[01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:42.880]   But it was so successful for the first two years
[01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:44.640]   that he took it behind a paywall.
[01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:46.560]   And I really just never really bothered with it.
[01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:48.720]   But of course, now it's available as an audible subscription,
[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:50.400]   and that might be more possible there.
[01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:52.400]   Just make sure that when you select your free book
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:53.560]   or when you select your free credit,
[01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:55.560]   there's so many times I came this close to saying, wow,
[01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:56.320]   that's a great pick.
[01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:59.680]   Then read close and saying, oh, that's actually 23 minutes
[01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:00.920]   and it costs $1.30.
[01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:04.240]   I don't think I want people to use their free pick on $1.30.
[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:05.120]   Yeah, I know.
[01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:05.600]   They're so small.
[01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:06.600]   We don't ever mention this.
[01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:08.560]   Yeah, but there really is some great stuff.
[01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:08.920]   You're right.
[01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:10.200]   I mean, $1.95, $3.
[01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:11.640]   Pick something expensive.
[01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:13.280]   You really want to stick it to them.
[01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:14.240]   Ring, James, buy--
[01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:15.400]   If they're coming up to you for free,
[01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:17.640]   you should take something worth $100 if you can't.
[01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:19.280]   I'd buy Jimmy Stewart.
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:20.480]   Small one.
[01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:27.840]   In the beginning, the world was without form and shape.
[01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:30.720]   And the Lord.
[01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:32.440]   And you know that, oh, they're just killing you.
[01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:33.640]   They're just killing you.
[01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:34.080]   I love it.
[01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:36.640]   Audible.com/Macbreak gets you first book free.
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:39.560]   It's a great-- really a great choice for people
[01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:41.000]   who love to listen.
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.080]   And we know you love to listen.
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:44.240]   Or else why in heaven's name would you still
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:46.480]   be listening to this?
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:48.640]   Now Alex Lindsey's going to give us his pick of the week.
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:50.640]   Hey, Alex Lindsey.
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:52.000]   I have a geeky one and it's free.
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.360]   Geeky pick.
[01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:55.080]   I went a little geek today.
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:57.440]   Don't pick the iPad.
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:24:58.240]   I almost did.
[01:24:58.240 --> 01:24:59.520]   You know, I thought about it.
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:00.080]   I have to admit.
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:02.480]   I thought off of the iPad and I thought, you know,
[01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:05.480]   I'm already known as a little bit of a Mac geek boy.
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:09.880]   And I was afraid that a fan boy and no one would believe
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:11.320]   anything I set up to that.
[01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:13.240]   I don't even have it yet.
[01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:13.560]   So no.
[01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:14.960]   So this is one was pointed out.
[01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:16.920]   Sam at the office pointed this one out to me.
[01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:18.200]   I'm still experimenting with it.
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:18.720]   But it's free.
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:21.880]   So people should download it because it is so cool.
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:24.200]   And what it is, it's called Geek Tool.
[01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:27.920]   And so here's-- it solves a problem in a geeky way
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:29.320]   that I've had for a long time, which
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:31.920]   is that I want to put stuff on my desktop.
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:33.960]   I don't want dashboard.
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:36.200]   Like, I don't want things to show up on my dashboard.
[01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:37.600]   And I want to hit F12 or whatever.
[01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:38.800]   I want my schedule.
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:41.040]   I want maybe some hard drive information.
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:43.480]   I want images that I'm interested live feeds, whatever
[01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:43.760]   I want.
[01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:44.760]   I want to put it on the desktop.
[01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:45.800]   I don't want it to be clickable.
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:47.320]   I want it to be underneath my icons.
[01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:50.440]   I want everything to just kind of operate back there.
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:55.480]   You know, it's a desktop that has information that
[01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:58.040]   should be in front of me like what my next appointment is.
[01:25:58.040 --> 01:25:59.680]   You know, what my dentist appointment is.
[01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:00.240]   What my--
[01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:00.740]   Yeah.
[01:26:00.740 --> 01:26:03.040]   You say that because I missed--
[01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:05.880]   I was supposed to be drilled today and I forgot.
[01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:07.480]   That's a Freudian forget.
[01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:07.960]   They need it.
[01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:09.440]   We need a new phrase.
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:10.360]   They've got Freudian slip.
[01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:11.400]   We need a Freudian forget.
[01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:12.680]   I wouldn't do that before a show.
[01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:15.560]   I wouldn't do it because you'd walk in and go, air, right?
[01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:17.400]   Well, as it turned out, yeah, that would have been a bad idea.
[01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:18.600]   But I had an 8 AM--
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:20.360]   two fillings, 8 AM appointment.
[01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:22.360]   So anyway, so I want to have this information in there.
[01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:23.920]   So what Geek Tool let you do?
[01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:26.520]   It's a preference pane.
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:28.280]   And you can load images.
[01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:31.080]   You can have it point to live feeds on the web.
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:34.000]   You can have it do shell scripts and display those shell
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.680]   scripts on your desktop.
[01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:39.000]   And it becomes when you click away,
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:42.160]   when you close the panel, then it just
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:43.160]   becomes part of your desktop.
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:44.520]   It's not clickable.
[01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:46.760]   I mean, here's a very rough version of it.
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:48.480]   But there's just stuff--
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:49.360]   There's some shell scripts.
[01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:49.560]   You can show me.
[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:50.200]   But there's no heck.
[01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:50.760]   No one can see it.
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:51.280]   No one can see it.
[01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:52.280]   No one can see it.
[01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:53.280]   But the point is that--
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:54.120]   It's very cool what it does.
[01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:54.960]   And you can mix and match with them.
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:56.680]   And if you look at some of the examples,
[01:26:56.680 --> 01:26:58.880]   people have gone crazy with this thing.
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:00.680]   These gorgeous desktops.
[01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:02.320]   Now is it live like it'll update?
[01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:03.960]   Yeah, you can have it look at an RSS feed.
[01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:04.920]   You can have it look at--
[01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:07.000]   But it doesn't-- it's kind of static updating.
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.160]   You can tell it how often you want it to update.
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:10.000]   OK.
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.600]   And you can have it look at a live camera.
[01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:13.560]   I haven't gotten it working with a live camera yet.
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:15.160]   But you're supposed to be able to only get it.
[01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:15.680]   Sam?
[01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:18.120]   How-- you could have it update every 15 seconds or something.
[01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:20.040]   Where every zero seconds or one second or whatever.
[01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:21.200]   But the point is, for instance, I
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:24.680]   could have it look at my iCal so that I could have my schedule
[01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:25.200]   and everything else.
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:26.560]   And I can work on the design of it.
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:28.800]   I can figure out how I want it to be designed
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:31.000]   so that it looks nice on my desktop.
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000]   And this is something that other people have made some kind
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.680]   of basic tools that do this.
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:36.520]   But I haven't found anything that really just
[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:37.600]   was part of my desktop.
[01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:38.600]   I didn't have to think about it.
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:39.560]   It wasn't anything extra.
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:42.040]   And I can work on it and figure out what I want to do.
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:43.680]   So I just started playing with it.
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:51.720]   And it's by tinsotyne.org.
[01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:53.920]   And they do a bunch of other cool stuff too.
[01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:58.160]   But this is Geek Tool is the thing
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:00.640]   that I just think solves a bunch of problems.
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:01.800]   It's still a little geeky.
[01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:03.880]   You have to roll up your sleeves and play with it a little bit
[01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:05.680]   to get what you want.
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:07.120]   But it's-- and we're definitely going
[01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:09.360]   to cover this more in a Mac break dev because it's just like--
[01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:10.960]   Well, as long as you're going to do that,
[01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:13.080]   Josh Browner, chat room has mentioned this site, which
[01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:15.040]   you might want to add to that list.
[01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:21.120]   From Mac OS X tips in the UK, MacosX tips.co.uk/geeklets,
[01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:24.000]   these are a variety of different things
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.400]   you can use with Geek Tool, like List, currently,
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:30.240]   online Skype contests, display lyrics from the track being
[01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:32.960]   played in iTunes, display ping time to a server,
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:36.920]   Facebook news feed, list tasks from things.app.
[01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:40.680]   I mean, there's quite a few handy little dandy things here.
[01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:41.800]   You don't have to build it up yourself.
[01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:43.240]   Right.
[01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:45.640]   So you use terminal commands to--
[01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:47.280]   You can do terminal commands.
[01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:48.800]   Or you can have a look at an image
[01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:50.080]   or you can have a point to something.
[01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:51.440]   There's a couple of different ways of--
[01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:52.800]   a lot of it's terminal based.
[01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:54.920]   Right.
[01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:59.200]   But it's really slick.
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:02.480]   And as it is really a Geek Tool.
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:03.000]   Yeah.
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:03.600]   It's geeky.
[01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:05.960]   And so for those of you who like to geek out with your Mac,
[01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:07.360]   this is something that is--
[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:09.600]   and what I'm looking at is working on like quartz composer
[01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:11.120]   stuff that I can do cool things with it
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:14.560]   and have it be looking in RSS and have it feed back in.
[01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:16.720]   So it'll look at files on your desktop.
[01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:19.240]   So if those things change, it could change.
[01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:21.040]   So anyway, Geek Tool.
[01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:21.880]   Check it out.
[01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:28.720]   From projects.tynsoe.org.
[01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:30.800]   But if you do a Google for Geek Tool, it's first thing.
[01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:32.080]   First thing shows up.
[01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:33.640]   I feel lucky.
[01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:38.160]   Don McAllister from ScreenCastsOnline.
[01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:38.520]   OK.
[01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:40.360]   Well, this one is--
[01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:42.880]   it's an iPhone app, but it's going to be really useful
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:43.520]   for the iPad.
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:45.560]   It was a one point that's been by my friend Wally
[01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:46.840]   over in Canada.
[01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:47.960]   And what it is basically--
[01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:50.200]   I mean, we've all got video collections.
[01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:53.880]   And this alludes back to a point that was made before.
[01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:57.480]   That conversion is always an issue with video.
[01:29:57.480 --> 01:30:01.080]   So I like to have big high resolution videos for my Apple
[01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:03.440]   TV or to-- in fact, I've got a Mac Mini now because it was
[01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:04.960]   such a pain.
[01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:07.280]   Having different media formats, I ended up
[01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:08.920]   with a Mac Mini Media Center to play
[01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:11.080]   lots of different types of video formats
[01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:12.560]   on my large screen TV.
[01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:14.320]   But if you want to play on your iPhone,
[01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:15.920]   you have to convert.
[01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:17.080]   You have to downsize it.
[01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:18.720]   If it's at high resolution, you have to downsize it.
[01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:21.760]   And if you've got MKV files or API files,
[01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:26.080]   all the different file formats that the iPhone won't work with,
[01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:28.280]   you have to convert it to get onto your iPhone.
[01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:30.320]   Well, there's this application that--
[01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:31.040]   it's in two parts.
[01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:31.720]   There's an iPhone app.
[01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:35.600]   And there's also an app that runs on your Mac called
[01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:37.000]   Ervidea.
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.200]   And it's really clever.
[01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:40.560]   And it works really, really well.
[01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:42.920]   Basically what you do, you put the Ervidea server
[01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:44.400]   on your Mac where your media is, or you
[01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:46.440]   point it at your media files.
[01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:49.200]   And then you install the iPhone application.
[01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:51.360]   And what it does, it allows you to--
[01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:53.120]   well, one, if you want to convert the files,
[01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:54.000]   it will actually convert it.
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.600]   You can use your iPhone to start off a conversion process.
[01:30:56.600 --> 01:30:58.960]   And it will convert the files so you can play them on your iPhone.
[01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:01.640]   But the really neat thing is that it will actually stream.
[01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:03.640]   And it will do live streaming of the file,
[01:31:03.640 --> 01:31:07.200]   even if it's not in the format that the iPhone natively supports.
[01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:10.560]   So you could have an MKV file, a 1080p MKV file,
[01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:12.600]   sitting on your hard disk on your Mac.
[01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:15.000]   Use a video on your iPhone.
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.320]   And you get it to live stream.
[01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:17.080]   And it buffers.
[01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:19.280]   It takes about 10 or 15 seconds to start.
[01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:23.880]   Once it starts live converting, it will actually output that to your iPhone
[01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:24.800]   or your iPad.
[01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:25.720]   And you can watch it.
[01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:27.720]   And you can watch the whole movie right the way through.
[01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:31.120]   Other than that 10 or 15 second pause while it converts the first bit,
[01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:34.360]   it will actually convert the lot and stream at the same time.
[01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:37.000]   It's really clever.
[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:37.880]   Very cool.
[01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:40.600]   Give me the URL again, or I guess your album is great.
[01:31:40.600 --> 01:31:42.080]   It's an iPhone, absolutely.
[01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:44.000]   In method.com.
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:50.360]   So if you go to the website at www.inmethod.com/dashvideo,
[01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:52.440]   you'll see there, I'll give you a link to the iTunes.
[01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:54.120]   I think it's only-- there's a free version.
[01:31:54.120 --> 01:31:56.320]   I'm not sure the limitations are on the free version.
[01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:59.000]   But the full blown application is only--
[01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.480]   I think it's $2.99, I think, around that area.
[01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:03.360]   It's not very expensive.
[01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:05.760]   And it will export to like 640 by 480.
[01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:07.680]   So you can have a 1080p movie on your hard disk.
[01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:10.520]   And it will stream that live convert at the same time.
[01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:13.560]   And you can watch it on your iPhone at 640 by 360.
[01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:15.280]   And the picture quality is fantastic.
[01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:16.320]   There's no latency.
[01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:18.120]   It works really well.
[01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:19.360]   That's like--
[01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:21.720]   It's very good, very good.
[01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:23.160]   I say, you can convert if you want,
[01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:24.280]   so you can start a conversion job,
[01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:25.640]   and it will convert the whole thing.
[01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:28.200]   But this live conversion-- you need to have an Intel Mac for it
[01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:30.400]   to do, and a fairly speedy one as well for it to do the live
[01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:31.280]   conversion.
[01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:33.400]   But it will convert on the fly and stream it as well at the same
[01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:34.080]   time.
[01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:35.920]   So you can actually be sitting at your TV,
[01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:37.400]   and not want to watch the TV.
[01:32:37.400 --> 01:32:38.960]   Your better half is watching the TV.
[01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:40.480]   Get your iPad.
[01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:41.520]   Connect to your media device.
[01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:44.640]   In fact, it shows you the folder structure on your Mac.
[01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:47.120]   So you can see all the folders where you have all your media.
[01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:48.320]   Pick a piece of media.
[01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:50.520]   Say it's a 720p video.
[01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:51.360]   Tap that.
[01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:53.960]   And you have an option to start conversion,
[01:32:53.960 --> 01:32:56.560]   start streaming, or cock it to iTunes as well.
[01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:58.440]   You will even expose your iTunes playlists.
[01:32:58.440 --> 01:33:01.360]   So you've got iTunes videos in iTunes as a playlist.
[01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:03.120]   You can access those as well.
[01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:04.360]   Click Live Convert.
[01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:05.880]   Wait till 15 seconds, and then watch
[01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:08.640]   you start streaming to your iPad.
[01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:09.480]   Pretty good.
[01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:10.640]   Can it stream?
[01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:12.880]   You can't stream live video, though, to your iPad.
[01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:14.440]   Mm-hmm.
[01:33:14.440 --> 01:33:16.800]   No, it's not only pre-recorded media
[01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:17.800]   you have on your hard disk.
[01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:19.360]   I'm not sure about live stuff.
[01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:20.720]   I would doubt it.
[01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:22.240]   OK.
[01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:25.040]   I wanted to do the first iPad application.
[01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:26.240]   Pick.
[01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:28.600]   Mm-hmm.
[01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:29.920]   I think we should leave that to Andy.
[01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:36.320]   I've been alive forever, and I wrote the very first ad.
[01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:40.080]   I put the curve out and the user interface together.
[01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:41.960]   This credit goes to Erica Siboon.
[01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:44.000]   Once again, she's the great developer who
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.360]   writes for the unofficial Apple web blog,
[01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:48.520]   and has been on the show before.
[01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:52.040]   She noted that there is an iPhone application called
[01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:55.760]   Neon Wallpaper Backgrounds Creator, which--
[01:33:55.760 --> 01:33:57.640]   if you're an iPhone user, you probably
[01:33:57.640 --> 01:33:59.840]   know about $0.99 for this.
[01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:03.080]   And the folks at Neon have announced, yes,
[01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:07.440]   they are going to have a version to create wallpaper
[01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:09.240]   for your iPad.
[01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:11.160]   So in fact, they've posted a video on YouTube,
[01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:14.200]   quite a beautiful video on YouTube showing--
[01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:17.120]   now remember, this is the iPad's simulator interface,
[01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:19.280]   not the actual interface.
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:22.080]   It's kind of got an interesting interface,
[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:23.400]   kind of like a slot machine, where
[01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:28.480]   you pick colors, fonts, styles, and background.
[01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:30.560]   You can do it randomly, or you can do it by hand.
[01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:31.920]   You can add your own images.
[01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:34.400]   You can rotate it, change the font size, the line wrap,
[01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:35.480]   and so forth.
[01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:38.960]   It will create an image for your wallpaper.
[01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:41.920]   You can do dynamic wallpaper as well.
[01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:44.640]   I don't know what that means, but we'll have to find out.
[01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:46.800]   And put a picture or a logo on it.
[01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:49.200]   So of course, we'll be doing the Twit logo wallpaper
[01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:51.440]   for the iPad very quickly.
[01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:53.680]   But this will be out at $0.99 on the iPhone.
[01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:58.040]   So I presume this will be available day of on Saturday,
[01:34:58.040 --> 01:34:59.080]   $0.99 as well.
[01:34:59.080 --> 01:35:01.520]   And it's one thing to change the wallpaper on the iPhone.
[01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:02.800]   I don't feel too--
[01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:04.040]   I just put a picture there.
[01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:06.080]   But I guess if you want to do your iPad,
[01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:06.920]   that's a lot more space.
[01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:09.920]   There's a lot more wallpaper there.
[01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:14.320]   So it might be kind of fun to have a little bit more control
[01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:15.560]   over that.
[01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:17.560]   And maybe Andy, you could have one that says something like,
[01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:19.440]   this is not an iPad.
[01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:23.360]   This is only an amazing simulation.
[01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:25.240]   What could have been my pick of the week,
[01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:30.480]   I have a friend who's a really good like a sewer and seamstress.
[01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:34.880]   And so she took my fake iPad and built me--
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:37.440]   I told her that she said that she was making a sleeve
[01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:39.120]   for the iPad that she had ordered.
[01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:41.640]   And I said, what you really need to do is kill her feature
[01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:42.920]   for this thing, make sure there's
[01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:44.240]   like a pouch on the back of it.
[01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:46.200]   That's exactly the right size for a MyFi,
[01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:48.200]   because a lot of the Wi-Fi users are going to be using
[01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:49.360]   both of those things.
[01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:53.280]   And so I took this over for a fitting the other day.
[01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:59.000]   And she said, well, my machine can also do embroidery.
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.840]   So do you want me to literally have an embroidered?
[01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:03.880]   This is not contained in iPad.
[01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:05.880]   That would be good.
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:07.640]   It could be a very stylistic.
[01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:09.000]   He sees nothing I'd say.
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.840]   Sese, cine, paz, and ipad.
[01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:13.960]   And now, ladies and gentlemen, the pick of the week
[01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:17.600]   from Mr. Andy, not go to Chicago sometimes?
[01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:20.120]   Well, I occasionally do interviews
[01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:22.000]   that I then have to transcribe.
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.640]   And that is the absolute most soul sucking thing ever,
[01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:27.440]   because the only thing worse than having to type a lot
[01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:30.080]   without thinking is having to listen to your own voice
[01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:32.920]   and then for a half hour and an hour and half to think.
[01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:35.080]   So I'm going to recommend two different tools
[01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:38.560]   that I came across, two and a half, actually.
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:41.000]   One is a service that someone recommended to me called
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:41.960]   WeScribeit.
[01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:47.480]   It's called WeScribeit.com, where it's a transcription service.
[01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:49.720]   You just email a file to them.
[01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:52.240]   And they will send back to you a Word file
[01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:55.520]   with a complete transcript of the entire file.
[01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:59.880]   And their rate is $0.01, a penny a word normally.
[01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:02.880]   So if you have a 60 minutes recording,
[01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:04.360]   they have a sample table here.
[01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:08.080]   It will cost you $54.56 to have a complete transcript.
[01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:10.360]   Yeah, but think about the idea of,
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:11.520]   I'm finished with the interview.
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:12.760]   I emailed this to the service.
[01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:14.080]   I go out to dinner, I come back,
[01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:16.520]   and the transcription is done.
[01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:21.680]   And in many situations, getting that work done for me
[01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:23.000]   and being able to come home from dinner
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:24.480]   and be ready to start editing this
[01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:25.960]   and start writing about it,
[01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:29.120]   that might be an interesting proposition for me.
[01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:30.760]   So the other cool thing is that people might think,
[01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:33.240]   well, how about you use Mac's speech's dictation tool,
[01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:34.800]   which often works.
[01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:37.720]   Unfortunately, when you're doing a phone interview,
[01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:39.440]   the phone quality is not good enough
[01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:41.600]   to do that kind of automatic transcription.
[01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:44.720]   Also, multiple voices is also a problem.
[01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:46.520]   So this, when you can have three people in a conference call
[01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:47.880]   and they will give you a transcript
[01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:49.680]   of the entire conversation all three ways.
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:51.080]   I haven't used it myself,
[01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:52.480]   but you better believe that I've bookmarked it
[01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:55.600]   because I believe that I'm sure that at some point in the future,
[01:37:55.600 --> 01:37:57.120]   there's gonna be a time where I don't think,
[01:37:57.120 --> 01:37:59.520]   yeah, which is 60 bucks to transcribe this interview,
[01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:01.800]   I'm gonna think, great, I can actually get this done
[01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:04.360]   and post it by tomorrow rather than having to wait two days
[01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:07.000]   for me to have time to go through all this thing.
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:10.600]   What I did instead, I didn't wanna spend 60 bucks.
[01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:13.880]   So I started looking for tools that help you
[01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:15.680]   transcribe conversations.
[01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:18.920]   And I found this really good app in a Google code,
[01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:20.880]   a free app called Transcriptions.
[01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:23.560]   It is a word processor that's designed explicitly
[01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:26.880]   for transcribing video and audio.
[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:29.120]   You have a one window interface in which you can actually
[01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:31.760]   have the video, even if it's a video, video playing
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:34.280]   in one pane of the window, you have keyboard shortcuts
[01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:36.720]   that will have you sort of stutter stop the playback
[01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:38.880]   so you can catch up as you type it.
[01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:41.840]   I believe it also supports slowing down the speed
[01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:45.520]   so that it can go down to a speed that you can accommodate.
[01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:46.960]   And I thought it was very, very easy.
[01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:49.560]   Some of the shortcuts have to be sort of up to,
[01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:52.280]   I believe that's to playback controls are control one,
[01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:55.240]   control two, control three, just to keep the regular
[01:38:55.240 --> 01:38:57.200]   command keys free for other things.
[01:38:57.200 --> 01:39:00.880]   And so I found that really, really useful.
[01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:02.680]   And then of course now this, I'm gonna go,
[01:39:02.680 --> 01:39:06.440]   we have to do a callback to an earlier recommendation.
[01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:09.480]   I use Transcriptions long enough to verify
[01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:11.480]   that yes, it does work, yes, it does work great, great.
[01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:12.880]   So let's just take a break and then come back
[01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:14.200]   and start tackling this job.
[01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:16.240]   And in the meantime, someone reminded me that
[01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:19.240]   Srivner actually does have my favorite word processor
[01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:21.560]   has a transcription feature built in.
[01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:22.400]   - Of course it does.
[01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:24.760]   - You simply drag the MP3 file into your project,
[01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:27.200]   it will open in a split pane of your window.
[01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:29.880]   There are simple keyboards, shortcuts to control playback
[01:39:29.880 --> 01:39:31.000]   and you get it done and dust it.
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:32.960]   So that's of course what I did instead.
[01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:36.640]   So a triple recommendation, if you don't have,
[01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:38.920]   if you don't have Srivner transcriptions,
[01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:42.560]   give that a try, I think it's a really wonderfully done
[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:44.920]   solution, if you want to do nothing whatsoever,
[01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:47.840]   then pay a penny a word and go to these other guys.
[01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:48.680]   - Great.
[01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:50.920]   Or, well, there you go.
[01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:53.320]   There's a lot of solutions to this.
[01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:56.640]   You know, it's funny, I'm not sure if I'm allowed
[01:39:56.640 --> 01:39:58.920]   to say this or not, I guess I'll say it.
[01:39:58.920 --> 01:40:01.840]   We have a friend's company called PhoneTag,
[01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:03.960]   they spent, I don't know what, a huge amount of money
[01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:08.240]   they donated to Charity Water to get an ad on Twitch,
[01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:11.480]   six months ago or whatever with Jason Calicanis.
[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:13.400]   And I'll be talking ever since then,
[01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:15.160]   when they were at CES, they announced that they are going
[01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:18.400]   to do a transcription service for conference calls
[01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:19.880]   that I think is going to be free.
[01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:21.720]   I'm not sure, but anyway, they've offered it to us,
[01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:23.680]   but the idea is you use one of their conference
[01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:26.280]   calling services, I think ZipDX is the first
[01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:28.400]   and it will automatically be transcribed for you.
[01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:31.040]   And what's interesting, the thing I thought was interesting
[01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:34.320]   is the way they're doing it, they have a service phone tag
[01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:35.920]   that transcribes your voicemail.
[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:38.640]   So they already have people somewhere, I don't know,
[01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:42.520]   in India or somewhere doing transcriptions of short things.
[01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:44.280]   So what they're going to do is take longer things
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:47.120]   and farm them out like 140 characters at a time.
[01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:50.600]   And is that clever?
[01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:53.360]   So nobody's doing the whole thing, which is onerous,
[01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:55.200]   but they're doing a little bit, a little bit, a little bit.
[01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:57.400]   And then I think that to validate it,
[01:40:57.400 --> 01:40:59.280]   they're going to have two or three people do the same thing
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:00.120]   and then--
[01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:00.960]   - I think I do this for free.
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:01.800]   - Have a vote.
[01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:04.440]   It's pretty cheap because you use things
[01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:06.560]   like Amazon Mechanical Turk.
[01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:09.440]   It's an interesting idea.
[01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:11.200]   - It also solves one of the problems that I would have
[01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:12.880]   with using that transcription service,
[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:16.160]   which is that the interview that I did was with Marvel DC
[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:18.600]   about the digital strategy, that's perfectly fine.
[01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:20.320]   But oftentimes you're doing something that has to be
[01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:22.760]   completely confidential and you know,
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:24.160]   that's so you're out there.
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:27.680]   I'm not sure if what could happen in 140 word snippet
[01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:30.000]   or five second snippet that would compromise things,
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:31.160]   but that's an interesting idea.
[01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:32.520]   - I figured some point they're going to have to charge,
[01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:35.480]   but it may be that they charge the conference call provider
[01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:37.080]   and you know, or something like that.
[01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:40.560]   You can do it now with a company called ZipDX.
[01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:42.840]   - We spend good money on transcription.
[01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:44.760]   - Yeah, it's very, well, 55 bucks is actually
[01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:45.680]   not that much for an hour.
[01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:46.920]   So it is, it's expensive.
[01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:49.960]   We actually have a company doing our transcriptions,
[01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:54.160]   pods in print do transcriptions for a number of shows for us.
[01:41:54.160 --> 01:41:56.280]   They specialize in podcasts.
[01:41:56.280 --> 01:41:57.560]   But what I would really like,
[01:41:57.560 --> 01:41:58.640]   and that's what this will provide,
[01:41:58.640 --> 01:42:01.800]   is real time transcription, which we could then use
[01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:04.840]   as closed captioning or kind of store,
[01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:05.840]   which would be very cool.
[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:08.560]   So anyway, so I don't know what the latest is
[01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:09.760]   with that phone tag thing.
[01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:12.000]   I'll find out, I don't know if it's free,
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.760]   but zipDX.com is currently offering it.
[01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:15.600]   - That's very nice.
[01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:16.720]   - Yeah.
[01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:18.200]   Isn't that cool?
[01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:19.520]   All right.
[01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:20.600]   - Did we all do pics?
[01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:22.000]   I think we did.
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:23.640]   I think we are ready to say good night
[01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:27.720]   to everyone on our final iPad free.
[01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:29.400]   - Pre iPad.
[01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:31.400]   - Evidently there might be some choices,
[01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:36.400]   there might be some pics next week related to the iPad.
[01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:39.040]   - But I got the first one.
[01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:40.680]   I got the first one.
[01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:42.040]   - It's gonna be, it's gonna be,
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:43.440]   one of us has got to pick the iPad.
[01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:46.120]   You can't pick the apps for the iPad without picking the iPad.
[01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:46.960]   - Can we all, you know--
[01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:48.240]   - Someone's gonna have to be the fall guy.
[01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:49.240]   - And we probably shouldn't pick it
[01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:50.320]   'til it comes out and we've played with it.
[01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:51.880]   So next Tuesday we will have played with it
[01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:53.520]   for four days, we'll have a better idea,
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:56.320]   and then we can see if we actually pick it.
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:42:57.560]   - Right.
[01:42:57.560 --> 01:42:58.400]   - And you know, we could do,
[01:42:58.400 --> 01:43:01.760]   you pick the 499 one, I'll pick the 591,
[01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:03.440]   and pick the 699 one.
[01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:04.280]   - I already picked the.
[01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:05.120]   - You heard pick the top of the line?
[01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:05.960]   - Two of those, yeah.
[01:43:05.960 --> 01:43:06.960]   - See, I don't need the, I got the cheapest one.
[01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:07.800]   - So you can talk about the cheapest one.
[01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:10.640]   - We'll talk about why, you know, who use case.
[01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:12.840]   - I just turned the dial up. - Don't forget though,
[01:43:12.840 --> 01:43:14.520]   all those people outside the US,
[01:43:14.520 --> 01:43:16.360]   US certainly launch.
[01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:18.280]   So, you know, everybody else in the rest of the world
[01:43:18.280 --> 01:43:21.040]   is looking, salivating at what's going on.
[01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:22.280]   - So we'll have you back on,
[01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:23.440]   and you can talk about what it's like
[01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:25.320]   to watch us play with it.
[01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:27.880]   - Well, actually, I'm guessing we're on Saturday.
[01:43:27.880 --> 01:43:29.120]   (laughing)
[01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:29.960]   - Aha!
[01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:32.920]   Don't come crying to me, Don McAllister.
[01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:35.480]   - You can tell us what it's like in the audio series.
[01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:37.400]   - No, I'm not insensitive to this.
[01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:39.360]   In fact, it's a big problem for us for a lot of things,
[01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:41.000]   even the audible ads sometimes,
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.840]   is that people listen and we sell this stuff,
[01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:45.240]   you know, so highly, and then they go,
[01:43:45.240 --> 01:43:46.600]   "But I can't get one."
[01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:49.800]   - Well, it just happens that I booked a vacation
[01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:51.240]   back in October, I think,
[01:43:51.240 --> 01:43:52.680]   even before the iPad was announced,
[01:43:52.680 --> 01:43:54.640]   and it just so happened, it just fell.
[01:43:54.640 --> 01:43:56.600]   It was to New York, and it just so happens
[01:43:56.600 --> 01:43:59.320]   that right bang in the middle of the four or five days
[01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:00.880]   where there is the launch day.
[01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:02.920]   So I'm actually gonna be down at Fifth Avenue Store,
[01:44:02.920 --> 01:44:04.120]   picking two up,
[01:44:04.120 --> 01:44:04.960]   I'm just gonna give you a couple of days.
[01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:06.260]   - Powerful occasion,
[01:44:06.260 --> 01:44:07.640]   - Powerful occasion.
[01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:09.320]   - That's what you told your wife.
[01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:11.640]   - Huh, this so happens.
[01:44:11.640 --> 01:44:14.920]   - Honestly, honestly, I'm just gonna be honest.
[01:44:14.920 --> 01:44:16.960]   - Remember, honey, we have to talk about the iPad
[01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:19.160]   during every meal to make this the duck go.
[01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:21.640]   (laughing)
[01:44:21.640 --> 01:44:22.600]   - Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:23.960]   we thank you so much for being here.
[01:44:23.960 --> 01:44:25.400]   We hope you will tune in next week.
[01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:28.080]   We are gonna do a little special iPad coverage,
[01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:32.520]   not the 24 hours of iPad that we did for the iPhone 3G launch,
[01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:35.240]   because I don't think there'll be big lines
[01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:36.880]   because most people will do like I did,
[01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:38.040]   and you did, which is just say,
[01:44:38.040 --> 01:44:39.160]   deliver it to me on April 3rd,
[01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:40.360]   why wait in line, right?
[01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:41.200]   - Right, right.
[01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:44.360]   - So however, I do know Robert Scoble tells me
[01:44:44.360 --> 01:44:47.200]   that there will be a party out front of the Palo Alto
[01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:48.360]   Apple Store.
[01:44:48.360 --> 01:44:50.640]   It's called Steve Jobs Apple Store,
[01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:51.480]   'cause that's where we live.
[01:44:51.480 --> 01:44:53.200]   - The Steve Store.
[01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:55.560]   Speak in the past at iPhone launches,
[01:44:55.560 --> 01:44:57.640]   Wozniak showed up, Bill Hertzfield,
[01:44:57.640 --> 01:44:59.360]   or Annie Hertzfeld, Bill Atkinson,
[01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:01.800]   I mean, well-known names in the Apple community
[01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:05.320]   have shown up just to be part of the excitement.
[01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:08.040]   So we're gonna send, I'm not gonna go.
[01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:12.120]   I thought I'd take a break on this one
[01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:14.120]   and send Colleen and Eric Lanigan,
[01:45:14.120 --> 01:45:15.640]   who's one of our video editors,
[01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:18.560]   really great young guy, a couple of young people.
[01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:19.480]   A couple of young people.
[01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:21.160]   - Oh, I said, no, it's whippersnappers down.
[01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:22.400]   They can get up early.
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:24.520]   - We're gonna send them with the Ustream Live pack,
[01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:26.520]   and that we used it to South by Southwest,
[01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:28.040]   the camera on a pole.
[01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:30.480]   Eric will be our--
[01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:32.240]   - Action, Twint Mobile One.
[01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:34.480]   - Twint Mobile One will be on the scene.
[01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:36.000]   - From the action, Twint Mobile One.
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:36.920]   - Okay.
[01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:37.760]   - So they're gonna go there.
[01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:39.400]   I don't know what time, probably in the afternoon,
[01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:41.960]   but I told them, start broadcasting
[01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:43.240]   if there's something going on,
[01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:45.600]   continue to broadcast until it gets deadly dull.
[01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:46.960]   And so that could be all night,
[01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:49.160]   it could be four minutes, we don't know.
[01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:50.000]   I just don't know.

[01:46:02.680 --> 01:46:04.760]   and we will put that up there,
[01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:06.320]   we'll update that as soon as we figure that out.
