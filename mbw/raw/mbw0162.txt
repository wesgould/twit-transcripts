[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   >> It's time for MacBreak Weekly, the show that covers
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   the "I Am Back in Command" here at the White House.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Leo LePord here.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Alex Lindsey is also here.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   He was running things while I was gone.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Hello, Mr. Lindsey.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   >> Hello.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   >> How did everything go?
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Everything stay intact?
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   >> You know, I had so much fun last week.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   >> It is fun, isn't it?
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Sitting at the little board here.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   >> It's tiring.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   I get home and I don't want to think.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   >> Yeah, but did you tell my wife that?
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   My wife was asking.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   She was like, "Can we talk about this?"
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   And I'm like, "I can't.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   My brain is done."
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   >> My wife says, "You never want to talk.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   You never want to talk.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   It's because I'm tired.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   I've been talking all day."
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   >> Well, it's not just the talking.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   It's the multitasking at a constant rate.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   So you're worried about the lower thirds and you're doing
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   the mix and you're doing the pieces and you're running
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   all these pieces.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   You know, all that stuff has your brain going 100%
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   all the time.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   And it's totally exciting when you're doing it.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   So I found myself, like, totally into it.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   And everything else.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   And then when you finish it, you're just toast.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   >> Exhausted.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   But I had a great time.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   >> Thank you so much for filling in.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   I really appreciate it.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   >> It was really my pleasure.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   >> Very nice to have you.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Also here in the magic box.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   >> The lovely and talented Andy.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   >> And let's go.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   >> Hello Leo.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   >> Hello, Andy.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   >> Hello, Andy.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   >> Yeah, I was in Arabia.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   You know, I thought maybe that you don't call it Arabia.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   >> It's exactly.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Well, no, it's --
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   >> You do.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.160]   >> It's not an all insulting to refer to various world nations by the names they had under
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.760]   British colonial rule.
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.760]   That's just respectful.
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.160]   It shows you took the time to study a little bit about the nation's history.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.200]   I was salon.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.000]   >> I had a lovely, lovely time in the Belgian Congo.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.640]   No, I -- it was really -- I'll talk more about Dubai at some point, I'm sure.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.200]   But it was just a fantastic trip.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.200]   TEDx was incredible.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:28.440]   I met so many people, very wonderful people doing amazing things from all over the region.
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.880]   They call it Arabia themselves.
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.480]   Maybe that's just because they're speaking in English.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.600]   But it was wonderful.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.600]   I'm a little tired.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.560]   I'm still on Dubai time, which means it's a midnight right now.
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.720]   >> Is it still sunny in your world?
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.280]   >> Is it still sunny in my world?
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.520]   >> It isn't in Dubai time.
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.840]   In Dubai, it's sunny.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.840]   Here it's pouring rain.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.640]   In fact, I have to apologize for those of you who are watching the live stream.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.440]   We had a big power outage about an hour ago and it's taken me quite a bit to get things
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.200]   working again.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.240]   But I think we're all up and running.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.880]   You know, every time something like that happens, it reminds me this isn't really TV
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.880]   yet.
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.360]   We're not quite there yet.
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.560]   It's still a gorilla theater that we're doing.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.040]   Anyway, Andy and Alex, good to talk to you.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.880]   And let's talk about the Mac.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:18.880]   What do you say?
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.380]   >> Sounds like a good point.
[00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.320]   >> Is there anything to talk about?
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.840]   Well, I just got my iPhone 3.1.2 update.
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:27.840]   What is that?
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.960]   Andy, you're the author of iPod Strips Naked.
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.200]   I mean, iPhone power.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.920]   >> That's my direct to video subscription series.
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.440]   The first volume is $9.95.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.920]   But you are sitting up for $9.29 per month.
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.880]   >> iPhone Gone Wild.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.080]   And if you see the iPhone Gone Wild RV at your college campus, by all means, you know,
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.720]   strip your shirt on a baguette and stop on by.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.240]   >> So is this today or did this happen while I was in Arabia?
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.080]   >> I believe it happened while you were in Arabia.
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.880]   I think it was a bug fix release.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.240]   Realize that I was off the map for about three days.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.240]   >> You do.
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.720]   >> Because, well, chiefly because I was, let me put it this way.
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.960]   I did not know that the Red Sox have been knocked out of the World Series of the LPS.
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.680]   >> I haven't watched my T-vos yet.
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.720]   >> Well, they lost.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.320]   >> Well, at least those Dodgers are going to lose.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.000]   >> They're still definitely in the hunt.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.040]   >> At least there's no chance that Dodgers could get on to the next.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.960]   >> And they'll never leave Brooklyn either.
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.080]   >> Yeah, I was working so hard.
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.040]   The drop deadline for the book was this weekend, which meant that I spent every waking moment
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.400]   doing nothing but finishing the book.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:47.200]   So I fell behind on at least a, if it were 3.1.5, I would have known about it.
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.080]   3.1.2, I downloaded it, I installed it.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:56.680]   Everything is like, if I put up slice of bread on the toaster, I put the little lever down.
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.680]   It doesn't come up for a while.
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.720]   I think, okay, does this in any way impact any of the work that I have to do or redo
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.720]   in the book?
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.960]   No, fine, I'll just let the toast burn.
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.840]   >> Yeah, that's your question, isn't it?
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.240]   >> Not so much, what does this do, but does it change the book?
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.240]   >> Yes.
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.960]   >> I have to say that I've had all three of the main issues that it update handles.
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.360]   >> Yeah, it's like battery draining, security locking and what's the third?
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.240]   >> Well, one is where the iPhone will not wake up from sleep.
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.400]   And I, both I and my son have both had that problem where it goes to sleep.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.280]   >> I am my son, you mean Malachi, you're three or nine?
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.240]   >> No, Malachi had his own iPhone, but then it got, it got absconded with one, another
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.240]   one got broken.
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.640]   But no, but Stephen has one, so he's-
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:38.640]   >> That son, okay.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.640]   >> That's it?
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.120]   >> Doesn't every two year old have an iPhone?
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.040]   I mean, come on, it's gotten to that point.
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.720]   You've seen the penetration into the market and-
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:50.000]   >> While I was in the United Arab Emirates in Dubai, they announced that they were going
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.200]   to start selling the iPhone in UAE, but it's funny because everybody had one already.
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.320]   I don't know how they got one, but I think they have the money to-
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:02.200]   >> It's very expensive, at least a hundred bucks a month, just for the data.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.200]   It's very expensive.
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:08.680]   It's funny, you'd think that a place like that would have really good internet connections.
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:15.120]   And I think there's one or two undersea cables that serve all of the Middle East.
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.880]   So it's a little shaky out there.
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.480]   Not the best bandwidth.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:24.400]   >> But the other ones that were an issue was intermittent issues with a cellular network,
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.320]   that you'd lose a cellular network until you restarted and you couldn't get back to it.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.880]   And I've had that traveling and then also-
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.440]   >> All that happens to me all the time.
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.440]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:36.280]   >> And then finally fixes a bug that could cause an occasional crash during video streaming,
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.280]   which I've also-
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:41.320]   >> We had asked a few weeks ago if people were having battery problems because we hadn't
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:46.040]   really experienced them and boy did I get, we got over 200 calls for people saying yes.
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.040]   So this clearly was a problem, it's a good apple fix that.
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.040]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.880]   >> So it's worth updating, definitely.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.760]   These aren't fixes that are happening occasionally.
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.200]   I think these are fixes that are happening to a lot of people.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.240]   >> And this isn't fixing it so the Palm Pre won't sink or anything like that.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.840]   >> I'm sure it does that too.
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.080]   >> Something you actually need.
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.480]   I guess that's iTunes that they have to change that in.
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.080]   >> Well, I think it also does break.
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.840]   There was a tethering hack that I do believe in this new version.
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.600]   >> Oh, I'm sure broke that, yeah.
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.040]   >> So they fix the things they need to fix and then while they're doing that, we'll break
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.040]   the Palm Pre.
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.040]   >> We're in here.
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.040]   >> Yeah.
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.640]   >> As long as we're in here, let's just make sure those pirates get a little frustrated.
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:27.360]   There is already black rain, there's already a 3-1-2 unlock.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.360]   >> Not actually.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.720]   >> Not unlock, I'm sorry.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:30.720]   Jailbreak.
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.000]   >> It's a jailbreak, important to make the distinction.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.240]   But I don't know if there's one yet for 3-1.
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.240]   Maybe there is for 3-1-2.
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.240]   I guess there is a black rain.
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.240]   >> Yeah, it looks like there's a jailbreak for-
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.240]   >> Black rain.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.240]   >> Yeah, from black rain.
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.240]   >> Yeah.
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.240]   >> Yeah.
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.240]   >> Okay.
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.240]   >> Three a's.
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.240]   >> Okay.
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.240]   It's not taking them long, is it?
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.240]   >> No.
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.760]   >> Hey, I just bought a bunch of laptops and desktops.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:52.760]   Any new Macs yet?
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.760]   >> Sounds like they're gonna be coming soon.
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:55.760]   >> Any minute now.
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:56.760]   >> No.
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:00.320]   >> The rumors are, any day now, yeah?
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:05.280]   >> The rumor sites that you have to understand are no longer actually talking to anybody internally
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.280]   at Apple.
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.800]   They literally are just watching your office.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:08.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.560]   >> Yeah, they just, they go well.
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:11.560]   >> What's that?
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:11.760]   >> That's the UBS- >> That's the UBS-
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:12.560]   >> Home-resigned-
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:13.560]   >> What a Leo order.
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.560]   >> It's like a Leo order.
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.560]   >> I did get though.
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.880]   I'm so excited.
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.800]   My Windows 7 party pack.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.040]   It's a little smaller than I thought.
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:24.680]   I mean, how can they get a whole party in this small box?
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.680]   >> I evidently threw compression.
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:33.560]   >> It's a hex to ASCII compression that, or ASCII to hex compression that makes it very
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:34.720]   small, but watch out.
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.120]   Don't, you gotta be careful not to open that.
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.600]   It may fill up the entire room.
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.520]   >> Well, Microsoft is very kind because they put instructions on here.
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.520]   It says, "It's here.
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.680]   Your party pack has arrived.
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:44.920]   Operating instructions.
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.360]   One, open box."
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.800]   >> Well, that's good.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:49.960]   >> Two.
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.480]   This is starting to sound like that Saturday Night Live song.
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.440]   Put a hole in the box.
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:57.320]   Three, add friends.
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.320]   >> Four.
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.240]   >> That's where all the space went.
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.640]   >> Party till done.
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.640]   >> You know, I tell you.
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:08.040]   >> See, it should have been party that told them 1,000 times, party till dawn, not party
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.040]   till dawn.
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.040]   >> Party till dawn.
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.040]   >> That thing?
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.520]   >> Clippy, like automatic correction system.
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.440]   >> You seem to be writing a party instruction manual.
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.440]   Would you like some help?
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:19.600]   >> That's the difference between the music industry and the computer industry.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.440]   See, in the music industry, it's party until dawn.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.440]   >> Dawn.
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.280]   Here's party until dawn.
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.280]   Let's see what's in here.
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:29.280]   I think I'm going to open it.
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.080]   I would save it till Windows weekly, but that's not till Thursday.
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.080]   I cannot hold on.
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:37.000]   And Alex, you were very-- this came while you were in the-- it was very tempted.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.520]   >> You were in the command seat.
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:43.560]   >> You were playing a Spock to my Captain Kirk.
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.560]   >> Yes.
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.560]   >> It can be like the briefcase and pulp fiction.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.120]   It's going to be a golden glow.
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.720]   >> I can't tell you what's in here, but this is good.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.720]   Wow.
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:52.720]   Oh my God.
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:56.960]   Well, okay, I'll show you one little thing.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.800]   >> Windows 7 playing cards, enough said.
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:00.800]   >> Oh, wow.
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:01.800]   There you go.
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.800]   >> If-- if-- who's the king?
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:04.800]   >> Windows 7.
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.160]   >> Now, do listen closely.
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.360]   The port this is for your--
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.560]   >> Oh, this is-- this-- oh, look.
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:10.560]   >> Oh, these--
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.920]   >> Each of these playing cards is infused with a neurotoxin.
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:17.280]   If you want to deal a full house with all red cards, it will detonate immediately.
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.520]   Look at the pen.
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.520]   Click it twice to set the timer.
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:23.520]   And what I'm looking for-- oh, here it is, my autographed.
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.320]   Uh-oh, you know, I thought it'd be-- I thought it'd be bigger.
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:30.360]   >> My autographed copy of Windows 7 by Steve Ballmer.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.200]   I bet you his hand was really tired.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.960]   >> Yeah, how many do you think you saw?
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:35.960]   I signed it.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.200]   Now, do you think Apple would ever do something like this, this window?
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.200]   So here's what they did.
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.040]   They went to Houseparty.com, which is a site that does this for other stuff.
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.760]   Like you could go there and celebrate California avocados.
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.360]   >> If you want.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.200]   >> They have parties for other commercial entities.
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:53.280]   And they signed up and so they're having a Windows 7 House party and they-- there was
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:56.280]   some-- you know, you had to apply to get in, you had to get approved, and then--
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.720]   you know, it gives you some support and stuff, and then they had the video.
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.280]   We all saw the video.
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:05.360]   >> And I think a lot of people signed up.
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.240]   And I think a lot of it was tongue in cheek, but so what?
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.920]   They still get the publicity, right?
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.840]   >> I think the Houseparty thing makes a lot of sense.
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.520]   I think that I would not expect Apple to do anything like that.
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:14.520]   I mean, Apple-- >> I think so.
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:15.520]   It's not cool enough.
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.840]   >> Apple's picky about who can actually show up for their own events.
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:21.320]   They do the event-- you know, it's this-- I was talking to someone who does a lot of
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:24.480]   these types of events and they spend a lot of money on food and they do all-- you know,
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.080]   they make it a dinner and they do all these things.
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.880]   And I was like, you know, Apple doesn't do any of that stuff and they were like, well,
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:33.000]   we're not-- you know, that's not-- we don't have the push that Apple has.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.320]   But, you know, Apple, it's hard to get in, let alone, you know, send you anything.
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.600]   >> You know, I think that's actually Steve's signature.
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.440]   Let me just get it wet here.
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:46.040]   >> I do think Apple would do exceptionally well if they did these kinds of--
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.640]   >> I think they'd make it-- >> It's like he did this with a ballpoint pen.
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.720]   You can feel-- you can feel that it's like--
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.880]   >> I bet it's not open.
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:54.880]   >> Oh, a lot of--
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.600]   >> That's a really tight signature for something that--
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:58.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:59.840]   >> You know, you're right.
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:03.240]   But the question is, what benefit are they going to get from this that they wouldn't have
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:06.240]   gotten just by simply shipping a lot of product at the same time?
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.240]   [laughter]
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.240]   >> I mean--
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.240]   >> Oh, wait a minute.
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.240]   >> I mean--
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.240]   >> Oh, you mean just sell some?
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.240]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.520]   >> No, I mean, you know, just-- you know, it's nice, it's lovely.
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:19.200]   I'm glad that lots of people are getting free playing cards.
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.960]   And I just-- when Windows 7 is a very, very good release, I just don't know if--
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.480]   >> Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.160]   Not just a very, very good release.
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:31.000]   Walt Mossberg in the esteemed Wall Street Journal said the best version of Windows ever.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.360]   He even said, "Apple better watch out."
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.360]   >> Yeah, he's not getting any chocolates from Steve this--
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:42.440]   >> Ooh, I think he was at pains to prove that he's no longer Apple's, you know, towel
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.440]   boy.
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:50.240]   >> Well, I mean, it's true in it as far as it goes because the thing is Apple gave Microsoft
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:56.280]   a gift in operating system that they have not given them since 2000, which is they essentially
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:01.480]   took a year off from huge brain hammer scale innovation.
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:04.640]   So that definitely gave Windows a chance to play catch up a little.
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:07.520]   The gap has definitely narrowed.
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:13.000]   I can just imagine the five-year-old girl that Microsoft has kidnapped and forced to
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.440]   like make promotional videos for commercial--
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.440]   >> She's 7, please.
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:20.200]   >> I'm sorry, she's 7, which is still far underneath the child labor
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.200]   laws in this country.
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.240]   Maybe they're doing it in Canada, but there are no laws.
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.240]   >> It's a victory.
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.040]   >> Daddy, look at 7, 7, 7.
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.600]   >> I want to-- I want to add-- it's horrible.
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:33.440]   >> I want to-- I want to be-- I want to get food for the first time in four days, so
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:38.760]   I'm going to use the built-in Windows Wizard to make a slideshow about these quotes.
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:45.280]   And so, it's definitely like sort of back to where we were maybe in, let's say, 2001,
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:52.880]   2002, where we had two very, very good operating systems and Mac was definitely ahead.
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.680]   They weren't just stupid to get ahead.
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:57.680]   >> Hi, my name is Kylie and I found these happy words.
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:00.080]   >> All over my dad's computer.
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:06.880]   >> 7, 7, 7, 7, happy words made happy pictures.
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.880]   >> I'm going to link a slideshow.
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.880]   >> What do you think of that?
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.880]   >> Oh, oh, stop.
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:13.880]   >> What is that?
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:14.880]   What is that music?
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:15.880]   >> I know you can identify that.
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:16.880]   >> A final countdown!
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:26.600]   >> The first song you learned when you get your Casio tone keyboard for your birthday
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.080]   if you're having your birthday in 1987, 1988.
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.800]   >> Does that come with Windows?
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.880]   Is that like a Movie Maker-- it must be?
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:34.880]   Theme?
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:37.040]   >> It's-- no, I think it's a download.
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.080]   A lot of the cool stuff for Windows 7 is stuff that you have to--
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:41.080]   >> Doesn't come with it, yeah.
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:42.080]   >> You have to go out and download it.
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:43.080]   >> Including Windows Movie Maker.
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:46.080]   You have to go to get.live.com and download it all.
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:48.080]   >> Yeah, install it quickly.
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.080]   >> Exactly.
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.080]   >> Well, it's lightweight.
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:56.560]   I actually think that's kind of a decent idea because it allows the bureaucracy of how Microsoft
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:02.760]   puts together these systems means it allows them to keep updating these external tools
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.000]   with a lot more agility than they normally do.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.960]   >> No, I think that's actually not a bad thing.
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:11.400]   It also avoids antitrust actions, things like that.
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:16.080]   >> Yeah, and it also allows them to keep working-- essentially keep-- release Windows 7 without
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:20.400]   worrying about we're not going to delay this for another three weeks because the Movie Maker
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:21.400]   is not done.
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:22.400]   We're not going to do that again.
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.400]   We've been doing that for the past three years.
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.920]   We're not going to do it again, right?
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:30.680]   >> And now they're-- since I was-- as we've talked last, they were shipping an antivirus
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:33.040]   that you still have to download.
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:36.680]   But free antivirus with all Windows, right?
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:40.200]   And not only that, there's one of the good features of the new Windows 7 is that there's
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:45.320]   a tighter, more integrated alert system that allows the operating system to say you don't
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:50.040]   have this-- you don't have an antivirus installed, but here specifically where you can go and
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:51.040]   get-- >> That's good.
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.040]   >> --have that solved.
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.560]   >> And they show other ones too, besides their own, right?
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:54.800]   They show other free antivirus.
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:55.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:56.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.320]   >> But it also means things like, again, if you don't have the media-- if you don't have
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:03.880]   those media extensions installed, you no longer have to be reading websites to learn that,
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:07.480]   oh, wait, I didn't have to spend $50 for this cheap little video editor.
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:11.200]   I could have gotten a free cheap little video editor that's made by Microsoft.
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.800]   So it's just little things like that.
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:18.040]   It's so many things that are not revolutionary new ideas.
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:21.880]   They're just things that you wonder why Microsoft waited so long to roll that into part of
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.680]   the operating system.
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:29.760]   I don't think it's-- I've already seen a lot of pull quotes that have been pretty-- that
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.480]   made Mossberg's reviews sound a lot more dire than it actually is.
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.560]   A lot of pull quotes are saying, oh, well, now there's really no difference between having
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:37.880]   a Mac and having a PC.
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.360]   Well, no, that's not true at all.
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:43.240]   But it means that our friends who use Windows and some of our friends who use Macs are also
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.240]   friends who use Windows.
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.960]   We'll have a much, much happier time of it.
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:47.960]   >> Yeah.
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.960]   Windows 7 means Mac no longer much better.
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:55.760]   I, like many other reviewers have argued, he says, that Apple's Mac OS X operating system
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.680]   is much better than Windows.
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.080]   That's no longer true.
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.440]   >> Yeah, I disagree with that.
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.240]   That's wrong.
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.280]   It's as usual.
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:09.600]   I think the hallmark difference between Apple and Microsoft in terms of when they put up
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:13.600]   big new products like this is Microsoft can fill an operating system with a lot of good
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:19.360]   ideas that may be if lots of other people spontaneously decide to back them up and get
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:22.520]   behind them will result in really great new features for users.
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:26.440]   Whereas Apple, when they do something this multi-touch, it's a very real, very practical
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.680]   solution that appears just about everywhere.
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:34.760]   I had my last full-scale hands-on briefing about two weeks ago, and this is the sort of thing
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:38.840]   where I just want to make sure that after using Windows 7 for about, you know, for several
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:42.920]   months now, I want to make sure that I get the top-down A to Z demonstration so I don't
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:44.000]   miss anything.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.320]   And so many of the coolest bullet items are things like really, really cool support for
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.560]   massive multi-touch.
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:56.360]   If you have nine fingers on one hand, it'll support nine finger multi-touch on the screen.
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:19:03.040]   Now granted, granted, it's like, how do you do that?
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:04.680]   I had a model.
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.680]   You can't even get nine fingers on the touch pad, come on.
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:08.680]   Right.
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.880]   Well, see, you always tell that they're going to screw that up.
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:14.880]   Already we already have okay stretch, okay, stretch, okay, twist.
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.960]   That's going to be this, this, and this.
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:17.960]   Well, Apple kind.
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:22.600]   We do the color and you can set the, if every finger represents red, green, blue, cyan,
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:26.960]   and a gentle, and if you just twist like this and the skin tone is perfect and just simply
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:27.960]   let go like that.
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:28.960]   Yeah.
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:32.960]   No, I mean, they kind of did that with the, the, the, the, the MacBook touch pad.
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.600]   There's, there's, there's still drop crazy.
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:35.760]   Do you use any of those?
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.560]   Well, I want to turn them off.
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:40.920]   And in fact, Jeff Jarvis was complaining about this and I've, I've complained about
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:46.040]   it and you've complained about it, Alex, this spontaneous font size changing.
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:49.400]   And then now it's happening on my desktop, the icons.
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:54.320]   Somehow I'm doing something that the icons are going shrinking.
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:58.480]   And that now I know with command zero, I can get the font size back on the browser, but
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:03.080]   I, I have to actually, you know, do a command J and reset the icon size every time.
[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:04.800]   And I can't figure out why it's doing it.
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:07.320]   And I've, I've looked in the settings.
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:11.920]   Maybe you can help us, Alex, Lynn's, I mean, Andy, and I go, how do we stop that?
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.920]   There's actually, I don't have an, I don't have it on my, I'm back right here.
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:18.960]   There's, there's no real easy way to fix it with settings, but there are a couple of
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:23.320]   third part of utilities that will let you simply say, please ignore multi touch in this
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:27.320]   specific application and this specific circumstance on my Macbook upstairs.
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:30.120]   I was so, it's such a big pain in the butt.
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:34.520]   There's so many times where I'm suddenly looking at, you know, tiny, tiny one point
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:40.200]   text that I've set it up so that multi touch doesn't really, so many multi touch gestures
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:43.480]   are simply not recognized in Safari or Firefox anymore.
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:44.960]   I just turned them straight off.
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:47.560]   They say it's the pinch doing that.
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:48.560]   Yeah.
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:53.120]   I mean, it's the point though with Windows 7 though, is that this, at least this is something
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:57.040]   that if it works wrong, at least it works wrong in every application with Windows 7,
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:02.120]   so much of it is going to be one of the neat features is that there's a right there, there's
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:05.920]   support right inside the operating system for all kinds of different sensor input, like
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:09.720]   accelerometers, GPS, light sensors.
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:14.960]   It's the, there's an API so that if I'm a developer, I can make a completely abstract
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:15.960]   interface into that.
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:19.800]   I don't care where you got this light sensor module, but my application will be able to
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:22.000]   deal with that information if it's available.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.120]   And there's a really swell little demo that you can imagine would work really great on
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:31.120]   a laptop where it uses an ambient light sensor that's built into the laptop to sense if it's
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.640]   really, really super bright in the environment.
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:37.880]   Not only, it doesn't adjust the brightness of the contrast of the display, it simply
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:41.400]   switches to an extremely high contrast black and white display.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:45.080]   It's an RSS reader that where they'll make all the, all the text really, really big to
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:48.600]   make sure they can truly compete with all the glare that you're probably getting off
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:49.600]   of this light sensor.
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.760]   And again, it's a great idea.
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:52.120]   I would love to see that.
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:56.480]   I like to see that sort of agility inside all of this, all the different hardware I have.
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:01.520]   But the question is, I have a, it's a demo application designed to take advantage of
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.400]   the API sets inside Windows 7.
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:08.840]   Are we going to, if I buy a laptop that has that light sensor, can I count on seeing lots
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.560]   of software that supports it?
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:14.000]   So we're as Apple can emphatically say, this is a really great feature.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.360]   We're going to really want to support it.
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.720]   We're going to try to make it easy for you to support developers.
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:21.480]   But if you don't support this ambient light sensor that's going to be inside every single
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:24.360]   MacBook, your competitor will and where would that leave you?
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:25.360]   Exactly.
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.440]   Up a certain creek without a certain implement.
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.040]   And I think Apple can air the other, the other direction as well.
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:34.360]   I mean, because they, you know, there's this obsession with simplicity in simplifying things.
[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:40.400]   And I think that for me, QuickTime is a good example in, in Snow Leopard of probably going
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.640]   too much the other direction.
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:47.080]   I had a, a friend of mine that was, that literally just sent me something over to compress for
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:52.320]   him because he just was like, I, you know, I put Snow Leopard on and now I can't get an
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.720]   H.264 out the other end.
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:58.720]   You know, what you used to use, you know, we're going to take a break and I want to talk
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:02.840]   a little bit of Snow Leopard because in fact, I think I was right.
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:06.080]   And, and I'll let Andy apologize to me in a moment.
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:09.600]   But you know, you, I'm sorry.
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:20.120]   Leo you you you you you qu Francisco everywhere that you're gonna be in Dubai for two whole weeks your warehouse was just gonna be empty. If anything by having parties there, I was scaring away burglars. Okay.
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:34.100]   If that if you want to. And I just want to say that I was. I was only there during the day. Well, somebody left for kegs in my bedroom and I just want to know who before we do that before we do that.
[00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:43.100]   I do want to talk about my friends that go to meeting the Citrix folks have done it again with a great product that we use all the time.
[00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:51.100]   We use it on many of our shows now. In fact, I think beside I know Ray Maxwell's been using it for a while for his screenshots.
[00:23:51.100 --> 00:24:03.100]   Great. That was a great cool. It was awesome. So, you know, when we were using it last week. So he so he has the go to meeting and then he's able and I'm able to show the capture but he has complete control over over what the audience is.
[00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:13.100]   It's a great solution. Yeah. Fantastic. The idea go to meeting is, you know, uses Citrix's unique probably patented. Although I'm not going to assert that.
[00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:24.100]   I would suspect patented remote access capabilities to set up online meetings. Now it's, you know, ostensibly you use it for phone calls.
[00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:31.100]   When you're in the conference call, you know, and you want to show something and you got a keynote presentation or a PowerPoint presentation and you're kind of describing it.
[00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:42.100]   All you have to do is say, look, I want to show you this. So everybody go to go to meeting.com right now. Tap, tap, tap, tap. Okay. They're on go to meeting. Okay. Now I see that button that says join a meeting. Click that.
[00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:51.100]   Click. Now here's the meeting ID. You give them the nine digit number and all of a sudden they're seeing your desktop on their screen and now you show them the PowerPoint.
[00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:59.100]   You can give them control so you can, you, there are a couple ways you can do this. You can have them control your machine, which makes it great for training. If you've got the software, they don't.
[00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:11.100]   Great for collaboration. You could both control it so they could type you type kind of like Google wave. Only this has been around for years, but they can even start a, they can even take the go to meeting session to their computer and show you what's on their screen.
[00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:17.100]   So I mean, it's the ultimate collaboration tool. No longer do you have to describe what you're seeing. You can show them.
[00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:26.100]   It's 100% secure, 128 bit SSL encryption. Very easy to use. No installation. Your client doesn't have to have it installed.
[00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:37.100]   You just, it just goes and it takes a second or two to download the small little stub. It's just a few hundred bytes. If you're not, I can't remember exactly how because it comes in seconds and then boom, they're seeing your screen.

[00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:16.100]   So, big bug in Snow Leopard. Yeah. Whoo. So here's the deal. If you log into the guest account, for some people, and I don't, it's, I don't know how it is reproducible. I haven't been able to, I haven't tried it because I don't want to do it.
[00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:27.100]   But in some cases, your account, your real login will be erased as if it didn't exist, as if it's a brand new account. All your data gone. Bing! That is not good.
[00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:38.100]   All of it. Like, it's the whole user account, I believe. Yeah, it's a blank. It turns into a blank user account. According to that. Now I haven't tried it, so I'm not going to, and I ain't going to try it.
[00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:51.100]   I guess I could set up a machine. And there's been similar problems in the past where, for instance, one of the big "don't cross the beams" on a Mac is when you create your, create an account, you never want to change the name of that account.
[00:26:51.100 --> 00:27:03.100]   Oh, yeah, yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. So that's been a similar, you know, I guess, I want to say Unix era thing, but you don't want to, like, once you create that account, you want to keep it that name.
[00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:12.100]   You don't want to, you know, I wanted to change capitals or move things around, and that's basically, you know, you lose everything. Or that's been my experience.
[00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:20.100]   Now, there have been complaints, according to Mac News Network, since September on the company Support Boards, they say about 100 posts discussing this loss.
[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:32.100]   Apple Today, which is actually yesterday, acknowledged that there is a problem. They say, quote, "We are aware of the issue, which occurs only in extremely rare cases.
[00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:46.100]   And we are working on a fix." You know, the truth is when you sell millions of copies of something, even something that only happens 1/100 of 1% of a time is enough to have to buy hundreds of thousands of people.
[00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:56.100]   Right. And it's also, it's oftentimes a good time to, a good reason to be slow on the upkeep. You know, they say that if you're one step ahead, you're a leader, and if you're two steps ahead, you're a martyr.
[00:27:56.100 --> 00:28:20.100]   In traditionally in the Mac world, we've always updated the minute there's a new update. Tiger, Panther, Leopard, right away. I'm guilty of that. I did it with Snow Leopard, and I had, I went, "Whoa!" And I've only done it on one machine. I actually rolled this machine that's in front of me back, and I am still on Leopard on every other machine. And it has been my recommendation since Snow Leopard came out to wait.
[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:29.100]   And now I'm glad I did recommend that. Do you think, Andy, though, that maybe this is a minor thing, or is this a show-stommer?
[00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:45.100]   It only has to happen to one person, you, in order to make it a shaker. Especially not that you're seeing these commercials about the 70-year-old girl who likes Windows 7 so much, that will tempt you to make a very, very angry change to another operating system.
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:29:02.100]   I don't think it's terribly widespread. It's just one of those things where it's so dynamically bad. It's just the most awful thing that can ever happen to you and your data to simply innocently not do anything bad whatsoever and suddenly find that your entire account has been deleted.
[00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:04.100]   It's T-Mobile Sidekick bad.
[00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:06.100]   Exactly, but your Mac's been side-kicked.
[00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:08.100]   Yeah, I think we should make that a verb now.
[00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:11.100]   Oh, you've been side-kicked!
[00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:14.100]   Oh, so... I think we have the name of the show, right?
[00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:16.100]   Yeah, let me write that down.
[00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:23.100]   For those who haven't heard, because I don't think many Mac users use a sidekick, but that was a horrible situation.
[00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:32.100]   In fact, everybody's writing me now saying, "See? Cloud computing's a bad idea." T-Mobile admits now that all the data that was on these sidekick phones is lost forever.
[00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:40.100]   Yeah, they're doing some sort of server maintenance. It was a very, very easy thing to fix and easy thing to avoid.
[00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:42.100]   Something got totally borked.
[00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:49.100]   The language of the press releases and the information releases to its users are absolutely precious.
[00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:50.100]   There...
[00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:56.100]   Well, you can hold out a hope that we might be able to retrieve your personal data.
[00:29:56.100 --> 00:30:01.100]   We feel as though that that's an unlikely scenario at this juncture.
[00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:05.100]   I shouldn't laugh, because if it happens to you...
[00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:10.100]   Well, Dad, I suppose if we could find the car, maybe we could repair it.
[00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:13.100]   I think it's unlikely we're going to be able to find it at this juncture.
[00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:16.100]   You're six feet of water. At this point might be difficult.
[00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:23.100]   If you could get it from the bottom of the quarry, we'll definitely be able to get those tapes out of the tape deck, but...
[00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:28.100]   We should be approaching this from a, "Let's replace those tapes that have been destroyed."
[00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:35.100]   To team levels credit, apparently they are offering people free side grades to a different phone.
[00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:40.100]   You don't get your data back, but if you don't ever want to use a sidekick again, you can.
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:41.100]   Wow.
[00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:42.100]   Oh, man.
[00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:48.100]   I would love to be a fly on the wall and find out exactly how these discussions happen within the carrier's office,
[00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:56.100]   because this is a situation where they have no responsibility to their customers,
[00:30:56.100 --> 00:31:05.100]   but they had absolutely nothing to do with this, and they're probably just as off at sidekick as a rim, as anybody else.
[00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:14.100]   Now they're looking at every single contract saying, "Is there some sort of clause that says that if you were to screw up so badly
[00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:22.100]   that we want to cast your likeness, Mr. Sidekick Company President, in bronze at 10 times life scale,
[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:30.100]   just so we can take video of that bronze statue being pulled down in the Times Square and being beaten with shoes?"
[00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:32.100]   Can we cancel our contract?
[00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:36.100]   Actually, this just in from Microsoft apologists Paul Therat.
[00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:38.100]   [laughs]
[00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:39.100]   Oh!
[00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:40.100]   Oh!
[00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:41.100]   I hope he doesn't hear that.
[00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:42.100]   I love you, Paul.
[00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:45.100]   He says, "The recent efforts--" This is from a Microsoft.
[00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:51.100]   "Recent efforts indicate the prospects of recovering some lost content may now be possible."
[00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:53.100]   A joint state--
[00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:57.100]   From Microsoft, T-Mobile reads, "We will continue to keep you updated on this front,
[00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:58.100]   and we know how important this is to you.
[00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:02.100]   Apparently, some psychic users are reporting that recovered data is being retransmitted,
[00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:06.100]   so maybe they found a backup in the bottom of a closet somewhere."
[00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:07.100]   We found a zip disc.
[00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:08.100]   What's this?
[00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:13.100]   It's going to take a while for us to put all these 100 megabyte cards into the drive.
[00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:16.100]   You know, I found this blue-ray disc down here.
[00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:18.100]   Do we need this?
[00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:20.100]   It's just a--
[00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:27.100]   But anyway, T-Mobile's offering a $100 payment and a free month of service if you can't recover your data.
[00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:29.100]   So that's fair.
[00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:32.100]   But now, I don't know what Apple's offering people who've had this problem.
[00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:34.100]   I mean, that's a nasty bug on Snow Leopard.
[00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:39.100]   No timeline from Apple about when they'll fix it.
[00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:47.100]   Or there's no-- and there's no workaround except that you should probably disable the guest login on your system.
[00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:54.100]   Because if you accidentally log in as a guest, you could lose all your data.
[00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:57.100]   Well, this is a really good-- I mean, just to get back to backing stuff up,
[00:32:57.100 --> 00:33:01.100]   whether it's the cloud or whether it's an external hard drive, you know, we really--
[00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:05.100]   This is just a reminder, regardless of all the stuff that Apple should fix,
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:13.100]   that, you know, the saying that we have in the office and I see this open over again is that nothing exists until it exists in two places.
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:14.100]   And sometimes three.
[00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:19.100]   And that's kind of my response to the cloud people who say, "Oh, we'll see this, you know, with the sidekick thing.
[00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:21.100]   This proves the cloud's a bad idea."
[00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:24.100]   Well, it is a bad idea if you have only one copy on the cloud.
[00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:26.100]   One point of failure is always going to be a bad idea.
[00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:31.100]   You'd be in the same fix if it wasn't a cloud device and you lost your sidekick and never backed it up.
[00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:33.100]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:36.100]   Or if you were on your PC and your hard drive died.
[00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:39.100]   I mean, you got to have backups even if it's stuff in the cloud.
[00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:45.100]   And I guess the problem with the sidekick is most people, you know, you don't really back it up.
[00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:48.100]   You create the data on-- if you create data on the sidekick, there's no easy way.
[00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:51.100]   I don't think to get it off the sidekick, you just kind of have to--
[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:53.100]   This was always my problem with the sidekick.
[00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:55.100]   Was this cloud of closed environment?
[00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:56.100]   Right.
[00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:58.100]   And you couldn't just end up to a computer and back it up.
[00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:03.100]   And that's one of the things that takes some of the stress out of, like, my iPhone, for instance, is that--
[00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:04.100]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:06.100]   --is that if I-- and I've gone through one in order-- a couple.
[00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:11.100]   And you just simply, you know, re-sync it and you've got-- you've got all the basic data.
[00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:16.100]   I mean, it doesn't keep track of all the music and the apps, but you can install those back.
[00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:19.100]   It just doesn't keep track of where they all are and everything else, so there's a little bit of setup.
[00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:24.100]   I finally got my iTunes library pristine.
[00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:25.100]   I'm going to tell you--
[00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:26.100]   Mine still--
[00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:28.100]   It's actually my-- well, you like my pick of the week, then.
[00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:30.100]   But actually, I don't think it works anymore.
[00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:32.100]   I think I broke it.
[00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:35.100]   Because I recommended it and too many people downloaded it.
[00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:36.100]   But--
[00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:37.100]   Mine's a disaster.
[00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:38.100]   I tried to move it to another drive.
[00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:39.100]   Oh, I cleaned it up.
[00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:41.100]   I got rid of all the duplicates.
[00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:43.100]   I got all the album art perfect.
[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:45.100]   Because I ripped the Beatles.
[00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:49.100]   I got the-- you know, my box set of Beatles stereo came so I wanted it before I left.
[00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:50.100]   I ripped it all.
[00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:52.100]   And it doesn't-- you know, when you rip something, it doesn't come with album art.
[00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:54.100]   So I got everything and I thought, well, I'm going to do it.
[00:34:54.100 --> 00:35:05.100]   And I have now on one-- I got those-- that little-- it's a 750 gigabyte bus powered firewire 800 or USB hard drive
[00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:06.100]   from other world computing.
[00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:09.100]   I just called them Mercury for the name.
[00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:12.100]   But that now holds my entire library and go around.
[00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:14.100]   Oh, it just feels so good.
[00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:16.100]   No, no, you moved it.
[00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:18.100]   You moved it from your internal drive?
[00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:20.100]   Yes, I put it on this thing.
[00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:21.100]   And then cleaned it all up.
[00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:25.100]   And now what I'm going to do is keep copies on my internal drive on all my machines.
[00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:27.100]   But this is the canonical copy.
[00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:32.100]   OK, so you still have it on your laptop as well?
[00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:35.100]   Not on my laptop, no, but I do have it on my desktop machines.
[00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:38.100]   My laptop, you know, is constrained for space.
[00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:41.100]   Well, no, because my-- what I tried to do in the car--
[00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:43.100]   My library is 200 gigs.
[00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:45.100]   I can't-- no, no, I have the same problem.
[00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:48.100]   So what I tried to do is move it all to an external drive just going, you know, I'll sync it.
[00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:53.100]   And so I tried to move my iTunes library to an external drive and then just tell iTunes.
[00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:56.100]   My library is now over there.
[00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:57.100]   Yes, that's what I did.
[00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:59.100]   And it worked for you?
[00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:00.100]   Yeah.
[00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:04.100]   And whenever-- now I can't play any music until I have the external drive plugged in.
[00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:06.100]   Oh, when I plug it in, it just didn't see any of it.
[00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:07.100]   I had to re-import it all.
[00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:09.100]   Oh, no, no, no, that's terrible.
[00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:10.100]   No, this worked for me.
[00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:12.100]   Yeah, no, this worked for me.
[00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:15.100]   And when I rip anything, I have to make sure the drive's pulled in.
[00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:19.100]   Actually, that drive is big enough that it has both my iTunes library and my entire photo
[00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:21.100]   library, my Lightroom library on it.
[00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:25.100]   So that's-- that drive is-- and of course, I'll keep that backed up onto another drive.
[00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:26.100]   But that drive is great.
[00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:28.100]   I mean, I took-- you know, it's really a hand--
[00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:30.100]   I got one of those recently, too.
[00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:31.100]   Oh, my God, that.
[00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:35.100]   It's my favorite enclosure, not only because it's a triple interface, but also because
[00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:38.100]   it is dead simple to swap out drives from that thing.
[00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:39.100]   It's one of the nicest things--
[00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:40.100]   Oh, that's good to know.
[00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:43.100]   So when a bigger drive comes out.
[00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:50.100]   Yeah, that they-- when you have the 2 1/2 inch mechanism version of it, I like-- I'm a big
[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:55.100]   fan of IOMEGA's EGO drive, but it's sealed up like a MacBook.
[00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:59.100]   See, you can't-- it's a 500 gigabyte drive, but you're pretty much stuck with it as a
[00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:01.100]   500 gig drive for the life of the device.
[00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:09.100]   I know that when I invest in this other world enclosure, I've had the old Firewire 400
[00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:16.100]   USB 2.1 version of this for-- I think since 1953, I've had core memory inside that thing.
[00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:17.100]   Yeah.
[00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:19.100]   And every time there's like a new mechanism that comes out, I simply slide out the old
[00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:20.100]   slide in the new.
[00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:21.100]   Right.
[00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:22.100]   And it looks awesome.
[00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:26.100]   This is-- as far as I know, the largest bus-powered drive you can get.
[00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:30.100]   I looked for Terabyte, and I don't see a Terabyte anywhere, but this is 750 gigs.
[00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:31.100]   They also have small--
[00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:32.100]   Smaller drives.
[00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:33.100]   Wait a minute now.
[00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:36.100]   It looks like they do have a Terabyte now.
[00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:38.100]   They've just added a Terabyte.
[00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:39.100]   See?
[00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:40.100]   You bought it?
[00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:41.100]   You made it happen.
[00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:42.100]   I bought it, and that made it happen.
[00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:43.100]   Well, that's OK.
[00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:44.100]   It is really-- it is really.
[00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:45.100]   This is such a slick thing.
[00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:49.540]   But don't you get a little bit scared when you're transacting that much data inside a
[00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:50.540]   pocket drive?
[00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:56.100]   I kind of like the idea of-- I'm OK with the Drobo having two terabytes of storage because
[00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:58.660]   it's a fixed device that's on my desktop.
[00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:05.860]   I kind of like the idea that I'm spreading out my one terabyte of mobile storage across
[00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:10.700]   three different drives so that if I have a physical loss of a drive or a failure or a
[00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:14.580]   drop or something like that, the worst thing that can happen is that I lose one third of
[00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:15.580]   my data.
[00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:18.300]   I also like the idea of having multiple boot drives when I'm traveling, especially when
[00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:19.500]   I'm traveling for more than a week.
[00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:21.420]   Yeah, I should make this a boot drive, shouldn't I?
[00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:22.420]   That's a good idea.
[00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:23.820]   No, I just keep it backed up.
[00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:28.140]   So it's-- you know, and you're right, the only real risk is if I'm on the road with it
[00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:31.140]   and I lose it, then I'm not going to have anything until I get home.
[00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:33.660]   But I always have it fully backed up.
[00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:39.420]   Do you have a partitioned up so that you have a secure area either through an actual partition
[00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:43.340]   or through-- by having a disk image, say, that has here a secure stuff on it?
[00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:44.340]   That's a good idea.
[00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:49.300]   That's the second worry I have is that you're giving away-- here is Leola Port's entire life
[00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:51.740]   in one deck of card size device.
[00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:53.100]   Here's all the music he likes.
[00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:56.460]   He's every picture in video he's shot over the past three months.
[00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:59.260]   That's a good point.
[00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:00.260]   It's all there, isn't it?
[00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:01.260]   All my music.
[00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:07.500]   All the pictures, all the incriminating photos of me and my underwear dancing like Tom Cruise,
[00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:08.500]   except not.
[00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:09.900]   Oh, we do want those to get out.
[00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:14.820]   The other thing that scares me about the encryption is always that I'm afraid that for some bug
[00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:17.980]   is going to happen and it's going to stay encrypted.
[00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:21.940]   What I do want to do, Andy, though, is make a partition that's a boot drive.
[00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:22.940]   That's a very good idea.
[00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:25.220]   So I could always boot from that if I lost the internal.
[00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:26.220]   Yeah.
[00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:28.820]   Well, that's-- Alex, that's a good note.
[00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:32.580]   So encrypting an entire partition hinders recovery.
[00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:37.140]   If you have a whole thing that's right up your recovery, it makes it difficult to recover.
[00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:42.220]   That's why when I have secure areas in my heart drive, I do use an encrypted disk image
[00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:45.820]   where I have like one 10 gigabyte or 20 gigabyte--
[00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:46.820]   Do you use TrueCrypt?
[00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:48.460]   How do you do that?
[00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:51.020]   I've just been using disk utility for that.
[00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:52.980]   Oh, I see what you're saying.
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:53.980]   OK.
[00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:56.620]   Because you've created an encrypted image with disk utility.
[00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:57.620]   Yes.
[00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:02.340]   You have a password encrypted-- password protected and encrypted disk image that you can then
[00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:04.860]   move on to any device that you want.
[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:06.740]   I actually have two or three.
[00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:11.100]   One of them is a disk image that can fit onto a thumb drive so that if I need to--
[00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:18.180]   I have images of things like-- when I was traveling to Asia, I had photos of all of
[00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:24.100]   my travel documents in that disk image and encrypted so that if my passport was stolen,
[00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:26.900]   I have a complete image of everything that was on it, all the data and everything.
[00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:33.340]   I could easily make a call and at least not print it out hopefully but at least show it
[00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:35.340]   to the embassy and get out of a fix.
[00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:37.460]   That's not something that's hard to have on an open file.
[00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:38.460]   Oh, well, I do.
[00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:40.740]   And actually, I have Xeroxes in my suitcase and everything.
[00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:42.700]   But you're right, that's probably a bad idea.
[00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:44.740]   I'm like Polly Ann.
[00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:49.780]   I'm wandering blithely through the world going, hey, hey, you want to go ahead?
[00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:51.300]   I got no privacy.
[00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:55.940]   I took on something when-- and everybody hates me on Twitter now because there's--
[00:40:55.940 --> 00:41:02.180]   Louftansa has this new tweet thing that tweets your progress as you fly.
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:03.180]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:05.740]   And it really pissed everybody off.
[00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:07.180]   But it was such a long flight.
[00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:08.500]   It's a 15-hour flight.
[00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:09.860]   It tweeted like five times.
[00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:12.300]   Leo is now over the Arctic Circle.
[00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:14.100]   Leo is now over Mermansk.
[00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:17.300]   Leo has been cut off from the stewardesses with the bar cart.
[00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:18.300]   Exactly.
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:20.460]   Leo is now defecating on the bar cart.
[00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:23.300]   Leo is now at the hands of federal air marshals.
[00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:25.900]   It would be nice if it would tweet that as well.
[00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:26.900]   Yes.
[00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:27.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:28.900]   Please check Twitpik.
[00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:29.900]   Yeah.
[00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:32.140]   Leo knows damn well how much how many drinks he's had.
[00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:33.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:36.940]   He doesn't need a stupid, smarmy waitress to tell him what to do.
[00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:37.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:40.220]   It's kind of cool.
[00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:42.420]   It's called MySciestatus.com.
[00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:43.420]   But it really did.
[00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:44.420]   It probably over-tweeted.
[00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:46.860]   It was an over-share.
[00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:47.860]   So--
[00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:48.860]   Well, I'll see.
[00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:49.860]   There are two different kinds of Twitter.
[00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:55.100]   There's Twitter for people who have, like, followed by maybe a few dozen people, friends,
[00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:56.820]   like co-workers and family.
[00:41:56.820 --> 00:42:00.180]   And then there are people who have, like, thousands of Twitter followers.
[00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:03.940]   And a lot of these tools just are not good ideas for people who have thousands of people
[00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:07.940]   following them because it's great when, like, your entire family gets, "Gee, I wonder
[00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:08.940]   how Leo's doing an vacation."
[00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:11.460]   "Oh, look, his plane landed safely.
[00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:12.620]   What a load off of my mind."
[00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:13.620]   I don't--
[00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:14.980]   I would want to call him and bother him.
[00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:15.980]   No, I'm worried.
[00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:20.020]   But when it's, like, 20,000 people, it's like, "Oh, look at Mr. Mr. Celebrity.
[00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:22.020]   He thinks it's important that everybody knows that the--"
[00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:23.020]   Yeah.
[00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:24.020]   His homie, though, gets where it's like.
[00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:28.700]   It's probably-- it says, "Leo is now flying over the Arctic Ocean on Emirates.
[00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:32.540]   Leo is now flying over Baffin region, none of it territory Canada.
[00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:35.260]   Leo is now flying over Victoria Island, Canada.
[00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:39.700]   Leo is now flying over Fort Smith unorganized new territories Canada."
[00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:41.540]   Like, re-target the missiles.
[00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:42.540]   Yeah, right.
[00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:43.540]   Yeah, somebody said that.
[00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:46.300]   Are you trying to get somebody to shoot you down?
[00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:47.300]   And then it does, in fact--
[00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:53.020]   If you're flying a light aircraft, probably Baff Bay area, by all means buzz the plane.
[00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:58.380]   So it does give you, like, the exact longitude and latitude.
[00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:02.300]   You know, it goes to a Google map and it says exactly where you are.
[00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:04.260]   So-- but it only did it every hour and a half.
[00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:06.220]   It's just that it was a 15-hour flight.
[00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:10.380]   Yes, I don't think that's going to be enough accuracy for a surface-to-air missile.
[00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:12.660]   Well, I've gone by then.
[00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:14.660]   What a great free advertisement for Twitter.
[00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:16.940]   The first time one of those planes goes down.
[00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:21.140]   And every single local news story will say, "The last known location was an eighth--"
[00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:24.980]   There was a tweet on his account about the plane is now over Baff Bay.
[00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:25.980]   Tweeted.
[00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:27.500]   That's the last time we heard.
[00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:31.500]   110 passengers were saved because we knew exactly where the plane was.
[00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:34.140]   You see Twitter saves lives.
[00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:38.420]   All right, coming up in just a little bit more stuff.
[00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:42.180]   More big Mac stories, but I do have to take a little break and tell you about Squarespace.
[00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:44.380]   You still using Squarespace, Mr. Lindsey?
[00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:45.380]   Oh, yeah.
[00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:46.380]   You're like--
[00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:48.940]   Actually, we've actually almost rebuilt the entire-- it was amazing.
[00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:51.020]   We just rebuilt the entire-- we're about to-- you know, just--
[00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:56.220]   I just moved DB Garage's website, my other company, to Squarespace.
[00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:59.820]   And the guys, I thought that they were going to have to, like, re-jigger everything and
[00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:01.980]   get it all working.
[00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:05.940]   And when I actually saw it, they showed it to me this morning.
[00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:07.380]   And I opened it up.
[00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:08.380]   It was the same.
[00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:12.780]   I mean, it looks like the same website that DB Garage had except now it's in Squarespace.
[00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:14.860]   Now we can edit it easily and quickly.
[00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:17.100]   Now we can-- you know, it just makes it much, much easier.
[00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:18.820]   It's in the cloud, baby.
[00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:19.820]   Yeah.
[00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:20.820]   It's quite a thing.
[00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:21.820]   Yeah.
[00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:26.180]   So we're moving-- the front end of the Pixel Core site is in that-- this week-- or Twip
[00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:28.020]   Log is in Squarespace.
[00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:33.460]   My blog-- I mean, all of these are all in Squarespace because once it's there, you know, it works.
[00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:34.460]   People can edit it.
[00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:38.620]   I was talking to my aunt over the weekend and she's trying to get her-- she does-- she's
[00:44:38.620 --> 00:44:42.380]   got like a specialized hair salon.
[00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:44.820]   And she's trying to figure out what to do and how to get it up there.
[00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:45.820]   That's not her specialty.
[00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:47.620]   And I was like, oh, you just got to use Squarespace.
[00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:49.820]   You know, don't bother to try to figure this stuff out.
[00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:50.660]   Yeah.
[00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:51.660]   It's so slick.
[00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:54.580]   I mean, I can give you a list of the features.
[00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:57.220]   You've got the great templates.
[00:44:57.220 --> 00:45:00.660]   And by the way, not just for blogs, I think a lot of times we say it's a blog tool.
[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:01.660]   It's not.
[00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:02.660]   It's-- OK.
[00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:07.300]   So it's a hosted site system, software, you know, content management system that they
[00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:08.660]   do the hosting.
[00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:15.260]   They've got an amazing architecture that allows them to basically load balance across many,
[00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:16.260]   many machines.
[00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:17.260]   So you're never down.
[00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:20.100]   I mean, it's not, you know, it's not a shared hosting.
[00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:22.420]   It's amazing the way they do this.
[00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:24.620]   It does have a blog module, but it also has forums.
[00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:25.860]   It has a photo gallery.
[00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:27.060]   It has a form builder.
[00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:30.220]   So you can, you know, have people fill out forms, do polls, that kind of thing.
[00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:37.660]   Google Maps built in amazing stats built in search engine optimization.
[00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:38.660]   You can have permissions.
[00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:43.140]   So if you're using it like Alex is for a whole company and with multiple editors, you can
[00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:46.740]   have some people have this access, some people have other access.
[00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:47.740]   Just I could go on and on.
[00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:48.740]   I want you to try.
[00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:53.020]   Really what they've done, I think, very wisely is you just try it for two weeks.
[00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:55.540]   The sign up is you go there and you say, "Here's what I want the site to be."
[00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:59.100]   You don't need to give them credit card or any information, just an email address.
[00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:00.940]   And you're then using Squarespace.
[00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:01.940]   You're designing your site.
[00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:02.940]   You're building it.
[00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:07.340]   You can import all your data automatically and free from WordPress, Blogger, Moveable
[00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:10.620]   Type, Type Pad, by the way, Import and Export.
[00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:14.660]   So if you post something and then you want to move back, just export it out and it goes
[00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:15.660]   right back in.
[00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:17.300]   I mean, I can go on and on.
[00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:19.620]   It's just really easy to try it for two weeks.
[00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:20.620]   Absolutely free.
[00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:21.620]   No credit card or anything.
[00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:25.100]   Just go to squarespace.com/macbreak and play with it.
[00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:26.100]   That's all I asked.
[00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:27.100]   Just play with it.
[00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:30.420]   You'll see more and more people are moving to Squarespace.
[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:34.020]   We're using it for inside Twitter, company blog and it's fantastic.
[00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:37.060]   That's a case where we have multiple editors.
[00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:40.900]   In fact, we used it for our contest giving away the ultimate gaming machine.
[00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:41.900]   Congratulations, Gabe.
[00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:47.820]   We won that and we used it for the contest because we knew that the rules would be absolutely
[00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:51.380]   rock solid no matter how many people hit it.
[00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:55.940]   Squarespace.com/macbreak and if you decide to buy, I should say this is a hosted solution
[00:46:55.940 --> 00:46:56.940]   so you pay a monthly fee.
[00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:58.940]   I think it starts at $7.95 a month.
[00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:02.140]   Well, I think the thing you have people have to remember is you're going to pay that somewhere.
[00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:04.140]   I mean, you're going to pay for hosting somewhere.
[00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:05.140]   Unless you're going to be geosy.
[00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:06.140]   These are something.
[00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:07.140]   Right.
[00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:08.140]   Right.
[00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:10.660]   But if you're going to have your own URL and you're going to host it somewhere, you're
[00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:11.660]   going to pay something.
[00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:16.340]   So this is the same as that you were going to pay anyway.
[00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:17.540]   And we really moved.
[00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:20.820]   The first thing we did was a blog but we've moved completely away from that.
[00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:22.420]   It's just a platform at this point for us.
[00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:24.500]   A word of warning from Hunt Henning in our chat room.
[00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:28.060]   He says, "Just don't sign up for the trial in the middle of midterms.
[00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:30.460]   I ended up playing with it for two and a half hours."
[00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:33.060]   I hope you didn't flunk.
[00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:34.060]   It's true though.
[00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:35.860]   Once you start, it's like, "Oh, I can do it."
[00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:37.260]   You play with it anyway.
[00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:38.260]   Try it for free.
[00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:39.260]   Don't do it during midterms.
[00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:41.380]   Squarespace.com/macbreak.
[00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:46.380]   10% off if you decide to buy if you use the coupon code Macbreak.
[00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:48.220]   We really love these guys.
[00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:50.620]   They're so nice, so cool.
[00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:51.620]   Very hip.
[00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:52.860]   This is the latest, greatest stuff.
[00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:53.860]   Squarespace.com/macbreak.
[00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:54.860]   Give it a try.
[00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:56.860]   You're going to love it.
[00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:58.020]   Let's see here.
[00:47:58.020 --> 00:47:59.020]   What do we got?
[00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:04.260]   Let me go back to MBWI-deers.
[00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:06.500]   We got so many calls.
[00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:10.820]   I couldn't, and we're still getting more calls in there on our number.
[00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:12.180]   I don't know what to do.
[00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:15.620]   Do we, let's have a vote of the hosts.
[00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:19.820]   Do we want to put calls in at the end or how do we want to do this?
[00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:23.020]   You took more calls over, last week, didn't you, Alex?
[00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:24.020]   Do we take calls?
[00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:26.540]   No, I mean, but there are more calls that came in all week.
[00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:28.700]   So did you want us to mention the number?
[00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:30.660]   I think I might have, you know.
[00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:32.020]   We got to figure out.
[00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:33.020]   People are leaving messages.
[00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:36.020]   We got to figure out what they're doing.
[00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:40.540]   Maybe we'll have a special all call show.
[00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:41.540]   You know that would be fun.
[00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:42.540]   You want to do that next week?
[00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:43.900]   We'll just mock the next week.
[00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:44.900]   We'll mock the calls.
[00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:45.900]   We'll do it.
[00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:46.900]   It'll be like a morning zoo.
[00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:47.900]   You know what I mean?
[00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:48.900]   You know what I mean?
[00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:49.900]   That's a really good question.
[00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:55.900]   I can't get my user to come.
[00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:58.540]   You know how they do that in the morning zoos?
[00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:01.220]   They play tapes and then they pause the tape and then they mock it and then they play
[00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:02.220]   some more and they pause it.
[00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:03.220]   We'll do that.
[00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:07.580]   So we all got one week to get like strippers in our respective studios.
[00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:08.580]   Yeah.
[00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:10.300]   Hey, they're doll phase now.
[00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:15.460]   If you want to get the free implants, you're going to have to account for us now.
[00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:17.780]   Morning Zoo time.
[00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:19.140]   Let me give you the phone numbers.
[00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:25.740]   As long as we're doing this.
[00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:27.140]   This is thanks to phone tag.com.
[00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:29.340]   We really appreciate the service.
[00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:30.500]   Let me see how many.
[00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:32.020]   There are so many how many are there?
[00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:33.620]   There's just hundreds of messages.
[00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:38.460]   I really feel like I should probably.
[00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:40.420]   Now, where's the phone number?
[00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:41.420]   Oh, dark.
[00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:46.780]   Five years later on the California Angels in 2009 with the Boston Red Sox were in 2004.
[00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:47.780]   We're taking your calls.
[00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:50.420]   The phone lines are open.
[00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:52.580]   I used to do sports talk radio.
[00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:53.580]   Nightmare.
[00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:54.580]   Nightmare.
[00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:55.980]   You don't ever want to do that.
[00:49:55.980 --> 00:49:57.980]   What is the phone number, guys?
[00:49:57.980 --> 00:49:58.980]   Chatroom.
[00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:00.140]   Do you know what the number is?
[00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:01.620]   I don't know what the number is.
[00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:03.380]   You're crowd sourcing your own show, Lee.
[00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:04.380]   I am.
[00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:06.820]   This is called You Do The Show.
[00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:09.020]   I'm still jet lagged.
[00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:10.100]   You do the show.
[00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:12.100]   I'll find it.
[00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:13.820]   I'll find it.
[00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:15.380]   They're all giving me different numbers now.
[00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:16.380]   That's no good.
[00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:17.380]   That's no good.
[00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:18.380]   Don't do that.
[00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:21.940]   Here, I'm going to get the, they're all giving numbers of ex-girlfriends.
[00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:23.740]   They're trying to get back at.
[00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:25.980]   Oh, everybody call 617-8.
[00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:29.460]   1-800-ASK-AND-D.
[00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:35.300]   But unfortunately, we have bandwidth issues, so be sure to call between 2 AM and 430 AM
[00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:36.300]   on weekdays.
[00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:37.300]   Totally.
[00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:39.900]   They won't mind.
[00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:42.340]   Our call screen is a little bit annoying.
[00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:43.340]   So just keep calling.
[00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:44.340]   Just keep calling for you.
[00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:46.700]   She yells and hangs up the phone.
[00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:47.700]   Just keep calling.
[00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:48.700]   That's all right.
[00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:49.620]   I'm not going to worry about it.
[00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:56.060]   So would you guys explain to me why Vonage is okay, but Google Voice is not?
[00:50:56.060 --> 00:50:57.700]   Did you guys talk about that last week?
[00:50:57.700 --> 00:51:00.700]   I didn't.
[00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:03.620]   Oh, my God.
[00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:05.420]   Snipers have taken out Alex Lindsay.
[00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:09.060]   This is an empty microphone where Alex used to be.
[00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:11.940]   It's just underscores what I thought all along.
[00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:13.700]   That's just like a foreground, Matt.
[00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:17.500]   He's been doing it from a green screen in his car, driving home from work every single
[00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:18.500]   day.
[00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:19.500]   That's what I thought.
[00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:20.500]   Oh, there he is.
[00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:21.500]   He lost the video channel.
[00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:24.100]   He was super-fuloting his head on the microphone.
[00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:25.100]   I had a great...
[00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:27.700]   It's like the apple of my brain was shot with the first one.
[00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:29.700]   I had not paced my tea consumption well.
[00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:30.700]   Uh-oh.
[00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:32.700]   And then I succeeded in locking myself out of the studio.
[00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:33.700]   You've been...
[00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:34.700]   Oh, really?
[00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:37.940]   I never happened to you when you were a DJ because it's happened to me.
[00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:44.740]   It happened once and I locked myself out of the morning show one morning and my other
[00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:47.060]   my co-host wasn't there.
[00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:51.740]   And the problem lasted during the show lasted about 10 seconds because as soon as I realized
[00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:52.740]   it, I just kicked the door open.
[00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:55.660]   And then I had to explain to the general manager why I had shot.
[00:51:55.660 --> 00:51:57.700]   I'll never understand why they design.
[00:51:57.700 --> 00:52:02.260]   And there are many radio stations designed this way where the bathroom is outside the
[00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:03.260]   locked door.
[00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:06.500]   The radio station doors are locked so people can't just wander in while you're on the air.
[00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:10.820]   So you go out of the studio, you go down the hall, you go past the company cafeteria,
[00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:17.020]   which has 18-year-old paydays in the machine and a cup of noodles.
[00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:21.900]   And you go through a door and the bathroom's down that hall and the door closes behind
[00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:23.780]   you and you're locked out.
[00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:29.060]   And if you forgot your card key, you kind of have a problem.
[00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:31.740]   Fortunately we were in a pretty small station but it was still all the way to the other
[00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:37.500]   side of the station that it was always required and you always needed to find the album version
[00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:40.980]   of a Smith song or a Rish mode, a remix of the Rish mode.
[00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:43.860]   You know, I'd play nights in White's Hat and the whole side.
[00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:44.860]   Nights in White's Hat.
[00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:47.860]   Yeah, if I'd played nights in White's Hat on my station, it would have been...
[00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:51.540]   I was on a, you know, that kind of station, whatever kind that is.
[00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:52.860]   I don't know what kind of station you are.
[00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:53.860]   A-R.
[00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:54.860]   I don't know what.
[00:52:54.860 --> 00:52:58.020]   I don't know anybody allows you to play nights in White's Hat and to be honest with you.
[00:52:58.020 --> 00:53:01.060]   If you're ever listening to the radio and you hear nights in White's Hat and you know
[00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:02.820]   exactly why.
[00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:06.340]   Stare way to have nights in White's Hat and certain cuts that are just, you know, potty
[00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:07.340]   break cuts.
[00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:12.180]   But anyway, so I'm hearing the thing come to the end and the doors and I'm going, oh,
[00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:13.180]   but I was able to...
[00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:14.180]   I found a...
[00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:16.180]   It was an early hack.
[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:17.420]   I found a way around it.
[00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:25.500]   You can climb up and punch out the ceiling, you know, the acoustic tiling and crawl over.
[00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:26.500]   So I did.
[00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:30.340]   And I think the record had ended by the time I got there, but it was only, you know, 30
[00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:31.340]   seconds a day there and there.
[00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:33.100]   Wow, that was a beautiful song.
[00:53:33.100 --> 00:53:34.100]   Now let's move on.
[00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:39.620]   A little something from my friends, Peter Paul and Mary.
[00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:42.940]   Those of you who have not set up your stereo speakers correctly, you might have heard that
[00:53:42.940 --> 00:53:47.540]   30 seconds, be sure to rewire correctly.
[00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:52.140]   If it's out of phase, if a channel dropped out, you know, it's time to call consultant.
[00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:54.940]   And why not call Pacific South?
[00:53:54.940 --> 00:53:56.940]   There you go.
[00:53:56.940 --> 00:53:57.940]   Over on La Brea.
[00:53:57.940 --> 00:54:00.940]   You missed your calling, Andrew.
[00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:02.100]   Let's see.
[00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:06.860]   Did you see the smartphone numbers?
[00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:08.500]   No, what's that?
[00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:16.180]   So this is on Silicon Alley insider via the flaming lips.
[00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:17.340]   John Groopers.
[00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:19.300]   Yeah, very powerful.
[00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:20.780]   So the numbers.
[00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:25.980]   So Apple has gone from 2% global share to 14% global share in a year.
[00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:27.380]   Holy cow.
[00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:28.380]   Yeah.
[00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:29.380]   Yeah.
[00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:31.980]   And that's the worldwide market.
[00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:32.980]   That's global share.
[00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:36.980]   So Apple went from 2% to 14% in one year global share.
[00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:42.500]   United States share is 23% up from 7%.
[00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:51.740]   Now, RIM is still 52% down from 56%, but it's a crazy, crazy growth.
[00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:58.820]   This is from Silicon Alley insider, Henry Blodgett via Daring fireball, John Grooper.
[00:54:58.820 --> 00:55:01.460]   And I didn't realize that Apple is 190.
[00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:05.820]   They're back up to 190 with a target of like 238 or something like that.
[00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:06.820]   Is that a 90 million?
[00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:08.020]   No, no, 190.
[00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:09.020]   I'm sorry.
[00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:11.220]   Their stock value is back up to 190.
[00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:12.220]   Oh, that's amazing.
[00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:14.980]   I look down and they're back to where they were before.
[00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:15.980]   Yes.
[00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:16.980]   In the middle of a risk.
[00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:17.980]   Scotty were here.
[00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:18.980]   You know.
[00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:19.980]   Be telling us.
[00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:22.940]   Well, he had a CC sold all his Apple stock so he couldn't go.
[00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:24.540]   But he did say it would be back to 200.
[00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:25.540]   He told me that.
[00:55:25.540 --> 00:55:26.540]   Yep.
[00:55:26.540 --> 00:55:27.540]   He was right.
[00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:28.540]   As always.
[00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:30.020]   Yeah, so it's quite a bit.
[00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:34.420]   So don't you think Android's going to come on pretty strong in the next year?
[00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:35.420]   Google has so many.
[00:55:35.420 --> 00:55:37.420]   I need to play with them.
[00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:38.420]   Or roll on.
[00:55:38.420 --> 00:55:39.420]   I need to play with them.
[00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:42.260]   I have to admit I played with a couple of smartphones in the last couple of weeks.
[00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:46.780]   And the problem with Android has been that it's been tied to that crappy G1 that T-Mobile
[00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:47.780]   shipped.
[00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:51.180]   But I think once we start seeing other Android phones, the HTC hero people are raving about.
[00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:53.220]   Have you played with any others, Andy?
[00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:57.300]   Yeah, I've got I've got currently two or three different Android phones in the office.
[00:55:57.300 --> 00:56:02.100]   I've got the Android based Arco's five tablet that's supposedly going to be showing up
[00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:04.100]   today or tomorrow in the office.
[00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:12.260]   The big story about Android is there's an explosion of handsets and also an ability to
[00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:16.340]   make the case to developers that if you start investing your time and learning how to develop
[00:56:16.340 --> 00:56:20.620]   software for Android, that's going to start paying off a lot more handsomely in 2010 and
[00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:23.540]   2011 than it might have for you in 2009.
[00:56:23.540 --> 00:56:27.580]   So this is going to be a bigger, bigger problem, especially when you consider that Google is
[00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:31.780]   coming out with new versions of the operating system 2.0 is expected sometime, I believe,
[00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:38.420]   2010, and it's going to bring a lot new functionality and a little slicker interface to the experience.
[00:56:38.420 --> 00:56:42.780]   Yeah, I keep wanting it to succeed just for competition's sake.
[00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:43.780]   Yeah.
[00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:48.420]   And I'm a big BlackBerry fan too, but I mean, you know, I'm trying them all and I just end
[00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:49.780]   up using the iPhone.
[00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:54.460]   And it's what times when I travel that I really realize how cool the iPhone is as a platform
[00:56:54.460 --> 00:56:57.620]   for creating content, you can blog, you can upload pictures.
[00:56:57.620 --> 00:57:01.580]   I used to pick PostRIS to upload all my pictures as I was, you know, taking them.
[00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:06.740]   And I even, you know, it's funny, I brought my cameras and I didn't even open the case.
[00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:09.460]   By the way, I bought that Pelican case you recommended, Andy, that's been great.
[00:57:09.460 --> 00:57:10.460]   Yeah.
[00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:15.100]   It's a great camera case and I locked it up and I could even check it.
[00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:17.420]   But I ended up taking all the pictures with the iPhone.
[00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:22.380]   They're not as good as they'd be with a digital SLR, but they're there.
[00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:23.540]   They're good enough, you know.
[00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:25.740]   I was going to be shooting the Panos.
[00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:26.740]   Yeah.
[00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:27.740]   Yeah.
[00:57:27.740 --> 00:57:31.260]   Well, the big problem that Apple, I think, is going to have to address is the fact that
[00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:37.100]   Android has a big advantage in developing software in that I can create, I can create,
[00:57:37.100 --> 00:57:42.300]   I can have an application that creates Microsoft Word documents and then another application
[00:57:42.300 --> 00:57:46.620]   on the phone that can take that exact same file and then do something with it.
[00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:50.480]   Right now, the only way you can share information between applications is either through cut
[00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:55.940]   and paste text or by if you have a photo application that can drop something inside the camera
[00:57:55.940 --> 00:57:57.440]   role.
[00:57:57.440 --> 00:58:03.200]   I was, my pick of the week sort of touches upon this, but the ability of the ability of
[00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:07.520]   people to actually sling documents around and create content is sorely limited by the
[00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:12.320]   fact that every single application that you use on the iPhone that creates content is
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:16.480]   pretty much its own island and you cannot, with no extradition to any other, any other
[00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:17.480]   applications.
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:18.480]   Yeah.
[00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:22.880]   So when you have an open file system, problems like that are just nonexistent with an iPhone,
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:26.660]   you need to have some clever workarounds to be able to hand an Excel spreadsheet or a
[00:58:26.660 --> 00:58:30.040]   calculation from one place to another.
[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:31.640]   Pepsi and a little bit of trouble.
[00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:43.800]   It's an amped energy drink created an iPhone app called before you score and it categorizes
[00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:45.800]   the ladies.
[00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:51.640]   Leo, your former DJ, you can do better than that.
[00:58:51.640 --> 00:59:00.260]   The ladies, the ladies, amp tweeted, our app tried to show the humorous length guys go
[00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:01.260]   to pick up women.
[00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:06.700]   We apologize if it's in bad taste and appreciate your feedback and they included the hashtag
[00:59:06.700 --> 00:59:09.140]   pound Pepsi fail.
[00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:10.140]   Wow.
[00:59:10.140 --> 00:59:12.860]   That's like really throwing yourself on the sword.
[00:59:12.860 --> 00:59:18.340]   The application before you score, according to the Wall Street Journal, drew ire for its
[00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:23.400]   male centric approach to categorizing women calling itself quote a roadmap to success
[00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:26.160]   with your favorite kinds of women 24 and all.
[00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:28.520]   There's only 24 kinds of women.
[00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:29.520]   Female types include.
[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:30.520]   Oh boy.
[00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:39.320]   Oh, I almost don't want to even say this cougar bookworm tree hugger rebound girl.
[00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:42.240]   And when a user selects the type of woman of his choice, the app provides information
[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:47.400]   that will supposedly help a guy score that type complete with pickup lines.
[00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:49.900]   This is for like a 15 year old.
[00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:56.740]   Yeah, that's that's an indication that there's the usual hierarchy that an advertisement
[00:59:56.740 --> 00:59:59.500]   has to go through or TV commercial has to go through.
[00:59:59.500 --> 01:00:02.260]   That doesn't exist for the sort of like new media marketing.
[01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:03.260]   There's just a guy.
[01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:07.300]   There's just like a three person agency that they subcontract that out to.
[01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:09.460]   And they just simply say, we had a great idea.
[01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:13.100]   If you give us $13,000, we can develop an iPhone app that will be free.
[01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:14.100]   Great.
[01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:15.100]   Go do it.
[01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:16.100]   Just right.
[01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:17.420]   Millions of people are already seeing it.
[01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:19.080]   Then we'll decide whether we like it or not.
[01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:22.280]   Well, I'm sure it was someone who is they considered a social media expert.
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:23.280]   Yeah, that's it.
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:25.280]   You know, stay away from the media.
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:26.280]   Yeah.
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:30.040]   Yeah, to get in with the generation, whatever they call it now.
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:32.720]   Yeah, it'll say that we are guy is great.
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:35.080]   He's 43 years old, but he wears his hat like this.
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:37.180]   So we know he's on Twitter.
[01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:38.680]   So we know he's plugged in.
[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:39.680]   Yeah.
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:40.680]   Yes.
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:43.680]   I do think we're missing a boat as as accomplished Twitter users.
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:46.960]   We could probably make it a big, big bunch of money.
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:52.500]   We should offer ourselves to the highest bidder as social media experts.
[01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:53.500]   Yes, exactly.
[01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:54.500]   Indeed.
[01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:57.620]   Just means we've been there for 15 minutes longer than everybody else.
[01:00:57.620 --> 01:00:59.620]   I make sure it was social media.
[01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:02.660]   Hey, I twittered my way across the Arctic Circle.
[01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:03.660]   Yes.
[01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:05.420]   You know, there you go.
[01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:07.620]   What more do you need to know about me?
[01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:12.460]   Well, the thing is Ash and Kutcher has really ruined it for pretty much everybody.
[01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:16.580]   I used to be able to say, I have over 20,000 followers.
[01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:18.260]   But Ashton has three million.
[01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:19.260]   That's great.
[01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:20.260]   Exactly.
[01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:21.700]   Because that may have 500,000.
[01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:22.700]   We'll talk.
[01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:23.700]   I know.
[01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:26.720]   Well, you know, it's interesting because Drew Carey, a host of the Price is Right, that
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:28.660]   big fat guy with black glasses.
[01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:35.160]   He, you know, well, famous TV personality and he wants to donate a buck for every follower
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:40.500]   he gets up to $1 million.
[01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:44.260]   But I, you know, I think that people think it's easy to get to a million followers on
[01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:45.260]   Twitter.
[01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:46.340]   It's not unless you're on the suggested user list.
[01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:47.900]   You can't just, and he's not.
[01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:49.540]   I mean, he's got, I think he's got 200,000.
[01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:50.780]   No, 100,000.
[01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:55.220]   It's very hard on your own recognizance to get a million followers.
[01:01:55.220 --> 01:02:02.340]   I keep insisting that I got my 23,000 followers, 24,000 followers by good old fashioned door-to-door
[01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:03.340]   canvassing.
[01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:04.340]   Yes.
[01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:05.340]   I've never tried to buy followers.
[01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:07.220]   I've never tried to beg for followers.
[01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:09.900]   I've never made promises in exchange for followers.
[01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:13.700]   It's that human contact that makes my style of Twitter politics.
[01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:15.500]   In fact, I've upset many of them.
[01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:17.940]   But that's, see, I'm a maverick.
[01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:20.740]   I'm the maverick candidate for Twitter, one million followers.
[01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:23.420]   I think this will be very interesting to see how well he can do.
[01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:24.620]   He's going to give it to Live Strong.
[01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:25.620]   It's a great cause.
[01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:27.140]   I mean, who could say no to this?
[01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:28.140]   Exactly.
[01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:33.580]   He's got 75,000 followers, even though he's saying a buck, a follower up to a million, and
[01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:37.340]   he's been campaigning and everybody's mentioning it, but he's not on the suggested user list.
[01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:40.500]   I think that's just not possible unless you get on that suggested user list.
[01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:43.580]   Do you think he's less likely now that he's pandering?
[01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:45.540]   No, no, I'll follow him.
[01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:46.540]   I mean, it's not...
[01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:49.740]   No, no, to get on the suggested user list, do you think that because he's going down that
[01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:50.740]   path...
[01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:51.740]   Oh, I don't know if Twitter...
[01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:54.060]   I mean, if they're not, they would have done it by now if they were going to do it.
[01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:55.060]   Yeah.
[01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:57.060]   It seems crazy that they wouldn't usually a star like that.
[01:02:57.060 --> 01:02:58.540]   They would think they'd throw it right.
[01:02:58.540 --> 01:02:59.540]   Absolutely.
[01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:00.540]   He's verified.
[01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:01.540]   He's verified.
[01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:03.260]   That means Twitter knows he's there and they're saying, "Oh, yeah, that's the Drew
[01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:04.260]   Carey."
[01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:05.260]   Right.
[01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:10.060]   Now, it looks bad for Twitter if they don't put him on the SQL.
[01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:12.300]   You know, it's a no win now, right?
[01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:14.740]   Because if they don't, and he never gets...
[01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:17.100]   He's 75,000, and he's...
[01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:21.340]   The world, he's going on the TV show and saying, "Follow me."
[01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:23.100]   Right.
[01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:29.860]   I feel good about this knowing that it's Drew Carey who has that really wonderful, crazy
[01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:32.220]   rich person, Gene, that says...
[01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:33.220]   Oh, I think Drew's...
[01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:34.220]   I'm...
[01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:35.220]   I'm...
[01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:36.220]   I love it.
[01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:37.460]   I love the fact that he says, "You know what?
[01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:38.460]   I'm a crazy rich person.
[01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:42.940]   If I want to become a freelance sports photographer and travel the world on my own dime just to
[01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:46.100]   wear the yellow vest and take pictures of stock events, I'm going to do that.
[01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:48.660]   If I want to buy my own soccer team, I'm going to do that."
[01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:52.980]   So, I'm convinced this is a cool way for me to donate a lot of money to a great cause.
[01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:55.020]   It would be fun having a lot of followers.
[01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:59.620]   My problem is when some media company decides, "You know what?
[01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:02.580]   The secret to modern media is going to be Twitter followers.
[01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:07.340]   Whereas a multi-city ad buy would cost over $6 million to $500,000.
[01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:11.980]   We can give you a problem to position in the most perverse social media platform in the
[01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:12.980]   future."
[01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:14.740]   I mean, it's only a buck.
[01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:18.500]   Jason Calicana's going to pay more than that for getting on the SUL list.
[01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:20.300]   It's only a buck, a person.
[01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:23.860]   In any event, let's see if we can throw some power behind him.
[01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:26.620]   Drew from TV, follow him.
[01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:31.420]   Every follower generates another dollar for Livestrong, up to $1 million, which I think is
[01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:32.420]   fantastic.
[01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:35.620]   And you have to the end of the year, but don't delay.
[01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:40.380]   Let's see if by our own efforts we can get Drew to a million.
[01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:41.380]   We'll see.
[01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:42.380]   We'll see.
[01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:47.140]   It's not going to happen.
[01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:49.140]   You know, we all know.
[01:04:49.140 --> 01:04:52.620]   Nobody has ever gotten to a million people without being on the SUL list.
[01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:56.820]   Nobody's gotten over, as far as I know, 200,000 without being on the SUL list.
[01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:58.820]   And what is this thing you are?
[01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:02.380]   I think that's the big question is that you get a bunch of people who just signed
[01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:05.140]   up and half of them will never come back to Twitter.
[01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:06.380]   I think you'll have a spam too.
[01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:09.180]   I don't think that the spammers use that list.
[01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:10.180]   Yeah.
[01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:16.420]   I'm actually at this point, I'm more fascinated by the process by which famous people, I think
[01:05:16.420 --> 01:05:20.460]   what they do is that they're just experimenting with Twitter and they come up with a really
[01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:25.140]   weird name and then unexpectedly they start getting 40,000 people and now they can't change
[01:05:25.140 --> 01:05:28.700]   that really weird name anymore.
[01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:32.460]   Roger Ebert just started Twittering just a few days.
[01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:33.460]   Really?
[01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:35.020]   That's the L follow him.
[01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:39.740]   And it's I want to make sure I don't get this wrong because I want to make sure it's
[01:05:39.740 --> 01:05:41.100]   a great Twitter feed.
[01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:44.460]   The first few days he was just posting limericks.
[01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:46.500]   Oh, I love it.
[01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:47.500]   It's a.
[01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:51.060]   I'm going to type this.
[01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:52.060]   I know what it is.
[01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:55.420]   If Twitter works, you could just go to find people and type directly.
[01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:56.420]   Exactly.
[01:05:56.420 --> 01:05:57.420]   It's never worked.
[01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:59.500]   Ebert, it's Ebert Chicago.
[01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:00.500]   Okay.
[01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:01.500]   Ebert Chicago.
[01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:02.500]   Oh, there it is.
[01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:03.500]   It worked.
[01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:04.500]   It found him.
[01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:05.500]   Right here.
[01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:08.340]   Blogger shallow and profound, correct and mistaken.
[01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:09.940]   And only 6,000 followers.
[01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:10.940]   Everybody should list.
[01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:11.940]   This is a good man.
[01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:12.940]   Let's follow.
[01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:13.940]   Let's follow.
[01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:14.940]   Yeah.
[01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:16.940]   Actually, I told him that he'd probably be on me in about a week.
[01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:18.540]   I'm very certain that's going to happen.
[01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:22.860]   If if Twitter does not immediately put him on the recommended recommended list, then that's
[01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:25.220]   just I mean, someone is someone at Twitter is listening to this.
[01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:27.220]   By the way, he's following you, Andy.
[01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:28.220]   And a chimp.
[01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:29.220]   I don't know.
[01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:30.620]   No, I roll Morris.
[01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:32.100]   That's that's a real Morris's.
[01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:33.100]   That's a little more is now.
[01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:34.700]   See, I'd follow a little more.
[01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:35.700]   Yeah.
[01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:36.700]   You and a chimp.
[01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:37.700]   So that's what I see.
[01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:42.740]   I just realized that I'm recommending people follow Ebert because he's a great Twitter.
[01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:49.620]   And also he put up a great post on his blog explaining that he feels as he was pooping
[01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:52.660]   the idea of Twitter when I and a couple of the friends were like recommending to get
[01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:53.660]   into it.
[01:06:53.660 --> 01:06:57.180]   But now just like so many other so many of other of us, he's fascinated.
[01:06:57.180 --> 01:07:01.540]   He's really interesting coming up with a really interesting 140 characters.
[01:07:01.540 --> 01:07:02.540]   Yeah.
[01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:03.540]   Something to post.
[01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:04.540]   Yeah.
[01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:08.660]   But I realize that now I feel like like the member of like Brad Pitts, entourage, when
[01:07:08.660 --> 01:07:13.060]   he was single, that the fact that he only has to only is following two people.
[01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:17.380]   The more followers Ebert gets, probably the more followers I will get because someone's
[01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:18.380]   going to check.
[01:07:18.380 --> 01:07:20.300]   Well, say, well, I'm already following the monkey.
[01:07:20.300 --> 01:07:22.700]   Let's see who this strange guy is.
[01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:23.700]   Exactly.
[01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:25.100]   Well, I'm following Roger.
[01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:29.900]   Now his last tweet, I saw movies so bad, I stopped taking notes in my iPhone and started
[01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:31.700]   playing the little chess game.
[01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:32.700]   I love this.
[01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:36.660]   And I'm a follower of Morris too, because I'm a fan of his.
[01:07:36.660 --> 01:07:37.660]   That's great.
[01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:38.660]   There you go.
[01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:41.580]   See you and Errol Morris, both are going to benefit from this.
[01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:42.580]   Exactly.
[01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:45.100]   Well, we'll take Roger's leftovers.
[01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:47.980]   That's a my class skirt, my friend.
[01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:53.420]   I don't know what this means, but he's both people he's following are in Boston.
[01:07:53.420 --> 01:07:55.820]   Well, we're very hip people.
[01:07:55.820 --> 01:07:56.820]   Yeah.
[01:07:56.820 --> 01:07:59.740]   Andy, do you hang out with Errol Morris very much since you're since you're neighbors?
[01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:00.900]   Since you live in Boston?
[01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:01.900]   Yeah.
[01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:05.580]   Well, I mean, it's a little bit awkward because like we have lots of conversations, but I
[01:08:05.580 --> 01:08:09.940]   have to talk into a half-silvered mirror off on an angle.
[01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:12.100]   And that's what that's an in-joke.
[01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:16.140]   But we actually call that the in-teritron process.
[01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:18.900]   We have a smart audience who will get it.
[01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:20.220]   We don't need to say anymore.
[01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:22.980]   We always have to book a table for six just to get all the equipment in there, even though
[01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:24.860]   it's just me and Errol's both.
[01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:26.660]   And let's see.
[01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:27.660]   Wait a minute.
[01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:30.900]   I guess we should move on to our picks of the week here.
[01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:32.300]   We've got all the stories out of the way.
[01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:34.980]   Obviously, we're fritting around with Twitter.
[01:08:34.980 --> 01:08:37.020]   Once you're fritter with Twitter, there's nothing else to say.
[01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:40.100]   I think someone on Twitter is now saying our job is done.
[01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:41.100]   Yes.
[01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:45.780]   We've once again derailed another show.
[01:08:45.780 --> 01:08:50.260]   Rational, valuable discussion into meaningless little triple.
[01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:53.980]   People often wonder why we don't talk more about Apple on this show.
[01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:58.140]   Because it's a weekly show, it's one company, and there's not just not that much stuff
[01:08:58.140 --> 01:08:59.500]   to talk about every week.
[01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:04.340]   We can only hope that at some point an Apple executive kills somebody in a drunk driving
[01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:05.500]   accident.
[01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:11.780]   Did you see the news about the article about the fact that you should not bank on Windows?
[01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:12.780]   Yeah.
[01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:13.780]   Do your bank.
[01:09:13.780 --> 01:09:14.780]   That's it.
[01:09:14.780 --> 01:09:15.780]   Brian Krebs writing it.
[01:09:15.780 --> 01:09:19.380]   He's Brian, by the way, one of the best security column is he writes for the Washington Post.
[01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:21.500]   He fixed column.
[01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:24.980]   He says, "Do not do your banking with Windows.
[01:09:24.980 --> 01:09:29.420]   If you're going to do use a live CD of Ubuntu or some other Linux because you know--"
[01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:31.860]   I thought it was funny at the very end he goes, "Well, of course, the Mac would be just
[01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:32.860]   as good."
[01:09:32.860 --> 01:09:33.860]   Yeah.
[01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:36.980]   He says, "The Mac would be just as good, but nobody who reads this column is using a Mac."
[01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:37.980]   That's why I didn't mention it.
[01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:39.540]   I know it was a strange afterthought.
[01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:41.700]   It was a backhanded compliment.
[01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:43.660]   Like of course, you could use a Mac.
[01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:50.060]   Instead, download a 650 megabyte distro, burn a live CD and use that.
[01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:55.620]   Everybody knows that seven-year-old girl knows how to burn an ISO.
[01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:57.500]   We're not having your compiled Darwin.
[01:09:57.500 --> 01:09:58.780]   We're just having your due Ubuntu.
[01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:00.780]   That's definitely within the rights of a seven-year-old.
[01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:04.780]   That is a huge story because Brian is, I think, one of the most respected--along with Bruce
[01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:09.020]   Schneier, one of the most respected security guys writing right now.
[01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:12.660]   And for him to say, "Don't use--don't do home banking on Windows."
[01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:13.500]   Right.
[01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:14.500]   That's huge.
[01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:15.500]   Yeah.
[01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:20.540]   His point is that--I'm not sure I'd agree with it, but his point is that there are--and
[01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:25.380]   he gives you a number of case studies where they're just these--all these systems are
[01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:27.020]   laden with Trojan horses.
[01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:29.180]   People don't know.
[01:10:29.180 --> 01:10:33.580]   They're giving away their passwords just by using their system to log into the bank.
[01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:40.300]   Well, we talked about that on security now last week, which was turned out to be both
[01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:42.140]   terrifying and riveting all at the same time.
[01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:45.340]   My first one that I really--they got the host and it was scared me.
[01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:50.060]   I know you get scared every week, so you get kind of jaded by it, Leo, but--but it was
[01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:51.060]   terrible.
[01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:53.140]   Oh, the situation is awful out there.
[01:10:53.140 --> 01:10:54.140]   Yeah.
[01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:55.940]   I mean, the guys--the bad guys are winning.
[01:10:55.940 --> 01:10:57.300]   I mean, they really are.
[01:10:57.300 --> 01:11:00.740]   And you know, I think Windows 7 is much more secure.
[01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:02.860]   The problem is not so much that Windows isn't secure.
[01:11:02.860 --> 01:11:07.980]   The problem is that most users just don't know how to keep it secure.
[01:11:07.980 --> 01:11:08.980]   Yeah.
[01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:10.540]   So there's a lot of compromised versions of Windows out there.
[01:11:10.540 --> 01:11:14.740]   And you really can't expect people to become security experts in order to use a computer
[01:11:14.740 --> 01:11:15.940]   or a can you?
[01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:21.020]   I often feel as though I need to defend Windows that, yeah, there are huge problems with viruses
[01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:24.020]   and spyware, but most of the problems are people who are just leaving that barn door
[01:11:24.020 --> 01:11:25.020]   wide open.
[01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:29.620]   The minute that you realize that you can download some very, very good free anti-spireware,
[01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:32.980]   anti-trogen horse software, you get to climb when anti-virus.
[01:11:32.980 --> 01:11:33.980]   That's the first thing.
[01:11:33.980 --> 01:11:37.380]   Even when I'm just going to be testing out a laptop for two or three days before sending
[01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:40.500]   it back to the company of Iopedics, the first download is always clamoring.
[01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:46.540]   Once you've got that in there, it will update, it'll create updates automatically.
[01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:51.540]   There's nothing, there's no more cheerful thing from my Windows notification bar than
[01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:54.740]   that little pop-up that says clam when it's now been updated.
[01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:56.420]   Yes, wonderful.
[01:11:56.420 --> 01:11:59.780]   But once you've got that done, I think most of your problems are sort of behind you.
[01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:02.980]   I think the problem is that there is a certain reasonable amount of fear.
[01:12:02.980 --> 01:12:09.060]   I will never do anything on a Windows machine that could put, that is financial in nature,
[01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:14.500]   that's accessing, that's doing an online purchase, let alone accessing a bank account.
[01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:15.940]   I just don't trust it.
[01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:16.940]   Yeah.
[01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:18.940]   I don't know.
[01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:22.580]   I don't even use an anti-virus on Windows.
[01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:24.060]   I know how to be secure.
[01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:27.220]   I think if you know what you're doing, it's not such a hard thing to be secure.
[01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:35.140]   But I just think the Windows, as the default choice of the masses, is well the most compromised.
[01:12:35.140 --> 01:12:37.980]   They'll always find loose-door knobs.
[01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:38.980]   Yeah.
[01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:43.500]   If Macintosh had 90% market share, it'd be exactly the same.
[01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:45.980]   Right, and it would be just as many failures.
[01:12:45.980 --> 01:12:48.820]   But you didn't just say you don't use anti-virus on Windows, do you?
[01:12:48.820 --> 01:12:51.220]   I don't use any security software on Windows.
[01:12:51.220 --> 01:12:52.460]   Oh, that's stupid.
[01:12:52.460 --> 01:12:54.340]   No, it's not necessary.
[01:12:54.340 --> 01:12:56.060]   It's on Windows?
[01:12:56.060 --> 01:12:57.060]   Yeah.
[01:12:57.060 --> 01:12:58.980]   You just don't do stupid things.
[01:12:58.980 --> 01:13:00.700]   Even if you have any virus, if you do stupid things-
[01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:02.500]   Don't do stupid things like access the Internet.
[01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:03.500]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:07.940]   So long as you just get that two-part epoxy, mix it up in your hands, then plug every
[01:13:07.940 --> 01:13:13.220]   single network port everywhere around this laptop and never turn on the Wi-Fi.
[01:13:13.220 --> 01:13:14.980]   I haven't had a bug.
[01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:17.700]   I will run a scan every year.
[01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:20.020]   Every URL of a free site.
[01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:23.980]   No, no, no, I have not 32 all over the place.
[01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:28.820]   But I just don't use it because I don't feel the need for it.
[01:13:28.820 --> 01:13:31.900]   The thing is, most security experts do not use an anti-virus.
[01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:34.020]   I've only had one beer.
[01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:37.620]   It's the people who get drunk and then try to drive.
[01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:38.820]   The people who get into trouble.
[01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:39.820]   I have never seen-
[01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:42.420]   I haven't had a Trojan or a virus in four years.
[01:13:42.420 --> 01:13:45.740]   I haven't had a B-box sandwich before the beer.
[01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:47.620]   I'm only two miles away.
[01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:50.140]   [SOUND]
[01:13:50.140 --> 01:13:52.340]   Well, I don't- I don't- I'll be honest.
[01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:56.940]   I would never say this on any of the other shows because I don't want people then to
[01:13:56.940 --> 01:13:58.860]   do that.
[01:13:58.860 --> 01:14:02.500]   But I know you're all using Macs, so you know it's okay.
[01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:06.100]   But I think if you know what you're doing, it's not necessary.
[01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:07.340]   I will only say this.
[01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:12.380]   I've managed to avoid a lot of trouble by following one simple maximum, one simple belief that
[01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:14.060]   I absolutely believe in.
[01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:19.300]   There are so many people out there who are so much smarter than I am on so many different
[01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:20.460]   subjects.
[01:14:20.460 --> 01:14:23.820]   Every time that I think I understand how a certain Trojan is going to propagate-
[01:14:23.820 --> 01:14:24.820]   Oh, I know.
[01:14:24.820 --> 01:14:28.460]   Or I think I understand exactly how to secure something, I find out that no Andy, you're
[01:14:28.460 --> 01:14:29.460]   an idiot.
[01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:32.900]   You're a journalist who's very, very clever on a lot of different topics, but you do-
[01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:38.340]   You have extremely knowledgeable, you're extremely knowledgeable of only a few different areas,
[01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:40.660]   and Windows security is definitely not one of them.
[01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:44.020]   We don't- I don't use- I don't do home banking on Windows.
[01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:45.780]   I mean, I'm not crazy.
[01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:48.060]   That's- that's- that's- that is also a point.
[01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:49.060]   I mean-
[01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:50.060]   But-
[01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:51.900]   But no, I'm not compromised.
[01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:54.060]   I scan periodically and-
[01:14:54.060 --> 01:14:55.500]   Again, it's a free download.
[01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:57.060]   I don't know why you would not simply take a free download-
[01:14:57.060 --> 01:14:58.660]   Because it's launched up the system.
[01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:01.020]   It doesn't run okay.
[01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:02.500]   All right.
[01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:07.300]   And be honest with you, I think it's a false- it's a false sense of security, you're getting-
[01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:10.820]   Because to be honest with you, if you do stupid things, I don't care what you've got running,
[01:15:10.820 --> 01:15:11.980]   you're going to get bit.
[01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:12.980]   Okay.
[01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:13.980]   I mean, again, porn.
[01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:18.620]   And Andy Fierz does not protect you on Windows.
[01:15:18.620 --> 01:15:20.780]   Well, it does.
[01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:24.500]   I would- I would like- although it's a good point that I would like to see like a MythBusters
[01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:28.980]   sort of head-to-head thing saying, we have- we've got two identical like dull latitude
[01:15:28.980 --> 01:15:30.140]   laptops.
[01:15:30.140 --> 01:15:35.660]   On the one on the left, we have the very latest anti-virus tools installed.
[01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:37.900]   On the very right, we only have three rules.
[01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:43.300]   The first two are do not access any porn site of any kind.
[01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:48.980]   Because you come across these sites and say, wow, that's like 80 terabytes of porn and
[01:15:48.980 --> 01:15:50.900]   no access fees and no nothing.
[01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:54.980]   It's almost as if you really want me to visit that site and stay online long enough for
[01:15:54.980 --> 01:15:58.180]   some sort of remote bot to do something to my browser.
[01:15:58.180 --> 01:15:59.940]   You don't have to be online very long.
[01:15:59.940 --> 01:16:01.260]   All you have to do is go to this site.
[01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:05.620]   But anyway, we'll see.
[01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:06.620]   I'm not here to judge.
[01:16:06.620 --> 01:16:09.700]   When I get bit, I will call you up and say you were right, Andy.
[01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:14.940]   I will do some sort of appropriate- You'll do the entire show and it's in a bare mid-rift
[01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:15.940]   cheerleader outfit.
[01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:16.940]   Okay, I will.
[01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:17.940]   I don't know.
[01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:21.020]   I think that's- that's not really all of us.
[01:16:21.020 --> 01:16:22.020]   That's a punishment for everyone, isn't it?
[01:16:22.020 --> 01:16:23.500]   Oh, Andy, you're so fine.
[01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:24.500]   You're so fine.
[01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:25.500]   You blow my mind.
[01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:26.500]   Oh, Andy.
[01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:31.700]   I think we could- I think we could increase- We could get more hits than the developers,
[01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:33.780]   developers, developers, developers video.
[01:16:33.780 --> 01:16:35.860]   Certainly go viral.
[01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:38.460]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:40.220]   Come back with your picks of the week.
[01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:42.780]   But first, I got to pick audible.com.
[01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:47.500]   Our friendly audible, the folks who give you those great audio books, save my life on
[01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:51.300]   that 15-hour trip to Dubai.
[01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:58.820]   I got through the entire accidental billionaires book, the Facebook story was great.
[01:16:58.820 --> 01:17:03.980]   And I'm listening now to the book you recommended, the Biskin book about Hollywood in the 70s.
[01:17:03.980 --> 01:17:06.180]   Boy, is that great.
[01:17:06.180 --> 01:17:09.260]   Maybe you want to watch- and I watched last night Bonnie and Clyde just because I was
[01:17:09.260 --> 01:17:12.060]   reading the Bonnie and Clyde chapter.
[01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:13.300]   So many great books.
[01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:15.260]   You get 60,000 books to choose from.
[01:17:15.260 --> 01:17:20.900]   It's an online library of audio goodness.
[01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:23.580]   If you go right now to audible.com, you'll see what I'm talking about.
[01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:26.860]   I mean, one of the nice things they do, and I think they've really gotten better and better
[01:17:26.860 --> 01:17:32.900]   at this, the front page is a great entree into the kinds of books, the kinds of stuff
[01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:35.380]   that they have at audible.com.
[01:17:35.380 --> 01:17:38.260]   They've got best of lists, you know, the best sellers.
[01:17:38.260 --> 01:17:39.580]   They've got recommendations.
[01:17:39.580 --> 01:17:43.860]   They've got the latest releases.
[01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:50.580]   There's a new book from Chelsea- Sally Sullenberger, Highest Duty, my search for what really matters.
[01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:54.460]   It's a story that just came out.
[01:17:54.460 --> 01:17:56.020]   Jeffrey Zazzlo wrote that with him.
[01:17:56.020 --> 01:17:57.020]   That's interesting.
[01:17:57.020 --> 01:18:00.780]   But so it's like going to a bookstore and you just go online and you can see what the
[01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:03.620]   latest best sellers are.
[01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:04.780]   And I'll tell you what, you go there.
[01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:06.820]   It's very hard not to say, "Oh, I got to listen to that.
[01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:08.820]   Oh, I got to listen to that.
[01:18:08.820 --> 01:18:09.820]   Oh, I got to listen to that."
[01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:11.340]   There's just so many great books there.
[01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:12.340]   So here's the deal.
[01:18:12.340 --> 01:18:13.340]   We're going to give you your first book free.
[01:18:13.340 --> 01:18:15.300]   You go to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:18.740]   Do this first and sign up for the gold account.
[01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:21.500]   That gives you a book of months and your first one's free.
[01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:27.100]   And now you can choose from all of these books and it will cost you nothing.
[01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:30.100]   It's a great way to kind of see what you're like.
[01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:32.900]   Andy, I haven't heard a recommendation from you lately.
[01:18:32.900 --> 01:18:34.420]   So you have something for us?
[01:18:34.420 --> 01:18:35.520]   Yes, I do.
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:39.620]   This is a book that actually read Vi Kindle last week.
[01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:43.700]   And I cannot believe that the audiobook of Paul Shafers will be here for the rest of
[01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:46.580]   our lives, A Swing and Showbiz saga.
[01:18:46.580 --> 01:18:48.700]   Narrated by Paul Shafer.
[01:18:48.700 --> 01:18:50.140]   Oh, God, that's going to be good.
[01:18:50.140 --> 01:18:54.820]   "Unabridged" is not going to be as awesome as the book if not more awesome.
[01:18:54.820 --> 01:18:55.820]   Oh, much more awesome.
[01:18:55.820 --> 01:18:56.820]   He's reading it.
[01:18:56.820 --> 01:18:57.820]   Yeah.
[01:18:57.820 --> 01:18:58.820]   It's exactly.
[01:18:58.820 --> 01:19:04.220]   I recommended a while ago a backstage book about an authorized history of Saturday Night
[01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:07.700]   Live in which they had interviews with just about everyone.
[01:19:07.700 --> 01:19:13.100]   And they had sort of different audiobook narrators take all the different voices and
[01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:15.260]   they use this sort of voice for Paul Shafer.
[01:19:15.260 --> 01:19:16.260]   Oh, no.
[01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:18.020]   When I formed the Blues Brothers Orchestra.
[01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:21.900]   I said to John, you're going to be careful with that.
[01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:22.900]   No, no.
[01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:24.820]   And that doesn't really work.
[01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:28.380]   And this is, I listened to the audio samples and it's just, oh, this is going to be fun
[01:19:28.380 --> 01:19:29.380]   to listen to.
[01:19:29.380 --> 01:19:30.380]   And it is a great book.
[01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:32.420]   I did read the whole thing.
[01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:36.100]   It has two components that I really, really wanted out of this book.
[01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:40.620]   Just showbiz stories and Paul Shafer, the character he, what he does on the Letterman
[01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:47.460]   Show is a combination of just absolute reality and just playing the part of this showbiz
[01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:48.460]   guy.
[01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:53.020]   He's just been a huge fan of showbiz culture ever since he was a little kid in Canada.
[01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:58.100]   So you enjoy seeing backstage stories and stories about working with every single musician
[01:19:58.100 --> 01:19:59.260]   over the past 30 years.
[01:19:59.260 --> 01:20:01.300]   You could possibly name his stories about Dylan.
[01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:02.620]   He has stories about Ray Charles.
[01:20:02.620 --> 01:20:05.020]   He has stories about Stevie Wonder.
[01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:11.700]   Friendships that go back to the 70s with some of the top TV comedians you could ever name.
[01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:14.500]   But also the fact that he is a consummate musician.
[01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:20.980]   He is so incredibly talented with a voluminous understanding of all kinds of different styles,
[01:20:20.980 --> 01:20:26.660]   a love of Brill building classic rock and also a knowledge of everybody who works in the
[01:20:26.660 --> 01:20:29.020]   music scene and the ability to work with him.
[01:20:29.020 --> 01:20:35.300]   So it's not only is it great to find out how he sort of blew it the first time he met Jerry
[01:20:35.300 --> 01:20:42.660]   Lewis, but it's also good to find out exactly how he came to really love as a kid, not only
[01:20:42.660 --> 01:20:47.420]   learning piano, but also just having a love affair with a Hammond B3 organ and trying to
[01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:52.580]   figure out exactly how breaking down albums to find out exactly how these things work.
[01:20:52.580 --> 01:20:58.220]   When he went from a four piece band in the Letterman Show to a large orchestra with a
[01:20:58.220 --> 01:21:02.580]   brass section, what are the problems of how did he choose those musicians and how did
[01:21:02.580 --> 01:21:07.060]   he change the format of the band to support not only the music that they have to play
[01:21:07.060 --> 01:21:11.660]   going in and going out of commercial and playing people on and off, but also just supporting
[01:21:11.660 --> 01:21:13.460]   any group that might come in and off.
[01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:16.860]   I'm really hoping that he will follow it up with another memoir that focuses more on
[01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:22.340]   the music because I felt as though I learned a lot more about rock and roll by reading
[01:21:22.340 --> 01:21:27.540]   this memoir, but it's one of those just hellaciously entertaining books.
[01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:28.540]   It's under bridge.
[01:21:28.540 --> 01:21:33.100]   You get eight hours and 54 minutes worth of Paul Schafer and in Swinging Times.
[01:21:33.100 --> 01:21:35.500]   Last thing is the old time in hipster, isn't he?
[01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:36.740]   Let me play a little bit.
[01:21:36.740 --> 01:21:37.740]   Let's just hear the.
[01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:42.140]   In the 70s, I had heard that Bob had returned to his orthodox roots.
[01:21:42.140 --> 01:21:46.300]   Supposedly, he was studying with a Hasidic Rabbi in Brooklyn.
[01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:51.420]   Then came to rumors that our man, Zimmey had ventured beyond the Old Testament into
[01:21:51.420 --> 01:21:52.900]   that Paul Schafer.
[01:21:52.900 --> 01:21:53.900]   Yeah.
[01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:54.900]   Oh my God.
[01:21:54.900 --> 01:21:56.700]   He sounds like a comic.
[01:21:56.700 --> 01:21:57.700]   Yeah.
[01:21:57.700 --> 01:21:58.700]   I love it.
[01:21:58.700 --> 01:21:59.700]   This is great.
[01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:00.700]   I didn't want to believe it.
[01:22:00.700 --> 01:22:05.420]   I clung to the notion that once they cut the tip, you're always hip.
[01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:08.420]   All right.
[01:22:08.420 --> 01:22:09.420]   That's it.
[01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:13.980]   I'm going to know that book.
[01:22:13.980 --> 01:22:18.740]   We'll be here for the rest of our lives of Swinging Shobiz Saga from the King of Swinging
[01:22:18.740 --> 01:22:21.500]   Himself, Paul Schafer, the ultimate hipster.
[01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:23.260]   This is a must listen.
[01:22:23.260 --> 01:22:24.260]   Absolutely.
[01:22:24.260 --> 01:22:25.780]   Eight hours and 54 minutes and it's yours for you.
[01:22:25.780 --> 01:22:31.700]   Just go to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:22:31.700 --> 01:22:34.700]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:35.700]   Our first book is free.
[01:22:35.700 --> 01:22:36.700]   Wow.
[01:22:36.700 --> 01:22:37.700]   That's awesome.
[01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:39.220]   Oh, I can't wait to hear that.
[01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:41.660]   We thank them for their support of MacRaeque Weekly.
[01:22:41.660 --> 01:22:42.660]   All right.
[01:22:42.660 --> 01:22:44.740]   Time for our pick of the week and Mr. Alex Lindsey.
[01:22:44.740 --> 01:22:47.060]   Why don't you kick things off, baby?
[01:22:47.060 --> 01:22:48.060]   Okay.
[01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:54.340]   So I feel like I need to recommend this next one.
[01:22:54.340 --> 01:22:56.740]   It's an iPhone app, but it's it.
[01:22:56.740 --> 01:22:58.860]   It's just one about girls.
[01:22:58.860 --> 01:23:00.700]   You ruined everything.
[01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:03.700]   I was getting all wound up.
[01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:05.700]   I was going to tell you what is it.
[01:23:05.700 --> 01:23:06.700]   What is it?
[01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:07.700]   Come on.
[01:23:07.700 --> 01:23:08.700]   No, no.
[01:23:08.700 --> 01:23:10.700]   So Adobe has released Photoshop.
[01:23:10.700 --> 01:23:12.700]   Oh, how much is this going to cost?
[01:23:12.700 --> 01:23:13.700]   Free.
[01:23:13.700 --> 01:23:14.700]   What?
[01:23:14.700 --> 01:23:15.700]   It's free.
[01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:16.700]   What?
[01:23:16.700 --> 01:23:17.700]   So that's why you have to go download it.
[01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:19.340]   Now, of course, it's not the entire Photoshop.
[01:23:19.340 --> 01:23:21.900]   This isn't a replacement for Photoshop.
[01:23:21.900 --> 01:23:26.220]   But it is a I think that we you know, you want to see the first step.
[01:23:26.220 --> 01:23:29.820]   This is the first baby step that Adobe is taking in this.
[01:23:29.820 --> 01:23:31.700]   It's the Photoshop that I'm mobile.
[01:23:31.700 --> 01:23:34.300]   So wow.
[01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:37.500]   So this is and it's it's you know, it's solid.
[01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:39.380]   It's a big company builds this kind of thing.
[01:23:39.380 --> 01:23:41.220]   It's solid.
[01:23:41.220 --> 01:23:44.860]   You can do crops, rotate flips, but you can also I mean, in the way they've implemented
[01:23:44.860 --> 01:23:47.980]   the interface, I think, you know, they're really taking advantage of the of the touch
[01:23:47.980 --> 01:23:48.980]   interface.
[01:23:48.980 --> 01:23:53.340]   And so like for instance, when you want to change exposure, you open up the application.
[01:23:53.340 --> 01:23:58.220]   I mean, you open up the you select the exposure from the top and the interfaces work really
[01:23:58.220 --> 01:23:59.220]   well.
[01:23:59.220 --> 01:24:05.060]   So you're using the same thing, you know, kind of rough around the edges.
[01:24:05.060 --> 01:24:06.420]   But then you just sit there and just move.
[01:24:06.420 --> 01:24:07.420]   There is no interface.
[01:24:07.420 --> 01:24:11.020]   You just kind of move your fingers over the over the image and you can change the saturation
[01:24:11.020 --> 01:24:14.980]   and the exposure and you can, you know, do all this up and it's very iPhone-ish.
[01:24:14.980 --> 01:24:17.540]   You know, it's really taking full advantage.
[01:24:17.540 --> 01:24:19.620]   So it's an image editor that it's totally taking full advantage.
[01:24:19.620 --> 01:24:20.620]   It's a great interface.
[01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:24.540]   There's a lot of great little applications that are used for changing this, but this
[01:24:24.540 --> 01:24:26.300]   is definitely given that it's free.
[01:24:26.300 --> 01:24:30.340]   It should be something that everybody's got an iPhone should download to do little adjustments
[01:24:30.340 --> 01:24:35.020]   on your piece, whether it's, you know, there's the filters are very basic, just a sketch
[01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:36.460]   and a soft focus.
[01:24:36.460 --> 01:24:41.980]   But of course, you can, you know, add pops and borders and vignette blurs and, you know,
[01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:44.060]   you can make it warm.
[01:24:44.060 --> 01:24:46.900]   These are all some of the exposure one is great.
[01:24:46.900 --> 01:24:50.700]   And so anyway, it's in flash.
[01:24:50.700 --> 01:24:52.340]   It's not in flash, is it?
[01:24:52.340 --> 01:24:53.540]   I don't think so.
[01:24:53.540 --> 01:24:54.660]   I think this one is native.
[01:24:54.660 --> 01:24:58.540]   I know that Adobe shipped flash for every phone with the iPhone.
[01:24:58.540 --> 01:24:59.540]   Yes.
[01:24:59.540 --> 01:25:05.180]   And they also are building what they announced in Max was the ability to take flash applications
[01:25:05.180 --> 01:25:11.940]   and port them to the iPhone, you know, so to create that full applications using flash.
[01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:15.700]   And I think this is really good for game developers who have already built like a flash
[01:25:15.700 --> 01:25:19.020]   game that they want to make available on the iPhone.
[01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:23.740]   But I could be wrong and maybe someone from Adobe can set a straight, but I'm pretty sure
[01:25:23.740 --> 01:25:27.180]   that this is really a real native application.
[01:25:27.180 --> 01:25:30.980]   There's nothing to stop Adobe from making their own application in flash that wouldn't
[01:25:30.980 --> 01:25:36.100]   be putting a flash plug in into Safari, which Apple won't let them do.
[01:25:36.100 --> 01:25:37.100]   Right.
[01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:38.100]   Yeah.
[01:25:38.100 --> 01:25:39.100]   Right.
[01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:40.100]   No, this is the way.
[01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:42.300]   And so this is a, this is a native, this isn't like you're going up to Photoshop.com
[01:25:42.300 --> 01:25:43.620]   and running something.
[01:25:43.620 --> 01:25:46.540]   This is really a native application that you install on your iPhone.
[01:25:46.540 --> 01:25:47.540]   It's snappy.
[01:25:47.540 --> 01:25:49.180]   It works well.
[01:25:49.180 --> 01:25:53.060]   And as I said, for free, there's no reason not to have it on your, on your iPhone.
[01:25:53.060 --> 01:25:57.540]   It's just a, it's a great solid little app that really utilizes the touch interface
[01:25:57.540 --> 01:25:58.540]   effectively.
[01:25:58.540 --> 01:26:03.020]   I now have a whole page on my iPhone of photography software.
[01:26:03.020 --> 01:26:04.500]   There's so much of it.
[01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:05.500]   Yeah.
[01:26:05.500 --> 01:26:06.740]   And it's a great tool.
[01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:11.540]   I mean, and I use my, I mean, I think I use my iPhone more for those, the applications
[01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:15.700]   and a lot of them are the photography applications, everything from editing the stuff to having
[01:26:15.700 --> 01:26:20.140]   data tools so I can decide, you know, what lens I should be using and how much depth
[01:26:20.140 --> 01:26:23.620]   of field do I have and there's a lot, you know, which I've talked about in the past.
[01:26:23.620 --> 01:26:26.180]   So there's so many great things that the iPhone can do in this area.
[01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:29.380]   In fact, one of the other things that I do, which is a little unrelated to this is when
[01:26:29.380 --> 01:26:35.780]   I shoot panoramas, I was shooting panoramas in, in, in with a big camera in Brazil and
[01:26:35.780 --> 01:26:40.380]   I take a picture of the, of the camera in the location with my iPhone because it, it
[01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:42.940]   gives me GPS information.
[01:26:42.940 --> 01:26:47.780]   So the iPhone has become, you know, a real tightly wound thing to my entire photography,
[01:26:47.780 --> 01:26:50.860]   you know, endeavor.
[01:26:50.860 --> 01:26:52.180]   Very good pick.
[01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:53.180]   Thank you, Mr. Litzy.
[01:26:53.180 --> 01:26:54.660]   Yeah, you're a better welcome.
[01:26:54.660 --> 01:26:56.820]   I'm downloading it right now.
[01:26:56.820 --> 01:26:59.500]   My pick is something that is broken.
[01:26:59.500 --> 01:27:02.740]   And actually I think I broke it.
[01:27:02.740 --> 01:27:06.780]   I tweeted this just before I left because remember I was saying how I've cleaned up my
[01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:09.820]   library and there are a number of different programs that I used to do this.
[01:27:09.820 --> 01:27:13.740]   And this was the one that blew me away.
[01:27:13.740 --> 01:27:18.740]   It's called Pollux.
[01:27:18.740 --> 01:27:23.700]   But if you go there right now, you'll see this over the last couple of days, Pollux
[01:27:23.700 --> 01:27:28.300]   has gotten an unanticipated high volume of traffic and downloads.
[01:27:28.300 --> 01:27:30.860]   We're happy for the huge interest and success our app has received.
[01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:36.180]   But for this very same reason, the third party apps services that Pollux uses music DNS
[01:27:36.180 --> 01:27:39.540]   and Lyric Wiki, you're no longer able to support Pollux for free.
[01:27:39.540 --> 01:27:46.300]   They had an API key for nonprofit, non-commercial software.
[01:27:46.300 --> 01:27:49.860]   But they sent so much traffic to these sites that they got to cut off.
[01:27:49.860 --> 01:27:53.660]   So I feel terrible because this thing is so amazing.
[01:27:53.660 --> 01:27:58.100]   It adds a little item to your menu bar, runs in the background.
[01:27:58.100 --> 01:27:59.100]   And you could do two things.
[01:27:59.100 --> 01:28:04.060]   As you import music, for instance, the Beatles CDs, it will automatically look up album
[01:28:04.060 --> 01:28:11.020]   art, re-tag it as appropriate, even add lyrics to the iTunes tags.
[01:28:11.020 --> 01:28:19.940]   But you can also select iTunes stuff and it will scan that stuff and add tags.
[01:28:19.940 --> 01:28:24.060]   It also removes duplicates.
[01:28:24.060 --> 01:28:27.060]   This thing is just incredible and it was absolutely free.
[01:28:27.060 --> 01:28:28.060]   And I'm really sad.
[01:28:28.060 --> 01:28:29.420]   However, there's good news.
[01:28:29.420 --> 01:28:33.980]   The reason I'm mentioning it, because it's kind of a tease to say, here's a
[01:28:33.980 --> 01:28:37.380]   program that's really great you can't use.
[01:28:37.380 --> 01:28:43.700]   But the creators, Chetan and Saschwatt, who, by the way, are local guys, one's at UC Berkeley,
[01:28:43.700 --> 01:28:44.700]   one's at UC Santa Cruz.
[01:28:44.700 --> 01:28:45.700]   I wrote them a note.
[01:28:45.700 --> 01:28:46.700]   I said, "But this is great.
[01:28:46.700 --> 01:28:47.700]   Who are you?
[01:28:47.700 --> 01:28:48.700]   Where are you?"
[01:28:48.700 --> 01:28:50.380]   They're just college kids.
[01:28:50.380 --> 01:28:51.460]   They're trying to figure out what to do.
[01:28:51.460 --> 01:28:54.540]   We're going to have them on net at night, next tomorrow.
[01:28:54.540 --> 01:28:57.340]   And we're going to help them try to figure out how to do this.
[01:28:57.340 --> 01:29:00.460]   I think what they need to do is start just charging a couple of bucks for this so that
[01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:02.780]   they can pay for the API keys.
[01:29:02.780 --> 01:29:03.780]   Because this thing really works.
[01:29:03.780 --> 01:29:06.100]   Now, it's not 100% perfect.
[01:29:06.100 --> 01:29:08.140]   It did mistag a few things.
[01:29:08.140 --> 01:29:15.140]   But it did such a good job on 90% of it that I've tried every iTunes app out there to
[01:29:15.140 --> 01:29:19.060]   clean these tags up, including the commercial stuff.
[01:29:19.060 --> 01:29:21.980]   And this did a better job than anything I'd ever tried.
[01:29:21.980 --> 01:29:23.180]   It really worked well.
[01:29:23.180 --> 01:29:25.660]   And what happened is, I tweeted about it.
[01:29:25.660 --> 01:29:26.980]   Everybody retweeted it.
[01:29:26.980 --> 01:29:30.060]   And the word of mouth was incredible because it worked so well.
[01:29:30.060 --> 01:29:31.340]   And we basically put them out of business.
[01:29:31.340 --> 01:29:38.740]   So first of all, my apologies to everybody, including Chetan and Sashwat, especially.
[01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:39.740]   But we're going to get it up.
[01:29:39.740 --> 01:29:42.980]   We're going to figure out if I have to give them money to get this thing back up, we will
[01:29:42.980 --> 01:29:43.980]   do it.
[01:29:43.980 --> 01:29:46.500]   We're going to talk to them on net at night.
[01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:47.900]   It's just this thing is incredible.
[01:29:47.900 --> 01:29:52.820]   Do you guys have recommendations for iTunes cleaning software that you found that works
[01:29:52.820 --> 01:29:54.020]   really well?
[01:29:54.020 --> 01:29:55.020]   I need one.
[01:29:55.020 --> 01:29:56.020]   I don't have one.
[01:29:56.020 --> 01:29:57.020]   This one is the one.
[01:29:57.020 --> 01:29:58.020]   Wow.
[01:29:58.020 --> 01:30:01.820]   I should try it.
[01:30:01.820 --> 01:30:10.540]   I recently was forced to switch, finally switched from my iPhone 3GS and a really terrible problem
[01:30:10.540 --> 01:30:16.620]   resurfaced where a couple of my most important smart playlists no longer function.
[01:30:16.620 --> 01:30:21.580]   In my desktop iTunes library, the smart playlist that automatically builds me podcast playlists.
[01:30:21.580 --> 01:30:22.820]   It works just fine.
[01:30:22.820 --> 01:30:27.140]   But every time it syncs to the iPhone, I get the same old, like eight month old version
[01:30:27.140 --> 01:30:28.140]   of this playlist.
[01:30:28.140 --> 01:30:33.420]   It's not dedicated to playlists, but if the issue is the tags, it might fix this.
[01:30:33.420 --> 01:30:38.300]   What it does is it looks at the, I mean, it found stuff that was unnamed.
[01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:45.380]   It finds the album, adds the album art, names it, tags it, adds lyrics to it.
[01:30:45.380 --> 01:30:47.780]   And it does it quickly and very efficiently.
[01:30:47.780 --> 01:30:49.860]   I mean, this thing was really good.
[01:30:49.860 --> 01:30:53.580]   Now, it says, analyzes the tracks, unique fingerprint so it can never be wrong.
[01:30:53.580 --> 01:30:54.980]   Well, it could be wrong.
[01:30:54.980 --> 01:30:59.300]   Mostly what it was wrong about is what album it's on or sometimes the date was wrong.
[01:30:59.300 --> 01:31:03.260]   I think that's probably the flaw in the databases that it used.
[01:31:03.260 --> 01:31:05.340]   But we'll figure out a way to get this working.
[01:31:05.340 --> 01:31:09.620]   I gave him 50 bucks, but that's just because it's free.
[01:31:09.620 --> 01:31:11.660]   But I donate it because I said, this is so good.
[01:31:11.660 --> 01:31:16.940]   I've paid hundreds of dollars for other programs that haven't done nearly the job that this
[01:31:16.940 --> 01:31:19.300]   program does.
[01:31:19.300 --> 01:31:22.500]   But that was apparently not enough.
[01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:28.780]   So once again, gifted by the flying fist of death.
[01:31:28.780 --> 01:31:32.060]   We're going to figure this out.
[01:31:32.060 --> 01:31:33.700]   We recorded, we recorded that at night this evening.
[01:31:33.700 --> 01:31:34.700]   They're going to be on that at night.
[01:31:34.700 --> 01:31:35.700]   We'll figure this out.
[01:31:35.700 --> 01:31:40.100]   If we just have to make a donation to them to get it running again, we'll do that.
[01:31:40.100 --> 01:31:44.860]   So tune in again to pollxapp.com later in the week and see if it's come back.
[01:31:44.860 --> 01:31:48.260]   It really is, it is really, it is incredible.
[01:31:48.260 --> 01:31:51.100]   I would, I would, you know what, somebody said you should invest in this company.
[01:31:51.100 --> 01:31:52.420]   I would invest in this company.
[01:31:52.420 --> 01:31:55.420]   I mean, this is, this is the kind of thing somebody should really get behind this and
[01:31:55.420 --> 01:31:56.420]   make it happen.
[01:31:56.420 --> 01:32:02.900]   It just shows you though, giving away free software is, is, you know, a great thing.
[01:32:02.900 --> 01:32:03.900]   But you can get bit.
[01:32:03.900 --> 01:32:09.500]   Well, we, yeah, we say it's a, it's a demonstration of the, the, the difference of the business
[01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:14.340]   models in modern digital distribution where there is a butter zone where you want to be
[01:32:14.340 --> 01:32:18.620]   successful enough that you make a lot of money from this thing, but not so successful that
[01:32:18.620 --> 01:32:23.420]   the cost of actually pushing this data to people exceeds any money you could possibly
[01:32:23.420 --> 01:32:24.420]   make from it.
[01:32:24.420 --> 01:32:25.420]   Yeah.
[01:32:25.420 --> 01:32:27.860]   Well, when we started the PIXA core, it was a very, you know, it was all free and people
[01:32:27.860 --> 01:32:32.940]   would just show up and we, you know, and they, you know, work on stuff here and, and we just
[01:32:32.940 --> 01:32:34.260]   got to a point where we can't support them.
[01:32:34.260 --> 01:32:37.900]   We had to start charging because it was the only way we could keep on, you know, providing
[01:32:37.900 --> 01:32:39.380]   the services that we were committed to providing.
[01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:42.140]   I mean, there was, there is a point where you have to charge something.
[01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:43.140]   Yeah.
[01:32:43.140 --> 01:32:46.380]   And that's, I think what, I hope these guys are going to do.
[01:32:46.380 --> 01:32:48.580]   Now, somebody's saying in the chat room, it ruined my library.
[01:32:48.580 --> 01:32:52.180]   Yeah, I would, I would not take you, select your whole library and run it up across your
[01:32:52.180 --> 01:32:53.180]   whole library.
[01:32:53.180 --> 01:32:54.580]   I would do some samples.
[01:32:54.580 --> 01:32:55.580]   Right.
[01:32:55.580 --> 01:33:01.460]   And what I did was I would do the first album in first cutting each album and then see if
[01:33:01.460 --> 01:33:02.700]   it got the right album and stuff.
[01:33:02.700 --> 01:33:03.780]   And if it did, I would continue.
[01:33:03.780 --> 01:33:06.260]   If not, I would, you know, I would stop.
[01:33:06.260 --> 01:33:07.260]   Yeah.
[01:33:07.260 --> 01:33:10.620]   So yeah, I mean, nothing's perfect because it's doing, you know, it's automated.
[01:33:10.620 --> 01:33:14.660]   It's not a human, but it did, it's done better than any program I've ever used before.
[01:33:14.660 --> 01:33:18.180]   And boy, it's nice to have a cleaned up iTunes library with almost all the album art and
[01:33:18.180 --> 01:33:20.300]   everything was just great.
[01:33:20.300 --> 01:33:23.740]   And Leo, I'm afraid that I have to, I have to leave a couple minutes early.
[01:33:23.740 --> 01:33:24.740]   Okay.
[01:33:24.740 --> 01:33:26.140]   Well, you know, all we have is Andy's pick left.
[01:33:26.140 --> 01:33:28.460]   So thank you, Alex Lindsey, pixel core.tv.
[01:33:28.460 --> 01:33:30.340]   Everybody should go there.
[01:33:30.340 --> 01:33:33.620]   And I'm going to be logging in next week from a counter optical.
[01:33:33.620 --> 01:33:36.100]   We're going to be shooting a motion control shoot the next day.
[01:33:36.100 --> 01:33:37.340]   And we'll, I'll be there for a setup day.
[01:33:37.340 --> 01:33:39.900]   So it should be, I should be able to show people around a little bit.
[01:33:39.900 --> 01:33:42.500]   Well, during the show, so people are going to find out.
[01:33:42.500 --> 01:33:44.700]   So you'll be coming from the Great Wall of China.
[01:33:44.700 --> 01:33:46.700]   IO, the tune.
[01:33:46.700 --> 01:33:47.700]   Yes, exactly.
[01:33:47.700 --> 01:33:49.300]   So it's a pretty cool thing.
[01:33:49.300 --> 01:33:53.820]   So people should definitely stay tuned into the live video because I'll try to do a little
[01:33:53.820 --> 01:33:55.020]   walk around while we're there.
[01:33:55.020 --> 01:33:56.020]   That's cool.
[01:33:56.020 --> 01:34:02.100]   We do that every Tuesday at God willing and God in this and the Tricaster willing at
[01:34:02.100 --> 01:34:03.340]   11 a.m.
[01:34:03.340 --> 01:34:04.260]   Pacific, that's two p.m.
[01:34:04.260 --> 01:34:05.260]   Eastern at live.twit.tv.
[01:34:05.260 --> 01:34:07.660]   So join us next Tuesday for that.
[01:34:07.660 --> 01:34:08.660]   Thank you, Alex.
[01:34:08.660 --> 01:34:09.660]   Thank you.
[01:34:09.660 --> 01:34:10.660]   Take care.
[01:34:10.660 --> 01:34:15.260]   No, last but not least, Mr. Andy, you're not coz pick of the week.
[01:34:15.260 --> 01:34:16.260]   Yeah.
[01:34:16.260 --> 01:34:21.460]   I'm the, my pick of the week is going to be another iPhone app, but it's an app that
[01:34:21.460 --> 01:34:24.220]   I've been waiting for for a long time.
[01:34:24.220 --> 01:34:27.260]   And also an app that caused me a great deal of problems over the weekend.
[01:34:27.260 --> 01:34:32.620]   The problems where I, I feel as though if I stop working on a book before the deadline,
[01:34:32.620 --> 01:34:34.180]   it's like leaving money on the table.
[01:34:34.180 --> 01:34:36.860]   I need to spend all that time going through everything.
[01:34:36.860 --> 01:34:40.380]   Everything I've written to see if there's something, something else out there.
[01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:45.620]   And there's one big, the point of the iPhone fully loaded has always been not here's how
[01:34:45.620 --> 01:34:47.420]   to get the most out of iTunes.
[01:34:47.420 --> 01:34:50.820]   It's, it's mostly about here's how to get data that you have on your desktop or in your
[01:34:50.820 --> 01:34:53.700]   real world and make it useful for your iPhone.
[01:34:53.700 --> 01:34:56.860]   There's a chapter on working with Microsoft Office Docs.
[01:34:56.860 --> 01:35:00.380]   And after lots of research and lots of work and lots of testing things out and spending
[01:35:00.380 --> 01:35:02.500]   lots of money and lots of apps, it didn't really work.
[01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:07.020]   I finally had to say there are no good word processors for the iPhone.
[01:35:07.020 --> 01:35:10.180]   So here's a go, go, go, you, you Zoho documents online.
[01:35:10.180 --> 01:35:11.540]   It's a decent text editor.
[01:35:11.540 --> 01:35:13.500]   It makes it easy to move where docs in and out.
[01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:16.140]   I wish that, you know, I'm sure I hope that by the time you read this, that there will
[01:35:16.140 --> 01:35:17.140]   be a better app.
[01:35:17.140 --> 01:35:20.940]   But unfortunately, there's simply our node decent word processors on the iPhone.
[01:35:20.940 --> 01:35:24.180]   And that was certainly, that's still certainly true.
[01:35:24.180 --> 01:35:31.620]   But one day, like two days before my drop deadline for the book, Alphonse Schmidt uploaded
[01:35:31.620 --> 01:35:32.620]   a new updated.
[01:35:32.620 --> 01:35:35.380]   I'm sure this back.
[01:35:35.380 --> 01:35:37.220]   We love him.
[01:35:37.220 --> 01:35:43.060]   He created a new version of an app called Notebooks that solves the problems that I had with version
[01:35:43.060 --> 01:35:48.980]   2.6 and made me, maybe suddenly have to go back and say, what I thought was going to
[01:35:48.980 --> 01:35:50.740]   be maybe tweaking two paragraphs.
[01:35:50.740 --> 01:35:55.580]   What I'm going to be doing is researching an entire new second of the book.
[01:35:55.580 --> 01:36:01.420]   It's still more like a, it still stops, stops just short of being a great word processor.
[01:36:01.420 --> 01:36:03.620]   It is a great, great, great notes application.
[01:36:03.620 --> 01:36:05.860]   Better than ever note, which is free.
[01:36:05.860 --> 01:36:08.100]   Well, it's a different thing.
[01:36:08.100 --> 01:36:13.260]   I really don't care about what it does for recording little snippets of notes.
[01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:17.300]   And certainly it's not designed to intercept notes from the web, from email and stuff like
[01:36:17.300 --> 01:36:18.300]   that.
[01:36:18.300 --> 01:36:21.540]   I'm looking at it as the way that I would use a word processor.
[01:36:21.540 --> 01:36:25.940]   Obviously, on an iPhone, I'm not going to sit there or stand there in line and be tapping
[01:36:25.940 --> 01:36:29.860]   on a 1000 word column with just my thumbs or just my index finger.
[01:36:29.860 --> 01:36:35.820]   What I really want is an iPhone application that will take the role that's currently
[01:36:35.820 --> 01:36:36.820]   filled by my netbook.
[01:36:36.820 --> 01:36:39.900]   I take it, if I'm going to be away from the office for more than a couple of hours, I'm
[01:36:39.900 --> 01:36:42.940]   going to be after the show, I'm going to drive over and visit my dad.
[01:36:42.940 --> 01:36:46.700]   And of course, I'm going to have my netbook in the driver's seat because just in case
[01:36:46.700 --> 01:36:50.300]   there's, I get an email from an editor or phone call from an editor that they need something
[01:36:50.300 --> 01:36:52.340]   really quick or they need me to change something.
[01:36:52.340 --> 01:36:54.180]   It's something I filed just the day before.
[01:36:54.180 --> 01:36:58.220]   I need to be able to be able to open up a Word document that they've sent me, make some
[01:36:58.220 --> 01:37:04.860]   changes, maybe even write a whole new section to it, then give them that new version.
[01:37:04.860 --> 01:37:06.980]   Notebooks can do that and it doesn't very, very well.
[01:37:06.980 --> 01:37:10.260]   It has exceptionally good Microsoft Word support.
[01:37:10.260 --> 01:37:14.300]   If I, there's a lot of applications on the iPhone that will open up Microsoft Word documents,
[01:37:14.300 --> 01:37:18.820]   I'm not talking about the basic, the basic document reader that's built into the operating
[01:37:18.820 --> 01:37:19.820]   system.
[01:37:19.820 --> 01:37:23.500]   I'll talk about apps that promise that we will let you edit a Microsoft Word document.
[01:37:23.500 --> 01:37:26.660]   This can open up that document and keep all the formatting intact.
[01:37:26.660 --> 01:37:32.500]   It doesn't support styles, but if the formats that are dictated by the styles will be interpreted
[01:37:32.500 --> 01:37:35.060]   and will be correctly done.
[01:37:35.060 --> 01:37:39.300]   The chapters I've been writing for this book, I can open on the iPhone and notebooks and
[01:37:39.300 --> 01:37:44.700]   they appear exactly the way they're supposed to appear in the way they would appear on
[01:37:44.700 --> 01:37:45.700]   my desktop.
[01:37:45.700 --> 01:37:50.300]   I can write new paragraphs, new sections, I can do edits, I can respond to notes that
[01:37:50.300 --> 01:37:56.420]   my editor has done, and I can even, through a workaround, remember, I can even send that
[01:37:56.420 --> 01:37:58.580]   back to my editor.
[01:37:58.580 --> 01:38:01.740]   That's the second thing that I really like about this app that separates it from all
[01:38:01.740 --> 01:38:02.740]   the rest.
[01:38:02.740 --> 01:38:07.700]   The rest of these apps make it very, very difficult to get a Word document into this application
[01:38:07.700 --> 01:38:11.660]   and more importantly, get it back out again to do something with it.
[01:38:11.660 --> 01:38:16.980]   Notebooks offers a desktop syncing program that will let you drag all kinds of different
[01:38:16.980 --> 01:38:23.220]   formatted documents and use it within notebooks, but it has a really awesome feature.
[01:38:23.220 --> 01:38:28.540]   It will actually, it will sync your notebooks workspace with any web dev based network storage
[01:38:28.540 --> 01:38:29.540]   solution.
[01:38:29.540 --> 01:38:33.740]   I simply have given it my information about my iDisk account.
[01:38:33.740 --> 01:38:37.460]   What I can do is I can simply, like the last thing I do before I leave the office is simply
[01:38:37.460 --> 01:38:43.100]   either manually copy my files to my private iDisk or just simply have an automated workflow
[01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:45.140]   that automatically backs that stuff up.
[01:38:45.140 --> 01:38:49.180]   Then later on, if it turns out that I need to make some changes to a story I filed yesterday,
[01:38:49.180 --> 01:38:52.500]   I can just access my iDisk, the file will be right there in notebooks.
[01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:56.300]   I can make the change right in a Microsoft Word compatible editor and then either save
[01:38:56.300 --> 01:39:00.860]   it back to my iDisk or simply email it to an editor as a file attachment.
[01:39:00.860 --> 01:39:04.580]   If an editor needs to send me a Word document, they can't simply, I can't simply email it
[01:39:04.580 --> 01:39:07.700]   to me as an attachment because once again, there's that sandbox.
[01:39:07.700 --> 01:39:12.700]   I can't get information out of one application on the iPhone and put it into this other application,
[01:39:12.700 --> 01:39:15.860]   but I can simply say, well, just copy it into my public folder on my iDisk.
[01:39:15.860 --> 01:39:20.260]   Then I can simply, again, just through notebooks, get it out of my public folder, make the edits
[01:39:20.260 --> 01:39:23.500]   that are requested, then email it onto somebody else.
[01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:27.260]   It is actually a competent text editor.
[01:39:27.260 --> 01:39:31.060]   It doesn't support, as an editor, when I'm creating text, I can't do any formatting of
[01:39:31.060 --> 01:39:32.060]   any kind.
[01:39:32.060 --> 01:39:33.060]   I really wish they would address that.
[01:39:33.060 --> 01:39:36.060]   I'd love it if they included text expander support as well.
[01:39:36.060 --> 01:39:37.260]   That would sure help.
[01:39:37.260 --> 01:39:40.860]   Yeah, but the simple fact that cut copy and paste is now an operating system.
[01:39:40.860 --> 01:39:41.860]   Yeah, that makes an inference.
[01:39:41.860 --> 01:39:42.860]   Yeah.
[01:39:42.860 --> 01:39:48.420]   It really is elevated all the boats and the harbor, but I have been able to write like
[01:39:48.420 --> 01:39:55.540]   in the sidekick meltdown, I was actually in midtown Manhattan on the sidewalk when I got
[01:39:55.540 --> 01:39:59.940]   an email from my editor at the paper saying, can you submit something?
[01:39:59.940 --> 01:40:03.500]   I was expecting to do something in a couple of days, but I just sat there in a park bench
[01:40:03.500 --> 01:40:08.500]   and wrote a five or 600 word column right there in notebooks and was able to email it
[01:40:08.500 --> 01:40:11.740]   to my editor as a word file attached to an email.
[01:40:11.740 --> 01:40:14.500]   I think that there's still some ways left to go.
[01:40:14.500 --> 01:40:21.660]   I think that Alphonse could really add maybe the final four percent of features to notebooks
[01:40:21.660 --> 01:40:24.580]   and turn it into a killer word processor.
[01:40:24.580 --> 01:40:28.700]   It is right now a killer notes app that is very, very, very useful for people who need
[01:40:28.700 --> 01:40:31.420]   to create edit and manage word files.
[01:40:31.420 --> 01:40:33.980]   But I think that there is definitely a leader in this race.
[01:40:33.980 --> 01:40:37.460]   And I think that right now, I think they're up to version 2.7.
[01:40:37.460 --> 01:40:43.060]   I am so on Tender Hooks to find out what he's going to do with version 3.0 because notebooks
[01:40:43.060 --> 01:40:46.700]   could be, for me, a game-changing application for the iPhone.
[01:40:46.700 --> 01:40:48.340]   And for $5.99 for God's sakes.
[01:40:48.340 --> 01:40:51.620]   Well, I'm thinking documents to go, which was probably, I can't remember what it was,
[01:40:51.620 --> 01:40:54.380]   but it was a lot, but it was more than that, at least twice that.
[01:40:54.380 --> 01:40:55.780]   And it doesn't do as much.
[01:40:55.780 --> 01:40:58.500]   I mean, documents to go is more of an office suite.
[01:40:58.500 --> 01:41:01.380]   It looks like it imports all the office formats.
[01:41:01.380 --> 01:41:07.300]   It imports and it's sort of edits, but not really, and sort of exports it, but not really.
[01:41:07.300 --> 01:41:13.380]   That was my problem with almost every single text editor that I found for the iPhone.
[01:41:13.380 --> 01:41:15.300]   It does not give me that end-to-end.
[01:41:15.300 --> 01:41:17.740]   I have a Microsoft Word file.
[01:41:17.740 --> 01:41:21.420]   I want to be able to edit it without stripping out all the formatting that was already existing
[01:41:21.420 --> 01:41:22.420]   in that document.
[01:41:22.420 --> 01:41:23.860]   And I want to be able to get it into the phone.
[01:41:23.860 --> 01:41:27.180]   I want to be able to get it out of the phone without having to run home and attach to my
[01:41:27.180 --> 01:41:31.740]   MacBook because, you know what, if I have to run home to attach my MacBook, I'll edit
[01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:34.260]   that document on my MacBook, not on my iPhone.
[01:41:34.260 --> 01:41:35.260]   Yeah.
[01:41:35.260 --> 01:41:37.420]   I'm not saying it's a perfect solution.
[01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:40.860]   There are no perfect solutions for word processing on the iPhone, and that's a really bad problem,
[01:41:40.860 --> 01:41:45.620]   I think, considering there's so many good ones for BlackBerry and other operating systems.
[01:41:45.620 --> 01:41:48.980]   But we are close to this is this is this is the gem.
[01:41:48.980 --> 01:41:52.220]   I think notebooks is the Gemini missions to the moon and we're very, very close to actually
[01:41:52.220 --> 01:41:54.220]   doing a landing.
[01:41:54.220 --> 01:41:57.820]   I like that.
[01:41:57.820 --> 01:41:58.820]   Very good.
[01:41:58.820 --> 01:42:00.700]   It's our pick of the week from Andy Anaco.
[01:42:00.700 --> 01:42:06.020]   It is called Alphonse Schmitz notebooks.
[01:42:06.020 --> 01:42:10.860]   He gave his name in the apparently on the application title form.
[01:42:10.860 --> 01:42:12.180]   He put his name.
[01:42:12.180 --> 01:42:14.100]   So that's in big letters.
[01:42:14.100 --> 01:42:18.380]   And then where his name should be is the name of the product notebooks.
[01:42:18.380 --> 01:42:19.380]   But that's fine.
[01:42:19.380 --> 01:42:20.380]   He deserves credit.
[01:42:20.380 --> 01:42:24.260]   Alphonse does this is the name of the he is his own company.
[01:42:24.260 --> 01:42:25.700]   I do the point there.
[01:42:25.700 --> 01:42:30.100]   He's his own company as as am I 599.
[01:42:30.100 --> 01:42:32.340]   It's available on the, but you got two iPhone apps.
[01:42:32.340 --> 01:42:33.340]   There you go.
[01:42:33.340 --> 01:42:34.860]   One for free one for 599.
[01:42:34.860 --> 01:42:36.100]   Andy, thank you so much for being here.
[01:42:36.100 --> 01:42:40.940]   Andy is the man behind the celestial waste of bandwidth at cwob.com.
[01:42:40.940 --> 01:42:43.260]   He's also at the Chicago Sun times.
[01:42:43.260 --> 01:42:48.500]   You can follow him on Twitter, Twitter.com/anaco, right?
[01:42:48.500 --> 01:42:50.740]   All I can do, all I need to do is spell my last name.
[01:42:50.740 --> 01:42:55.140]   Although I would suggest that instead you would simply go to cwob.com and follow the
[01:42:55.140 --> 01:42:56.140]   link.
[01:42:56.140 --> 01:42:57.140]   Click the link.
[01:42:57.140 --> 01:42:58.140]   Follow me from there.
[01:42:58.140 --> 01:42:59.140]   It's easier to spell.
[01:42:59.140 --> 01:43:03.620]   C, W, and then you want to know and then a B.
[01:43:03.620 --> 01:43:04.620]   Okay.
[01:43:04.620 --> 01:43:06.260]   As in Boston Red Sox, the most awesome Red Sox team.
[01:43:06.260 --> 01:43:08.980]   It was my favorite question.
[01:43:08.980 --> 01:43:12.620]   I'd say, oh yeah, I work at KGO and they say, how do you spell that?
[01:43:12.620 --> 01:43:13.620]   KGO.
[01:43:13.620 --> 01:43:17.580]   The L is silent.
[01:43:17.580 --> 01:43:19.580]   But do follow Andy because he's a great Twitter.
[01:43:19.580 --> 01:43:22.420]   And if he's good enough for Roger Ebert, he should be good enough for you.
[01:43:22.420 --> 01:43:24.420]   We want to tell everybody the phone number.
[01:43:24.420 --> 01:43:25.420]   I have got it now.
[01:43:25.420 --> 01:43:27.020]   Thanks to our chat room.
[01:43:27.020 --> 01:43:30.020]   You can call and leave a message which we'll ignore, but you know, you'll at least have
[01:43:30.020 --> 01:43:32.660]   the satisfaction of having done it.
[01:43:32.660 --> 01:43:37.100]   And that number is 877-Twit-81.
[01:43:37.100 --> 01:43:38.580]   877-881.
[01:43:38.580 --> 01:43:42.940]   Maybe next week we'll do an all phone show.
[01:43:42.940 --> 01:43:43.940]   877-Twit-81.
[01:43:43.940 --> 01:43:47.620]   Unless there's a big story in which case we won't.
[01:43:47.620 --> 01:43:49.420]   877-Twit-81.
[01:43:49.420 --> 01:43:52.260]   We also want to remind you the podcast awards are coming up soon.
[01:43:52.260 --> 01:43:55.180]   The nomination period closes October 18th.
[01:43:55.180 --> 01:43:59.860]   And we'd sure appreciate it if you'd vote for your favorite Twitch show by going to podcast
[01:43:59.860 --> 01:44:03.100]   awards.com.
[01:44:03.100 --> 01:44:05.940]   There are a number of categories we could qualify in.
[01:44:05.940 --> 01:44:13.020]   People's choice, of course, best produced, best, I don't know, comedy, business, education,
[01:44:13.020 --> 01:44:14.380]   entertainment, general.
[01:44:14.380 --> 01:44:15.660]   We could qualify for all of those.
[01:44:15.660 --> 01:44:18.340]   And of course, there's technology and science.
[01:44:18.340 --> 01:44:19.340]   And I'm not going to vote.
[01:44:19.340 --> 01:44:21.540]   I'm not going to say which one to vote for.
[01:44:21.540 --> 01:44:24.260]   You let your conscience be the guide.
[01:44:24.260 --> 01:44:28.860]   But if you got several categories, you could vote for one in people's choice.
[01:44:28.860 --> 01:44:30.860]   We just want you to vote for some of those.
[01:44:30.860 --> 01:44:33.980]   And if you have another favorite podcast, you could vote for that one too.
[01:44:33.980 --> 01:44:36.180]   That's podcastawards.com.
[01:44:36.180 --> 01:44:40.700]   You can watch this show as I mentioned live every 2 p.m. every Tuesday, or yeah, Tuesday,
[01:44:40.700 --> 01:44:47.020]   2 p.m. Eastern, 11 a.m. Pacific at live.twit.tv.

[01:44:50.020 --> 01:44:52.860]   Always nice being had by you.
[01:44:52.860 --> 01:44:53.860]   Time's over.
[01:44:53.860 --> 01:44:54.860]   Get back to work.
[01:44:54.860 --> 01:44:56.860]   I ain't never get that.
[01:44:56.860 --> 01:44:57.860]   Naughty Gaggers.
[01:44:57.860 --> 01:44:58.860]   Naughty Gaggers, you.
[01:44:58.860 --> 01:44:59.860]   Barney Wicks.
[01:44:59.860 --> 01:45:02.860]   I've got to go play with Windows 7.
[01:45:02.860 --> 01:45:03.860]   See you later.
[01:45:03.860 --> 01:45:04.860]   [MUSIC]
[01:45:04.860 --> 01:45:14.860]   [MUSIC]
[01:45:14.860 --> 01:45:17.440]   (upbeat music)
[01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:18.780]   (drumroll)
