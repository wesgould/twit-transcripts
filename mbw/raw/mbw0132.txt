[00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:16.680]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show that covers all things
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.380]   Macintosha today.
[00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.720]   There is finally some news to talk about.
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.720]   It turns out there's no DRM in the new iPod shuffle.
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.020]   But that story in a moment.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.360]   First let me introduce our panelists, Mr. Alex Lindsey
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.660]   from the Pixel Corp.
[00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:32.520]   Good morning.
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.360]   Good to have you.
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.020]   Thank you.
[00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.920]   Welcome to the show.
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.660]   Beer.
[00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.760]   Had to walk all eight blocks.
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:44.100]   All the way from Bag Haba, SAG Haba.
[00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.400]   Up in the Washington state region there, it's Mr. Scotty
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.700]   Born.
[00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.340]   It's OK if we just call it Gig Harbor.
[00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.040]   Gig Haba.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.840]   What do they have?
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.940]   Hey, Scott, how you doing today?
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.280]   I'm doing just fine.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.380]   I'm very excited because you know when iPhone stuff happens,
[00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.080]   I get excited.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.980]   It's a big iPhone day.
[00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.780]   We'll talk about that in just a second.
[00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.220]   Also here from Kentucky, weighing in at 138 pounds.
[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.320]   Yeah, I don't know about that.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.260]   The young contender, Mr. Ryan Shroud to PC perspective.
[00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.460]   Hi, Ryan.
[00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.960]   How are you?
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.260]   Great to have you back on the show.
[00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.800]   Ryan does a hardware show with us.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.600]   And of course, he was very helpful in understanding
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.700]   what those new Mac pros can do.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.860]   I'm seeing now some of those Cinebench benchmarks.
[00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.500]   Mac Rumors just published them to make it look pretty awesome.
[00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.540]   I don't feel quite so bad.
[00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.840]   Also here, ladies and gentlemen, from Massachusetts.
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.280]   It's Andy and not co.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.980]   Addy.
[00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:42.540]   Addy.
[00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.380]   How are you?
[00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.920]   Wicked Pesser here.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.720]   We've been drunk off our butts since 2am because that's
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.260]   technically the status St. Patrick's Day.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.860]   It is.
[00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.060]   It's a federal holiday.
[00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.760]   No one ain't getting their mail today.
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.860]   Anywhere in the Boston area.
[00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:00.300]   Do they?
[00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.000]   Is it a big?
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   I think it's a big holiday.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.100]   You're in the Celtic land.
[00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.700]   I've been in my office all day long.
[00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.840]   I have received one report from one of my field operatives
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.140]   who already spotted Guinness vomit in the subway.
[00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.240]   Oh, that's disgusting.
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.880]   On her way into work.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.580]   So you know that's bad.
[00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.720]   And you could tell it's Guinness because it's--
[00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.420]   It's just disgusting.
[00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.660]   Because it's got a steam of foam at the top, razor
[00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:27.620]   and separation.
[00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.360]   The foam never goes away.
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.960]   Ee.
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.300]   All right, we have a big story, of course.
[00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.800]   And we will get to the minor stories like the iPod,
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.200]   shuffle, DRM, kerfuffle.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.240]   The shuffle, kerfuffle, kerfuffle.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.040]   A little later on.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.280]   But before we do that, let's talk about big announcements
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.080]   out of Cupertino, California today.
[00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:56.220]   The new iPhone 3.0 looks like Kevin Rose nailed it.
[00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.720]   Yes.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.120]   He's got to be right sometime.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.020]   Yeah.
[00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.160]   Cut and paste, or they call it copy and paste.
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.620]   It can do both.
[00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.260]   It can do both.
[00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.660]   Copy, cut and paste.
[00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:09.760]   It's just that good.
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.060]   It's just that good.
[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.840]   First of all, I guess we should say we should ask,
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.000]   when is this going to be available?
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.600]   Have they yet?
[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:20.200]   Yes.
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.340]   So they say a new hardware yet?
[00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.340]   They did not.
[00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.100]   In fact, they asked.
[00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.600]   I think someone from the BBC said--
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.340]   They're in the Q&A section.
[00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.040]   What about the hardware?
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.640]   And they said nothing to say today.
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:29.740]   And then they said, what about netbooks?
[00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.480]   What nothing to say today?
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.240]   OK, that's the stock answer.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.680]   It's forest all that did the presentation, right?
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.580]   It was everybody.
[00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:38.580]   Everybody.
[00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.380]   It was a big part.
[00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.920]   It was a big part.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.520]   Yeah.
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.020]   OK.
[00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.860]   So Andy, you think this is going to-- does mean new hardware?
[00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.020]   Well, it's got to mean new hardware.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.580]   They have to keep pushing out new phones,
[00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.620]   if only just to get people to replace their old phones.
[00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.960]   I think Scott was-- you who pointed out
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.060]   that this is going to be the second anniversary of the unveiling
[00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.100]   of the iPhone 1.0, which means that a lot of people
[00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.060]   are going to have their contracts expire.
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.860]   And rather them have them free as a bird to actually
[00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.240]   be on a month by month basis, this would offend AT&T
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.500]   in some fashion and they would have to slap down like--
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.040]   Of course it would.
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.240]   Yeah, I predict a new phone will land around June,
[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.040]   because that's when all of us that bought the new phone
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.640]   back two years ago will have our contracts expire.
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.780]   And it's way too big a risk to let those people flounder
[00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.720]   around out there without some new little tempting bobble
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.220]   to say, hey, you want to upgrade to this, don't you?
[00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.520]   And then you can do that.
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.620]   What I find interesting is I don't
[00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.720]   know that many people with a 1.0 iPhone.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:41.660]   Yeah, I don't--
[00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:42.360]   I still have mine.
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.460]   Everybody I know is upgraded to two.
[00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.060]   Yeah.
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.220]   I'm still one of those holdouts with one.
[00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.920]   You have a 1.0 iPhone?
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:49.920]   That's--
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.860]   There's no 3G service where I live.
[00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:52.960]   It doesn't matter.
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:53.560]   OK.
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.100]   And you don't care about the GPS.
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.500]   Do they say anything about upgrade for instance?
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.300]   I've got to really--
[00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.100]   I've got to really--
[00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.700]   They didn't say anything.
[00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:59.500]   They got a nice--
[00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.400]   They didn't say anything.
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.840]   They did say that 3.0 will work with existing phones.
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:05.840]   They did say that.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:06.440]   Yeah.
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.440]   That's good news.
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.380]   But there are two features that will not.
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.980]   Stereo Bluetooth won't work with 1.0 and neither will MMS.
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.140]   They're finally adding stereo Bluetooth.
[00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.840]   Oh my god.
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.340]   I'm going to fall off my ball.
[00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.680]   They're finally adding MMS.
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.080]   That's something that's been in phones for five years.
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.980]   And something no one really needs.
[00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.180]   You don't cheap $60 phones.
[00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.080]   Well, that's true.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.520]   If you're sending email.
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.320]   Yeah, who wants--
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:34.260]   I think a lot of moms use MMS to send pictures of things.
[00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.160]   They don't really want to set up email accounts
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.860]   and that kind of stuff.
[00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.300]   Well, it clearly hasn't hurt the sales figures for the phone
[00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:40.960]   not to have it.
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:41.900]   I'll say that.
[00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:42.400]   Yeah.
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.760]   It seems like MMS is just not something anybody needs anymore.
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.800]   But I do think he was on the checklist.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.700]   Hey, who really is--
[00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.840]   Did anybody do the Crunchgear Bingo just
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.440]   to see what the final score was?
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.640]   That was a cool little list that you put up there.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.180]   I think they did pretty well.
[00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:59.880]   That was from Crunchgear.
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.880]   I think they did pretty well.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.720]   Well, I think Apple hit most of the marks.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.420]   Still, I don't think we saw--
[00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.020]   we weren't there, but video is still not.
[00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:10.720]   No video?
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.220]   No video.
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.260]   But a lot of the stuff, the cutting base, I think,
[00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260]   was something that we assumed had to be there.
[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.360]   I mean, there's no reason to do an event
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.800]   if you don't have a cutting paste.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.660]   Really?
[00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:25.800]   But the thing that I was surprised that they made available
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.640]   now is the tethering.
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.100]   Or being able-- not tethering, but being
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:34.740]   able to connect something hardware-wise to the camera.
[00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:36.940]   There are so many possibilities there.
[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:41.480]   But they do allow for the remote apps.
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.580]   I think we're talking about--
[00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:47.020]   developers have hardware API access to the dock connector.
[00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.920]   So you could do really, really awesome new hardware that
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.060]   has a really intimate connection with software
[00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:54.560]   that's running on the iPhone.
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.960]   Like what?
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.360]   Well, go ahead.
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.600]   When you talk about medical applications,
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.400]   they showed one where you can have a blood pressure thing.
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.300]   The blood pressure is actually showing up on the iPhone.
[00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.140]   You could do that with a scale.
[00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:11.240]   So your scale at home could be connected.
[00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.980]   Through either Bluetooth or through hardware.
[00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:16.080]   But also, imagine having--
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.780]   being able to connect an iPhone to medical devices
[00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:21.120]   at a hospital and being using it as-- and this is where
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.820]   the iPhone really starts to break away from just being
[00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:26.920]   a phone and really becomes this interface to many,
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.920]   many, many different applications.
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.660]   And many, many pieces of hardware, your computer,
[00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:32.860]   so on and so forth.
[00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:33.960]   Any way I imagine--
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.900]   Somebody that wants to do an inventory,
[00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:37.900]   they could have a scanner that would connect
[00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.100]   via Bluetooth to the iPhone that immediately
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.800]   could connect through some sort of app that they use
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.640]   to get the inventory information into a spreadsheet.
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.040]   You could imagine Amazon building
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.480]   a little barcode scanner that you could pop to the bottom
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.280]   and that you could scan anything in the world
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.980]   and have it pop up in your Amazon app
[00:08:57.980 --> 00:08:59.380]   so that you could order from Amazon.
[00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.720]   Developers are getting their copies now,
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.720]   so presumably we'll start developing for the summer release.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:05.660]   Yeah.
[00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.860]   Do you guys really think that hardware companies
[00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:10.560]   would want to build hardware specifically
[00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:11.660]   to use the dock?
[00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:13.260]   I think the wireless connectivity option
[00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.200]   is really where everybody would want to go.
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.560]   I think that it depends on--
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.400]   I mean, there's a lot of things where bandwidth and latency--
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.200]   I know that some of the stuff I don't want to really talk about
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.800]   on the show that we're working on.
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.540]   One of the things that have been a big hold up
[00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:28.940]   was dealing with the we need more bandwidth.
[00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:30.240]   Wireless is just not fast enough.
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.080]   Wireless isn't fast enough for what we want to do.
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.880]   And so-- and latency.
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.380]   You know, and so both of those things
[00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:38.080]   get eliminated with a hardware connection.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.080]   So let's start with copy and paste,
[00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:43.280]   because this is something that's been just lacking for so long.
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:44.280]   How does it work?
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.580]   Has anybody seen the video of the demo?
[00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:48.320]   Well, none of us were at the event, I should say.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.020]   None of us were invited to the event.
[00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.220]   Well, you might have been Ryan.
[00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:52.020]   Nobody I thought.
[00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.020]   No, no, I was not.
[00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:55.420]   Oh, look, who's here?
[00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:57.260]   Kiki Sanford, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:58.860]   Dr. Kiki.
[00:09:58.860 --> 00:09:59.860]   Yeah, come on.
[00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:00.860]   Have a seat.
[00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:01.760]   We don't have a camera for you.
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.160]   We just have a-- you can just sit down.
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.660]   [laughter]
[00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:06.200]   Yeah, yeah, like this makes sense.
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.900]   You got me on camera, but not the most beautiful girl
[00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.000]   in the area.
[00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:11.340]   Yeah, well.
[00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:12.340]   Thanks, Scott.
[00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:14.740]   We never really figured that part out, Scott.
[00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:16.640]   Not only do I have you on camera,
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.840]   but I've got your aspect ratio stretch.
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.480]   So you look like you're about 800 pounds.
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.080]   Well, and I appreciate that, because you know,
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.380]   I need all the help I can get that way.
[00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:27.380]   Yeah, right.
[00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.180]   Mr. Skinny wasting away.
[00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:34.020]   So how do cut and paste work?
[00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.460]   It really sounds like it works just like Kevin Rose,
[00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:37.320]   kind of said it would.
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.060]   Double tap a word, and you can drag
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.160]   little selectors across different text,
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.900]   and then it will pop up a copy paste,
[00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:47.400]   pop up that you can select.
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:50.740]   Does the magnifying glass come into effect?
[00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:53.140]   I don't see that in any of the pictures at all.
[00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:54.340]   Oh, yeah, I see.
[00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.640]   We're like the use to holding the finger over there.
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.740]   Yeah.
[00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:59.240]   If you want to fine tune your selection,
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.280]   it works the same way as it does in any other apps.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:06.580]   So you tap, hold, then double tap.
[00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:07.320]   No.
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:11.080]   Pretty soon you're going to have to be so dexterous
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.520]   to operate one of these things on a MacBook Pro
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.820]   that you're going to know like seven forms of sign language
[00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.420]   just to communicate.
[00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:18.520]   It's getting a little complicated.
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.300]   You know, Lonely Sandwich made a great video
[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.200]   two years ago when the iPhone first came out
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.500]   that showed how to do copy and paste,
[00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:28.300]   and this actually looks exactly like his video.
[00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:29.600]   Yeah, yeah, it does.
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.400]   That's pretty funny.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:33.440]   I mean, I guess there's really only one way to do it, right?
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.640]   How else are you going to do it?
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.340]   So that's good.
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.600]   And is it copy and paste across all apps,
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.800]   or how does is there limitations to what it sounds
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.800]   like it's across the entire iPhone?
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.740]   Yeah, I mean, everything works with pictures, too.
[00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:45.940]   Yeah, pictures.
[00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:49.280]   And don't forget you can shake the phone to undo.
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.580]   I like that.
[00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:53.780]   That part is actually quite cool, I think.
[00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.680]   I guess there's no other way to do it.
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:59.220]   I mean, so I don't know what you can face you.
[00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.260]   Undo is shaking the phone.
[00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:02.760]   It's kind of like the Etchisket program,
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.060]   except with Undo.
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.460]   You see all these people sitting on the muni just shaking
[00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:07.860]   their iPhone the same.
[00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.600]   Yeah, shake, shake.
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.600]   I think there's an advert there.
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.400]   Somebody wants to make it.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.000]   Kiki, if you want on Mike, you can sit in that chair right there.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.440]   I just don't have a camera for you.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.140]   You're allowed to be on Mike.
[00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:24.440]   Yeah, you can be on Mike.
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.140]   He's over here.
[00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.340]   Man, I don't know.
[00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:28.240]   It's such a boy.
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:31.180]   It's such a sausage party, but OK.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.180]   We'll let you and we'll get you get sit down.
[00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:35.680]   All right.
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.280]   That's a visual I would have rather not had.
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.180]   I know.
[00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:40.180]   I'm a member of the club.
[00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:42.920]   You remember the club, absolutely.
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:43.520]   There you go.
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:44.720]   You don't even need your power supply.
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.960]   See, we've got special power supplies built in here.
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:52.260]   And the studio, the Clugeo.
[00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260]   I'm going to start calling it Clugeo.
[00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:55.660]   The Clugeo here in the Clugeo.
[00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:58.400]   We provide you with power adapters.
[00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:02.700]   So Kirsten, have you been watching what the announcements have been?
[00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:03.700]   Or no?
[00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:04.700]   You were just driving up.
[00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.540]   So you missed the whole thing.
[00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:08.440]   All right, so just listen and learn.
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.040]   No interaction.
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.840]   Well, we're going to work on that for sure.
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:17.580]   That's something Steve and the Schiller are about to fix.
[00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:21.520]   So pictures, mail, text.
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:22.220]   This is great.
[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:22.980]   Yeah.
[00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:23.920]   And that's just the beginning.
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.720]   How about horizontal--
[00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:29.080]   See, now I don't think they said anything about the horizontal keyboard.
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:32.460]   No, they did say you could do landscape keyboard
[00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:35.860]   across all applications now, including your email, your text message.
[00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:37.160]   Yay, yay, yay, yay, yay.
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:38.060]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:40.360]   And see, and that's almost the part that annoys me
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.700]   is that people do applaud and clap.
[00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:44.600]   There's stuff that they should have had.
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.740]   And it sounds to me like it's a simple toggle switch
[00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:47.900]   in a piece of software.
[00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:49.040]   It really does.
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.640]   Yeah, it's kind of pathetic, actually.
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:52.740]   There's a lot of other--
[00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:54.640]   I mean, some of the other stuff that they put out
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.340]   that I think is pretty important is
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.940]   that you can now embed Google Maps into your applications.
[00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:03.140]   So this is something that before was a little bit
[00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:06.280]   cloozy of being able to try to--
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.280]   you could tell people kind of where it was,
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.480]   but they don't have to send it back to Google Maps.
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.980]   Now Google Maps can be inside of your application.
[00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:16.120]   They've been working with, I guess, Google to make that work.
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.720]   And--
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.720]   There's no turn-by-turn, no, Alex.
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:20.960]   Well, yes and no.
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:21.960]   Yes and no.
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:22.560]   Go ahead.
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:23.960]   Go ahead, Andy.
[00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:26.460]   What I was going to say is it's a yes and no.
[00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:29.000]   They are allowing turn-by-turn directions,
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.660]   but you have to bring your own maps.
[00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:31.700]   So any--
[00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:34.400]   Tom, Tom, wanted to sell an iPhone app that
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.500]   does turn-by-turn directions, spoken directions,
[00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.940]   dynamic rerouting, all this sort of stuff.
[00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:41.040]   Apple has absolutely no problem with that.
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.280]   However, these embedded maps will not
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.640]   be permitted to use that stuff.
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:47.240]   They said it was a licensing issue with Google
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:50.980]   that they don't have permission to use that data pile
[00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:52.220]   for that kind of navigation.
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:55.080]   But Apple says, absolutely cool, Tom, Tom, come.
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:55.680]   Yeah.
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:56.280]   The what?
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:56.780]   What's your question?
[00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:57.780]   The question is application.
[00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:58.520]   Why widened it?
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:14:59.320]   They just go ahead and--
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.660]   I mean, they licensed Google Maps.
[00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:02.860]   Why didn't they just go ahead and license the turn-by-turn?
[00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:03.760]   That's what I wanted to say.
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:04.660]   Well, I'll be honest with you.
[00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:05.560]   I don't think that-- I think that actually this
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.660]   is a feature not a bug, because one of the problems--
[00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:08.460]   I mean, one of the--
[00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:11.900]   I recommended an application a couple of shows
[00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:14.400]   ago, or maybe last show, of--
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.000]   I think there's a huge advantage to having the maps
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.040]   on the iPhone, because you get into situations
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.840]   when you're driving, where you don't know--
[00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:23.700]   the phone knows where you are, but it doesn't know where that is,
[00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.440]   because it can't connect to the internet.
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:30.440]   And so the G-Map, which is the one that I have on my phone,
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.880]   is-- I put a gigabyte or half a gigabyte or whatever
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.980]   of maps, or 750 megs of maps onto my iPhone.
[00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.920]   And I'm happy with giving it that data.
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:40.120]   And that's about what it would be.
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.420]   It'd be about a gigabyte of your iPhone,
[00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:44.620]   and you have the whole US, or all of Europe,
[00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:46.560]   or whatever, on your iPhone.
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.760]   The performance is much, much higher.
[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:52.360]   There's no that waiting for the 3G lawyers to work
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:53.360]   when you're not online.
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.500]   So the thing is that the Google Maps will work.
[00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:56.960]   It's just that it's slow.
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.360]   When you're not online, it won't.
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.560]   Yeah, well, with 3G.
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:00.360]   I mean, it'll download.
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.360]   Well, I meant not online, not online.
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.200]   Oh, right, right, right.
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.600]   Well, Google Apps won't work when you're not online,
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.100]   but it also-- even when you are online,
[00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:09.240]   it's slow and inclusion.
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:13.540]   When you're actually on a trip, it's not a great solution.
[00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:18.580]   So by having the maps built in, I think that's going to be awesome.
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.340]   OK, everybody hold for just a moment.
[00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:22.480]   Welcome, Kiki Sand for Dr. Kiki.
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.540]   Nice to have you here.
[00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:27.680]   Now we have you on Mike so we can hear your dulcet tones.
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:28.980]   Oh, but I have to press report.
[00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:30.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:30.980]   Grew up.
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:32.180]   Hello, Dr. Kiki.
[00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:33.180]   Hello.
[00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:34.680]   Hey, Mr. Leo.
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.180]   Hey.
[00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:39.720]   So we're talking about all the new features in the iPhone.
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.580]   We're going to get to more of those in just a second.
[00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:43.660]   We're also going to--
[00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:44.760]   There is other Mac news.
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.580]   We'll talk a little bit about some of the other Mac news.
[00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:47.180]   It's out there.
[00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:48.580]   It's quite a bit, but first I want to mention
[00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:51.680]   the folks that go to MeetAng.
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.280]   Go to meeting the folks from Citrix
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:56.780]   do this great software that is now Mac compatible.
[00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:58.280]   Actually, it was always been Mac compatible.
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.980]   It's now-- you can start a meeting on the Mac.
[00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:02.680]   You used to be able to join a meeting on a Mac,
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:04.680]   but now you can start a meeting on a Mac,
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:07.380]   which makes it even more wonderful.
[00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:09.380]   Go to meeting is that software you probably
[00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:13.380]   seen now where you don't have to go in person to meet with somebody.
[00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:16.680]   You can be on a conference call and say, "Hey, look, let me show you the PowerPoint
[00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:18.580]   of the slides or the drawings or--"
[00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:20.680]   I'm sorry, the keynote.
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.480]   Did I say PowerPoint?
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:23.380]   Yes, you did.
[00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:25.280]   Yes, shocking, shocking.
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:27.980]   And they just go to go to meeting.com.
[00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:30.680]   They enter in the meeting ID and boom, they're seeing your computer.
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:33.580]   They see your desktop, Mac or Windows.
[00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:34.980]   And they can be using Mac or Windows.
[00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:38.580]   In fact, this is one way that a Mac person could use Windows software
[00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:42.680]   and vice versa because you can give them control of your computer as well.
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.680]   For sales presentations, for product demos, for training, for collaboration,
[00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:46.880]   it's easy to set up.
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.480]   You don't need the IT department.
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:50.080]   It's just a couple of clicks of the mouse.
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:52.180]   In fact, you could do it for free now for the next 30 days.
[00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:55.080]   Go to go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.680]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:00.280]   Try it free for 30 days.
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:02.680]   And I think you'll see why this is so cool.
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:08.180]   And then when you sign up, the good news, one low flat monthly right
[00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:09.780]   for as many meetings as you want, as long as you want.
[00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:12.480]   If you've tried the other guys, give it up.
[00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:14.480]   This is so much easier.
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:17.180]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:22.480]   We thank them so much from Citrix for their support of Macbreak Weekly.
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:25.980]   So one of the things they did, which was kind of interesting,
[00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:30.080]   is they've got push notification working.
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:30.680]   Or did they?
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:37.580]   Is this-- now, we have push for Yahoo mail right now and voicemail.
[00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:41.080]   Is this push for more than just those two applications?
[00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:42.680]   Is that the idea, Andy?
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:45.680]   The idea is that the architecture that they promised last year
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.080]   is now actually going to happen.
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:47.780]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:49.580]   They did an answer this last year.
[00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:52.480]   Again, one of those things where-- remember that thing that we told you
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.080]   it was happening?
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:53.980]   That didn't happen?
[00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:54.680]   Well, it's happening.
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:55.680]   It's happening.
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:00.280]   And they also provided with virtual charts and graphs explaining why they weren't--
[00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:04.980]   it's more or less their apology for not doing background applications.
[00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:07.780]   They claimed that they did a couple of sample apps
[00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:09.780]   that would use background processes.
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:11.580]   Like a background chat app.
[00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:14.580]   And they were shock dismayed and disappointed and depressed
[00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:17.280]   by the hit that the battery took by virtue of the fact
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:21.080]   that if this application is remaining active and still pulling CPU cycles
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.680]   when the phone is just in your pocket doing nothing,
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:29.380]   they were saying things like cut the standby-- cut the live time by about 80%
[00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:34.280]   were asked running an iChat sort of application via push,
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.480]   cut that down to maybe 10 or 15%.
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.480]   But it never worked.
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.080]   And now it will work.
[00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:40.180]   Now it will work.
[00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:45.580]   The explanation that they had given was that they weren't prepared
[00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:48.480]   for how quickly the app store would explode.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:52.180]   And for the variety of applications that was going to be demanded by a push service.
[00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:56.380]   So they basically figured if we're not able to really support the load
[00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:59.080]   of all these apps calling on push services,
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.380]   then we should actually just pull the plug on that until we--
[00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:02.680]   we-- be focused on that.
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:03.980]   OK.
[00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:07.680]   That must be frustrating to people who created apps with push services.
[00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:10.180]   And now they're first off the door.
[00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:14.680]   And the other thing is it's really disappointing that it didn't come sooner
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:19.180]   because that was to me one of the things that really was cool about that announcement
[00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:20.780]   is the ability to extend that.
[00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:24.180]   But now that you have this announcement which says we can use Bluetooth
[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.780]   to communicate with external devices and you've got push,
[00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:30.280]   now we might actually see the realization of some of these apps
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:35.280]   that I think could make the iPhone a real tool for even the enterprise.
[00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:42.280]   And it's interesting to note that they use push as you guys already said
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:44.580]   to make up for the fact they don't do background apps.
[00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:48.280]   So they use the example of a chat program where when you go to the home screen
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.280]   you're essentially closing out of the chat program,
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:54.280]   somehow the application still stays connected with the Apple Push service.
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:57.280]   And so when you get a new instant message then apparently,
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:01.280]   it lets the Apple Push service know that then sends a message to your iPhone.
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:04.480]   So that's actually different than what they had announced because last time
[00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:08.480]   you'd be disconnected but the server on the Apple side would kind of keep track
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:11.480]   of things then when you reconnect it it would dump all that into you.
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:15.480]   So you're saying it's going to continue to push even while you're not running.
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.480]   The demo application, go ahead.
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:23.480]   No, the demo application they showed was where it was rebadging a application
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.480]   in the springboard app.
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:27.480]   Basically, the Lertrude that hey there are things going on.
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:31.480]   I think they showed an ESPN sports application that showed you that oh,
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.480]   by the way that game that you were interested in has now gotten to over it.
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.580]   So maybe you want to tap this and start watching TV.
[00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:41.380]   So finally they can get the actual temperature and the weather icon for instance.
[00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:42.380]   Or something like that.
[00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:45.380]   Once again, the $300 solution to avoid looking up the window.
[00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:46.380]   [laughter]
[00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:48.380]   How would it be your best?
[00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:50.380]   Who needs to look at the window?
[00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:54.380]   Not just $300 but also millions of dollars in infrastructure.
[00:21:54.380 --> 00:22:00.380]   So one of the things I think that I know as someone who is seriously getting
[00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:02.380]   into iPhone development right now,
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.980]   are you hiring developers to do this?
[00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:08.380]   Some of the guys that already developed some of our software is working on a bunch of stuff
[00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:10.380]   that we're hoping to be able to show off in April or May.
[00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:11.380]   Cool.
[00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:15.380]   And it's mostly stuff for the video industry but I'm looking at all kinds of things
[00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:17.380]   because I use my iPhone for lots of different things.
[00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:23.380]   But one of the things that I think is pretty exciting also is this idea of developers being able to
[00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:27.380]   charge for things on going from within the application.
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:32.980]   So this is not for free application so you can't get a demo and then have to pay to go up.
[00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:34.980]   It can't be kind of a bait and switch.
[00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:38.380]   But if you pay for something you could buy levels one through ten.
[00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:45.380]   This is what they showed on this is if you want to buy levels 11 through 20 you could pay another
[00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:47.380]   hundred or the hundred ninety one ninety nine.
[00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:49.380]   [laughter]
[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:51.380]   But this would allow for subscriptions.
[00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:54.380]   New content, additional levels.
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:59.980]   If you want to, for instance, have an ongoing training program like I might,
[00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:05.980]   you would be able to have people pay on going for that item.
[00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:09.480]   I think it's a pretty cool, I think it's going to open up a lot of opportunities.
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:13.980]   It's a very, very big deal because this is the first time Apple has explicitly said,
[00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:17.980]   "Everybody, publishers, please turn our iPhone into a book reading device."
[00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:23.980]   Because you know that as newspapers and magazines are increasingly agitated to find new revenue streams,
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:26.580]   we're going to see a new version of the New York Times application.
[00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:31.380]   We're also going to see an Atlantic monthly application where you, Wall Street Journal,
[00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:35.080]   all these things that are already subscription based, things that are already on the Kindle store
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:40.080]   publications that you have to pay for where you can pay, let's call it a nominal ninety nine cents
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:43.980]   to get today's copy of the Wall Street Journal on your iPhone.
[00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:48.980]   And every additional copy you can either pay as you go for ninety nine cents just by tapping a button right on your iPhone
[00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:51.780]   or you could sign up for, "Well, you know what? I've liked it for the past three days.
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:55.580]   Give me a whole week or no. The week's gone great. Give me another month. No, give me another year."
[00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:59.380]   And I think that one of the things that's important here is that now while some people will say that this is,
[00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:03.280]   it's a great business for Apple too. All of the e-commerce goes, still goes through Apple.
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:05.580]   So Apple's still pulling 30% of every sale.
[00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:11.980]   What makes that great though for some developers that are getting started is they don't have the e-commerce capabilities.
[00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:16.280]   They don't have the stuff. They don't want to set that stuff up by simply being accepted into the Apple store,
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:21.380]   having that stuff working. And one thing Apple said is ninety six percent of every application is approved,
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:25.880]   you know, going into the Apple store. But by getting your applications into the Apple store,
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:30.980]   you no longer have to think about it. You get a monthly check based on what you put in.
[00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:35.780]   Now, I imagine some of the larger companies like the New York Times or whatever may negotiate a different percentage.
[00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:37.880]   But I think for an average person... You can count on it.
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:39.380]   Yeah, I mean, you can count.
[00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:41.380]   They'll go, "We want to give you five or ten percent."
[00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:48.880]   And I think as a starting developer, being able to not have to think about any of that and have a platform that you can develop to
[00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:51.580]   and then just get a check is a pretty great thing.
[00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:55.480]   I know when we were getting started, that would have been huge.
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:25:03.780]   Yeah. I mean, I'm running a column right now that basically says that if newspapers and magazines want to survive on the web,
[00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:06.280]   they need to abandon the web because the web has to be free.
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:08.880]   There's no way you can really charge for content to make that work.
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:16.880]   But a system like this where another company is handling the DRM for you and also taking a lot of the heat for DRM and taking that off your hands.
[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:19.880]   This is really where all these publications, I think, are going to move.
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:22.880]   Whether it's Kindle DRM, whether it's iPhone DRM or both.
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.880]   I think this is really where things are headed.
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.480]   This is a really big jump forward.
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:32.280]   Yeah. And being able to stream video, which is something else that they showed, I mean, this opens up huge opportunities for,
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:34.480]   and I think they had ESPN showing some of the stuff here.
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:42.480]   But imagine being able to subscribe to some basketball game or something or pay a pay-per-view or whatever going through your iPhone.
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:45.080]   It is... It's huge.
[00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:47.180]   The mix is in our chatroom.
[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:50.280]   Hey, I like these guys. I like this show, but this just sounds like an Apple apology.
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:52.680]   Why didn't Apple do this long ago?
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.680]   Well, they didn't go.
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.280]   Well, you know, they didn't have to.
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:59.080]   And secondly, because there's other things for people to complain about.
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:03.680]   I received 200 tweets saying still doesn't have voice dialing, still doesn't give you a massage,
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:06.180]   still doesn't do any quantitative algebra.
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:07.080]   Where's my pony?
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:08.180]   Yeah.
[00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:09.180]   There are like...
[00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:09.680]   Doesn't matter.
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:13.180]   Listen, it just absolutely didn't matter what Apple said.
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:17.180]   There's going to be a certain segment that we're going to come out and speak plenty against it.
[00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:19.980]   But we all know there's no perfect phone, period.
[00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:21.680]   Nobody will ever make one.
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.180]   There's a perfect phone for you.
[00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:24.580]   There's a perfect phone for Andy.
[00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:25.980]   There's a perfect phone for me.
[00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:27.680]   But there's not a perfect phone.
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:31.080]   I frankly couldn't care less about half of this stuff.
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:36.680]   What I do wish they would have done was voice dialing because I primarily use the iPhone.
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:37.580]   Wait for it.
[00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:38.580]   As a telephone.
[00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:39.580]   Yeah.
[00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:40.880]   You know, you're...
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:41.480]   Well, you're...
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:42.080]   I mean, you're just...
[00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:43.180]   I know.
[00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:43.880]   I know.
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:45.580]   I mean, I took the phone and...
[00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:48.580]   The iPhone, most of the word is phone.
[00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:50.980]   And, you know, I would love to have voice dialing.
[00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:54.080]   I had that on my absolute piece-o-crap.
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:54.780]   Yeah.
[00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:57.080]   Trio that I threw into San Francisco Bay.
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:58.080]   Yeah.
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.380]   What the...
[00:26:59.380 --> 00:26:59.980]   I think...
[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:00.580]   Say something.
[00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:01.380]   Say something, Kiki.
[00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:02.680]   I heard you take a breath.
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:03.580]   I know, I'm like...
[00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:06.880]   You just jump in with these guys and just a bunch of loud mouths.
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:10.480]   Well, I mean, the way I see it is that the iPhone and any other phone,
[00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:14.380]   if you're not going to come out with the ultimate end-all be-all product
[00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:17.980]   as your first release, even if you know exactly what your...
[00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:21.680]   what your target audience or your target market wants,
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:25.180]   you're still going to give them a little less because the next version,
[00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:26.980]   then you have something to build up to.
[00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:33.180]   And then as the technology grows, you're ahead of the game in terms of getting something out to the public.
[00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:34.680]   And the public is always looking for...
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:36.980]   I mean, the tech...
[00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:38.980]   The tech mind, you know, the guy...
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:43.680]   It's the guy who wants the best new technology on the market.
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:44.980]   And there always go...
[00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:48.580]   There's always money to be thrown down on a new phone.
[00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:52.280]   I think that one of the things that is going on here is that...
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:54.880]   As someone who develops software,
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:58.280]   you also just don't know what people are going to want until you put it out there and then you go,
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:02.280]   "Oh, and then immediately you know, "Oh, this didn't work, and we should have done this, and we should have done that."
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:04.480]   And the thing is, is you don't want to make all those assumptions.
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:07.980]   We've made assumptions in some of our applications based on how we use it.
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:12.680]   Internally, and then people don't understand how to use it because we were in our own little world for too long.
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:16.880]   And so by having people react to it and look at it, it has been a few years.
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.980]   It's been a long time.
[00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:26.580]   And also, I mean, there are other places in the world where telephones, where mobile devices are more advanced than they are here.
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:29.580]   And that's basically like everywhere.
[00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:30.780]   So why...
[00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:37.980]   I mean, I would be shocked to hear that Apple has not been paying attention to what other markets are really going for.
[00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:42.580]   And that they don't already know what the youth or the business community wants.
[00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:43.380]   I would be shocked.
[00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:49.480]   But I think that also, I think Facebook is a good example of a company that when you get a lot of people going in some certain direction
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:54.180]   and you put a lot of stuff out there and then you try to change it, like they're changing some of the interface stuff now.
[00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:54.780]   And people are...
[00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:55.480]   Lots and they...
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:59.480]   So the thing is, there is an advantage to moving slow and laboriously.
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:03.380]   You know, towards, you know, thinking of really thinking it all out and then adding a couple more pieces
[00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:05.480]   and then really thinking it out and adding a couple more pieces
[00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:08.280]   and not allowing people to get used to something that you don't want...
[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:10.780]   that isn't necessarily good for you later.
[00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:14.480]   And you have to kind of think those processes out and I think that that was part of the thinking here.
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:17.080]   Do you think Cut and Paste was really that hard to do and that's why they didn't do it?
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:19.580]   It sounds like it was a security issue. I think that it should have been done.
[00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:21.380]   I think it should have come out...
[00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:22.080]   Number...
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.880]   I mean, it should have come out in version 1.0.
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:27.880]   I mean, that's the only thing for me that was just this glaring "Can't Believe".
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:30.980]   I mean, every time I didn't... I couldn't cut and paste, which was like a day or...
[00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:34.180]   once or twice a day, I'd be like, "I cannot believe this isn't here."
[00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:36.780]   Well, I don't know.
[00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:39.380]   Maybe because stuff on the clipboard, then I don't know.
[00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:42.580]   Like if you're trying to cut and paste JavaScript into some places, it shouldn't go.
[00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:43.880]   Yeah, it doesn't seem like a security issue.
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:47.180]   Yeah, I'm guessing it's an inter-application security issue.
[00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:49.580]   But if you're not running background apps, I really don't see.
[00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:50.180]   Yeah.
[00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:56.680]   Oh, like maybe if you email yourself a piece of malware that's JavaScript and then paste it into...
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:57.780]   (laughter)
[00:29:57.780 --> 00:29:58.880]   I'd be quite serious.
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:02.780]   Then paste it into the address bar of Safari, it could execute something, I'm guessing.
[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:05.580]   I can't believe that that's what they worried about.
[00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:07.280]   I don't know, I'm trying to figure that out.
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:07.980]   I'm going to make it...
[00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:08.780]   I'm going to hazard a guess.
[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:09.580]   They're saying it's security.
[00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:13.180]   I'm going to hazard a guess that it's actually ugly.
[00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:15.180]   And they couldn't take any way to do it.
[00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:16.380]   That wasn't ugly.
[00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:21.180]   I think that's more correct because there's way too many button pushes or screen touches involved in it.
[00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:22.980]   And they just didn't want to do it.
[00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:25.180]   Steve didn't want to do it because it was ugly.
[00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:29.380]   Well, it's also possible that... I mean, touching on something that Kiki said earlier,
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:34.680]   but Apple is really, really smart and saying we're not going to put out everything with version 1.0
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:39.180]   and give everyone all these little itsy bitsy reasons not to like our iPhone
[00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:43.980]   or one little bug that gives everybody the Newton message pad effect of,
[00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:47.280]   well, the handwriting doesn't work well, so we're going to trash the whole thing.
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:51.680]   I think they're smart enough to say, "Let's swing for the fences with 1.0.
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:54.280]   Let's make sure we can really, really hit that target.
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:57.280]   If it means deleting some features that seem obvious with 1.0
[00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:59.780]   saving it for next year, then that's what we ought to do."
[00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:05.780]   Could be that they just knew what appeared to be and what turned out to be true.
[00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:08.180]   They just knew they could sell a boatload of them with that.
[00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:11.180]   Sell it as a $10 rep.
[00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:17.480]   I'm still waiting for the phone to be able to do be my mobile journalism device.
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:23.180]   As soon as I can shoot high quality video, instead of having to have a flip and an iPhone,
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:30.380]   I want one phone that is easy to type on so that I can enter any kind of blog or chat
[00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:34.780]   or article that I might be writing plus video plus photos.
[00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:37.580]   I want my mobile journalism device.
[00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:38.280]   That's what I want.
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:39.680]   And then I will invest in it.
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:44.080]   Until it happens, the iPhone is still subpar in my mind.
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:45.580]   You don't use an iPhone?
[00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:46.480]   I refuse.
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:47.780]   She's holding up.
[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:50.480]   My wife is clinging to her razor.
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:53.380]   She's got this Motorola razor that she will not give up.
[00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:57.380]   And when I watch Malachi, my son walk around and pound things with it, I don't stop him.
[00:31:57.380 --> 00:31:59.980]   I just, I just figure, you know, I just watch it.
[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:00.780]   Break it, boy.
[00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:01.980]   I just like, good boy.
[00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:06.080]   He uses it as a drumstick and I'm just like, I'm just like, eventually it'll die.
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:08.080]   She's like, you know, my icons don't pop up right correctly.
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:09.680]   And I'm like, well, you know, it's getting old.
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:15.280]   For me to go past will be how much of this stuff can be implemented without screwing it up.
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:16.480]   Yeah.
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:24.380]   You know, I have to say, I know it's going to sound like an apple apologist, but as many flaws as it has, I still think this is, well, Scott said this too.
[00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:26.580]   This is kind of the best platform out there and I would not.
[00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:30.580]   I keep trying other fun to replace the iPhone hoping there'll be another one.
[00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:35.880]   Maybe is this how much of this is in response to the fact that the pre is going to be out in the next couple of months right around June.
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:36.780]   I don't think it's a response.
[00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:46.580]   I think that I think this is really like, you know, Apple's been working on this and then they come out with it, you know, and I think that the issue is is there's a lot of other phones with a lot of better, you know, a lot of features that are better than what Apple is pre-built.
[00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:47.580]   Providing on the iPhone.
[00:32:47.580 --> 00:33:11.180]   But as a unified experience, as with all the features, with the App Store, with the iTunes music store, with all those pieces, it is so far ahead, everyone else that they don't have to, you know, be putting out a new version every month because they are, there's a lot of catch up for people to do to get it all right not to get a couple features that Apple doesn't have, but to get everything working this way is still a big deal.
[00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:13.680]   Well,
[00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:17.180]   it's still pretty. But you can see in Austin as in everybody has one.
[00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:17.780]   Yeah.
[00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:24.780]   We're going to get to some other stories, including the fact that at South by Southwest, you couldn't use your iPhone because everybody was there.
[00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:27.080]   They finally solved that.
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:30.280]   I also want to talk a little bit about we talked about it a lot on Twitch.
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:41.680]   So I want to update the story about the so-called DRM chip that's built into the new iPod shuffle and more about the iPhone 3.0 because there's a lot more to talk about there.
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.780]   So before we do that, I just want to quickly mention we have a new sponsor on the show.
[00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:46.180]   I've mentioned it a couple of times now.
[00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:53.180]   I just want to remind you if it's time to set up a new website to think about squarespace.com.
[00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:55.280]   It's a, I don't want to say a blogging platform.
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:56.880]   It's really a web platform.
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.480]   Yeah, it's a great blogging platform.
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:07.480]   It'll import your blog if you already have one from WordPress or TypePad or blogger instantly, by the way, import and export.
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:16.180]   So if you want to try this free two week trial, you could try it fully, you know, and get a sense of it without any risk at all because in and out.
[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:20.880]   It's come so far in a year or two because I, you looked at it a year ago.
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:21.880]   See, I never saw it.
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:23.680]   And I was like, and what happened was actually I got so excited.
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:28.480]   I decided I wanted to do way more than I was like, I can run the whole Pixelcore on this thing and then I couldn't quite do that.
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:33.480]   And, but we are now about to push a bunch of our, I'm going to probably put my blog up there.
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:37.780]   We're going to push a bunch of it is seamless to just throw something up there.
[00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:38.580]   Make adjustments.
[00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:40.280]   It's Whizziwig for a lot of the stuff.
[00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.180]   That's really the design template.
[00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:44.080]   You can, oh, you know about too, Kirsten?
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:47.080]   The design template you can drag, you know, draw stuff.
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:55.580]   We've been testing it since I found out they were a sponsor and I will say that the form and data collection stuff, if far supersedes what is available anywhere else.
[00:34:55.580 --> 00:35:00.980]   And, you know, I've been paying people to write that stuff and now I can just drop in a little deal and it works.
[00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:02.080]   Very cool stuff.
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:10.580]   I just want people to try it. You can try it free by going to squarespace.com/macbreak a free two week trial just to see what's going on.
[00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:17.080]   Also, if you sign up at squarespace.com/macbreak you get 10% off any of the plans.
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:19.880]   It isn't a free blogging system like WordPress.
[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:22.380]   I don't want to give you the mishap re-henction that it is.
[00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:23.480]   It's hosted blogging.
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:27.780]   They hosted with very sophisticated, very scalable hosting.
[00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:30.380]   You don't have to worry about getting dug or slashed out of it with this thing.
[00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:32.380]   This will handle anything you could throw at it.
[00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:35.780]   But because they hosted you don't have to worry about all these issues.
[00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:39.980]   Believe me, I spent a lot of time late at night worrying about my servers.
[00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:41.780]   This is, you don't worry about that.
[00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:43.580]   You can incrementally pay more per month.
[00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:46.680]   I mean, so if you decide, oh, I now I have more than 250 users.
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:49.580]   Well, I'll pay another $10 a month to be able to support that.
[00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:51.980]   Start very affordably and move your way up as you want.
[00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:53.480]   But I think this is a great solution.
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:56.680]   And you can have, yes, you can have your custom domain name and so forth.
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:58.680]   squarespace.com/macbreak.
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:04.280]   We welcome them to the Macbreak and Twit family and we thank them so much for their support.
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:09.280]   squarespace.com/macbreak.
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:15.680]   Yeah, we saw the howls of horror from South by Southwest on Twitter.
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:18.680]   Although not as many as you might have because nobody could use their iPhones.
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:21.680]   I saw one person said, thank God I brought my G1.
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:26.080]   AT&T was just swamped because everybody in a place like that's going to have an iPhone.
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:29.680]   Yeah, I heard it was that girl that did the interview with the Facebook guy.
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:32.080]   She made sure that nobody could get on the iPhone.
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:34.880]   Sarah Lacey didn't want any bad comments this time around.
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:39.480]   I don't think Sarah was hosting any panels this with this this year.
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:42.080]   I'm pretty sure she appointed the state of Texas.
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:42.680]   It's a big event.
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:43.480]   I wish I'd been there.
[00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:47.680]   It sounds like it was a lot of fun and maybe maybe people couldn't use their iPhones,
[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:50.280]   but there sure was enough tweeting about South by Southwest.
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:52.880]   You could barely use Twitter for the last few days.
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:59.880]   AT&T did come in with some portable cell towers a day or two later and beefed up the connectivity there,
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:02.680]   but it was just it was just a mess.
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:08.680]   Also, the other story I wanted to mention real briefly, but because we did mention it on Twitch,
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:15.480]   I want to I guess clarify and I actually like your guys intake input on this rather.
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:16.480]   We had seen a story.
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:23.280]   In fact, we saw it from the Electronic Frontier Foundation that there was a new DRM chip in the new iPod shuffle
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:29.080]   that would keep anybody from creating a compatible headphone system.
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:34.080]   You know, the iPod shuffle requires headphones with controls on it or you've got no controls at all.
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:35.480]   That's where the controls live.
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:38.280]   Instead of making a little dongle that you could put any headphones into,
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:41.280]   Apple decided not to do that, but to ship headphones with it.
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:47.080]   A third party that wants to make headphones it looked like would have to get Apple's permission,
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:49.880]   perhaps pay a license fee because of this chip.
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:54.080]   Now Apple is saying, no, it's not DRM.
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:58.080]   It's just so that we can do this certification built for.
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:00.880]   Yes, he sounds like the same thing to me, but maybe I'm stupid.
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:08.880]   They're about the user experience because a lot of people are buying headphones that the impedance of the copper is a lower grade.
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:12.280]   What the heck is that all about?
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:14.680]   So it sounds like it's not a DRM chip anymore.
[00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:17.080]   It's just like an encoding chip.
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:18.280]   They said there's no DRM.
[00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:23.080]   There's no DMCA risk involved if you want to reverse engineer it or anything like that.
[00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:24.480]   So there really is.
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:28.680]   So they can get a made made for iPod shuffle icon on it.
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:30.680]   Boymoying gadgets discovered this chip.
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:35.880]   I have to announce the chip, of course, and there was considerable speculation about a licensing fee.
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:38.680]   Mac world contacted an Apple spokesman about the matter.
[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:40.880]   The spokesman confirmed the existence of the chip.
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:46.280]   It said they said it's intended purposes to be related to the made for iPod program alone.
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:51.080]   I'm blowing my gadgets then called says just spoke with Apple.
[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:53.880]   There is no encryption or authentication on the chip.
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:56.680]   So it wouldn't be against a lot of clone.
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:39:04.280]   So this is this is a this gets, I think, to the point where you plug your iPhone in and it says this this application.
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:07.080]   Not made this hardware is not made for the iPhone or not.
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:08.880]   Is that is that we're talking about here?
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:11.480]   Yeah, except I think that the upshot of it is the same.
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:12.880]   You can clone it legally.
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:14.880]   You don't have to worry about a DMCA violation.
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:19.080]   However, you could be sure Apple's not going to promote it sell it in any way.
[00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:19.280]   Right.
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:21.680]   You know, I mean, they can't sue you over it.
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:22.080]   Right.
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:26.480]   But already, I mean, anybody who's a big manufacturer, you know, Griffin's going to play.
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:29.080]   Ball you're going to want to because you want to be in the Apple store.
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:29.680]   Yeah, sure.
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:30.480]   It's going to play ball.
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:31.480]   All these companies are going to play ball.
[00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:33.880]   So I don't know who will clone this.
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:35.480]   I don't even know how hard it would be to clone it.
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:40.280]   So OK, there's that there's a full story right there.
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:41.880]   I still think it's pretty reprehensible.
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:46.680]   If you ask me, I mean, I just don't like the fact that basically you have to buy another Apple adapter.
[00:39:46.680 --> 00:40:00.080]   And if you want to use any of your headphones now, you know, I bought had I bought some really expensive headphones from the Apple store specifically, not because I, you know, they were only available there, but I bought them there for the iPods and iPhones that I have now.
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:03.480]   And when I bought the first iPhone, I had to buy an adapter to use my headphones.
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:07.480]   And now if I want to buy an iPod shuffle, I have to buy another adapter to use headphones.
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:08.280]   My mind is...
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:15.680]   I think what they should do is discharge enough money for the phone that they can, you know, cover this kind of stuff and not make you go through this.
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:18.280]   I understand wanting to protect their business interests.
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:19.080]   Everybody does.
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:22.480]   But I don't understand doing it this way just because it tastes bad.
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:22.980]   Yeah.
[00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:29.880]   Well, I think that these existing ones, like for instance, what I'd be curious about if there's not authentication, like, will this all...
[00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:32.080]   These ultimate ears that have a button on them.
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:35.480]   So what we're saying is they won't work or they won't show up as made for iPhone.
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:37.280]   I don't know. Will you buy one of those shuffles and tell us?
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:38.080]   I'll find out.
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.680]   There's one I wasn't going to buy and I might have to go ahead.
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:42.080]   Get a bacon buy one of those.
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:44.080]   It does work in the shuffle.
[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:46.680]   You can plug in any pair of headphones you want.
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:50.680]   The problem is that all the operational controls are there on the cord.
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:52.680]   What happens is that'll just simply power on.
[00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:57.080]   It'll play through your playlists either in alphabetical order or shuffle order, depending on the mode switch and that's it.
[00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:57.680]   Did you buy one?
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:00.880]   You've got to be happy with whatever volume it's set at.
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:04.480]   I'm just agreeing with the idea with how it works.
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:07.080]   I know people who have the shuffle and...
[00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:10.080]   The new shuffle? The Trident shuffle?
[00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:13.080]   No, the older, the previous incarnation.
[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:13.680]   Yeah.
[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:14.680]   Same idea.
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:17.080]   I think it's funny that the new shuffle looks...
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:21.280]   Because it's almost exactly like the one on the Saturday Night Live Skit where Steve Chino was on.
[00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:22.280]   Yeah.
[00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:25.080]   Yes, the iPod.
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:26.280]   But, Kino!
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:28.880]   I like the fact that I now have a tight clip.
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:31.680]   I was going to go buy one because I needed one for something.
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:32.680]   It's a perfect tight clip, isn't it?
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:33.680]   Oh, got a tight clip.
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:34.680]   It's a perfect tight clip.
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:35.280]   Yeah.
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:37.280]   If you don't mind having headphones coming out of your tight clip.
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:38.280]   Well, there's that.
[00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:39.880]   That might be a benefit, right?
[00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:40.880]   I'll only be able to do it.
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:40.880]   Blue tooth.
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:41.880]   Are you perfect?
[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:42.880]   Yes.
[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:43.880]   So...
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:44.880]   Well, you...
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:45.480]   Good.
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:46.880]   No, no, you please, I...
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:49.280]   No, no, no, I was going to make a snide comment.
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:50.280]   Oh, all right.
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:54.880]   I didn't want to bring the level of this conversation down with a cheap snide comment.
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:56.880]   I think you'd be bringing it up, actually.
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:57.880]   But, okay.
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:58.880]   I want to buy...
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:00.880]   You know, I kind of want to buy one of these.
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:01.880]   I don't know.
[00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:02.880]   I just...
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:03.880]   I feel I might swallow it by accent.
[00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:05.880]   It is cool.
[00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:08.880]   I mean, when you think of...
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:12.560]   If this was the only iPod they made, I mean, it really is the epitome of Whiskey Tango
[00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:14.280]   Foxtrot design.
[00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:19.400]   But as for what the shuffle has always been for, which is the thing that you wear while
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:24.280]   you're jogging, while you're on the Stairmaster, while you're on the bike, it really does make
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:26.000]   a lot of sense.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.480]   Apple was nice enough to throw my original shuffle review back at me during my briefing
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:34.680]   on Thursday or Friday and say, "Well, Andy, it seems as though with the initial shuffle,
[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:37.720]   you were disappointed that you couldn't have multiple playlists.
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:39.680]   We seem to have addressed that."
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:43.400]   And they were actually very, very...
[00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:45.080]   They're being funny about it.
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:48.200]   But I mean, it did help to bring to mind that there...
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:54.560]   It's a cheap way of bringing features into the $79 iPod without stealing sales away from
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:56.040]   the iPod Nano.
[00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:57.040]   And like...
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:00.240]   Don't forget, Apple calls this a fashion tech accessory.
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:02.040]   Well, that's what it is.
[00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:03.040]   Oh, my God.
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:05.880]   They realize it's not just a music player.
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:07.600]   It's a fashion accessory.
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:08.600]   That's on their website.
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:09.600]   It looks just like the...
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:12.760]   By the rainbow of colors available for it.
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:13.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:15.560]   What was the movie?
[00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:16.560]   Yeah.
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:18.560]   Oh, Austin Power?
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:19.560]   No, no, no.
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:20.560]   Zoolander.
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:21.560]   Zoolander.
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:22.560]   The world's smallest selling card.
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:24.560]   Mine is smarter than you.
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:25.560]   Yeah, it does look like that.
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:27.040]   You have the smallest iPod.
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:31.480]   I do agree that it would get lost in the bottom of my purse and my backpack and then
[00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:33.480]   eventually be eaten by my cat.
[00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:39.520]   I think it's destined to be the most widely laundered music player in the industry.
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:43.600]   Do you think they have special ceiling gas?
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:48.320]   I think they know boys, we're going to sell four to every person within the person.
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:49.320]   They're cheap.
[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:52.120]   Five four.
[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:55.560]   Before we get to our picks, I just want to see if there's anything else more to say about
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:56.760]   the iPhone availability.
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:59.680]   Let's just go through the availability.
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:03.680]   They're going to be 15 more countries in addition to the 62.
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:05.560]   So that's 77 countries.
[00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:11.120]   iPhone 3.0 will ship this summer free to existing 3G customers.
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:12.440]   That's good news.
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:13.880]   That's really good news.
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:19.320]   And even, Scott Born, the original iPhones can use it.
[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:22.680]   So you will be able to upgrade to 3.0 as well.
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:27.120]   Well, I'm going to upgrade when the new phone comes out in June as per my prediction.
[00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:30.600]   Now they said that not all features will be available to the original iPhone like Stereo
[00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:34.600]   Bluetooth, but maybe Stereo Bluetooth will be available on the 3G.
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:37.920]   I'd spend something that's bugging the heck out of me for some time is that I can't use
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:39.760]   my A2DP headphones.
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:42.080]   I actually heard you say that about 20 times.
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:43.080]   So I believe you.
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:47.600]   But isn't that symbolic of a lot of these new features?
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:51.760]   Some people are just devastated and befuddled that these features don't exist.
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:56.280]   And yet I have never in my life understood the attraction of Bluetooth headphones because
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:57.320]   you know what?
[00:44:57.320 --> 00:45:02.080]   I'm not in the best of shape, but I can deal with two feet of copper.
[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:03.760]   That's not too much for me to carry.
[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:05.840]   The idea of having a wireless connection between here.
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:08.520]   I don't like anything wireless that close to my ears.
[00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:10.520]   You my friends do not snowboard.
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:16.760]   Yeah, you know, I saw your YouTube video of you kicking that 320 Ollie buckets and back
[00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:17.760]   of sugarbush.
[00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:18.760]   Wow.
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:24.600]   You know, when you're a sportsman like me, you're looking for wireless everywhere you
[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:25.600]   go.
[00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:26.600]   Why you don't know?
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:27.600]   You fall down on the snowboard.
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:30.560]   If you take a major landing, those things go popping out of your ears and they're lost
[00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:31.560]   in the snow.
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:32.560]   So you want to attach by a wire?
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:35.800]   No, I want them embedded in my helmet.
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:36.800]   That's well, no, that's it.
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:37.800]   That's exactly it.
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:38.800]   They're helping.
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:39.800]   They're starting.
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:42.400]   They make eight to DP helmets.
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:43.400]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:44.400]   Nice.
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:45.400]   Or work your stuck our stereo.
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:47.200]   There's a lot of places you could use this.
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:48.200]   Yeah, not necessarily.
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:49.400]   It'll probably help.
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:55.040]   There are some states that actually have wireless hands free laws as opposed to wired.
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:58.320]   So that would be applicable.
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:03.640]   And you know, I think it's cool to have it, but most of these features aren't things that
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:06.360]   have made me say, well, wow, now I buy the phone.
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:08.600]   If I hadn't bought it already, I think they're all...
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:12.880]   I have a friend who the reason she wouldn't buy an iPhone is because she snowboards.
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:15.920]   She has one of those helmets with a Bluetooth, a built-in Bluetooth.
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:16.920]   That was it.
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:19.720]   And until she could do that, it wasn't going to work for her.
[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:20.720]   It was DTN.
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:25.240]   Damn, you Leo, for producing a sensible argument that unveils pictures.
[00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:26.240]   No, no, no.
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:27.240]   It's... but you're right.
[00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:28.240]   It's a niche.
[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:30.240]   And obviously, it's a small enough niche that Apple didn't move quicker on it.
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:35.040]   But what I meant is that there's some features that some people are just absolutely...
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:37.120]   It's a deal breaker for them, for other people that...
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:38.920]   I'm disappointed.
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:46.040]   Well, let's say half-appointed that Apple made mention of tethering mode, saying that, yes,
[00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:47.040]   we definitely want to do that.
[00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:51.680]   Unfortunately, we have to do deals with AT&T and every international service provider.
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:55.480]   So we're not announcing it today, but yes, it's definitely on the horizon because I've
[00:46:55.480 --> 00:47:03.120]   been this close to buying a wireless broadband USB modem for my notebook.
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:06.920]   And I'm like, oh, but the Leo effect, as soon as I buy it, and as soon as I sign the
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:10.080]   two-year contract, they're going to introduce tethering for the iPhone, it's going to be
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:12.000]   like $8 a month.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:17.440]   Well, no, actually, AT&T does have some tethering stuff, but it's $60 a month.
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:18.440]   Right.
[00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:21.040]   Well, even on top of your current data plan.
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:22.040]   Right.
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:23.880]   You're paying for it twice, in fact.
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:24.880]   Yup.
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:29.920]   Okay, so to summarize, there were, they say, a hundred new features.
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:30.920]   But...
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:31.920]   Well, hold on.
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:33.920]   Oh, really important one that we can talk about.
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:34.920]   Spot Lite.
[00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:38.960]   Well, they search, it's got global search across all the applications, right?
[00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:42.120]   Yeah, it is third party apps, integrated apps, everything.
[00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:43.400]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:48.160]   Which I think is, which is one of my favorite parts about, you know, the out of box Mac experience
[00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:52.560]   that you get on a PC, but now it's on the phone.
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:53.560]   Cool.
[00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:55.400]   So we got A2DP Bluetooth.
[00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:56.400]   We've got Spotlight.
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:59.720]   It's got voice memos, which of course, if you had ever know what you could do before,
[00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:06.920]   or a variety of other packages, MMS, picture messaging for Andy said, the housewives want
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:07.920]   that.
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:12.120]   I don't know who wants that landscape keyboard and all key applications, including mail,
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:17.720]   hallelujah, cut copy and paste, hallelujah.
[00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:20.760]   They're going to allow developers to do turn by turn GPS.
[00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:21.760]   Hallelujah.
[00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:22.760]   Hallelujah.
[00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:23.760]   Tom, Tom's happy.
[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:25.240]   Can I get any man with all of you?
[00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:26.920]   Amen, brother.
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:30.680]   Push notification so you don't have to use a background process.
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:31.680]   You'll get notified.
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:32.680]   I think that's cool.
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:34.880]   Third party accessories because they're open to talk.
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:38.560]   I'm curious to see if this new intimate connection between software and hardware means that someone
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:44.360]   can actually come up with an external keyboard for the iPhone because I would be great.
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:48.800]   One of the big reasons why I have that, I have that, that, that netbook is because,
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:53.720]   you know, if the iPhone had three things extra on it, I would not need to have a netbook
[00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:54.720]   with me on that.
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:49:00.000]   At a conference that I think he's going to too in Colorado next month, I need to be able
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.240]   to record podcasts to a quick edit and upload it.
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:06.080]   I need to be able to write and file little things for the web and little columns.
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:09.880]   And that's the reason why I'm preparing this mini notebook just so I don't have to carry
[00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:13.880]   this big honking Macbook Pro with me all day long for morning to night.
[00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:17.200]   And if Apple just had that external keyboard, if they had a couple of quick editors and
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:20.680]   now they have copy and paste, that's another thing that's closer to it, I'm so close to
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:22.520]   being able to leave all that junk behind.
[00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:23.520]   Yep.
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:27.560]   Just think they seem to be having a little multi-channel recorder.
[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:29.920]   You could have like four little XLRs with a little tether on the bottom.
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:33.200]   If somebody makes something like that, the software that looks like that, but they don't
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:34.200]   have the actual input.
[00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:36.480]   Now with the tether, you could record one at a time.
[00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:37.880]   I was thinking with the hardware, you could do it all.
[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:41.360]   You could pop it to the bottom of the iPhone, it could be just like this little, you know,
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:44.680]   it could fan out into like four little things and be nifty.
[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:45.680]   That's pretty.
[00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:50.360]   They did ask about external keyboards via Bluetooth and the Q&A and their response was
[00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:52.520]   nothing to announce at this time.
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:54.520]   So there you go.
[00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:56.720]   They said that's a bit too.
[00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:59.640]   Yeah, it would be nice if the screen was a little bigger.
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:01.080]   I guess to summarize what...
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:02.080]   Oh, shut up.
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:03.080]   Oh, shut up.
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:04.080]   Oh, you stopped.
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:05.080]   Here we go.
[00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:06.320]   Oh, you tease.
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:07.400]   We talked about that last week.
[00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:08.400]   If you missed last week's show.
[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:09.560]   June, June, you think?
[00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:10.560]   Yep.
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:11.560]   At WWDC?
[00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:12.560]   Yes.
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:15.800]   China Times, one of the electronics magazines.
[00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:16.800]   We're building them.
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:20.840]   Said, yeah, Apple bought a bunch of touch screens that are bigger.
[00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:22.840]   Nine and a half, ten inches.
[00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:23.840]   Yo.
[00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:24.840]   What would that be for?
[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:27.480]   I don't know.
[00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:30.120]   The touch means probably another notebook.
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:34.720]   So I think to summarize, I think this is all exactly what everybody said.
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:40.560]   Kevin Rose was right and very good news, making it more of a computer platform than
[00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:43.640]   anything else, more of a usable computer platform.
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:47.960]   And that's really what, you know, we wanted from that.
[00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:51.600]   I think just like the App Store, with these new additions, just when the App Store popped
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:55.440]   out, with these new additions of hardware tethering Bluetooth, and a lot of these other
[00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:58.920]   pieces that they've added, I think we're going to see another explosion of applications
[00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:00.880]   and uses for the iPhone.
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:04.080]   And I think that it's going to pull, you know, it's going to continue to pull the iPhone
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:08.880]   away from all the other phone manufacturers, you know, because when you start looking at
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:13.640]   as an interface for a lot of other things, I think that you stop thinking that I really
[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:14.880]   want to have a keyboard built in.
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:15.880]   I really...
[00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:18.520]   I certainly know if I want to have all that stuff in there, because I'm using this as
[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:21.680]   a visual interface for these other applications.
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:26.080]   And so I think that it, once again, I think the iPhone is going to continue to take a
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:27.080]   lead.
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:28.080]   It's very exciting.
[00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:32.240]   All I can say is I hope that it lasts for more than 15 minutes with all these new features
[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:33.240]   running.
[00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:34.240]   That's right.
[00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:35.240]   They did not...
[00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:36.240]   It's turn off Wi-Fi.
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:37.240]   Battery life.
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:38.240]   That's what I do.
[00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:39.400]   They killed my battery life with 221.
[00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:40.400]   I don't know why.
[00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:41.400]   It was really good with 222.
[00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:42.400]   I just went right back.
[00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:43.400]   I keep my Wi-Fi off.
[00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:44.400]   That's what I just did.
[00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:45.400]   It was a really neat Wi-Fi.
[00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:46.400]   It only lasts for days.
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:47.400]   Yeah, without Wi-Fi.
[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:48.400]   Without Wi-Fi.
[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:49.400]   Yeah.
[00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:50.400]   That's what I just did.
[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:52.280]   I don't use it as a phone either.
[00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:53.280]   I don't...
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:54.280]   Okay, so you don't call with it.
[00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:55.280]   You don't use Wi-Fi with it.
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:56.280]   What do you do?
[00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:57.920]   You play crayon physics.
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:51:58.920]   Exactly.
[00:51:58.920 --> 00:51:59.920]   Exactly.
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:00.920]   It'll last for two days.
[00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:01.920]   I SMS constantly.
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:03.320]   I use it for some email.
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:06.680]   I use it for a lot of the applications that I have there.
[00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:07.880]   And I call when I have to.
[00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:08.880]   But it's not...
[00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:11.400]   I mean, I'm probably on the phone maybe 10 minutes a day.
[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:18.000]   I have to say with the new Google Voice app, SMS, unlimited SMS on the iPhone, just got
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:19.280]   very important.
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:20.280]   I think this...
[00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:23.880]   You know, because it'll text me a message text.
[00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:27.840]   I mean, my iPhone is much more useful thanks to Google Voice.
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:30.640]   So I'm actually not giving out my iPhone phone number anymore.
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:33.880]   I'm giving out the Google Voice number and just using that.
[00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:34.880]   Just fantastic.
[00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:35.880]   Just fantastic.
[00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:36.880]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:38.520]   Come back with your picks, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:39.520]   So get them ready.
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:42.880]   Nikki, you don't have to do a pick unless you've got something that you want to tell the world
[00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:45.800]   about software or hardware that you think is fantabulous.
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:48.360]   I'll give you a minute to think about that, okay?
[00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:50.840]   You're going to play the Japanese theme song now.
[00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:55.760]   You know I'm going to do an audible ad actually, and that's even better.
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:53:02.320]   If you know about audible.com, you know it is my pick for the place to go for the best
[00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:06.080]   deals, or the best books.
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:08.320]   Not just a good deal, but the best books, audio books.
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:10.760]   If you've gone to the bookstore and said, "I'm going to try an audio book and you saw
[00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:15.480]   much of CDs because like 70 or 80 bucks, forget it."
[00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:18.200]   Go to audible.com right now.
[00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:19.200]   Much more affordable.
[00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:23.000]   And when you sign up for one of the Audible subscription plans, even more affordable still.
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:26.480]   I recommend the Gold Plan for light readers, one book a month.
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:30.480]   I happen to be a platinum plan fella because I go through two books a month.
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:34.720]   Go to, if you want to sign up for the Gold Plan and get a free book too, to give yourself
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:37.320]   a chance to use Audible, go to audible.com/adabble.
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:47.960]   And you'll get a chance to hear all the amazing stuff.
[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:51.760]   Just take a pick from one of 51,000 books.
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:53.280]   We like to recommend in our Audible ads.
[00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:54.280]   We like to recommend a book.
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:56.840]   And usually Andy and I've got something great up his sleeve.
[00:53:56.840 --> 00:54:00.040]   Andy, what are you reading these days?
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:04.920]   I just downloaded three days ago a book that's sort of a companion piece to something that
[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:07.520]   I recommended a month or so ago.
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:14.560]   A while ago I recommended Life from New York, which is the story of a bunch of hippies who
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:20.720]   sort of took over TV and took an outdated sort of old person's format and revolutionized
[00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:21.920]   it and that sort of stuff.
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:23.920]   There is another book that's on that same vein.
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:26.800]   Only it's about the creation of Sesame Street.
[00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:31.800]   It's called A Street Gang, The Complete History of Sesame Street by Michael Davis.
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:37.600]   And it is narrated by the voice of Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch.
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:38.600]   Wow.
[00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:43.120]   It's not like listening to a book read by Frank Ours where even when he's talking to you
[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:47.760]   normally, it's Grover and it's Yoda.
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:51.200]   It's distracting for the first 10 minutes because you're really trying to hear Oscar
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:52.200]   the Grouch and the voice.
[00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:54.440]   It's there if you can hear it.
[00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:55.440]   But it really is a great story.
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:55:03.040]   It really is about a bunch of hippies and artists who are like it's like a gang of cats trying
[00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:06.400]   to herd them towards a certain destination.
[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:11.440]   But because there was such a bunch of commitment and passion and basically the idea that look
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:16.800]   the grownups are giving us the keys to the car and the garage and the machine shop for
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:20.800]   building cars, I bet we can do something fairly awesome with this.
[00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:27.040]   It really is a very well told story that gives you a lot of the behind the scenes stuff but
[00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:30.320]   also makes you understand a lot of the people who are involved in it.
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:35.360]   I mean, we know a lot of these people just by virtue that we grew up on the Muppet Show.
[00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:42.240]   But it's nice to see Jim Henson not just as the shaper of dreams and the maker of worlds
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:46.320]   but also as this guy who's trying to keep this team together and trying to get the budget
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:50.400]   together and trying to keep together this idea of revolutionizing children's programming
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:53.920]   and having to deal with people who work for these things called networks and even people
[00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:58.640]   who work for PBS, they're still TV people and so they're still at least a percent DNA reptile.
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:03.200]   Obviously there are a lot of fights involved trying to get that off the beams.
[00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:08.080]   I'm only it's about eight hours long. I'm only about one and a half hours into it
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:13.120]   so I'm still early in the thing. I do anticipate that when we get to the end of the book when
[00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:17.120]   we get to Jim Henson's funeral, I will probably have to pull up on the side of the road and
[00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:22.320]   probably turn me into a quivering wreck. Yes, I had to. But so far it really is a
[00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:29.680]   endlessly entertained book. So the name is again, Street Gang, The Complete History of Sesame Street
[00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:38.160]   by Michael Davis. Wow. And Frank Oz reads it. No, no, so narrated by Carol Spinni who's the voice of
[00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:43.360]   Oscar the Grouch and Big Bird. Oh, why did I think Oz was? Okay. Oscar the Grouch and Big Bird,
[00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:49.360]   Carol Spinni. Wow, that sounds so cool. Well, check it out right now. Go to audible.com/macbreak

[00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:06.640]   put you on the spot, but what he's going to? I'm going to. Did you find something? No, you still
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:10.640]   looking? I got nothing. Yeah, nothing. Good. I was hoping that would be the case. Damn, I was
[00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:16.320]   going to talk about that. I'll find something. I got nothing either. Anybody else? Alex Lindsey,
[00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:22.000]   what have you got? So I have, so we do a lot of compression, as you may have guessed,
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:27.200]   given that we are compressing as far as video compression. And when you buy, you know,
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:30.480]   quick time will do compression for you. I move, we will do some compression for you.
[00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:36.320]   When you move up to Matt Final Cut Pro Studio, you will, you know, comes with a program called
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:42.400]   Compressor that will do compression for you. But one of the things that kind of takes it up a
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:47.120]   notch that we've been using in the office here that we're really excited about is a
[00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:53.760]   program called episode, episode Pro. Now this is not, this is about 1.3, Alex's.
[00:57:53.760 --> 00:58:03.840]   So it's not a, yeah, so you're talking $999 for a compressor that comes free with Final Cut Pro
[00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:10.000]   Studio. So why do we have it? It is a entirely different world when it comes to episode Pro
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:17.120]   for people who are really serious about getting, putting out, you know, if you want to go out to
[00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:20.480]   all the different formats that are available, whether it's Flash or Windows Media Player or
[00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:26.240]   or QuickTime, of course, you want to have all the control. I got to say that when you open up the
[00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:31.760]   episode Pro thing, the first thing that we hit was you have a lot more control over Ace 264 than
[00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:38.640]   what you get in QuickTime or in Compressor. There's just an enormous amount of control over exactly
[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:43.120]   how you're setting up keyframes, exactly how you're putting stuff together. It is really,
[00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:50.480]   it's extremely powerful. You can actually work with it in Compressor. So you can use Compressor and
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:57.200]   use the built-in features of Compressor and have it send out to episode Pro. It takes full advantage
[00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:07.840]   of eight processors. It will saturate them. And it's a very fast compressor. We started using it and
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:13.600]   now, you know, a growing number of our shows are moving over to episode Pro. I mean, our pipelines,
[00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:19.600]   especially when working with clients who have various specific needs for either a Flash output or
[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:29.040]   kind of a more specific QuickTime output, this has turned out to be just a really, really great
[00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:34.240]   application. And as I hesitate to recommend it because it's $1,000 for a compressing application,
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:38.240]   but if this is your business, then you're listening to us and I think there are people who do that
[00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:42.320]   in our listener. It's definitely worth downloading, I believe they have a demo.
[00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:55.280]   This is Telestream, makes it. And it is definitely worth checking out. And it is, I said $1,000,
[00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:58.800]   Telestream is the owner. They also make Flip for Mac. So you know that it's going to work with
[00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:02.960]   WMB. So if you're trying to output a whole bunch of things to a whole lot of different areas and
[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:07.040]   you want to have absolute control, for us, the reason that we looked at it in the first place was
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:12.160]   because we could do lookup tables. So we could actually build what's called a LUT that would
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:17.200]   be applied to all the videos as they went through. And it was custom LUTs that actually got us to
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:21.200]   even open the application because it's something we couldn't do in Compressor. This is important
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:25.520]   if you're doing film work and you have everything shot, let's say, to what's called log and you
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:31.680]   need to convert it to Lin on the way through or linear, a lot of the rhythmical linear conversions.
[01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:38.080]   Anyway, all of this stuff is available. It's the best application we found in its little pod.
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:41.680]   You have to be serious about what you're doing. There's no reason to get it if you are happy with
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:47.200]   Compressor. But if you find that you want just a little bit more power, this is the next notch.
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:52.640]   You were going to say that, weren't you, Kiki? I knew you were. I jumped in because I saw Kiki
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:59.200]   using it all the time. I feel like it's my job to get into to have kind of the geeky video
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:05.200]   for Mac users' recommendations. And he was going to pick it, but he thought it was too obvious.
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:12.400]   Harkwell's thick and parrot about hearing about $1,000 compressors. I'm going to give you one for
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:18.800]   free to make up for this. My antidote to the expensive program. I've mentioned before menu
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:24.240]   calendar clock, which was a great little program to put a much more sophisticated calendar up in
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:28.560]   your menu bar and clock. And they started charging for it. And then they really got me, which I
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:32.240]   can understand. That's fine. I don't mind if pay paying for share, weren't I always do.
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:36.880]   But then they charge for the second edition with minor improvements. And it was like, come on.
[01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:41.200]   So I've been looking for a free replacement. I found one from charcoal design. It's called
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:49.200]   MAGICAL, charcoaldesign.co.uk/magical. And this has every feature you'd ever want. In fact,
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:56.640]   Andy, you might like this because I'm using one of those comic book fonts as my day and date in my
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:01.120]   menu bar. It lets you, of course, change all the fonts. It gives you a pop-up calendar when you
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:07.280]   click on the date. Very highly customizable. So you can have all sorts of different settings in the
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:12.400]   preferences. I mean, it just goes on and on all the preferences. And it's absolutely free. I like
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:17.360]   to have more information in my menu bar than just the time I like to know what day and date it is
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:22.320]   and so forth. You can have hours, minutes. I'm using CCHedge backwards, one of your comic book
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:28.080]   fonts. You can have any font you want in your menu bar. There's a calendar icon. You got a choice
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:33.840]   of calendar icons you can use. You have, of course, the calendars and I'm going to uncheck week begins
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:40.720]   on Monday because that's been making me nuts. I was wondering what was going on there. And, of course,
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:46.560]   automatic launch, unlogging and so forth. I have to say, this is a really, very, very full-featured,
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:53.760]   very nice program. If you want to put a calendar, day and date, and the menu and time in your menu
[01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:57.840]   and have some customization capabilities that Apple didn't give you, this is a free week.
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:05.120]   And I love it. Magic Cal from charcoal design. Is that Doc icon live? Because that is a beautiful
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:13.360]   icon. Which one the one? When you're showing the product download page.
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:18.000]   Oh, the icon. That beautiful, like, gray letters on the dark gray tech.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.520]   That's an interesting question. I don't know. That is beautiful, isn't it? That would be nice
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:26.240]   if that were alive. If that were just sitting on my desktop, I would be paying this guy at least
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:31.280]   five bucks for it. That is beautiful. You know, you're right. And there are a lot of yahoo widgets
[01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:35.360]   for my, I have a big 24 clock on my desktop that keeps track of the time.
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:42.880]   You know, first, when I first put it on the desktop, it would do the 24 set at the top of the
[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:47.520]   hour, "Bom, bom, bom, bom." And I couldn't figure out what's going on. What is that sound? Where's
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:51.600]   Jack Bauer? I know there's something. And then I realized, "Oh, it's the clock I put on my desktop."
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:55.600]   Because I, you know, I'm not big. I don't watch 24. So I couldn't figure out why, you know,
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:59.120]   people were getting all excited about it. So there's another one. You can have that on
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:03.840]   Yahoo! has some great widgets. Highly recommend them. Now they're on TV too, you know.
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:09.520]   Mr. Andy and not co, your turn. What do you got for us, sir, on St. Patty's Day 2009?
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:14.480]   I'm not drunk enough to do an Irish accent, so I'll do my old TV. Apparently, neither am I.
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:19.360]   I'll do my usual fake American accent for this one. Okay. There's a there's an app I downloaded a
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:24.960]   few days ago for the iPhone called Color Splash. I'm normally not a big fan of photo enhancing and
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:30.320]   photo trickery apps for the iPhone because you're dealing with, you know, a shaky low resolution
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:33.680]   image and it's kind of junky to begin with. And there's nothing wrong with a camera phone image
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:37.840]   looking like a camera phone image. And by the time I'm done twigging all those sliders that these
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:42.560]   applications give you for brightness and contrast and saturation and filters and stuff like that.
[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:47.280]   I'm like, well, gee, if I just emailed this to myself and then dumped it into even eye photo,
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:51.280]   I would have been able to do something four times as good as this in just three seconds.
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:57.600]   But Color Splash is really, really cool. It does one thing. All it does is it lets you mask out
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:02.320]   certain areas and turn it into turn into a black and white photo in which certain areas of the
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:07.440]   photo are left in color. So if you want a practical reason for this, it means that when you're
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:11.520]   sending a picture to somebody, you can make sure that they know exactly what you think is so cool
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:16.240]   about this picture. If there's a guy and we're in the top half of an elf costume in the bottom half
[01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:19.920]   of a Santa Claus costume and he's in the middle of a parade. And you want to say, no, no, not the
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:24.480]   band in front of him. No, not the school orchestra behind him, but the weird guy within the elf
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:29.680]   Santa Claus tomb. You can basically black and white the entire the entire scene except for the guy
[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:36.160]   and leave him in glorious saturated Technicolor. But it's always number two. It does produce really
[01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:40.240]   cool pictures. So when I email picture people pictures from this, it actually looks pretty cool
[01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:45.440]   as diverting as distracting. But also it's really fun to play with. I mean, I love taking pictures
[01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:51.120]   and I'm a big fan of photography and my enthusiasm exceeds my talent, I know. But I have a lot of
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:56.080]   fun taking just a casual picture then saying, well, what happens if we just make the trees and color
[01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:59.280]   and make the rest in black and white? Or what if we just colorize the people and leave everything
[01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:06.240]   else with desaturated? And you know, it's a good way to. So if you want to get a buck 99 for me off
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:12.880]   the iPhone store, give me a way to kill three to nine minutes in line at the bank or the post office.
[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:17.280]   And I'll not only buy your application, but I'll recommend it to other people and I'll give you
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:23.120]   five bucks for double decaf, tall, venti latte, whatever. I don't drink coffee, but five bucks.
[01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:27.440]   I'll give you extra because this is really a fun application to play with. And again,
[01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:31.360]   it also produces really cool pictures. I love this is really looks great.
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:36.000]   Color splash on the attitude store. It's all done by a touch. You basically are painting
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.880]   this mask in by hand. So it's actually kind of fun just to play with the masking features.
[01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:44.080]   Yeah, very cool. And just buck 99.
[01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:48.400]   Buck 99. All right. Now it's time for Mr. Ryan. I didn't warn you when you
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:52.560]   you joined us. I'm not going to make you do it, Ryan. Okay. Unless you have a Mac app that you'd
[01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:57.680]   like to share with us. I mean, if you think I'm a novice enough Mac user, the only thing I was
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:00.880]   going to throw out there was cam twist. And I'm sure that's something you guys have. You're using
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:06.320]   it. I know. Yeah. In fact, aren't you using it to Scott right now? I mean, you're doing multi cam,
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:14.480]   aren't you? No, I was just I have two monitors up each with the cam and then I just was switching
[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:18.800]   between them and Skype. Oh, okay. Yeah. Cam twist is a good way to do it, actually. It's pretty cool.
[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:23.680]   And it's free. It's free. That's a good recommend. I think we've made it a pick before by the
[01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:32.240]   dwarf repeating the cam twist. And now Mr. Scotty ball. Well, my first question to Alex is, did that
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:39.440]   $1,000 deal come with a chart? No, no, I did not. I'm didn't forget it. I'm not buying it. I
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:44.000]   did buy another. I was so happy with that $1,500 chart that I got a couple weeks ago that I did
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:50.080]   buy another $500 chart. Okay. For focus. Yeah, I guess over there on the compound, they need a
[01:07:50.080 --> 01:08:00.960]   medic. I pick today is constrictor three and it's a whopping 10 bucks and a share where. And my
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:06.000]   gosh, is it so much better than the native screen capture built into a Mac? I mean, for 10 bucks,
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.240]   Apple should have built this in. This thing is cool. You can you can set it up transparently
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:14.960]   over the screen, completely adjust it, adjust its output, any number of ways like you can have
[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:22.400]   bleeds, you can have fadeaways. It's very powerful. It's very easy to use. And I've been, you know,
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:26.720]   I do a lot of screenshots for the blog and my gosh, this has just made it way easier.
[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:34.240]   It's available from stick software.com. And you can download it for free. And then if you like it
[01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:41.200]   after so many times, you have to pay for it. But for 10 bucks, I mean, you know, they do a lot
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:45.120]   of stuff. I'm looking all the all the different programs they do stick. Oh, yeah, it's part of the
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:52.400]   icon family. So they have so they have a bunch of other cool little apps. But this one is, you know,
[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:56.880]   I thought to myself, you don't want to make sure when I give a pick, it's something I'm actually
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:01.440]   using a lot. And I realized I've been using the crud out of this thing and hadn't talked about it.
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:08.960]   So I happily sent them $10. And I think anybody that tries it will do the same. It works, you know,
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:14.480]   on the current lines of Mac, but they do have an older version, constrictor 2.3 that will work
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:19.600]   with the older operating systems as well. I use sketch for that. Have you ever used sketch?
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:25.360]   I love you, sketch. I've used sketch and I've used a couple other things. There's just something
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:28.320]   about the way the constrictor does it that I like better. Yeah.
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:34.640]   Sketch only because once you do the annotated, you can annotate, you can put it drop shadow.
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:40.320]   That's what I use for my blog a lot is a sketch. I've been blogging every day for the last few
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:45.200]   days. I'm just going to try to blog more often. You must write several posts a day, Scott.
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:50.640]   About a dozen. Yeah. I've never seen somebody so prolific because you know,
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:56.880]   it's not just one blog you've got. I got numerous blogs. Yeah. I'm writing about a dozen a day and
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:01.680]   it does, you know, for, well, I got to tell you, for some reason, it just comes to me. And part of
[01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:07.200]   it is I'm thankful for my, you know, the people that the audience, they make it easy. I mean,
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:12.000]   you know, I get people send me tweeters and emails and say, Scott, what about this? And I go,
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.080]   hey, that'd be a great, that'd be a great blog topic because, you know, on Twitch photo alone,
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:22.080]   I've written 700 posts. Wow. So, and that's in, you know, a little over a year. And eventually,
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:26.560]   the old brain starts to say, ideas? Any ideas out there? Right.
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:31.200]   Help. You know, like Andy just talking about this thing now is giving me an idea. So,
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:35.760]   basically what happens is I get an idea and then I immediately go vomit it down onto textmate.
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:42.240]   So basically you're blogging vomit. I've been that up a little bit when I talked to my editors.
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:47.680]   Yeah. I'll try to coalesce perfect jewels of truth, beauty and wisdom for you. If I had to
[01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:53.040]   play two p.m. No chunks, please. What I do is it's just a brain dump and then I clean it up a
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:56.320]   little bit later and put it up on the page. It's sort of a creative Ipaca.
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:11:04.560]   Yes. Yes. Twitter is Ipaca for the soul. Exactly. You should be blogging more,
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:08.320]   Leo, because you have lots of cool stuff to say. Well, the last post I wrote is about
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:12.880]   Skypeosaurus, which we're using, which is, I saw that. It was very cool. Yeah, I realized that's
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:17.680]   when I knew that that's that's when I knew you got the new Onyx. Yeah. Oh, and I love this
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:22.080]   new Onyx. I should do a post just on it. You didn't even tell me you got the new Onyx. That's the
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:25.680]   kind of thing you knew that would have gotten me excited. Yeah, I forgot you're well into.
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:31.840]   The Onyx is a mixer that we use. I've always used a Mac Eonic's mixers, the 1620 for years,
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:37.840]   because they're inexpensive and they and they I should make this a pick and they do.
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:41.920]   They do a good job. A lot of podcasters might want to look at them. They're about 800, 900 bucks
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:48.640]   for the 1620. The 1620 is the perfect mixer. It's very simple. Very lightweight. But it has all
[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:53.120]   the extra features that you need. All the extra ox. It didn't have enough ox outs,
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:59.440]   unfortunately, because we have now with Skypeosaurus. We have our gentlemen, our ladies in the four
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:05.440]   four windows, four different skipes. Each of them needs their own mix minus. And then we have people
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:09.440]   in the studio. So I just need I needed more capability. And this is this was a nice upgrade.
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:15.680]   The 16 unfortunately, Mac E's factory is shut down. And so they're looking for a new company to make
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:19.680]   them for them. So they're way back ordered. We actually bought a demo unit. It's all we could find.
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:24.240]   But it was about 1300 bucks. Right. And you have 16 for six ox.
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:28.560]   Six ox buses. But then what we also have, it's almost like it's got 10 because it's got
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:33.280]   four sub mixes. Wow. So instead of using an ox bus, for instance, for the monitor in the room,
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:38.160]   I can use a sub mix. Right. So there's some really it's very nice. It's a little over my head,
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:41.600]   to be honest with you. I came in here to me a half an hour. I had to figure out how to hear
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:46.640]   what was going on. But I finally did. And now you have the power that well, at least I can hear
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:53.040]   what's going on. But that's it. Yeah, I'll talk more about that at another time. And if you want
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:57.680]   to read about Skype, a source, my blog, we have a bill.com has and Colleen gets all the credit for this.
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:02.560]   She built this thing. That's just it's a monster. Gives us the capability of getting video from
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:05.520]   up to four different people on the show, which is really great.
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:11.120]   Ryan Chadd, thank you so much for joining us. Ryan is the editor in chief of PC perspective,
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:18.560]   a great website on hardware. He does our hardware show every Thursday afternoon on twitter.tv live.tv.
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:22.800]   It's called PC perspective. It's every afternoon at 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern.
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:29.120]   And we're it's great to have somebody who knows a little bit about hardware these days. It's gotten
[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:35.120]   more complicated. Yes, it tends to do that. Thanks for having me on. Great to have you. Andy Naco is
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:42.080]   the man at the Chicago Sun Times in charge of all technology. He also writes a great blog
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:47.520]   himself, the celestial waste of bandwidth at C W O B and he great to have you aboard this week.
[01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:51.520]   I'm just a simple country boy doing his job. I want to help out the team and play one game at a time.
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:56.800]   The good world willing things will work out. Yes, indeed. And Mr. Scott Born, for whom things
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:03.520]   have worked out time and time again, the luckiest man I've ever met. And he's got some great blogs
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:07.120]   as he mentioned. But the best place to go is scottborn.com with links to all of them.
[01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:11.520]   Anything you want to highlight, you're doing a lot of giveaways. We got Drobo giveaways and
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:17.120]   the aperture giveaways and man, you just you just give it away. I think I've given away a total of
[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:22.000]   11 Drobo's this month or something like that. But I've got a couple more going link to my deal.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:26.480]   My deal got me to get a chance and then follow me on Twitter. It's got born. It's all you have to
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:31.280]   do. I'm giving one away to people who just simply follow me. Oh, that's so old hat. That's so Jason
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:37.280]   Calicana. So old school. And you know what? Jason's done pretty well for himself. So I'm happy to
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:44.560]   wear that hat. Also, thanks to Mr. Alex Lindsey of the Pixel Corp, Pixel Corp.com. If you want to
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:49.600]   join that great guild of multimedia artists and find I'd be right. Yeah, it's wonderful. We've got
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:56.720]   an episode one of new show. What is it? Break work. Mac break work. Really good with Richard Harrington.
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:01.920]   I already watched it. Yeah, Richard Harrington. Richard Harrington, he wrote the book
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:10.720]   on iWork. And he's the Apple certified book. And so I got when we were at Macworld, we started
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:14.160]   recording them. It took a little time for us to get the whole pipe done. But we're going to come
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:19.360]   out every week with new stuff. At first, Mac break work is going to be all about iWork. We're going
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:24.080]   to introduce people to that. But we're going to branch out into building databases and building
[01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:28.720]   and networking your office and dealing with anything that you're dealing with at work. That's going to
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:33.680]   be the new area that we're looking for. So we've got Mac break work. Number one is on the website.
[01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:38.000]   It's not on iTunes yet. It's doing the iTunes thing. You know where it works. It's way through.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.840]   But by the end of the week, it should be on iTunes. And of course, we've got a new Mac break
[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:47.760]   dev with Sal up this week, as well as a Mac break studio about building iPhone ringtones on your
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:52.480]   garage band in garage band. So lots of new stuff. I just want to say about Rich Harrington is
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:58.800]   absolutely one of the very best teachers I've ever seen. A lot of the people do these videos,
[01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:03.840]   but not everybody. I mean, tell them I'm doing because they're famous. Rich does them because he's
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:07.600]   good. He's really, really good. Well, and there's a lot of little things. It's not only the main
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:10.960]   thing he's showing you how to do like great presentations and keynote. But he'll show you, oh, by the way,
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:14.720]   if you hit this little key and do this little thing, and I'm like, where did that come from? So
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:21.920]   it's like stuff that you wouldn't normally see. So lots of little Easter eggs in Mac break work. It
[01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:26.880]   should be really excited to get it off the ground. Good. Cool. Big kudos to you there, Alex. Big kudos
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:31.280]   for getting rich. That's exciting. That's exciting. Where would they find that? It's on it's at
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:36.720]   pixxscore.tv right now. And it should be in iTunes with by the end of the week. I think that
[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:40.880]   it's just going through the there's like a two or three day process. We literally published it
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:45.280]   last night. So excellent. Yeah, it takes a while to get through the whole. Yeah, there's just like a
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:49.520]   three or four day process of it going through. So if it's not there, you can see it at pixxscore.tv.
[01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:54.400]   And then you should be able to subscribe to it in iTunes as late as next week at the worst,
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:58.480]   but probably later this week. And finally, I last but not least want to thank Dr. Keke,
[01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:04.320]   Kirsten Sanford for stops. Kirsten, Kirsten's got what is my name? The teas are all mess.
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:09.040]   I'm a sassa sassa sassa. Kirsten Sanford for back birds are so pop back to her home dimension.
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:16.880]   It's easy to remember Sanford and son. Yeah, no, I remember it. It's just the tea and Kirsten.
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:20.960]   And then I want to put a tea in Sanford, but don't.
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:30.560]   So just call me Dr. Keke. That's why it's easy. She's at Kirsten stan sta... Kirsten Sanford.com.
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:36.640]   I love it. I love it. And of course, the host of this week at Science and a lot of great podcasts.
[01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:40.960]   And we keep planning on getting a podcast up here from you. And I just have been slow
[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:46.080]   getting up off the ground. So I apologize, but we will do that soon. I do a science show with
[01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:51.120]   Kiki because she's so great. And it'll be so much fun. Oh, I can't wait. Talk about science. Yeah.
[01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:56.160]   We need it nowadays. We need a little more science, a little less superstition.
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:18:00.080]   Yeah, I got a Twitter just now from someone who suggested my pick of the week should have been
[01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:05.600]   the Mathematica Home Edition. Oh, how much is that? That's so much fun. You play with analytics.
[01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:11.760]   You must be smart. I love Mathematica. Mathematica is amazing. I saw something recently where
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:20.000]   it was playing with the BMW logo and just using Mathematica to create mathematical algorithms
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:25.520]   for all the points in the logo and then to be able to adjust the logo and create all sorts of
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:31.600]   new designs out of it. I mean, you can take anything and mathematically create anything.
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:38.800]   It's hard to get into, but once you get into it, it can do almost anything.
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:42.320]   He's falling. The big thing is, to me, data isn't data until you can visualize it.
[01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:47.440]   Right. It is the visualization of data. And actually, the guy who came up with Mathematica,
[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:52.480]   Steve Wolfram, he's going to be coming out with, he's been... Wolfram Alpha.
[01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:56.480]   Yes, the Alpha. The new thing's coming out. That's going to be amazing.
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:19:00.320]   It's a knowledge engine. You can ask it a question. In real language.
[01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:04.960]   It's a real language. I love his book on new kind of science. You read that too? Yeah.
[01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:08.560]   Boy, you're smart. Beyond me. It's one of the few books I actually read.
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:10.640]   I only think the guy... I don't think he's got compound, man.
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:12.240]   What? No, he's got a compound. He can...
[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:19.520]   That's why you... I haven't... I haven't read the whole... I haven't read the whole book. I read
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:24.000]   big chunks of it when I feel like I'm thinking about a certain thing. But one of the big things
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.240]   about what he's talking about is the idea that a lot of science has gone to making more and more
[01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:37.360]   complex algorithms to explain the world rather than s'mores. He's saying what it might be and
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:41.920]   what might be more effective is to make it simpler algorithms that interact with each other,
[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:45.840]   which I think is very interesting. Yeah, it's a different way of looking at all the information
[01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:51.840]   that's out there. I think this real language engine that's going to be coming out Alpha,
[01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:56.000]   it's going to be just amazing. People have asked, is it going to compete with Google?
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.360]   No, it's not going to compete with Google directly. It's a different kind of engine
[01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:03.440]   or different information for knowledge. Maybe we could do a show on that. Maybe we can get
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:08.400]   Steven on the show. Yes. Yes. But you'd have to ask him all the questions you and Alex,
[01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:15.520]   because I'm going to sit here and go. Hold for Mathematica 7, the home edition is 295, which
[01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:21.520]   is pricey, but it's much more expensive to get the full edition. So consider it's only half an
[01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:29.520]   Alex. Come on. Go for it. And you can get that from Wolfram, WOLF, R-A-M dot com.
[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:34.640]   That's a great pick. Yes, I would like to say. Can I try it without
[01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:40.080]   Byron surveys? Thank you for that suggestion. Can I try before I buy because I don't know if I
[01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:44.960]   understand it. That's my problem. They probably have some. Do you enter like equations and then
[01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:51.840]   it generates like graphing calculator on steroids? Yes. Okay. I'll just stick with graphing calculators.
[01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:57.840]   I mean, you can go from both directions. You can start from equations or you can import images and
[01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:02.800]   then see if there's an equation. By the way, that's available for Windows, Mac and Linux as well.
[01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:07.280]   Just so as you know. Thank you everybody for joining us. We really appreciate it. Don't forget,
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:11.360]   if you like the show, you could subscribe to it in iTunes and get it automatically delivered to
[01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:18.240]   your computer or iPod. Every time we have a new show, it just comes and appears there.
[01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:24.000]   That's a great way to do it. Check out our twit pics at twit.tv/pix. There's always some great
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:30.480]   stuff, including right now an $88 terabyte hard drive. Colleen's really good at finding those deals.
[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:37.120]   And my blog, as I mentioned, at leoville.com describes Colleen's latest creation. The Skype
[01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:43.920]   of Sores. We'll see you next week. Another Mac break is broke.
