[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.120]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, by the way.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.000]   Did I not start Windows Weekly last week saying,
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.920]   it's time for Windows Weekly, everything
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.080]   you want to know about Apple?
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.960]   I believe I did.
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.360]   And so I'm going to say everything you ever
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.440]   want to know about Macintosh.
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.400]   No, no, everything you ever want to know about Windows
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.640]   on today's show.
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.760]   No, I shouldn't do that.
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.280]   That'll confuse everybody.
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.800]   We are going to talk about Apple Things,
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.480]   and we're going to do it with our good friend Andy
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.520]   Anaco from Baston.
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.800]   Good to see you again, the Chicago Sun Times,
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.600]   and Celeste Joesto Bandwidth.
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.920]   And we welcome back our prodigal son.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.000]   He has returned, ladies and gentlemen, Frederick Van Johnson
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.840]   into house.
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.520]   Hello.
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.200]   Hello.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.760]   Frederick, we had to banish Frederick
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.480]   because we have this crazy policy
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.120]   that if you work for a company that we cover,
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.280]   we won't have you on the show.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.000]   We have to try to have independent journalists on the show.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.880]   And you've got a job.
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:11.640]   How dare you?
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.120]   I know.
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.440]   With our sponsor, Drobo.
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.360]   I know.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.360]   I know.
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.920]   But--
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.880]   But you're not there anymore.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.520]   I'm here now.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.760]   So I could do a Drobo commercial in this show
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.200]   without any fear of conflict of interest.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.920]   You can.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.320]   You can.
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.640]   Good, I will, as a matter of fact.
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.000]   I allow that.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.040]   Frederick also hosts This Week in Photography,
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.560]   which is on to it on Mondays.
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.200]   But it's not-- it's a pixel-core production.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.840]   So I know it's confusing, but it's a different thing.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.200]   Yeah.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.120]   And they have-- and they have more lenient editorial policies,
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.360]   I'm afraid, than we do.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.240]   We do.
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.200]   We do.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.680]   Lenient, but--
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.040]   No, I think it's probably drawn up a photographer.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.440]   But Google's not a sponsor.
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.800]   Right.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.960]   So that you don't cover Drobo on this Week in Photography,
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.480]   so it's not really an issue.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.400]   When you worked for Adobe, we couldn't have you
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.280]   on this Week in Photography.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.720]   That's right.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.280]   Because you were talking about like--
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.600]   All your morals, you know.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.760]   By the way, you will be glad to know that I tried.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:02.720]   I really did.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.320]   Aperture.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.040]   I tried.
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.600]   I did Aperture 3.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.440]   I paid for it $299 or whatever hideous cost it was.
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.760]   And I bought the Nick plugins for it.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.600]   I really tried.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.520]   Yeah.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.040]   I couldn't do it.
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.840]   I went back to Lightroom.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.400]   It's just too slow.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.960]   Do you use Aperture Andy?
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:18.720]   Yeah.
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.200]   I just-- I think they're both great programs,
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.720]   but the Aperture is just so much more Mac-like.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.720]   And when the big letter that Steve Jobs posted
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.680]   about why they're banning Flash, the first incident
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.880]   I thought of is, yep, Adobe makes Lightroom.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.920]   And it's a very fine app for both Windows and for Macintosh.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.760]   And so identical on both Windows and Mac--
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.120]   That's right.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.480]   Exactly.
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.240]   --and I install it on both.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.360]   But it doesn't exploit the Mac interface the way
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.080]   that Aperture does.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.400]   It really feels like a Mac program.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.200]   Also, I don't like the really methodical step one, step two,
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.680]   step three, step four approach that Lightroom puts you
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.200]   through the module processor.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.960]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.640]   To put you through your stuff.
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.080]   Because sometimes I'm in a sort mode.
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.960]   Sometimes I'm in just a mess around and apply tags mode.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.560]   For a highly disordered and disorganized mind,
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.400]   I think Aperture is the way to go.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.320]   Aperture for the disordered mind.
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.520]   Yeah, I mean, they're both great apps, right?
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.320]   I mean, and it just depends on how your brain is wired.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.920]   And the speed of your processor.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.200]   Well, I have to say Aperture to me feels even--
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.720]   Now I have an i7 15.
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.800]   I got the new 15-inch i7.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.160]   And it still feels slow to me, whereas Lightroom--
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.080]   Bam!
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.400]   And one thing I do with Lightroom--
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.560]   and maybe this is one of the things that speeds it up--
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.280]   is I import-- I don't import the pictures.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.280]   You know what?
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.080]   Derek's story inspired me to my technique
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.640]   of photo manipulation.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.520]   He said, what you should do is first copy the session
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.240]   and copy it to the hard drive, name it.
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.280]   You know, like this was my pictures of Quite Tower.
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.040]   Name it, leave it, and then import it into Aperture
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.000]   or Lightroom and work with the photos there.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.400]   So you copy and then import.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.880]   And I used to import from the car.
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.800]   He says, copy first, then import.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.920]   And I've been doing that except that I haven't been moving
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.120]   the files into the Lightroom catalog or Lightroom folder.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.600]   When I moved him into the Aperture's folder,
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.680]   really took a long time to explore.
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.600]   I mean, I use reference.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.080]   So I keep-- I do the same thing.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.040]   I copy them over to my hard drive.
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.040]   I have my own little hierarchy there.
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.440]   And I'm using Lightroom and Aperture right now.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.480]   I can import thousands of-- well, you tell me,
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.200]   because I can import thousands of pictures
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.480]   in the Lightroom in a minute or two.
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.760]   And Aperture, just-- I mean, I go away.
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.960]   I go make a fine cup of coffee with my plunger.
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:36.480]   Yeah.
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.560]   There may be some settings in there.
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.640]   You may have it set to build gigantic previews.
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.280]   So you think it's just as fast?
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.800]   It's-- you know, it depends on what you're doing.
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.640]   So I think Lightroom is blazingly fast
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:46.880]   when you're skipping through things.
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.400]   But if you use Aperture and you put it in a mode
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.400]   where it's only going to look at the preview files when you're
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.120]   doing your culling, it's just as fast.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.120]   OK.
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.620]   It just--
[00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:55.680]   So I'm doing something wrong.
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.680]   And I can show you that.
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.600]   In my settings, no, I don't want to use it.
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.960]   I like Lightroom.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.200]   Don't show me the error of my ways.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.480]   I'm perfectly happy in my ignorance.
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.240]   And I can show you Lightroom stuff, too.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.200]   I love Lightroom.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.080]   Well, you remember I went on the Lightroom adventure
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.800]   with Michael Oland.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.160]   We went to Tasmania.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.000]   The one I missed.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.200]   Yeah.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.160]   And as a result, that's right.
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.160]   You were supposed to be there.
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:13.680]   And as a result--
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.680]   A paper.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.880]   You paid for it?
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.800]   And you didn't go?
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.640]   Who went in your place?
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.120]   I think it was Winston.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.400]   Winston-- the boss.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.080]   That's what happened.
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.200]   The boss got to go.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.760]   Well, and that's where I kind of got a fondness for Lightroom
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.000]   because Melinda Gull was there.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.200]   And I just learned a lot about Lightroom.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.000]   It's a great app.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   I love it.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.360]   Yeah.
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.240]   Anyway, I just-- I tried.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.320]   I tried to like Aperture.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.600]   And Andy, I'm sorry.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.280]   Please visit me.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.720]   It's perfectly fine.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.280]   I had both of them on my Mac for a long time.
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.840]   It just turned out that Aperture was always the app
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.280]   that I was going to, partly because it was easier to use
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.680]   as far as I was concerned, partly because of the style that
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.360]   just lets you do whatever you want, whenever you want.
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.680]   But I really found that the answers to the problems
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.600]   that I had with certain pictures,
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.560]   I could find those answers much, much more quickly
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.920]   with Aperture than with Lightroom,
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.000]   like if you're just saying, this skin tone has a little bit
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.800]   of a blue cast on it from the flash, but nowhere else.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.520]   And the ability to simply change just the cast of that area.
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.600]   It's just one click, one slide done.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.440]   You know what's missing?
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.800]   Missing out of Aperture?
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.480]   Negative clarity.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.000]   So there's a clarity slide.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:21.960]   You can turn it down.
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.560]   Yeah, you can like drag it to the left.
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.880]   I don't know why you'd want to do that.
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.720]   Well, for smoothing skin and doing that kind of thing.
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.040]   Oh, for pictures of my wife.
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.040]   Oh, geez, I'm in trouble now.
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.240]   You're digging a grave.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.240]   Oh, my God.
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.040]   I didn't mean my wife.
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:34.880]   I met my girlfriend.
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:35.600]   Oh, no, wait a minute.
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.040]   Now I'm really in trouble.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:41.000]   No, you know, I will try Aperture again.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.800]   One thing I do miss in Lightroom is the loop.
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.440]   The loop in Aperture is so great.
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.360]   Because it's flexible size.
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.200]   You can move it around.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.040]   And Lightroom, it kind of does the same thing,
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.120]   but not quite.
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.120]   It's just different.
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.400]   There's no physical loop, right?
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.720]   You're zooming in or you're zooming out.
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.800]   There's no graphical thing that's sitting on your image.
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.120]   It seems like there's only two zoom levels on Aperture.
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.200]   I mean, not in Lightroom, right?
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.200]   You either in or out.
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.200]   100% or you're out.
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.200]   Yeah.
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.760]   And see, I love the fact that I can do a lot more anyway.
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:09.600]   So, OK, and Aperture does video, which is why I switched.
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.600]   It does.
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.600]   But Lightroom 3 is going to do video.
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.600]   It does.
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:13.600]   Anyway.
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.600]   And if you're going to do books and all that stuff.
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.600]   How did this turn into this week in photography?
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.600]   I'm sorry.
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.600]   I'm here.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.600]   That's what it was.
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:19.600]   No more.
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.600]   Let's move on.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.600]   All right, all right.
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.600]   There are stories, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.600]   First of all, let me ask Andy how Bermuda was.
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.960]   Oh, Bermuda was extremely cool.
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:33.480]   Especially because it was unlike most of the cruises that inside cruises, McMania does,
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.840]   where there was bad, bad weather for the first port in Bermuda.
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.080]   So we just went right to the second one.
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:43.720]   So we spent three days and like three or four days in dock at the same place, which was incredible.
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:48.120]   Because because it was there wasn't that pressure to look, we got we're here from 7th
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.720]   during the morning and we got to be back on the ship by 4th, 3rd.
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.920]   We have to do something awesome during that one period.
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:58.000]   It also meant that there was not an Apple store.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.960]   There was an I store, even though this I store had exactly the same furniture as an Apple
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.560]   store and the exact same demo.
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.440]   Is it owned by Apple?
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.520]   Now this was this was people.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:15.200]   I was discussing this with people on in the in Bermuda and people on Twitter that apparently
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.800]   in Bermuda, there is a if I understood correctly, there is a law that says you can't have a
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.360]   company come in and simply own a store.
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.480]   It has to be majority owned by locals.
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:28.640]   And what I've been told, I haven't looked into this myself, what I was told by some
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:36.280]   other people is that often the and I Apple has the ability to simply allow stores to
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:41.880]   buy the exact same fixtures and furnishings and maybe even run things from the same playbook
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.960]   if it is within Apple's interest or something.
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:48.840]   I didn't, this is not stuff that I looked into as a respected journalist.
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.800]   This was things I just looked into as a dude said, hey, how come you got the, it looks
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:56.240]   like an Apple store and it works just like an Apple store, but it ain't an Apple store.
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.080]   But the point is that this was like just two blocks away from where the cruise ship was
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.080]   docked.
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.200]   It had free open Wi-Fi just like a that, just like an Apple store.
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:08.200]   So every, almost every single morning, like on my way to the beach or on my way anywhere,
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:13.160]   it would be let's stop off at the Apple store and get in a good 20 minutes of real free Wi-Fi.
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:18.800]   It also meant that the very, very topmost deck closest to shore was the one of the unafraid
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:22.680]   official meeting points for if you want to see anybody on the Mac cruise because it was
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:26.640]   well, sometime late in the first day, it was figured out that the single was so strong
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:31.280]   that if you were in this exact spot at this exact bar and it helped out a little bit,
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:35.000]   if you would actually hold your iPad or your, or your iPhone out over the rail a little
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.760]   bit, you could still get one or two bars of their Wi-Fi and download your email for free.
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:40.760]   So.
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:46.160]   Well, I am going on the next one to South America and that is.
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.160]   Antarctica.
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.160]   And Antarctica.
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.640]   It could not have been more different.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:50.640]   I am.
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.640]   Yeah.
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.760]   You know, it's funny because we leave from Buenos Aires where the average temperature
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:59.880]   in in January, or I guess it's February is is 80 degrees because it's summer there and
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.040]   south of the equator.
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.360]   And then we get to Antarctica.
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.360]   We have to wear it.
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.960]   You know, they have to list of things you have to wear like eight layers.
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:09.640]   I mean, it's freezing even though it's the summertime in Antarctica.
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:13.560]   So we're going to go from, I don't, I'm going to have to pack two bags, one for 80 degree,
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.560]   humid and humid and one for, you know, minus 20.
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:17.960]   What are you doing on these things?
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.360]   Are you teaching or you would?
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.360]   Yeah, we teach, right?
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.360]   We give classes.
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.360]   Yeah.
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.360]   He does a great class, by the way.
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.360]   I love Andy's class.
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:27.880]   If you're part of faculty, I gave, this was sort of a light one for me.
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:35.440]   I gave six hours worth of classes on four different topics and from just a thousand tips
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:36.440]   in 90 minutes.
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:39.160]   I didn't get all 1000, but I got to about 30 or 40 of them.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.040]   A class on iPhone tips.
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:46.480]   I did one that was, that was just what was the third one.
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:51.760]   Another one was turning a house network into a home network, making things a little homie,
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:52.760]   just things like that.
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:57.280]   And they get some really, the big side benefit for me apart from getting to take this really
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.320]   cool cruise is I'm often sitting in on some of these great classes.
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:04.840]   We just, off the top, we talked about Derek and his photo classes.
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:05.840]   I sat in on it.
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:09.720]   I've been using aperture for a few years now, but I've never actually sat through a real
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:10.720]   class on it.
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:15.080]   And within a half hour, as always happens whenever I take one of Derek's classes, it's
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:19.000]   like, okay, so the thing that I thought I've known how to do for 10 years, I've been doing
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   it completely wrong.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   You're using this wrong.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   And it was absolutely true.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.040]   He started off just by talking about importing photos.
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:29.680]   And I was one of those people who would just have it import directly into the aperture library.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.680]   So I was maintaining it multiple libraries.
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.160]   He was his first thing was, was walking through here, all the things that aperture can do for
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:39.720]   you automatically every time you pointed at a car at a card full of photos.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:43.240]   And again, I was like furiously typing, they, yes, that is better.
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.240]   Yeah.
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:48.160]   Yeah, Derek has a great Linda dot com series up there too.
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.160]   On aperture.
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.000]   I think, okay, now I know I have to do that and give aperture.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   It's due.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.400]   It's fair trial.
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:57.720]   So I am jealous that you guys went on this thing, but I'm going on one.
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:58.720]   You are?
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.720]   Yeah.
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:00.720]   In November.
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.720]   Yeah.
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:02.720]   Oh, you're going on Mac mania 10.5?
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.160]   No, this is a camera cruise.
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.240]   So it's a photography oriented cruise.
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.240]   Who's doing that?
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.240]   That sounds great.
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.240]   In Mexico.
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.240]   It's a, it's a friend of mine.
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.240]   So I'll post a link to it on my blog.
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.240]   Which is, and what is your blog?
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.240]   Frederickvan.com.
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.240]   Frederickvan.com.
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.240]   Frederickvan.com.
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.240]   And we've all plugged our cruises.
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.240]   Yeah.
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:22.240]   Insidecruises.com for the, and are you going to do a Patagonia?
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.240]   Are you going to do that one or you're not?
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.240]   No.
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.240]   You're not on that one.
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.240]   I would love to though.
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:31.480]   I mean, there are a lot of people on these cruises have been pooped on like two or three
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:34.160]   or four of these Mac mania cruises.
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.680]   And a lot of it was just people talking about.
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:38.760]   So I read that this is what you have to do once you get to Antarctica and you have to
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:42.000]   have this camera will work, but you don't need that camera.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.680]   And I'm like, we shall, we're going to South.
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.480]   I was, which I was going to Antarctica.
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.840]   Well, what did you go?
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.600]   Co-tail captain, Neil, you want to come?
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:49.840]   He's probably like booked up now.
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.600]   Well, like I got drunk and I took a swing on him, like on day three.
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.600]   So I don't think that's.
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.600]   I don't, you know, I was really like.
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.600]   I was like, I was like, you can't go.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.600]   I was like, no, I'm going to shit.
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:03.600]   It's just a damn phone.
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.600]   It's a phone.
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:05.600]   It's a phone.
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.600]   It's a, it's a phone.
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.600]   It's something that guy from the Simpsons.
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.600]   He was a drunk guy, Barney.
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.600]   Hey, how are you?
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:14.560]   You got to do the lip wave when you, when you're built.
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:17.040]   So John Gruber has a great post, which I really like.
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:25.640]   And he's talking about the Engadget article that, that, you know, they go back and they
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:31.840]   look at court filings that Apple finally admits in the court filing.
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:38.480]   And the court filings are, by the way, from, from, I think last year, maybe two years ago,
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:44.880]   they're fairly old court filings that Apple admits, yes, we have a five year exclusive
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:48.760]   deal with, or we had a five year exclusive deal with AT&T.
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:53.160]   So of course, the headline everywhere and Gruber points this out is Apple confirms AT&T's
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:15:00.560]   iPhone exclusivity until 2012, but as Engadget points out, but is, of course, overlooked.
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.440]   Anything could have changed since then.
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.880]   Contracts aren't written in stone.
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:10.480]   And, and, and as Gruber says, you know, this is an example of the media just kind of not
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.600]   paying attention to the facts and so forth.
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:20.600]   And in fact, we're seeing now some information that indicates maybe there will be a Verizon
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.600]   iPhone at some point soon.
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:28.040]   Let me see if I can find that story.
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:32.800]   There was AT&T really been that bad for you, Leo.
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:33.800]   You know, I think AT&T.
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.560]   Oh boy, I'm going to get something.
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.400]   I think they might get a little bit of a bad rap.
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:40.040]   You know, they work fine for me.
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:43.120]   I mean, I drop more calls, I think, on AT&T.
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.880]   But maybe I'm just in the areas that I travel in.
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.520]   Maybe I'm just blanketed, but it's been fine.
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:54.240]   The only time AT&T has really screwed me is been at like NAB or where there's a lot of
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:55.240]   eye-count.
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:16:00.280]   Yeah, there's a large concentration of geeks, but you know, other than that, it's been okay.
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.560]   Andy, what about you?
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:06.040]   I'm, see, it's, in my opinion, doesn't matter.
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:09.440]   It depends on where you live and where you work.
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.800]   In New England, all the places where I hang out, I'm getting five bars of AT&T.
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.960]   I've had a few drop calls, but nothing to really raise my eyebrows.
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:21.440]   That said, I almost always have a Verizon phone somewhere in the house for testing.
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:25.440]   And I will say that I do get better coverage on Verizon.
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:31.560]   Sometimes God is looking out for a certain company because God realizes that, okay, Andy,
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:33.960]   Andy's reviewing a Verizon phone this week.
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:38.600]   I really want, I hate my AT&T coverage too, so let's really stick it to AT&T.
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.040]   Oh, you heard it first, folks.
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.040]   God hates AT&T.
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:46.040]   Andy, pay me attention to the Verizon van in front of your place with the antennas sticking
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.040]   up.
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:50.560]   And as the Bible says, as it is in heaven, so it is on earth.
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:56.000]   I was reviewing the droid and my car broke down like in the middle of the highway and
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.080]   on the side of the road, of course, I have an AT&T phone and the Verizon droid.
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:05.400]   Of course, no bars on AT&T, full five bar strength in the middle of nowhere on the side, shoulder
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.000]   of a highway on Verizon.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.880]   It's not such a big difference on the network that I would choose a phone based on which
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:13.880]   network I could use.
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:16.160]   I do think that AT&T drops more calls.
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.160]   I really do.
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:20.880]   Having said that, the 3G iPad is fine.
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:21.880]   That's the problem though.
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.680]   Why do I have to pay extra money when I'm already paying on my iPhone?
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:29.360]   So that gets me and then the fact that they still haven't enabled tethering.
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.360]   They said they would.
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.360]   It's been what?
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:32.360]   18 months, two years?
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.360]   Yeah, they said they would.
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.040]   They said they'd have it the end of last year, right?
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:39.680]   So it's like either jailbreak and you get it or, you know, you just screwed it.
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:42.880]   Well, I mean, there's no way around it.
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:43.880]   I have a MyFi.
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:44.880]   I like it a lot.
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:49.640]   It's $60 a month versus $30, what would be $30 a month for the iPad plus $20 a month
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:55.000]   for the iPhone, but the fact that I can use it on anything that I have, including multiples
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.880]   simultaneously makes it a good deal for me.
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.320]   Or is it a way to tether the iPad?
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:00.800]   There's a little kind of mini jailbreak.
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:02.040]   You can do the iPad to.
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:06.840]   Yeah, on the iPhone and the iPad, if you've jailbroken the phone, there are easy ways
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:10.680]   to enable tethering because that is a feature that's enabled internationally.
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:11.680]   It's just AT&T.
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:12.680]   Yeah, the capabilities there, right?
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:13.680]   It's the carrier.
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:14.680]   That's the only thing I'd want to do.
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:18.880]   You know, if I jailbroken my phone or my phone or the iPad is just to be able to tether it.
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:19.880]   Yeah.
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.880]   And I think that's going to be a really big problem for Apple in the future because when
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:27.400]   you plug the, I have the new HTC incredible that I'm going to be publishing with you up
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.760]   next week.
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:33.200]   And when you plug in USB, I plug it in by USB chiefly just to get pictures off of it.
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:36.680]   But the first thing it asks you is, oh, here are all the things I can do if I'm plugged
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:37.880]   in by USB.
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:39.760]   Would you like me to be an Internet source for you?
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:41.200]   I'm like, yes, I would.
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.200]   Very much.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.200]   Incredible.
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.840]   But unfortunately today, I just want to evaluate your photo.
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:46.840]   Don't that phone.
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:47.840]   I hate it.
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:49.400]   It's Android is great.
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.400]   A couple of stories.
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.280]   Let me get first to the Verizon story.
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.880]   This is from crunch gear.
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:19:00.520]   Landor Associates, the rumor goes working on an iPhone campaign for Verizon.
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:04.480]   The rumor mill is churning says crunch gear about a company called Landor Associates,
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.880]   which does very good stuff.
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:09.880]   By the way, we're going to an advertising campaign for Verizon.
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:14.760]   Landor has been working on Verizon branding since 2007 and is according to a tipster heart
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:18.600]   at work preparing for the iPhone HD launch.
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:22.040]   Is that what the 4G, the 4G iPhone is going to be the HD?
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:25.640]   I wonder what that phone is going to look like.
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:27.140]   Yeah.
[00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:31.120]   You saw the video, which really confirms it now, the video of them putting together the
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:34.080]   assembly of the case in the screen.
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:35.080]   Yeah.
[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:36.080]   And it's the same exact case.
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:37.080]   Is it?
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:38.080]   You know, the outside.
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.080]   Yeah.
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:40.720]   And you're, I think it was you who said it, Andy.
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:42.400]   It's the styling, the iPad styling.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.640]   It's the new style.
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.640]   And that makes sense.
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.640]   It's sort of a crisp edge.
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:46.640]   It probably wasn't me.
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.840]   I was the one who said that I don't know if that's going to be the final thing at all.
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:54.120]   But I'll tell you, once you see this video, let me see if I can find it for you.
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.280]   Chrome is gone, huh?
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.080]   So this whole Chrome edge thing is over.
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:58.080]   Yeah.
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.040]   We're going to have square edges.
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.480]   They show the assembly being put together.
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.640]   And there's just no way this thing is faked.
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:05.640]   Yeah.
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:06.640]   And I didn't think it was fake.
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:10.240]   I just didn't know if that was going to be the absolute final case design or not.
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.160]   Well, I don't know either.
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.360]   This is from smartphone medic.
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.400]   They do smartphone repairs.
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.040]   And let me make it full screen.
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:20.040]   You can see.
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:24.240]   I mean, he's actually putting the screen into the body of the case.
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.240]   It is very ipad-y.
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:28.760]   And yeah, it has that square feel.
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.240]   It is an LCD screen.
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:34.120]   I haven't seen this video before.
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.960]   This is the Gizmodo phone?
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:36.960]   No.
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:37.960]   Yeah.
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:41.760]   This is a completely separate company doing a completely separate thing.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.240]   Wait, but where did they get that prior?
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:47.480]   Well, as somebody pointed out, if you're going to ramp up for June production, there's
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.880]   a lot of people who have this now.
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:52.480]   But I mean, this is not fake.
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:53.480]   That's too good.
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.480]   Yeah, but that's I know it's not fake.
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.280]   I'm still wondering where they got it.
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.080]   That is one.
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:03.760]   I'm sure this will not cause us to lose our rating, but that is one ballsy thing to do.
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:04.760]   To show that.
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:05.760]   Yeah.
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:06.760]   Yeah.
[00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:07.760]   Wow.
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:10.000]   I have to admit upfront, I don't know what sort of things you have to sign in order to
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.920]   get the contract to fix things or make parts for things.
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:16.320]   But the last thing I would be doing.
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:20.120]   If I had any sort of a legitimate business relationship is to say, you know what, I'm
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:23.600]   going to post especially, especially knowing what happened with the last time one of these
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.520]   got out in the field without Apple's control.
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:26.520]   That's interesting.
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:27.920]   How to burn a bridge, right?
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:29.960]   And the front facing camera is in there.
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:34.080]   The split buttons for volume, the square metal case.
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:37.120]   And I don't know if smartphone medic has an excuse.
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:39.480]   You mean a defense?
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.480]   Defense.
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:44.040]   But boy, that's, I mean, the video is very clear.
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:49.720]   I would say there's no doubt whatsoever at this point that that's the 4G or the next
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:50.720]   whatever.
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:51.920]   Is it going to be called the HD?
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.720]   Why is that like the tech crunch?
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:57.880]   You just says, oh, the iPhone HD as if that's like accepted.
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:58.880]   I have no idea.
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:21:59.880]   I don't either.
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:05.400]   Anyway, that's also I think it's it's sort of like when they when they call the standard
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:09.920]   for 100 megabit ethernet fast ethernet, don't you feel like you're going to waste the word
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:13.480]   HD if you choose the use that for the first device?
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:14.840]   And which is not HD.
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:17.240]   And then if you do an HD device, then what do you say?
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.240]   Right.
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.240]   HD for real.
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.240]   True HD.
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.240]   Real HD.
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:22.240]   Yeah.
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.240]   We were lying last time.
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:27.680]   Are they still using a moniker in in the iTunes store for eight member?
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:31.080]   They were going to do the apps and brand them iPad apps with HD.
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:35.080]   Well, I don't know if was that official because I know a lot of apps are branded HD, but
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:36.080]   they're not HD either.
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:39.320]   So I don't mean 1024 by 768 is not what I call HD.
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:40.320]   Yeah.
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:41.320]   I don't know.
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.680]   It was like Epson when they started with their HD printers.
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.960]   It's like, it's not really hold on.
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:46.960]   Hold on there.
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:47.960]   Hold on.
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:50.760]   We're going to talk more about the iPad.
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:54.200]   The Apple has fired for file for a very interesting trademark.
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.880]   WWDC news.
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.160]   There's a lot to talk about today.
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:00.680]   We are blessed by Frederick Van Johnson.
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:02.880]   What are you doing now instead of Drobo?
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:03.880]   You know what?
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:04.880]   It's funny you asked that Leo.
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:05.880]   I started a company.
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:06.880]   Wow.
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:07.880]   What's it called?
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:08.880]   It's called media bytes.
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.880]   EY-T-E-S. Correct.
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:11.880]   Right on the first try.
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:13.360]   Mediabytes.com.
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:17.640]   So it's a social media marketing company for creatives.
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:18.960]   Like me.
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:23.920]   Only old farts like me and maybe Devorak would remember there used to be a tech news source
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:26.000]   called News Bites with the BY-T-E-S.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   Do you remember that?
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   I don't remember that.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   But I can imagine what kind of stuff.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   You'll hear from them.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   Bring it on.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.160]   You'll be hearing from them.
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.160]   Bring it on.
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:38.840]   No, I think they've got one of my favorite like old school relatives.
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:44.880]   Alex is a single CD ROM that contains every piece of news that News Bites published in
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.360]   the entire history of the service.
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:47.360]   Wow.
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:49.360]   And I'm not even sure they filled the entire CD.
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.360]   Probably not.
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:51.360]   It's all nothing but tech.
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.360]   So it's like a million articles.
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:54.360]   But it's like, okay, there you go.
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:55.760]   News Bites was it?
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:58.040]   In the early days, that was it.
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:23:59.040]   So that's good.
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:00.040]   Congratulations.
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:02.240]   Mediabytes.com are already taking on clients.
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:05.040]   So it's a, in fact, Rummel's full on clients.
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:07.520]   Actually, I have bad news for you, Frederick.
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.600]   We don't have people from companies on the shows and we don't have PR people on the
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:11.600]   show.
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.600]   So it's been nice having you and thank you so much.
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.480]   But, but it's marketing, Leo.
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.480]   Okay.
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:17.480]   Okay.
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:18.480]   Yeah.
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.480]   That's what David Spark keeps saying.
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:20.480]   I'm not in PR.
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:21.480]   I'm in marketing.
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:22.480]   It's different.
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:23.480]   It's different.
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:24.480]   Well, he confused me.
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.480]   It worked.
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:26.480]   All right.
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:27.480]   Let's take a break.
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:28.480]   We're going to come back.
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:30.160]   I'm going to do a little PR and marketing here for the folks at Citrix and their great product.
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:32.520]   Go to meeting.
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:33.760]   I don't have to tell you about go to me.
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:34.760]   I hope I don't have to.
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.520]   Certainly you've heard me talk about it.
[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:41.000]   My question for you is if you haven't tried it yet, why not go to meeting is a fantastic
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.640]   way to save time and money on business travel.
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:50.240]   You can have your meetings right from your own desk without flying anywhere.
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:55.240]   And I'm telling you, these are great meetings, whether, you know, you're working with an
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:57.480]   app developer in New Mexico.
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:02.320]   I'm not saying we are, but if you were, this is how this is how we would do it.
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.520]   What are you laughing at?
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:06.000]   I can't keep a secret.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.840]   Whether you're working with an app developer in New Mexico, a website developer in Poland,
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:13.800]   an agency in New York, a project manager in London, you just have these go to meetings
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:19.680]   and it's a great way, a great way to get more done more effectively without the traveling.
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:22.720]   You could set the meetings up in advance or even while you're on the phone if you have
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.160]   something to show them.
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:28.320]   And anything on your computer screen can be on their computer screen just like that,
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:31.200]   securely, quickly, easily.
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:34.080]   You get much of the same connectedness of being there without having to go there in
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:38.520]   person for product reviews and demos for sales presentations, for collaboration.
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:40.200]   That's mostly how we use it for training sessions.
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.400]   We even use them and go to meeting on our shows.
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.400]   Great.
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.400]   Max will use it to show screenshots.
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:45.960]   It's all right from his desk.
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:47.040]   Try it free for 30 days.
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:50.920]   Go to go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:53.080]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:54.920]   30 day trial.
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.120]   No cost, no obligation.
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:57.640]   I think you'll like it.
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:00.400]   www.go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:03.920]   We thank Citrix and the folks at Go to meeting for supporting.
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:05.680]   Mac break weekly.
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:13.400]   So not only did we get a date for WWDC last week, they sold out in just eight days.
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.920]   So if you're planning on going, I guess it's too late.
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:18.600]   Eight days with the increased price, right?
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:23.040]   Increased price and interestingly, lack of focus on Macintosh.
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:26.920]   And it's all, you know, for instance, the awards are now just iPad and iPhone.
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:31.280]   And I imagine the most of the talk there will be iPhone 4 and iPad development.
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:33.600]   I have to say I'm interested in iPad development.
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.800]   You know, I downloaded the SDK.
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:36.760]   I downloaded it.
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:38.760]   There's some great courses, Stanford.
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:39.320]   I'm in there.
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:39.760]   Yeah.
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:41.920]   Yeah, you have that for my tunes, you watching those.
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:42.600]   Yeah, they're great.
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.120]   They're awesome, free and free.
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:48.240]   Now, the only problem is they pull down the course material shortly after the class ends.
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.640]   Do you have a copy of the course material?
[00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:50.200]   Can I get it from you?
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:51.600]   You can.
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.360]   I think there's a website somewhere that archives it.
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.240]   They tell you that in the first class that they're going to pull them down.
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.000]   Get it right now.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:56.400]   Yeah.
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.000]   And I didn't because I just downloaded the class.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.720]   But that's a great way to learn.
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:00.200]   It is.
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:00.960]   It's awesome.
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:01.520]   It's awesome.
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:04.800]   And it lets me know that I don't want to be a developer.
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:08.400]   But it's helping me understand what they can build.
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.040]   Yeah.
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:11.960]   Because that's what I wanted to learn, just what the capabilities of the platform were.
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:15.120]   So I could tell because I'm having an app built and I want to see--
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:15.720]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:17.600]   I want to know how to communicate with the developer.
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:18.400]   So that's why I'm watching it.
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:19.920]   I want to write a custom--
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:23.320]   I want to write an in-house app for us.
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:23.800]   And--
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:24.800]   Don't you have one other channel?
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.080]   We have a public app.
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:29.000]   The Twitpad actually we have several, I think, coming as well.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.480]   But Twitpad is a great app, dollar app that lets you watch Twit Live.
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:36.960]   In fact, I encourage you if you have an iPad or an iPhone to search for Twit in the apps.
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:37.880]   I actually have that.
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:38.400]   I'm going to run it.
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.080]   Yeah, it's great.
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:40.080]   Well, don't run it.
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:41.360]   You know, because you use yourself.
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:42.640]   And you're like, hey, what are you doing?
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:43.000]   You'll be very confused.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.440]   By the way, do you see Frederick's set up here?
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:48.160]   So he has a MacBook 15 inch in front of him.
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:49.840]   And he brought an easel.
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:51.360]   And he has his iPad on the easel.
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:54.080]   What do you have the extra-- is the extra screen-- and look at that.
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:55.400]   So $4, $8 easel?
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:58.200]   This is a $7 easel from Target.
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:58.560]   Look at that.
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:27:59.560]   From Target.
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:01.360]   Is this-- and he uses rubber stoppers.
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:03.200]   I told him about your rubber stoppers.
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:06.800]   I've expanded my rubber, rubber, I used rubber stoppers for when I'm typing.
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:10.760]   And I use a $3 frame stand from AC Moore.
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:11.720]   That's my easel.
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.720]   You win.
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:16.280]   I see your $7.
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:19.240]   I have a $1 cardboard box.
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.040]   That's what they taught him about.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.800]   I have a branch that actually holds--
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:23.840]   You can afford nice things.
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.920]   You can afford nice things.
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:30.560]   Well, I still have my $45 EcoView case from Mark.
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:31.720]   I'm loving that case.
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:33.320]   That's my favorite right now.
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:37.320]   And I've done it-- oh, you can see I'm playing farm if I'll never mind.
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:39.080]   Actually, it was God of finger.
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:40.640]   But this-- yeah, I love this.
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:43.400]   It's leather, but it's eco leather.
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:46.280]   I think that means no cows were harmed in the making of it.
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:46.800]   Right.
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:48.120]   It was-- it's--
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:51.080]   I think it just means that the animal checked off the donor form.
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:51.920]   Donor box.
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:52.720]   That's it.
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:55.280]   Also, you don't care about the environment.
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.640]   I care about your own guilty feeling, so you're in the clear.
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:58.120]   There you go.
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:59.600]   Use my hide.
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:04.640]   We should mention that the Stanford course is one of many courses,
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:07.640]   Stanford and other universities-- Yale, MIT.
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:08.120]   Yeah.
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:09.440]   I'll put online on iTunes.
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:10.600]   You've got a great resource.
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:11.480]   And they're free.
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:12.040]   It's awesome.
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:13.600]   I mean, you know it's a whole different experience.
[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.400]   I mean, you can watch it on your computer, of course.
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.240]   You can watch it on your iPhone, of course.
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:18.400]   But watch it on the iPad.
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:18.920]   Exactly.
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:20.560]   While you're sitting there, it's just--
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:23.040]   Well, you know what I did is I have it on my iPad here.
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:26.120]   And I have the SD-- I have Xcode running on my laptops.
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:27.400]   That was kind of one of my concerns,
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:28.560]   was, well, how am I going to do both?
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:29.320]   It's perfect.
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:29.820]   Yeah.
[00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:30.160]   It's perfect.
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:31.240]   It's like having a little TV--
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:32.520]   little personal TV set.
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:33.960]   Little instructor in your pocket.
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.040]   You could pause it and do all of that stuff.
[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:36.800]   That'll be like--
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:40.000]   So if you were going to go to WWDC, no to a link.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.400]   It sold out.
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:43.760]   They didn't say how many tickets were available.
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:47.240]   June 7th through the 11th Moscone West downtown, San Francisco,
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.560]   we weren't planning on covering it.
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:49.560]   But now that it's sold out, you see,
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:51.560]   they don't let the press into the conference.
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:53.600]   You can go to the keynote.
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.720]   So maybe we'll-- if Apple will let me in.
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:58.000]   Maybe Frederick, could you go for me?
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.280]   I don't think Apple is stringed for you.
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:02.880]   Apple's going to let me in anymore of their events
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:04.200]   after the incident.
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.280]   Wait a minute.
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:06.280]   What-- what did you do?
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:09.400]   You've seen the pictures of me at the iPad announcement.
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:11.200]   No, the last thing I saw of you online,
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:13.280]   you were crowd surfing itself by self-wast.
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:14.840]   That was later, yeah.
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:17.920]   I had-- well, I wasn't-- no, first of all,
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:18.680]   I signed nothing.
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.200]   They didn't tell me you couldn't brag us.
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:21.440]   If they had told me I wouldn't have,
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:22.840]   but nobody said anything.
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:26.680]   So Steve's talking and we're trying to cover it.
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:27.800]   Were you there any covering it?
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:30.040]   I think you're part of the coverage, right?
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:31.480]   I wasn't with you.
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.720]   I was sitting in the back.
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:36.280]   So I thought, well, what the heck?
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:39.120]   And I held up my laptop, turned it towards Steve.
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.480]   OK, yeah.
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.480]   I saw that picture.
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:43.760]   Yeah, I apparently Steve did too,
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:45.520]   because I haven't heard from him in days.
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:46.040]   Yeah.
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:46.800]   Anyway, I don't know.
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:47.200]   We'll see.
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:47.960]   Maybe not.
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:49.600]   I don't know.
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:50.480]   You're on the blacklist.
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.080]   Well, I'm not saying I am.
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:53.560]   I'm not saying I'm not.
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:54.280]   I'm just saying.
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:55.000]   No fly list.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.400]   Haven't received any invitations lately.
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:30:59.640]   Let's put it that way.
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:00.000]   So Apple--
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:00.840]   So Apple--
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:01.120]   So Apple--
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:04.000]   Apple files for a very interesting trademark.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.120]   Pattonley Apple, by the way, is a great website
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:10.560]   to follow Apple's patent and trademark applications.
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:11.720]   Now, I have to say, and we really
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:14.560]   should give you this caveat before we talk about any of this
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:14.880]   stuff.
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:17.040]   I don't often talk about Apple's patent applications,
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:19.320]   because like most big companies, they patent everything.
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:21.000]   It doesn't mean they're going to make it.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.680]   Trademark's a little different.
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.320]   You don't normally trademark something
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:26.880]   unless you really think you're going to use it.
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:31.960]   They just trademarked, and I'm so excited, iTunes Live.
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:34.040]   Look at that meme, though.
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:35.320]   Is it a concert series?
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.080]   Well, remember they bought La La.
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:39.280]   They bought La La.
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:39.960]   What do you think Andy?
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:42.280]   You think that means they'll do an on demand subscription
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:43.240]   service?
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:44.840]   I think it could be just about anything.
[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:45.760]   I think it's huge.
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:47.240]   That's why I don't follow Patton finally.
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:49.680]   It says, online retail store services
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:50.840]   in the field of entertainment.
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:52.760]   Because when you file for a trademark,
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:54.760]   you have to say what category it's in.
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:55.920]   Yeah.
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:56.440]   Yeah.
[00:31:56.440 --> 00:32:00.320]   I mean, this might be a little bit better
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:02.480]   than other usual trademark and patent filings,
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:05.560]   because conceivably, they don't have
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:08.560]   to protect that named for vague future use,
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:12.000]   because if anybody tried to create a trademark with iTunes,
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.800]   the word iTunes in it, they probably--
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:14.720]   They own iTunes.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:15.840]   --would boost that whole whole whole whole whole whole.
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:17.240]   So you could put live after iTunes.
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:18.440]   That's not going to do anything for you.
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:20.840]   This, by the way, this is not a graphic created by Patton
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:21.280]   Lee Apple.
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:22.880]   This is in the trademark filing.
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:26.360]   This iTunes with a stylized spray painted live.
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:27.120]   Ah, OK.
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:29.080]   So this is probably just a prank by Banksy.
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:34.840]   That's screen grabs going to be worth 80,000 dollars.
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:35.680]   Hope.
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:38.600]   I hope live will live.
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.600]   And you know, it might be-- by the way,
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:42.960]   they didn't trademark how you pronounce it.
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:45.640]   It could be iTunes Live.
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:48.320]   Did you ever think of that?
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:49.440]   I don't think so.
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.640]   Nothing to say.
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:53.320]   It allows you to post your bucket list as an iMacs.
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:54.320]   Live.
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:55.320]   I will live.
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:57.640]   Yeah, watch me live for this next eight days.
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:59.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:00.140]   Sorry.
[00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:03.040]   With counting crows, top number three hit.
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:06.600]   As long as we're doing rumors, I might as well mention
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:12.040]   the rumor from Mac Daily News that the Mobile Me service may
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:13.480]   be free to all.
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:16.960]   You know, it's $99 a year.
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:19.120]   I pay for it, but I know a lot of people look at it and say,
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:20.760]   that's just too damn expensive.
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:22.680]   I use it for address book context thinking.
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:23.160]   That's it.
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:24.880]   Yeah, that's a lot for that.
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:25.880]   Yeah.
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:26.560]   It is.
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:27.200]   But I--
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:27.680]   This is real.
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:29.320]   You don't use iDISC.
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:30.440]   There's cheaper and better.
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:32.240]   I'm using Dropbox instead of iDISC.
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:34.160]   Exactly.
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:36.440]   Google does the sync stuff, frankly, better.
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:38.320]   Exactly.
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:41.240]   According to Mac Daily News and their source,
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:43.360]   Mobile Me will become free of charge, quote,
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:47.240]   sooner than later depends on certain facilities
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:48.280]   going operational.
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:51.320]   And of course, probably means that server farm we've
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:55.400]   been talking about, that Apple's building in North Carolina.
[00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:58.120]   In fact, aerial footage--
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:59.920]   I'd like to know which Apple rumor
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:01.800]   blog rented the plane--
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:04.400]   The helicopter.
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:05.520]   For the aerial footage--
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.640]   This is on YouTube, but I don't know who's saying--
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:13.920]   There it is.
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:15.640]   In North Carolina.
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:17.840]   Wow, it's almost done.
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:21.000]   Well, the traffic down at Apple's facility in North Carolina
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.360]   is a little slow and go.
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:25.960]   We've got a fender bender right in the north end of the--
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:28.000]   The facility.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.120]   Look at that.
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:30.120]   In the middle of nowhere.
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:32.920]   Looks like it's in a swamp.
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:34.840]   It might be Dick Cheney's residence.
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:36.480]   So somebody said-- and I think they're right--
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:40.200]   this live thing could be concerts, not streaming.
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:41.040]   It could be concerts.
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:41.920]   That'll make them, yeah.
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:43.960]   Maybe you'd buy concerts online, huh?
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:44.640]   Yeah.
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:46.480]   And that would-- the data center--
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:48.720]   that's the problem is that the data center mobile Me
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:50.280]   maybe, but there are so many other things,
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:53.680]   including streaming content that would make more sense.
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:55.800]   They could be using it for pay-per-view events.
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:58.760]   I know that there have been other streaming companies
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:34:59.880]   that have been making moves there.
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:05.120]   We can buy traditional live pay-per-view sports content
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:08.960]   that you get on the cable channels via their streaming
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:09.600]   media service.
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:13.240]   So that's just one other thing that this could be.
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:17.320]   1995, get Don King's latest little dance remix
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:19.600]   at a theater.
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:23.920]   Somewhere I have a tech TV video of Don King plugging tech TV,
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:25.920]   but while he's plugging in, his holding up
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:30.520]   a sign that says the next fight that he's promoting.
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:31.960]   So walking better at it.
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:36.080]   The best we could do is get into plug tech TV.
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:37.800]   So do you credit the idea that mobile Me
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:40.120]   might be free, Andy?
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:43.320]   They might break out certain features of it and make it free,
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:46.200]   like mobile Me sinking or find my iPhone.
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:47.520]   Because those are the ones that you
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:48.720]   don't have to explain to people.
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:52.120]   It makes the Mac and the iPhone into a much more compelling
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:53.120]   product.
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:55.120]   And there are other things that are harder to configure
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:57.640]   and harder to really sell and actually
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:59.720]   cost them a lot more money to support,
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:03.040]   like mobile Me galleries and even the iDISK.
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:06.880]   I don't know what they would do to make it up to everybody
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:09.680]   who's just spent 100 bucks to renew their mobile Me account.
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:12.280]   But I wouldn't be surprised if they did things like sinking
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:14.840]   and find my iPhone.
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:16.600]   Yeah.
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:17.440]   Well, we'll see.
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:19.680]   I guess we'll find out at some point.
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:22.680]   Andy wrote an article on the iPad and how it's holding up
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:24.600]   now after one month.
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:25.800]   We'll get to that.
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:28.520]   Talk a little bit about the iPad.
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:30.800]   Also, some more news about the iPhone.
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:31.840]   A lot more coming up.
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:34.080]   You're listening to Mac break weekly.
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:35.720]   We're glad you're here.
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:36.960]   Don't forget you can't watch the show.
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:38.680]   We do it live now.
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:39.600]   Now.
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.720]   Before we were dead.
[00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:44.520]   But now, now we're alive when we do the show.
[00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:47.520]   We do it every Tuesday at 2 p.m.
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:51.400]   Eastern time 11 a.m. Pacific 1800 UTC at live.tv.
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:52.960]   So come and watch.
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.880]   You're invited to join us.
[00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:57.160]   And of course, you can get video now, the show.
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:58.200]   It's interesting.
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:00.520]   I was a little nervous about putting out video of the show
[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:01.280]   to be honest.
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:02.200]   You want it?
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:05.760]   I thought it might cannibalize the audio listeners.
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:06.640]   And what have you seen?
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:10.440]   It did a little bit, but there is also an overall growth of,
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:11.840]   I think 20 or 30%.
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:13.400]   We're up to almost 100,000.
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:14.360]   By doing both.
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:14.920]   Yeah.
[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:15.520]   Awesome.
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:17.760]   So I think it's--
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:18.960]   I just saw the numbers.
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:25.600]   I think we were getting 75,000 audio only listeners per show.
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:27.520]   This is unique listeners per show.
[00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:30.040]   And I think it went down to 65,000.
[00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:32.960]   But then we also have another 30,000 video download.
[00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:34.240]   So it's a total of 95,000.
[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:34.840]   It's insane.
[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:35.440]   Isn't that great?
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:36.680]   That's really good.
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:38.120]   Kudos to you, doze.
[00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:41.400]   Andy, you're not good.
[00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:43.760]   Thank you very much.
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:44.240]   I'm sorry.
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:45.240]   I was just--
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:47.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:51.240]   I was taking a moment to catch up on my Twitter feed,
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:53.160]   because sometimes people say interesting things to us on Twitter.
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:53.680]   No, no.
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:54.720]   I shouldn't have bothered you.
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:56.520]   I should know a man who's Twittering.
[00:37:56.520 --> 00:38:01.960]   No, no, because he just said that the iTunes Live graphic has been
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:04.680]   used for a while, and they're live from Apple Store concerts.
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:06.160]   Oh, fudge.
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:08.240]   Search on iTunes Music Store.
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:08.600]   And it's there.
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:11.520]   I was just tapping over to the iTunes Music Store to take a look for it.
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:15.440]   Bit again, bit again by those silly rumors.
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:15.960]   Yeah.
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:18.480]   I know I'd heard that before for live events.
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:23.400]   There was a stage at Live 8 or a stage somewhere in the UK
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:24.560]   that was referring to the--
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:25.640]   I had the iTunes Music Festival.
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:32.200]   I don't-- it was definitely triggering a long latent memory there.
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:32.800]   Long live.
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:35.600]   Yeah, iTunes Live from Soho, iTunes Live from--
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:39.480]   I thought you were stunned because I rhymed in Otco with something.
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:40.000]   Oh, did you?
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.160]   Oh, just say it again.
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:42.640]   He's like, what was that?
[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:44.560]   Say nothing rhymes with an Otco.
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:45.760]   All right.
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:48.040]   Let's take a little break and talk about--
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:48.960]   Yeah, there it is.
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:51.800]   You see it, iTunes Live from Soho, Taylor Swift, Adele--
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:52.880]   And it's that same logo.
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.320]   --counting crows, Kings of Leon Wright.
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:57.080]   It's like stenciled on the upper corner of the album art.
[00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:58.080]   Uh-huh.
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:38:59.080]   So it's there everywhere.
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:38:59.480]   Look at that.
[00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:00.760]   Through you patently, Apple.
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:01.240]   Look at that.
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:02.600]   Journalistic--
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:04.760]   You see, just a little diligence right there.
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:06.240]   Yeah, see, I'm very diligent.
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:07.160]   All I got to do is Twitter at--
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:08.960]   Twitter is the key.
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:11.360]   It's all crowdsourcing journalism.
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:13.200]   All about the Twitter, baby.
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:14.280]   All about the Twitter.
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:14.640]   All right.
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:15.240]   That's awesome.
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:16.960]   It's just made, baby.
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:18.160]   You don't want to know.
[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:20.760]   Let's take a little break to hear a little bit
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:22.880]   about those great friends from the company.
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:25.360]   Put all of your stuff on a job.
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:27.200]   And what's all your stuff on a Drobo?
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:28.800]   The Data Robotics Corporation would
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:32.880]   like to encourage you to check out the newest Drobo's,
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:35.480]   the original Drobo, of course, with four disc bays.
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:39.880]   Great for home users to store videos, movies,
[00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:41.360]   your photo collection.
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:43.600]   The new Drobo S with five disc bays,
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:45.680]   with higher performance for creative professionals.
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:48.840]   The Drobo Pro for small businesses and creative teams,
[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:53.800]   eight disc bays to make a total of 16 TB,
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:55.600]   although I think you go a lot larger.
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:57.960]   The newest Drobo elite with eight disc bays.
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.680]   And we have a Drobo--
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:02.640]   we have two Drobo FSs here in the studio now.
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:03.760]   I'm going to take one home.
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:04.240]   Get this.
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.080]   This is wild.
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:09.880]   The FS is an eight-bay Drobo, am I right?
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:11.440]   The FS is five-base.
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:12.520]   Five-base.
[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:13.880]   But it has two processors.
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:16.880]   It runs Linux.
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:17.640]   Man, wait a minute.
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:18.320]   It's pronounced Linux.
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:20.720]   Hello, my name is Linus Torvalds.
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:22.000]   And I pronounce Linux.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   Linux, Linux.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.840]   It runs Linux on the Drobo.
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:27.920]   And that way, so we can--
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:30.560]   this is wild.
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:31.880]   You hook it up to ethernet.
[00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:33.560]   It's got two gigabit ethernet ports on it.
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:35.480]   You hook it one.
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:38.680]   So glad you're here.
[00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:39.920]   One, well, what's the one with two?
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:41.120]   Is that the elite?
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:42.480]   That's the elite, yeah.
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:44.000]   Elite has two.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.920]   Two gigabit ethernet ports.
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:48.160]   See now, when you say it sounds like they're--
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.680]   that it's a two gigabit port.
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:53.960]   No, it's two ports each a gigabit, right?
[00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:54.440]   Yes.
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:55.480]   Thank you, sir.
[00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:57.800]   See, if you weren't here, I'd have screwed this ad up
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:01.280]   something awful.
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:05.760]   Anyway, we got the file, the FS, which is like Drobo's--
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:07.520]   basically, it's an ass.
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:08.680]   And I'm going to have one at home,
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:09.960]   and I'm going to have one.
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:11.040]   What are you laughing at?
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:11.640]   I'm not laughing.
[00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:12.000]   That was handy.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:12.880]   Somebody's laughing.
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:14.560]   Somebody's snorting.
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:17.480]   Well, you see, perhaps you want to say it's an--
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:19.080]   than an audible space, NAS.
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:22.120]   It says, it's an ass.
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:22.800]   But that's just me.
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:23.920]   I don't do the commercials.
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:26.320]   Cue the jingle singers, will you, please?
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:30.640]   All of your stuff on Drobo.
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:32.680]   Let's start that ad one more time.
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:33.120]   So anyway--
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:33.640]   It's an ass.
[00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:34.560]   Woo hoo.
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:36.160]   It's an ass.
[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:39.680]   It's an-- forget it.
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:40.960]   I'm interrupting commerce here.
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:41.280]   I should--
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:42.600]   No, no, there's no commerce.
[00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:43.320]   Are you kidding?
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:44.880]   You think we're going to get paid for this ad?
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:47.880]   No freaking way at this point.
[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:52.400]   This is what we call it in the trade, a bonus spot.
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:54.720]   So the Drobo FS, I'm going to have one here, one there,
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:57.840]   and the Drobo FS will back up all our stuff
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:59.120]   and then send it up to my house.
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:00.240]   So it's got off site as well.
[00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:01.120]   It's really kind of cool.
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:02.880]   I don't understand what it's calling magic.
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:03.400]   It's magic.
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:03.800]   It's magic.
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:04.760]   It's kind of magic.
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:05.560]   It's magic.
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:08.640]   And the Drobo Elite with eight bays supports ice,
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:10.760]   because we are also using that.
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:11.640]   I think we've got to--
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:15.120]   I think we're going to be in all Drobo House.
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:16.840]   If you want to get a deal on Drobo,
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:20.520]   go to Drobo.com/macbreak.
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:26.080]   We've got coupon codes, instant rebates from $75 to $500,
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:27.520]   depending on--
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:29.200]   are you laughing at me again?
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:31.200]   Depending on what you buy.
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:32.200]   Data, Robo.
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:33.040]   That's wrong.
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:34.080]   Data, Robo.
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:36.360]   It's D-- oh, God.
[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:38.240]   This ad's going down the tubes.
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:39.960]   DROBO.
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:40.560]   Drobo.
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:41.080]   There you go.
[00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:42.560]   Drobo.com/macbreak.
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:43.560]   I believe that's correct.
[00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:45.280]   That is correct.
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:46.920]   Did you have anything to do with this division
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:48.800]   when you were working at Drobo?
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:50.200]   With the-- which division?
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:51.960]   The ad division.
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:53.600]   Can you intercede?
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:54.800]   I knew that.
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:55.360]   I knew it.
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:55.800]   I knew it.
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:56.280]   I knew it.
[00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:57.920]   Can you intercede a little bit?
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:42:59.520]   Just tell him I'm trying.
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:00.280]   He's watching.
[00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:00.920]   Oh, dear.
[00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:01.920]   Is that Mark?
[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:02.480]   Oh, Mark.
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:03.000]   I love it.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.840]   Mark's a very nice guy.
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:06.680]   Go to Drobo.com/macbreak.
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:08.600]   And then, by the way, if you purchase
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:12.400]   the coupon code MACBreakWeekly, all caps
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:16.000]   for those $75 to $500 rebates on the populated Drobo's.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.920]   I just-- I'm blown away by what you guys have done.
[00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:19.960]   Not you guys anymore.
[00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:20.320]   Yeah.
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:21.400]   Those guys.
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:22.280]   The cleaning lady.
[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:23.120]   OK.
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:23.920]   Little Drobo store.
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:25.480]   I have the original Drobo at home.
[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:27.720]   That's what I used to back up my Macs.
[00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:31.480]   And you know, it's got that great magnetic front,
[00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:32.200]   which is so cool.
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:33.800]   It makes it-- you just pull it right off,
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:35.160]   put it-- you know, repopulate it.
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:37.920]   If you upgrade, put it in another drive in, or whatever.
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:39.840]   And I think the cleaning lady knocked it off.
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:42.000]   And I'm sure she thought she broke it,
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.160]   because it was carefully put aside.
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:47.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:48.680]   I'm not going to try--
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:50.320]   I was like, I'm not going to try to fix this.
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:51.400]   I don't know what happened.
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:54.240]   So I have to explain to her, no, no, it's magnetic.
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:55.720]   You know, you probably knocked it off,
[00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:57.480]   and that just goes right back on.
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:58.480]   I love the Drobo.
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:01.560]   You're going to-- Drobo.com/macbreak.
[00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:04.000]   Do you think if I play two different jingles, they'll
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:04.760]   like me more?
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:05.280]   They will.
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:05.780]   Yeah.
[00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:06.280]   They will.
[00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:08.000]   This is for you, Mark Fucchio.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   Oh, Drobo.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.320]   [MUSIC - DROPY, DROPY, DROPY, DROPY, DROPY, DROPY, DROPY]
[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:14.520]   Thank you very much, everybody.
[00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:15.840]   I love-- you know, when I play the jingles,
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:17.280]   I feel like we're doing old-time radio.
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:18.880]   That's what I like about that.
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:22.480]   I think I lapsed into Wally Blue for a moment there.
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:25.840]   Well, Wally Blue here, broadcasting from the--
[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:26.880]   No one jingles for Twi--
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:30.000]   --from historic Bath Bay Bay.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.040]   The world's famous sub-breed racers.
[00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:33.160]   Exactly.
[00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:35.400]   You must be a fan.
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:37.720]   Oh, huge fan.
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:40.040]   I can't tell how happy I was just a few weeks ago,
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:41.520]   where there was an interview in the New York--
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:43.880]   a piece in the New York Times with Bob Elliott,
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:45.040]   his son Chris Elliott.
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:45.680]   I saw that.
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:46.680]   Yeah.
[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:49.120]   Or his granddaughter, who's a cast member,
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:52.320]   and star in that live, because when Bob Elliott retired,
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:53.480]   he retired.
[00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:55.640]   And also, he wasn't like-- it's not like he was Bob Hooper,
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:58.280]   something where he keeps popping up for benefits or something.
[00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:01.280]   So it was great to know that he was like 85, 86.
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:03.600]   It was great to just know that he was still around.
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:04.600]   You know, it was--
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:09.480]   and it was a picture of them in their fishing cabin.
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:10.680]   It was just so cool.
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:11.920]   It was so cool.
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:14.200]   And you could see why Chris Elliott-- what's his daughter's name?
[00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:16.120]   I didn't know she was in Saturday Night Live.
[00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:17.440]   That's why I don't know her name.
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:19.600]   Is it Missy Elliott?
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:21.160]   No.
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:25.880]   No, actually, she often gets confused with her partner left eye,
[00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:26.160]   yes.
[00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:27.160]   Missy Mr. Meener.
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:28.200]   Missy Mr. Meener.
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:28.760]   There you go.
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:31.280]   Did you see Conan's video at Google apparently was very good?
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:31.880]   I did not see it.
[00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:32.560]   No.
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:33.480]   Apparently, there's a--
[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:34.320]   He was just--
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:35.000]   Did you tour in the place?
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:36.440]   Or did you do a little Google talk or something?
[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:37.320]   He gave it to Google Talk.
[00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:37.840]   Really?
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:38.840]   Yeah.
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:40.560]   I guess I could just play it.
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:41.960]   Have you done that yet?
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:45.720]   We started-- YouTube has an automatic--
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:47.880]   I think there's an automatic thing that goes through videos
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:49.240]   and looks for copyright violations,
[00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:52.280]   because now a number of our videos have been flagged.
[00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:55.520]   And there was one video where I replayed a--
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:56.880]   and by the way, we're a news show.
[00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:58.480]   So there's fair use--
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:45:59.840]   if we're using it for news coverage,
[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:01.640]   there's fair use for this stuff.
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:05.320]   And I showed a BBC--
[00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:07.720]   a clip from a BBC thing that was about--
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:09.600]   I can't remember what it was, but it was something technical.
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:10.400]   And it was appropriate.
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:12.440]   It was-- you know, it's part of our news coverage.
[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:16.080]   Just as it's-- and I say that as a preface to this,
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:19.920]   Conan O'Brien at Google, right from YouTube,
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:21.400]   as a matter of fact.
[00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:23.000]   He enters with a bagpipe.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.680]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:28.160]   Oh, the pipers, it's on.
[00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:31.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:33.280]   I'd like to enter this show with a bagpipe.
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:35.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:39.040]   Leo, what are you going to pay to be your--
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:41.000]   You've never invited me.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.440]   Now that Colleen works for Google, maybe I'll get--
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:45.640]   There you go.
[00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:47.280]   OK, this is going on a little bit long.
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:47.560]   Yeah.
[00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:48.880]   OK.
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:49.480]   There he is.
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:50.560]   Anyway, you know what's nice?
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:51.640]   We don't actually have to watch it.
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:54.920]   We could just read the captions.
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:57.880]   Yeah, but sometimes those captions are.
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:46:59.720]   I think these were hand done.
[00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:00.280]   Big though?
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:02.200]   Yeah, because I don't think the captioner would
[00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:03.240]   get Vic-Kundrith right.
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:04.800]   It's on Google called Adori.
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:06.360]   It basically allows Adori.
[00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:07.400]   It's an internal name.
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:08.760]   You don't need to know what it is.
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:11.200]   But it allows-- it allows--
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:12.120]   It allows--
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:12.960]   It was condescending, man.
[00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:15.600]   I've ever met.
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:18.800]   Hey, don't you worry about it.
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:22.600]   You just relax and let the search engine do the work.
[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:23.760]   OK, we got 45 minutes.
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:24.600]   We're just getting started.
[00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:25.920]   Just wait.
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:27.160]   I've got nowhere else to go.
[00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:28.600]   That's right.
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:29.280]   I'm here for the day.

[00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:34.480]   I like everybody.
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:37.720]   Are you all dancing?
[00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:41.160]   When Morris Day and the Time come out, you kids are young.
[00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:43.360]   You'll figure it out soon.
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:46.600]   So Googlers or G-Men--
[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:47.440]   And ladies.
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:49.200]   And ladies submitted a bunch of questions.
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:50.560]   Yes, it's a very Democrat.
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:51.920]   It's actually a great appearance.
[00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:52.320]   Who wants that?
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:54.240]   Yeah, it's really, really funny.
[00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:55.720]   And I can't remember why that came up.
[00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:58.120]   Why did I mention Conan O'Brien Google?
[00:47:58.120 --> 00:47:58.800]   I don't know.
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:47:59.480]   I have no idea.
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:00.480]   Let's move on.
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:01.840]   Because you're talking about taking down copyright
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:02.680]   or videos off YouTube?
[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:04.800]   No, I did that before I played the video so that YouTube
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:06.960]   wouldn't give me a hard time for playing the video of Conan
[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:10.080]   O'Brien at Google.
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:12.400]   But I doubt very much that that indemnified me
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:13.600]   in any way whatsoever.
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:16.200]   New MacBook Air, what do you think?
[00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:18.640]   You know why they're doing a new MacBook Air?
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:21.480]   Because I just bought a 15-inch.
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:23.000]   And I wanted an air.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:23.880]   Why do you need an air?
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:25.000]   Because I like how light it is.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.840]   But you know now with the iPad, I don't really need an air.
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:28.080]   There's your air right there.
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:29.280]   It's lighter than air.
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:31.000]   Do you think they will update the air given that they've
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   got the iPad now?
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   I don't know.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.520]   I mean, I know people with the air that
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:38.640]   are haven't cracked it open in a while because they have an iPad.
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:39.960]   This is from Macworld Magazine.
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:44.680]   They're quoting their source, a well-placed source familiar
[00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:48.840]   with Apple inventory levels and product refreshes.
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:51.280]   Same person who correctly predicted the MacBook Pro
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:53.640]   updates a week before they arrived.
[00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:57.480]   He talked to Australian Macworld after finding a new product
[00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:00.560]   number in the Apple database.
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:10.000]   MC516LL stroke AK87 better BTR dash USA.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.920]   Ha ha!
[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:13.280]   It must be a--
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:14.480]   I stand corrected.
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:15.400]   Must be a Macworld Air.
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:18.200]   You scared me with that.
[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:21.360]   I was having a conversation with somebody last week
[00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:24.200]   about the air because we're sort of going back and forth
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:26.920]   about why do they even bother making this apart
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:30.040]   from making a really tiny, tiny, tiny notebook?
[00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:34.760]   Given that it has such problems in delivering performance
[00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:38.120]   over a long haul, unless you've got it sitting on top of a bag
[00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:41.320]   of ice to keep it so cool that it will run as true speed,
[00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:42.680]   given that it's so expensive.
[00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:44.000]   And one of the ideas we'd come up with
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.520]   was that this was not only designed to be a viable product
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:50.560]   in and of itself, but also to test all kinds of techniques
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:52.720]   for building the next generation of MacBooks.
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:55.120]   The idea of a unibody Mac with a sealed-in battery,
[00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:57.920]   sealed-in everything to make sure they knew how to actually
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:49:59.680]   design these sort of things without affecting
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:01.480]   the bread and butter parts of the line.
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:04.840]   I think that obviously a refresh of the air
[00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:06.320]   has to-- if it doesn't come out soon,
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:08.080]   then we pretty much know that Apple--
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:09.640]   this is going to be another one of their little hobbies,
[00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:10.120]   isn't it?
[00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:10.480]   Right.
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:10.960]   Where it's--
[00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:11.480]   That's right.
[00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:14.520]   --the air is more of a hobby than a modern product.
[00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:17.840]   Now this tipster said it would come out today by now, maybe.
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:18.280]   I don't know.
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:19.840]   And it's not out yet as we record.
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:22.080]   I stand corrected.
[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:23.240]   Are you the tipster?
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:24.120]   Are you?
[00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:25.320]   I think hobby is the new beta.
[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:29.120]   Do you have intimate connections to the Apple inventory
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:31.480]   levels and product refreshes?
[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:32.040]   Andy, you know--
[00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:34.720]   Unless you're talking about Debbie, the dispatcher
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:37.320]   at the Waffle, Massachusetts Apple, Retail Depot.
[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:37.840]   No.
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:41.760]   So we got sidelined by a Skype-asaurus issue.
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:43.600]   Yes, she'll tell you.
[00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:48.360]   But do you have thoughts about one month in on the Apple iPad?
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.120]   And it's a couple of different things.
[00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:53.000]   Number one, a lot of practical issues
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.880]   that really don't come up until you've used it for about a month.
[00:50:55.880 --> 00:51:00.840]   Also, I had the minor handicap of when I wrote my main review,
[00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:05.720]   it was based on almost a week and a half of use of the iPads.
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:06.520]   I had it early.
[00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:08.280]   But it also meant that it was almost
[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:11.560]   like entirely done inside because I couldn't use it in public.
[00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:13.680]   And so one thing I really think I had to correct
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:15.080]   was the difference.
[00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:17.040]   I had to really sort of roll back my opinions
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:19.400]   of the screen a little bit, where in the original review,
[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:21.280]   I said that it was a glossy screen,
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:22.920]   and that's a problem in some circumstances.
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:24.640]   I'm not really a deal breaker.
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:27.160]   Now that I've been able to take it out for 30 days,
[00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:28.720]   I know that, yeah, that's kind of a problem,
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:31.160]   because now there's so many circumstances under which
[00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:34.640]   it's just not even useful due to the glare.
[00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:36.600]   They're too in particular.
[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:39.280]   One, I should say that day one of the crews,
[00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:40.760]   there were four of us around a table.
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:42.680]   All four of us had iPads.
[00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:44.120]   Three of us had brought along.
[00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:47.040]   In addition to the iPad, our kindles and our Sony readers,
[00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:50.320]   because we knew that we want to read the books outside
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:52.440]   and on the beach, and that it was not going to be happening
[00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:53.640]   on an iPad.
[00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:56.240]   That's one area which you definitely need an eink display.
[00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:58.160]   But the second thing came just a couple of days
[00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:00.480]   before I left when my iPad 3G, this is the one
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:04.440]   that actually ordered back in March, arrived.
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:07.720]   And I really couldn't resist turning on the GPS
[00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:08.800]   and taking it off for a drive.
[00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:12.080]   I jurried like a car mount for it with Velcro
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:15.360]   and Velcro in a couple of clamps and some duct tape.
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:19.320]   And I have a beta of an unreleased GPS car navigator
[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:20.600]   for the iPad.
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:22.920]   And it was like four in the afternoon, maybe five
[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:23.520]   in the afternoon.
[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:24.520]   I was driving around with it.
[00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:27.200]   And within 10 or 15 minutes, I sort of turned--
[00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:28.920]   I just reached over and turned it off,
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:31.080]   because there are just too many circumstances in which I
[00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:34.000]   would want to glance over to take a look to see what's
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   the next turn coming up.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:36.800]   And the glare off, it was just so bad,
[00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:37.560]   it was just unreadable.
[00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:39.640]   I would have to be sort of leaning over and just
[00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:42.320]   looking really carefully to get past that.
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:45.880]   Obviously, at night, it worked awesome, especially when
[00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:48.920]   you have a heads up display mode on an iPhone app,
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:50.400]   to scale up to 2X.
[00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:52.840]   The kind where it produces a mirror image
[00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:54.800]   of your navigation information.
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:56.680]   They just simply drop it inside the dashboard.
[00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:59.880]   It reflects backwards up into your windshield.
[00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:02.360]   And so you get this tactical animated heads up display
[00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:05.480]   that's sort of floating over the hood of your car.
[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:06.280]   That works great.
[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:10.760]   But if you would want to use an iPad as a car navigator,
[00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:13.800]   or as one of those center console computers,
[00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:15.720]   unless you're going to install it inside a hood
[00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:17.400]   or make some sort of arrangement for that,
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:18.680]   that's just not going to work.
[00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:20.920]   So that's one thing they really wanted to sort of roll back.
[00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:23.480]   Also, after 30-- this is something
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:26.280]   that I sort of predicted that it was going to take a good while
[00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:28.880]   for the real muscular, wonderful apps
[00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:30.760]   to be released for the iPad.
[00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:33.000]   It's not as though there aren't any good apps out there.
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.800]   There are a lot of really great apps out there.
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:37.400]   But after a month, even I'm a little bit surprised
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:39.720]   that there aren't more really great apps available
[00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:41.720]   for the iPad.
[00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:43.840]   It's not a case where we're seeing more and more wonderful
[00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:45.760]   apps coming out each and every day.
[00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:48.600]   I keep looking and I don't see many good productivity
[00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:50.600]   apps that were not available the first week,
[00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:52.600]   not a whole lot of good utilities that were not out
[00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:53.600]   the first week.
[00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:56.600]   It's not because the iPad is failing as a development
[00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:57.600]   environment.
[00:53:57.600 --> 00:54:00.600]   It just goes to show that it takes a certain number of months
[00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:03.600]   for a really ambitious application to be finished.
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:05.600]   And most of these developers didn't get their hands on an iPad
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:07.600]   until April 3 whenever else did.
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:09.600]   One thing that I'm really, really looking forward to
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:12.600]   is the first company that makes a really good word processor
[00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:14.600]   to compete with pages.
[00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:17.600]   I'm sure that the-- I don't have any specific knowledge,
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:19.600]   but I'm looking forward to when the docs to go people,
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:21.600]   these folks who have been doing mobile WordPress,
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:25.600]   Microsoft Word, Microsoft Office apps, just for years and years
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:27.600]   and years, they have not only experience on how to deal
[00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:31.600]   with Microsoft Office apps without any need for translation,
[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:34.600]   but they also have a really good idea of how people use
[00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:36.600]   mobile editions of Office apps.
[00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:38.600]   So that's going to be, I think, the version.
[00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:40.600]   That's going to be the word processor that everyone's going
[00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:43.600]   to want to have, the one that imports all of your style sheets,
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:46.600]   doesn't require any sort of changes whatsoever.
[00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:51.600]   You can simply save it to Google Docs or save it to Box.net
[00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:52.600]   or save it to your Dropbox.
[00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:54.600]   You don't simply open it natively.
[00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:57.600]   And it's just as though you'd slipped a disk inside
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:58.600]   into the side of the thing.
[00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:00.600]   So I really think it's still going to be August,
[00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:01.600]   maybe September before.
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:06.600]   We can really evaluate the iPad full stop as the device that
[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:09.600]   it's meant to be, because it's going to take that long
[00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:11.600]   for all the really great apps to finally drop.
[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:12.600]   Yeah.
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:17.600]   Yeah.
[00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:22.600]   Estimated that Apple will make $40 million on the iWork suite
[00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:23.600]   in the first year.
[00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:24.600]   Not a surprise.
[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:25.600]   Everybody's buying it.
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:28.600]   I wonder what that was that compared to the revenue it drove
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:29.600]   from the actual desktop apps.
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:30.600]   Oh, that's interesting, huh?
[00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:31.600]   I wonder if it's--
[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:33.600]   I mean, they're not charging these clips with those things,
[00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:34.600]   man.
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:35.600]   Yeah.
[00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:36.600]   I wonder.
[00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:37.600]   That is kind of free money at this point.
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:40.600]   Because at this point, the last time I checked for Office-style
[00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:44.600]   iPad, which really isn't-- it's OK, but it really duplicates
[00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:45.600]   the efforts of pages.
[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:48.600]   It doesn't go beyond pages in any meaningful way, as far as I
[00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:49.600]   can tell.
[00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:53.600]   So it's the set of apps that everybody's going to want to have,
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:56.600]   because that's what takes the iPad and turns it from a media
[00:55:56.600 --> 00:55:59.600]   consumption device into a credible alternative to taking your
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:00.600]   notebook with you wherever you go.
[00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:01.600]   Yeah.
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:02.600]   So this is the--
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:04.600]   The missing piece, Andy, though, is for me is--
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:06.600]   I'm an avid Dropbox user.
[00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:09.600]   And I love all my files in there and being able to access them
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:10.600]   somewhere.
[00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:13.600]   And what I was hoping for when I got my iPad was to be able to
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:17.600]   open a keynote document from my presentations folder in my
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:21.600]   Dropbox, edit it, present it, do whatever, and save it back to my
[00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:24.600]   Dropbox and go back to my Mac and continue.
[00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:26.600]   But that connection isn't there yet.
[00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:30.600]   So that whole importing, exporting thing has me a little bit,
[00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:31.600]   you know--
[00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:34.600]   Well, I think your flight is-- it's not something that is
[00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:36.600]   prevented by the iPad in any way.
[00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:38.600]   That capability is definitely possible with the development
[00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:39.600]   kit.
[00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:42.600]   Also, given that Dropbox just last week, open up a set of open
[00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:45.600]   access APIs, just like the sort of things available on
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:46.600]   Box.net.
[00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:49.600]   It means that if someone wanted to allow you to simply have a
[00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:53.600]   standard open save dialog box, it simply opens up your Dropbox
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:54.600]   directory.
[00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:57.600]   And that will be possible.
[00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:01.600]   I believe that they just either announced or just went live a
[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:02.600]   week or two ago.
[00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:03.600]   It's a very, very recent development.
[00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:04.600]   Yeah, I have that.
[00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:05.600]   I know you can open.
[00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:08.600]   And you can now open files directly from my Dropbox, but it
[00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:10.600]   essentially imports them in Sandbox.
[00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:13.600]   And then you have to say-- and then you have to-- the
[00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:16.600]   application that could then open it, say, pages would have to
[00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:19.600]   say, I can read this and then it would show up.
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:21.600]   It's-- or you'd email it to yourself.
[00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:22.600]   Exactly.
[00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:24.600]   Again, it's something that could be supported.
[00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:28.600]   If a developer wanted to have that sort of command O to open a
[00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:30.600]   file, brings up your list of everything you're going to
[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:32.600]   drop box, like the one you want, open it, and then save it back.
[00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:34.600]   That's something that can be done.
[00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:35.600]   It can be done.
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:36.600]   It's just what they do.
[00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:38.600]   You bet that pages will not do it.
[00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:42.600]   I'm saying that the capability is there in the operating system.
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:44.600]   There's nothing physically preventing--
[00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:46.600]   Somebody will drop-- a developer from incorporating that
[00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:47.600]   feature.
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:48.600]   Yeah, wonderful.
[00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:50.600]   And that will be a killer app when that happens.
[00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:53.600]   That's-- now, the good news is-- and we can add another saying
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:58.600]   to the Steve Jobs instant email design program.
[00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:01.600]   The good news is, according to an email from Steve Jobs-- and
[00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:04.600]   again, you can never prove that these really came from Steve
[00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:05.600]   Jobs.
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:07.600]   It could be faked.
[00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:10.600]   But according to an email that purports to be from
[00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:16.600]   Steve Jobs, Apple-- well, it doesn't even say Apple.
[00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:18.600]   Printing is coming soon.
[00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:19.600]   That's the other piece.
[00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:20.600]   Yes.
[00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:22.600]   Yeah, and not being able to print is huge.
[00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:23.600]   Yeah.
[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:26.600]   Well, it's either huge or you just don't care about it.
[00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:29.600]   I only print things when I just-- I need to mail things.
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:31.600]   I really need to mail things.
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:33.600]   No, it's that same workaround, right?
[00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:35.600]   That you have to mail it and then you have to put it on some sink.
[00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:38.600]   But there-- but I mean, there are people who want it and it's
[00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:40.600]   good that there's going to be something like that available if
[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:41.600]   this is actually true.
[00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:42.600]   It's true.
[00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:44.600]   I think it's more interesting that now we are at the point where
[00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:47.600]   someone needs to come up with Steve Jobs' reply email
[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:48.600]   refrigerator poetry magnet.
[00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:49.600]   I know.
[00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:51.600]   It's like, yup, coming.
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:52.600]   Yeah.
[00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:53.600]   Not a problem.
[00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:56.600]   So the email to Steve sent May 7th.
[00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:59.600]   Here's Steve Wino printing on the iPad.
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:06.600]   What gives response from Steve literally 15 minutes later?
[00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:08.600]   It will come.
[00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:11.600]   What do you need to print from your iPad, Leo?
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:14.600]   Well, I mean, I'll tell you where it comes up.
[00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:15.600]   It doesn't come up from me so much.
[00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:18.600]   But for Jennifer, I want to move Jennifer from her notebook,
[00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:20.600]   which she really has a hard time using.
[00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:21.600]   She just doesn't understand the file system.
[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:22.600]   It doesn't make sense to her.
[00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:24.600]   To an iPad for email.
[00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:28.600]   Frequently, she'll get an email with an attachment, carpool
[00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:30.600]   assignment sheet or something like that.
[00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:31.600]   She wants to print.
[00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:32.600]   Okay.
[00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:35.600]   She's now-- I can't-- you know, she's tethered to the notebook.
[00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:37.600]   She has to go back to the notebook to print it.
[00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:38.600]   And that's not good.
[00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:39.600]   Well, didn't Google announce something?
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:42.600]   I would like to see the iPad replace computers for a class of
[00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:43.600]   users.
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:46.600]   Didn't Google announce universal printing or something?
[00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:47.600]   What was that?
[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:49.600]   Could an iPad take advantage of that?
[00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:53.600]   Well, there are a bunch of different solutions for that,
[00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:59.600]   even into individual apps like Good Reader and the other
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:02.600]   other document viewer and document maintainer apps have
[01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:04.600]   printing features that work or don't work.
[01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.600]   And I think it comes down to the fact that whether I want
[01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:09.600]   printing or not, whether it makes sense for the iPad or not,
[01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:11.600]   that's a feature that a lot of people are going to want and
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:12.600]   expect.
[01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:14.600]   So if there's a way that Apple can do it, then there's really
[01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:15.600]   a very little downside.
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:17.600]   As long as they don't have to get into the problem of having to
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:21.600]   open up the iPad operating system to printer drivers, where now
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:24.600]   they have to let Canon and Epson and HP, they have to trust those
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:27.600]   guys to create printer drivers that cause the iPad not to
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:30.600]   crash and not to spit P-supe out through speaker point.
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:33.600]   I think it would be more like a networking network printing
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:36.600]   app that you just simply install on your Mac or install on
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:39.600]   your PC or you'll just simply be able to find network printers
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:41.600]   via Vonjour and reach it from there.
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:42.600]   Yeah.
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:45.600]   And there are apps and I just have been too scared to buy them,
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:48.600]   but there are apps out there that say, oh, this will work
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:51.600]   within that network printer, but then I read reviews and
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:53.600]   everybody goes, well, dang, dang.
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:54.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:55.600]   I'm very disappointed with those two.
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:58.600]   Air sharing is, as air sharing good reader on these other apps,
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:00.600]   they're really, really important apps.
[01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:03.600]   I think that Apple should have included a virtual, I think
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:06.600]   there's another thing that put in that column that you really do
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:09.600]   need an app that does nothing but let you drop arbitrary
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:11.600]   documents onto the thing, you either mount it as web
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:14.600]   diver just, I don't care that I don't have an app for reading,
[01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:17.600]   I don't have an app for editing word documents, I don't have
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:19.600]   an app for editing this, I just want to be able to take this
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:22.600]   document and have it with me as research, as reference, have this
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:26.600]   PDF of my travel documents just as something I can refer back to
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.600]   so I don't need to have access to the internet to get this
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:29.600]   information.
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:33.600]   And my two favorites are air sharing HD and good reader, but
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:36.600]   neither one of them works really, really flawlessly.
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:39.600]   Both of them, for instance, will support connecting to your
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:43.600]   box.net or other web dev servers, but I can't get either one of
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:45.600]   them to work 100% reliably.
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:49.600]   Some good reader and some others, I'm sorry, air sharing and
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:51.600]   some others also support printing.
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:54.600]   Once again, I'm not at that stage where I can count on being
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:57.600]   able to print from this application.
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:00.600]   On some circumstances it will work, some circumstances it won't
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:02.600]   work, and that's just terribly frustrating.
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:06.600]   So I think it's going to, I won't say to whom, but I've been
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:09.600]   talking to developers of some of these apps and they acknowledge
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:11.600]   that they have to have this app, they had to have this app
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:13.600]   open available as soon as possible.
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:15.600]   They acknowledge it doesn't really work properly and they
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:17.600]   consider it to work in progress.
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:19.600]   That's like, okay, well, that's nice.
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:21.600]   I mean, I should put in the description a work in progress.
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:22.600]   Good luck with this.
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:24.600]   Those are the two big pieces, right?
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:26.600]   The file system in printing?
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:29.600]   Well, and at the same time, that's why I don't want Jennifer to
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:32.600]   have to use a notebook because I don't want her to see a file
[01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:35.600]   system, but there needs to be some way for her to.
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:37.600]   But that's the superlative thing.
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:40.600]   Like the thing that you were talking about, Fredrick, the
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:43.600]   ability to simply have this, have just dumped all these documents
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:47.600]   by USB or dumped them by Wi-Fi, nominally just so you can view
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:49.600]   them, but then say, you know what, I actually want to edit this
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:52.600]   document and simply have that simple reader handed off to
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:55.600]   pages or handed off to docs to go or office squared.
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:57.600]   That is supported in the operating system.
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:00.600]   All that has to happen is for the developer to want to do that.
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:02.600]   So it's just a matter of time, right?
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:05.600]   Just a matter of time and hopefully everybody accepting
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:07.600]   that this is a good idea.
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:10.600]   If I'm a little bit frustrated sometimes, no matter what the
[01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:12.600]   operating system is, no matter what the device is, to know
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:15.600]   that this thing is possible, but nobody is doing it.
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:17.600]   As though no one wants to do this.
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:18.600]   Well, I want to do this.
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:19.600]   I'll give you.
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:20.600]   Here's $80.
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:21.600]   Do it for me.
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:22.600]   I know.
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:24.600]   Andy, here's a feature request.
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:30.600]   What about your iPad and or iPhone operating like your Apple TV
[01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:34.600]   does in terms of syncing so that I could say, hey, here's an iPad
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:38.600]   that's attached to my network and I want to sync these particular
[01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:41.600]   playlists and files down to that whenever it appears on the
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:42.600]   network.
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:44.600]   So I don't have to go back up and sync every time I want to get
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:46.600]   the latest podcasts and all that.
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:49.600]   That's not difficult to do, do you think?
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:52.600]   I think that's more of a philosophical thing because I mean,
[01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:54.600]   we've all been asking for that for the iPhone since, you know,
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:55.600]   since forever.
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:56.600]   It's time you can.
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:58.600]   Right between that and the desktop.
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:01.600]   Apple, there are more applications for the iPad that support
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:03.600]   wireless syncing or wireless communication.
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:06.600]   You would think that there'd be a more aggressive attempt to make
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:08.600]   this sort of thing work.
[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:11.600]   But this is exactly the sort of thing that I think Apple would
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:13.600]   just simply not approve for the App Store.
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:15.600]   So I think a lot of it is just simple fear that somebody does
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:18.600]   not want to spend a couple of months developing this with knowing
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:21.600]   that there is at least a 30% chance in someone's mind that Apple
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:23.600]   simply won't allow you to sell it.
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:24.600]   Yeah.
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:27.600]   So we add it will come to the Steve Jobs automatic email
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:28.600]   generator.
[01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:32.600]   We'll also add check your facts, I think, is one of the things
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:34.600]   that I think is is one.
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:35.600]   Apple announced.
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:37.600]   Two jobs sent me a fax.
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:38.600]   No, fax.
[01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:39.600]   No, fax.
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:45.600]   Well, Apple announced that the iPad will be coming out internationally
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:48.600]   in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Japan,
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:51.600]   Switzerland, and the UK at the end of the month, Friday, May 28th.
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:53.600]   Pre-orders are now open.
[01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:56.600]   And as some have pointed out, it's a little more expensive.
[01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:59.600]   Somebody sent Steve an email saying, "Hey, how come it costs so
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:01.600]   much more in Great Britain?"
[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:03.600]   And what does Steve say?
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:09.600]   Something like, "Check your facts," or, "Learn something, dude."
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:15.600]   He said, "Your country requires VAT taxes to be included in the
[01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:18.600]   price, so if you take that out, it's only $40 more."
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:19.600]   Yeah.
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:24.600]   I got a really passive-aggressive email from someone in the UK saying
[01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:28.600]   that we're the 3G's just placed my order for the iPad 3G here in
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:32.600]   the UK, and I get to choose between three different wireless
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:33.600]   providers.
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:34.600]   Hey!
[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:35.600]   Hey!
[01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:38.600]   How's that revolution working out for you?
[01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:39.600]   Yeah.
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:43.600]   So what do you think about Google announcing that it's going to do
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:47.600]   an e-book store, and in fact, now the latest is, and I had pooped
[01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:50.600]   it until I heard the latest, which is that almost all of the
[01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:54.600]   publishers have agreed to do it, and Google has announced we will
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:59.600]   have two million books plus another two million open free books,
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:02.600]   you know, non-public domain books, so if we're a total of four
[01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:05.600]   million in our bookstore when we launch, that's going right after
[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:07.600]   Apple and Amazon, isn't it?
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:08.600]   Yeah.
[01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:09.600]   Yeah.
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:11.600]   The question is, can they deliver a really good user experience
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:13.600]   for those books, though, for that storefront?
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:17.600]   Because Amazon has produced a pretty solid storefront that's
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:19.600]   easy to use and very discoverable.
[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:22.600]   The iBook store is a lot more fun to use and it's still just
[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:23.600]   practical.
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:25.600]   But it's disappointing because there's so few books in the iBook
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:26.600]   store.
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:27.600]   Yeah.
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:30.600]   But even when I've known the title of a book that I know that
[01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:33.600]   Google Books has as an ePub available for free download, I have
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:37.600]   to take two or three shots at it before I come up with a search
[01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:42.600]   term that will reveal not the one magazine article from 1851
[01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:45.600]   that the same guy wrote, but the entire autobiography he published
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:48.600]   in 1891, I don't know why.
[01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:51.600]   If you just do a simple author search, it will not give you a
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:54.600]   list of every single book available from this author.
[01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:57.600]   That's the only place where Google is vulnerable.
[01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:00.600]   They cannot, at some points I wonder if they even care about the
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:01.600]   user experience.
[01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:03.600]   Yeah, that's fixable, though, right?
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:04.600]   That's fixable.
[01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:07.600]   Like me, for example, I'm always going to go with the path of
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:08.600]   Blue Resistance.
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:11.600]   If my brain says it's easier to get it from the iBook store or
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:12.600]   Amazon or whatever.
[01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:14.600]   Stop it when I experience it because it is a separate app.
[01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:16.600]   I've been buying books on both the iBook store when I can find
[01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:17.600]   them and on the Kindle.
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:19.600]   Of course, you launch the Kindle application.
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:21.400]   It pulls up Safari when you want shop.
[01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:22.400]   But I don't find it difficult.
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:23.400]   I buy it.
[01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:25.400]   It downloads right into my Kindle software.
[01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:27.400]   No, I'm saying on the Google side.
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:30.400]   I think that the point being that a third party can make
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:31.400]   incredible experience.
[01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:36.400]   I don't think Apple has done such a good job with the iBook store
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:38.400]   that they have a lock.
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:39.400]   Yeah.
[01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:43.400]   And if the prices are aggressive, I don't understand how Google's
[01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:45.400]   doing it because I would have thought that these mainstream
[01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:48.400]   publishers like Random House would want copy protection.
[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:53.400]   I don't know.
[01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:56.400]   All the millions of tiles that they have simply indexed for
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:59.400]   searching will also be available for purchase.
[01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:03.400]   Well, this is the story is that two million are new books from
[01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:07.400]   in print books from publishers who are making a deal.
[01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:10.400]   And then another two million are in that public domain catalog
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:12.400]   which is now that's a very good question.
[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:17.400]   This has to do with that book deal settlement whether still
[01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:21.400]   copyrighted books that are orphaned, the so-called orphan works
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:24.400]   where there nobody claims ownership even though the copyright is
[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:27.400]   technically still enforced, whether those will be available.
[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:30.400]   You know, I think those are a little bit iffy just because the
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:32.400]   court hasn't really ruled on this Google book deal yet.
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:33.400]   Yeah.
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:38.400]   I think the other piece of that is the format, right?
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:40.400]   What format are these books?
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:41.400]   Well, I would hope ePub.
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:45.400]   If they're ePub then that for me, that sort of knocks out a big
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:47.400]   chunk of what I'm interested in reading.
[01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:48.400]   Why is that?
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:51.400]   Photography books and techniques and all this stuff that need
[01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:54.400]   graphical illustrations and so ePub does not support graphics.
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:57.400]   It supports graphics but it doesn't support formatting or
[01:08:57.400 --> 01:08:58.400]   proper formatting.
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:01.400]   So you're not going to look at like these beautiful Derek story
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:04.400]   books with an illustration and captions and all that stuff in
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:05.400]   there.
[01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:08.400]   It's just basically, it's like HTML one in some ways.
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:09.400]   Yeah.
[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:10.400]   So, you know.
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:11.400]   Really?
[01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:13.400]   Because I've seen some Sony reader books that are published in
[01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:16.400]   ePub that's been secured with Adobe Digital Editions that has
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:17.400]   some pretty good formatting.
[01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:18.400]   Really?
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:19.400]   I haven't seen those yet.
[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:20.400]   I need to see them.
[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:23.400]   The ones I've seen have been nothing like Alice in Wonderland on
[01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:24.400]   the top.
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:25.400]   Well, that's different.
[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:27.400]   And by the way, those books are selling like crazy.
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:28.400]   Yeah.
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:29.400]   But that's in there.
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:31.400]   I mean, there's difference between a book like Alice in Wonderland
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:33.400]   that requires active code to be running to get some of those
[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:35.400]   cool animations and tools working.
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:36.400]   Right.
[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:39.400]   But then there's in terms of creating a static book that's just
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:41.400]   has pretty formatting in it.
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:45.400]   If you have a good tool like Adobe InDesign, my understanding
[01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:48.400]   is that you can really pretty much make the pages look within
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:50.400]   certain limits as good as you want them to.
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:51.400]   I've seen box shading.
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:52.400]   I've seen borders.
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:55.400]   I've seen differences in type styles, differences in sizes.
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:57.400]   I've seen captions below pictures.
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:00.400]   But it's designed to reflow though depending on the device
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:01.400]   it's viewing it.
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:02.400]   Right.
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:04.400]   So that's going to knock out some of that formatting.
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:08.400]   Like, for example, your books, Andy, as an author, would you be
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:12.400]   OK with just sort of, OK, just sort of put this image here and
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:16.400]   wrap it, wrap my text however you see fit around it, or you
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:17.400]   more stringent.
[01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:19.400]   And I want, you know, this image needs to be on the page with
[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:23.400]   these two paragraphs only because if it's not formatted that
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:25.400]   way, then my story sort of breaks.
[01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:30.400]   Well, I'm probably a bad example because the sort of stuff
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:34.400]   that I would put in any pub is stuff that reflows pretty easily
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:37.400]   where you have separate-- I know that I can do things like put
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:38.400]   separate images.
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:41.400]   It makes sure there's a page break before a specific image or
[01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:43.400]   a specific section so I can control that there's a table that
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:46.400]   I really want to get all of its attention, all of its own.
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:48.400]   Not only can I format it very nicely as a table, but it can
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:50.400]   also make sure that it appears at the top of page.
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:53.400]   I'm not an ePub ninja by any stretch.
[01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:56.400]   I'm just working my way from the very, very bottom of hand
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:00.400]   coding ePub to the really interesting public domain and
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:01.400]   freeware ePub tools.
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:05.400]   And I'm starting to mess around with InDesign to try to see what
[01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:08.400]   the top of this sort of design process is like.
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:12.400]   But I know that you have a lot more flexibility of what
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:14.400]   appears than Kindle editions.
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:18.400]   I've been talking to people who design books for Kindle,
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:20.400]   for commercial publishers, and they say that constantly are
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:23.400]   banging their heads against the wall because there's a way
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:25.400]   that something is formatted in the printed book that they just
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:30.400]   have no way of reproducing in the Kindle edition that they had
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:32.400]   a quick solution for for the ePub edition.
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:34.400]   But for creating the Kindle, they had to talk to the public
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:37.400]   or the original book designer again and the author and saying,
[01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:39.400]   "This is not possible.
[01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:40.400]   What do you want me to do?
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:43.400]   Are three alternatives or what is capable using the toolkit
[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:45.400]   that's available for the Kindle edition app?"
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:46.400]   For the mobile format.
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:47.400]   Does this mean PDF is dead?
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:50.400]   Because we're going to use the acronym PDF at all in an all.
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:52.400]   Yeah, I think for books, eBooks is going to be the way
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:53.400]   forward.
[01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:55.400]   And I think that publishers are jumping at this.
[01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:58.400]   You know, I think the big story on this is that the Google,
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:01.400]   they're going to call it Google editions will not have
[01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:02.400]   copy protection.
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:04.400]   So I think the same thing is about to have been publishing that
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:07.400]   happened in the music industry in the last year, which is copy
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:09.400]   protection went by the wayside.
[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:12.400]   I think that's that may even be more important than these
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:13.400]   formatting issues or anything.
[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:15.400]   I mean, that's really huge.
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:17.400]   Google says a book you buy in Google editions will run on
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:19.400]   anything with a browser.
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:20.400]   Wow.
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:22.400]   Maybe HTML5 support?
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:23.400]   I don't know.
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:24.400]   Or there's a plugin for it.
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:25.400]   I don't know.
[01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:26.400]   I don't know how they're going to do that.
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:27.400]   That's crazy.
[01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:30.400]   This is something that when this was announced like last week
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:31.400]   or something.
[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:32.400]   Yeah, it's brand new.
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:34.400]   Unfortunately, unfortunately, I'm fortunate I'm still
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:35.400]   catching up on news.
[01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:37.400]   I missed what was on board the ship.
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:41.400]   But I haven't I've done like the level one looking at looking at
[01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:42.400]   this.
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:44.400]   I haven't done the level two where I've tried to figure out,
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:47.400]   okay, Google, what do you mean by it'll be readable by anybody
[01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:48.400]   with a browser?
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:51.400]   Do you mean that anybody who anybody with a browser who is
[01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:54.400]   signed in and verified their identity with a Google account?
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:57.400]   Or is it I can simply take this file, put it on a key chain
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:00.400]   drive, take it from machine to machine to machine browser to
[01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:03.400]   machine browser have no connection to the internet whatsoever to
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:04.400]   validate who I am or support.
[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:05.400]   Well, that's what I wanted.
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:07.400]   They say there'll be no DRM.
[01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:08.400]   Oh, okay.
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:11.400]   Then that's that's about as explosive as they can make it.
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:15.400]   All I know is that I've talked to publishers who are still very,
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:19.400]   very iffy not only about how how they're going to be supporting
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:23.400]   DRM or not supporting DRM, but also how they're going to be
[01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:26.400]   pricing these titles and how they can have the relationship between
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:27.400]   the publisher and the author these days.
[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:32.400]   So this is a this if it is just as clear as it's been stated,
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:34.400]   then this is a really groundbreaking sort of event.
[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:37.400]   And I think it would be a watershed moment in electronic
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:39.400]   publishing, which is why I want to make sure that I really look
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:42.400]   into this before I say, hooray, the witch is dead, the witch is dead.
[01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:47.400]   You know, there I think that there I'm digging back through to
[01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:53.400]   the original stories trying to find the exact quote from Christa
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:58.400]   Palma, who is the Google guy who made this announcement.
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:01.400]   And if I can find the original story, because none of these have
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:05.400]   a direct quote from him and it may be there's a little weaseling
[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:07.400]   going on little word.
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:08.400]   A little word.
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:11.400]   From PC Magazine, the company's manager for strategic
[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:13.400]   partner development, Chris Palma told a crowd in New York.
[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:17.400]   This was at a big book event that the store was set to launch in
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:21.400]   June or July of this year.
[01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:25.400]   Google is set to tie the service to its book search engine.
[01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:29.400]   According to Palma, and I wish the sort of direct quote, books
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:35.400]   purchased through the service will be viewable through web browsers.
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:41.400]   So you're right, Andy, that isn't exactly DRM free.
[01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:43.400]   It could very well be a plugin.
[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:47.400]   Maybe it's these these second sources, secondary sources that are
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:51.400]   inferring DRM free.
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:53.400]   And that's the thing I'm not clear about.
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:55.400]   Here's a Wall Street Journal article.
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:57.400]   Yeah, I'm reading that now myself.
[01:14:57.400 --> 01:14:58.400]   Yeah.
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:05.400]   Because even Kindle has access to only about a half a million
[01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:06.400]   titles.
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:08.400]   Yeah, four million is significant.
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:10.400]   Two million proprietary is significant.
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:12.400]   Again, I'm not saying I doubt any of this.
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:15.400]   I'm saying that I need to know exactly how they managed to get four
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:17.400]   million titles.
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:20.400]   If you're just talking about books that are in copyright, how do
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:23.400]   they get four times the amount of titles that are available by
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:27.400]   Amazon, given that Amazon is already so eager to master this
[01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:29.400]   market that they're going to lose money on every title?
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:32.400]   Well, but I think a lot of publishers hate Amazon's agency
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:33.400]   model.
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:36.400]   You know, where Amazon sets the price and they would and they
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:39.400]   much prefer Apple's model, but maybe they don't want to go down
[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:42.400]   the road that the record labels went, giving Apple all of that
[01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:43.400]   power.
[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:45.400]   But they see Google as a savior in this case.
[01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:46.400]   Yeah, it's possible.
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:49.400]   One of the smart things that the publishing industry has already
[01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:52.400]   done is learning by the negative examples set by the record
[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:55.400]   industry, because they spent so many times trying so much time
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:59.400]   trying to redefine how music is purchased and controlled to make
[01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:02.400]   sure that they get as every every penny in every right they can
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:05.400]   from the purchaser that they never got a market going and they
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:08.400]   got so desperate that they had to hand over their entire
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:09.400]   industry to Apple.
[01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:10.400]   Yeah.
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:12.400]   And the book publishers are smart enough to know that we never
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:13.400]   have to cause that to happen.
[01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:16.400]   If anybody comes to us with a great way that we can sell our
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:19.400]   books as long as they don't have to, we don't have to sell them
[01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:21.400]   exclusively through this one publisher, we are all in.
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:22.400]   So.
[01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:26.400]   So the latest on this, which is came out yesterday was that
[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:32.400]   according to Eric trick or a rec trick, which I don't know what
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:33.400]   that is.
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:38.400]   ERIC, TRIC reported that Google's very own e-book store,
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:41.400]   Google editions is expected to launch in early summer.
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:43.400]   Preliminary reports stated the store could launch with as many
[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:44.400]   as half a million titles.
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:47.400]   However, if a report by Japan today is to be believed the
[01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:50.400]   number of titles could be much larger according to Japan today,
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:53.400]   more than 25,000 publishers, which accounts for almost all
[01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:56.400]   publishers in the US are backing the upcoming Google editions
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:57.400]   bookstore.
[01:16:57.400 --> 01:17:01.400]   That's, you know, I mean, if that's again, it's a lot of ifs
[01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:05.400]   and hedge words here and a rec trick.
[01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:08.400]   Maybe his name is Eric trick.
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:10.400]   I'm not going to make the joke.
[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:12.400]   I'm not going there.
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:15.400]   I would never do that.
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:20.400]   You apparently confuse me with someone else.
[01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:22.400]   So a couple more stories that we're going to get to our
[01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:24.400]   picks of the week.
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:29.400]   First of all, a couple of actually big stories.
[01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:30.400]   Where were they?
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:31.400]   I have them.
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:33.400]   I said, I don't want to miss this story.
[01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:37.400]   Steen comes out tomorrow for the Mac, the open beta, the open
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:40.400]   public beta begins tomorrow, May 12th.
[01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:43.400]   That's huge because it makes it puts the Mac and we I've talked
[01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:48.400]   about this a couple of times before on a on a equal footing with
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:50.400]   the PC for gaming.
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:54.400]   Now initially it's going to have Portal 2 and Team Fortress,
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:55.400]   two very popular.
[01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:57.400]   Portal 1 is is very popular.
[01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:59.400]   Portal 2, I can't wait.
[01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:02.400]   And Team Fortress neither, which are particularly demanding, but
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:06.400]   apparently according to steam, apples, platforms going to be
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:08.400]   a tier 1 platform for them.
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:10.400]   That means they're going to release games at the same time for
[01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:17.400]   both Windows and OS X and that your steam account will be good on
[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:19.400]   all platforms, maybe even on Linux.
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:22.400]   Rumors are many of the Linux platform for this.
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:26.400]   So that's really good news for gamers on the Macintosh and
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:30.400]   really for anybody on the Mac because that was really one big
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:34.400]   lapse on the Mac side.
[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:36.400]   Oh, I love this story, the Flash crashing twice.
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:38.400]   You go ahead and you zing your ex-employers.
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:40.400]   Why don't you there, Frederick?
[01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:42.400]   I'm not going to zing them.
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:43.400]   Come on, you know you want to.
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:45.400]   No, no, Flash is great.
[01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:48.400]   So this is a demo of Flash, right?
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:49.400]   Yeah.
[01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:50.400]   Yeah.
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:51.400]   Well, what was this at?
[01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:52.400]   This is at that conference, right?
[01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:54.400]   The Flash Camp Seattle.
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:58.400]   Flash Camp Seattle, currently one of the, uh, the uppity, uppity.
[01:18:58.400 --> 01:18:59.400]   Uppity.
[01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:01.400]   I didn't mean uppity.
[01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:02.400]   Yeah, you did.
[01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:04.400]   I slipped right out there.
[01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:05.400]   I'm in New Freud.
[01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:09.400]   One of the, uh, let's see, uh, Flash platform evangelist
[01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:13.400]   Ryan Stewart demoing the new Flash player 10.1, which plays
[01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:15.400]   on, of course, the Nexus One.
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:19.400]   It's an Android, you know, look, you can play Flash on phones.
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:21.400]   We've got it on the Nexus One.
[01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:22.400]   It crashes.
[01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:23.400]   Yeah.
[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:24.400]   Twice.
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:26.400]   He pulled up a site called EcoZoo in this seemingly pretty
[01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:29.400]   intense example of Flash development, full of 3D rendering
[01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:31.400]   rich interactions and cute little characters.
[01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:34.400]   Then he pulled it up on the computer, then he pulls it up on his
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:35.400]   Nexus One.
[01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:36.400]   The site's progress bar fills in.
[01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:39.400]   The 3D world appears for a few seconds before the browser crashes.
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:43.400]   Well, well, well, well, well, it's beta and this is an intense
[01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:44.400]   example.
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:45.400]   Let's try it again.
[01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:46.400]   There was his mistake.
[01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:48.400]   And then someone from the audience said Hulu.
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:50.400]   And he said no.
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:53.400]   He said, "Huh, no, Hulu doesn't work."
[01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:56.400]   And then he wrapped up the demo saying, "If you want to try more
[01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:57.400]   sites, you'll find me later."
[01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:00.400]   I'll be playing with my Nexus One out by the garbage.
[01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:02.400]   I'll be walking down the street with all my stuff and stuff in a
[01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:03.400]   box.
[01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:06.400]   But you got a handful of Adobe, they promise that they would
[01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:09.400]   replicate the entire Flash experience on the desktop and
[01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:11.400]   mobile and damn if they didn't.
[01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:12.400]   Wow.
[01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:13.400]   Wow.
[01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:15.400]   I got an end to say about that.
[01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:19.400]   They have posted a video that purports to show EcoZoo working on
[01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:20.400]   the Nexus One.
[01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:24.400]   So you can't play the game, but you can watch that video unless
[01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:25.400]   it's been posted on Hulu.
[01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:27.400]   No, you couldn't watch that.
[01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:31.400]   HTML5 is coming though to CBS, which is great news.
[01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:33.400]   ABC has an iPad app.
[01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:35.400]   CBS says, "Now we're going to do a website, but we're going to
[01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:38.400]   make sure that all of our video going forward will be HTML5
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:40.400]   so you can play it on the iPad."
[01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:45.400]   I think the iPad is turning into a personal TV among other things.
[01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:50.400]   And finally, a zero-day flaw in Safari.
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:53.400]   I want to report these so people don't think we are somehow
[01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:58.400]   glossing over security flaws in the Apple stuff.
[01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:05.400]   Apple Safari browser contains a critical unpached bug on Windows.
[01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:06.400]   [laughter]
[01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:07.400]   I'm sorry.
[01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:08.400]   I'm sorry.
[01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:10.400]   It's not on the Mac.
[01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:13.400]   It's just on Windows.
[01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:18.400]   It can be used to exploit Safari 405 on Windows.
[01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:23.400]   And break into a Windows system.
[01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:24.400]   Not known.
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:25.400]   All right, I'll be fair.
[01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:31.400]   Whether the vulnerability also exists on Mac, but apparently,
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:32.400]   maybe not.
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:35.400]   It's kind of sad.
[01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:36.400]   I'm sorry.
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:37.400]   I'm sorry.
[01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:38.400]   It is out of the door.
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:39.400]   On Windows.
[01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:40.400]   I think that's it.
[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:41.400]   Do we want to get our picks?
[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:42.400]   Should we do our picks?
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:45.400]   Let me, before we get to the end, I'm sorry.
[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:50.400]   I'm sorry.
[01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:57.400]   I'm sorry.
[01:21:57.400 --> 01:22:04.400]   I'm sorry.
[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:09.400]   I'm sorry.
[01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:12.400]   I'm sorry.
[01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:15.400]   I'm sorry.
[01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:22.400]   I'm sorry.
[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:29.400]   I'm sorry.
[01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:34.400]   I'm sorry.
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:37.400]   I'm sorry.
[01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:42.400]   I'm sorry.
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:52.400]   I'm sorry.
[01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:57.400]   I'm sorry.
[01:22:57.400 --> 01:23:02.400]   I'm sorry.
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:07.400]   I'm sorry.
[01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:11.400]   I'm sorry.
[01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:13.560]   Actually, that would actually support the notion
[01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:18.840]   that it's saturated in the US, or that people hate AT&T,
[01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:20.840]   but it sells just fine elsewhere.
[01:23:20.840 --> 01:23:26.640]   >> The difficulty is that, remember that I really think
[01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:29.000]   that Android has only started being for sale
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:33.200]   for the past six months, because now that two-pone
[01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:35.200]   operating system is out there, now that there's a variety
[01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:37.560]   of really great handsets out there,
[01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:40.200]   Android is just it really found the gas pedal
[01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:41.040]   of the last six months.
[01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:42.360]   >> I think that's the key.
[01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:45.320]   I mean, if you look at this graph from NPD,
[01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:48.800]   RIM is slowing down, was a huge dominant force,
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:49.640]   but it's slowing down.
[01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:53.600]   OS 10 peaked in Q3 2009, has gone down a little bit,
[01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:56.040]   it's flattened out now, but that green line,
[01:23:56.040 --> 01:23:58.720]   that's the Android, and it's just taken off
[01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:02.280]   since the Nexus One, the incredible, the Droid.
[01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:05.240]   I think the Droid is probably where you begin this.
[01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:08.200]   >> Yeah, and you start off with one company
[01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:11.400]   having a huge ad campaign to make sure that everybody,
[01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:14.160]   even if they had no interest in an Android phone,
[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:16.680]   at least knew that there was another alternative
[01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:18.000]   to the iPhone out there.
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.360]   So that was the rising tide that really floated
[01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:21.440]   every boat out there.
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:24.000]   >> We're going to see H-Palm.
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:25.000]   >> I think it's OS.
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.760]   >> By the way, did you notice that black line,
[01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:30.120]   it just black for the graph, the black line in the graph,
[01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:32.040]   that is Palms Web OS.
[01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:33.040]   >> Yeah.
[01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:34.120]   >> This is going to come back.
[01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:35.400]   >> No, the yellow line isn't it?
[01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:36.960]   >> No, it is the black line.
[01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:38.840]   >> This is going down here at the bottom.
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:40.840]   >> Are we going to see that come back because of HP?
[01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:42.880]   >> It's actually below other now.
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:44.320]   [laughter]
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:45.600]   >> Insignificant, brownie, yellow line.
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:48.720]   >> I think HP puts, it's my, he might,
[01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:52.600]   it's marketing power, and it's money behind Web OS,
[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:54.920]   and makes it, I think it's going to make a slate device.
[01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:56.880]   I don't know about the phone stuff.
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:58.920]   HP isn't a smartphone business with the iPad,
[01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:00.000]   but not much.
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:00.840]   >> Yeah.
[01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:02.920]   >> I think it's going to be a tablet.
[01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:04.520]   HP is going to do a tablet, that's what I think.
[01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:06.240]   The slate will be reinvented, re-engineered.
[01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:09.640]   It'll take Adam out because you can't run,
[01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:12.720]   you can't run Web OS on an Adam processor,
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:13.640]   needs an ARM processor.
[01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:15.760]   >> I think that that would be interesting.
[01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:16.600]   >> Interesting.
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:18.000]   >> Interesting.
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.360]   >> Businessweek says Steve Jobs, healthy.
[01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:22.880]   Not much to report on that.
[01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:23.720]   He's, yeah.
[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:28.520]   They quote Guy of Kawasaki,
[01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:31.120]   "People like Steve Jobs have a different operating system
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:31.960]   from you and me."
[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:33.880]   [laughter]
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:35.320]   That's what makes him different.
[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:37.160]   Except for the fact that he's lost a lot of weight,
[01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:39.840]   says Tim Behren, he's a Steve Jobs of old.
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:41.560]   That, I think we'd agree on.
[01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:44.280]   He is, he's got the fire in the belly.
[01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:46.760]   He's definitely doing the job.
[01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:50.360]   Wozniak says Jobs is very busy, involved in a lot of work.
[01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:53.120]   Woz says the CEO has made a good recovery.
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:55.240]   And the doctor who conducted the liver transplant
[01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:57.280]   says 91% of his patients have a healthy liver
[01:25:57.280 --> 01:25:59.520]   one year after the operation.
[01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:02.000]   So the success rate is very good.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.720]   You know, I figure, Adobe's probably thinking,
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:05.840]   Steve's doing okay.
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:08.160]   [laughter]
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:09.600]   >> Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:10.640]   >> He's weakened.
[01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:15.320]   >> Let's get our Audible pick of the week in,
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:17.840]   and then your software picks of the week.
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:19.160]   You remember that we do that, Frederick?
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:20.600]   >> I should have probably warned you.
[01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:21.440]   >> I did remember that.
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:22.280]   >> I did remember that.
[01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:23.480]   >> Mine isn't software though.
[01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:25.520]   >> Okay, hardware's good too.
[01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:27.400]   Hardware's good too, but I do want to remind everybody
[01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:30.920]   to go to audible.com/macbreak to get your free book,
[01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:32.720]   Audible is the place we talk about.
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:34.120]   And I hope you've been listening,
[01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:35.040]   and I hope you've tried it,
[01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:38.160]   and if you haven't, please do yourself a favor.

[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000]   It's a great way to get your teen reading.
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.480]   I turned Henry on a demon,
[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:08.520]   and I'll get a review from him.
[01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:11.960]   >> Andy Inako is a big audible listener, we know that,
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:13.440]   'cause he's always got great recommendations.
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:16.200]   In fact, I look forward every week to Andy's recommendation
[01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:18.880]   to know what I should get next on Audible.com.
[01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:22.840]   >> Yep, and I don't know if this was influenced
[01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:26.080]   by last week's cruise, but this week's pick for me
[01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:27.720]   is Skinny Dip by Carl Heisen.
[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:30.760]   >> Oh, I love it, that's a great book, I read it, yep.
[01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:34.040]   Carl Heisen is one of my favorite humor novelists.
[01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:36.840]   He writes these stories are based upon this idea
[01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:38.960]   of a totally insane version of Florida,
[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:41.440]   which anybody else, I've haven't been to Florida,
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:44.640]   I cannot vouch for the fact that the situation of Florida
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:47.200]   is as insane as Heisen makes it.
[01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:48.600]   But I would like to think that there is a fantasy
[01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:50.840]   wonderland known as Florida as depicted.
[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:54.000]   It is a world in which on an anniversary cruise,
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.800]   a woman gets thrown off of a cruise ship,
[01:27:55.800 --> 01:27:57.200]   but the husband forgot that she used to be
[01:27:57.200 --> 01:27:59.880]   a championship swimmer, and because of the drug trade
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:03.320]   off of Florida, there's just a floating bale of marijuana
[01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:05.800]   that she gets to be able to hack onto.
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:09.160]   Makes her way to deserted island where the DEA
[01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:13.960]   comes up and she gets rescued by this drug cop.
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:16.920]   And now the husband has no idea whether she's,
[01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:19.520]   hopes that she drowned, but has no idea.
[01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:23.800]   And there's intrigue and all kinds of fun things happening.
[01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:26.960]   And also Heisen, he knows, I hope I'm found this name right,
[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:27.960]   I've never read it.
[01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:29.640]   He knows, I hope I'm found this name right,
[01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:30.880]   I've never actually heard it pronounced,
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:33.160]   I just, I'm pretty sure It's Heisen.
[01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:36.960]   He really does have a way with a phrase.
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:38.480]   Oh, he's so good.
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:40.160]   I mean, he's not up there with PG Woodhouse,
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:42.800]   but then again, who is, but you'll just come up with those,
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:44.360]   he'll just come up with one of these phrases
[01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:46.240]   that you wind up just having to go back
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:49.680]   and reread the paragraph because it was,
[01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:54.440]   there's a line for the killers,
[01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:57.560]   a line referring to the killers, a college graduation,
[01:28:57.560 --> 01:29:00.960]   saying the faculty stood up and applauded louder
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:02.440]   for him than for any other graduate
[01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:03.840]   because they knew that this was the last time
[01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:04.840]   they'd ever have to see him.
[01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:07.240]   (laughing)
[01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:08.480]   - It is a great book.
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:09.720]   And I think you're right, a great book
[01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:11.200]   to read on a cruise ship of you.
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:13.680]   - You're going on a cruise, just not near a railing.
[01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:14.520]   - Skinny did.
[01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:15.360]   - If you've been ark with my friends.
[01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:17.400]   - My Carl Hyason, and it looked like
[01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:19.040]   you've pulled up a book too, Frederick.
[01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:20.600]   - Yes, yes I have.
[01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:22.960]   This is the book that I was listening to on the way up here.
[01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:24.440]   - Again, for like the third time.
[01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:26.680]   - We interviewed the authors on a night,
[01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:27.880]   a couple of weeks ago.
[01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:28.880]   - I gotta see that.
[01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:29.720]   - They're great, yeah.
[01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:32.680]   - It's called rework, it's from the founders
[01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:36.160]   of 37 Signals, the folks who brought us base camp.
[01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:37.680]   - David Adamir, hence the game.
[01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:40.080]   - Yeah, it's an amazing book in terms of like,
[01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:44.800]   I mean if you're stuck in any corporation right now,
[01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:47.520]   you'll listen to this book and you'll be not in your head
[01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:50.280]   in affirmation after each chapter.
[01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:51.360]   - I agree, yeah.
[01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:54.320]   - 'Cause they basically expose things like inane meetings
[01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:57.120]   and just how you get things done
[01:29:57.120 --> 01:30:01.520]   and how you can operate in an interrupt driven environment
[01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:03.720]   like a corporation and all that stuff.
[01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:08.240]   It's a great book and it's narrated extremely well
[01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:10.160]   and I highly recommend it.
[01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:11.760]   And they're actually giving it away free, right?
[01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:14.400]   They're giving away the PDF on their website
[01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:15.240]   or at least at a reduced price.
[01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:17.080]   - You can read it for free, but if you wanna listen.
[01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:18.360]   - Right, if you wanna listen, you gotta buy it.
[01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:20.200]   And if you want the hardcover, of course you gotta--
[01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:21.520]   - But you don't actually have to buy it
[01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:23.880]   because you could just go to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:24.720]   - Yes.
[01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:26.200]   - And we'll give it to you free, so there you go.
[01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:27.040]   - There you go.
[01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:30.040]   - Audible.com/macbreak, if you're in the car,
[01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:33.040]   you know an hour a day or you go to the gym an hour a day
[01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:36.840]   or you work in the garden, anytime you can't hold a book,
[01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:38.840]   you still can get reading done.
[01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:41.960]   And I'll tell you, it's brought reading back
[01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:43.600]   to my life into a lot of people's lives
[01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:45.680]   where they really missed it, I just love it.
[01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:47.000]   Audible, in fact, in the middle of the night,
[01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.240]   I'll wake up and I'll listen to a book
[01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:49.520]   and it puts me right back to sleep.
[01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:52.680]   Audible.com/macbreak, your first one's free,
[01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:55.520]   works on over 500 devices, including all the Apple devices.
[01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:56.640]   I want you to give it a try.
[01:30:56.640 --> 01:30:58.840]   I see you were listening on your iPad for a drink.
[01:30:58.840 --> 01:30:59.680]   - Yep, and it's nice.
[01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:01.200]   - It's nice 'cause it brings up the,
[01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:03.000]   so hold up the album art, it really is nice
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.200]   when you're listening to an album or--
[01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:06.040]   - Where is it, can you say that?
[01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:08.520]   - You're right in front of you, or listening to a book,
[01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:10.360]   you really know what you're listening to.
[01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:11.200]   (laughing)
[01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:12.920]   - It's like fills the screen.
[01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:14.400]   - Like, who's the title of that book again?
[01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:15.240]   - Free work.
[01:31:15.240 --> 01:31:18.280]   - Audible.com/macbreak, we thank them
[01:31:18.280 --> 01:31:19.840]   for their support of MacBreak Weekly.
[01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:21.200]   - Go ahead, Frederick, you said you have something
[01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:22.880]   that is not software.
[01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:25.280]   - It is not software, it's very low tech.
[01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:26.920]   - And I talked about this at the top of the show,
[01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:31.360]   but I'm very fond of this, my fine, you're easel.
[01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:34.680]   - Right here, right there, look at that.
[01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:38.360]   It's a little tiny easel that I got from Tarjay.
[01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:39.200]   - Tarjay?
[01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:40.200]   - Tarjay for like seven--
[01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:41.560]   - It's like a picture easel or something.
[01:31:41.560 --> 01:31:43.800]   - That's exactly what it is, it's in the frame aisle.
[01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:45.680]   I was looking for something to hold up my iPad
[01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:47.360]   because I've been playing around with different cases
[01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:50.160]   until I've seen yours, I haven't found one that I like.
[01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:51.880]   - You have the Apple case, I have all it so I like.
[01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:53.120]   - I hate the Apple case, that's just a lot of it.
[01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:55.520]   - I decided I'm gonna put this Jealouskin on this thing,
[01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:57.000]   so I put the Jealouskin on the back of it.
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:57.840]   - That's pretty.
[01:31:57.840 --> 01:31:58.680]   - To protect it.
[01:31:58.680 --> 01:31:59.520]   - Love Jealous.
[01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:02.400]   - So I can, you know, man handle my iPad,
[01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:05.000]   and now I've got two or three of these little easels
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:05.840]   in there around the house
[01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:08.920]   and I can just throw it on there whenever I need to support it.
[01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:09.760]   It's good.
[01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:11.200]   - Well, as long as you're talking plugs,
[01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:13.800]   I guess I'll make my pick B this Marwur EcoView case.
[01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:18.800]   I did a wrap-up of cases for the iPad on the Daily Gizwiz
[01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:20.840]   so you can hear me talk about a bunch of them.
[01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:23.280]   I know some people like the Apple case,
[01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:26.800]   but at 40 bucks for a thin rubber case,
[01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:28.520]   I think it's overpriced.
[01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:31.080]   And for five bucks more, this is a leather case
[01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:32.640]   that gives you, I think, great protection.
[01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:34.920]   It's had, it's nicely padded.
[01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:38.120]   It has one advantage over the Apple case right up front,
[01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:40.000]   which is it doesn't have a big fat apple on it.
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.400]   So when I'm carrying it around,
[01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:44.320]   it really doesn't look like I've got an iPad here.
[01:32:44.320 --> 01:32:46.200]   It looks like I'm a businessman carrying a notebook.
[01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:49.960]   It's got a, the elastic band closure,
[01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:51.400]   which it makes it very secure,
[01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:53.720]   but also makes it look kind of like that moleskine,
[01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:54.720]   kind of a thing.
[01:32:54.720 --> 01:32:56.520]   It does doesn't look like an iPad.
[01:32:56.520 --> 01:32:57.520]   It does have cut-as, of course,
[01:32:57.520 --> 01:33:00.420]   for all the relevant ports on the iPad.
[01:33:00.420 --> 01:33:03.080]   And when you open it up,
[01:33:03.080 --> 01:33:05.680]   you'll see that you slide it in from the top.
[01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:08.080]   Now I have added a little feature that is not included.
[01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:09.080]   It has a tongue.
[01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:11.680]   Same thing that the Apple case does.
[01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:14.640]   It puts a tongue in around the iPad,
[01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:17.000]   but I added some Velcro to the tongue
[01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.240]   and put a little Velcro backing into the case
[01:33:19.240 --> 01:33:21.240]   just so that when that iPad's in there,
[01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:22.400]   that's not gonna slide out.
[01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:23.840]   That's really in there well.
[01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:26.320]   And you know, I don't want my iPad to fall out.
[01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:28.280]   It does slide in and is held by the frame.
[01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:30.200]   That's one of two or three different ways
[01:33:30.200 --> 01:33:32.200]   of mounting an iPad in a case.
[01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:33.320]   And this is my preferred way.
[01:33:33.320 --> 01:33:36.080]   I've seen some with a photo corner kind of a setup.
[01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:37.400]   I'm not crazy about that.
[01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:40.040]   But this has the thing that I think any case has to have.
[01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:42.480]   By the way, nice suede, soft suede inside.
[01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:43.640]   It has a stand.
[01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:47.520]   The only one orientation, it's landscape
[01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:50.400]   and the stand holds it at a particular angle,
[01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:52.280]   but it's just the right angle in my opinion for typing.
[01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:53.120]   It's very solid.
[01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:55.960]   You're not gonna knock it over.
[01:33:55.960 --> 01:34:00.280]   In fact, so much so that I keep my orientation locked in place.
[01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:04.320]   'Cause I just do everything kind of in landscape mode
[01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:06.080]   almost always, except for pages
[01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:08.360]   where you have to turn it, things like that.
[01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:11.120]   So this is from, it's five bucks more than the Apple cases.
[01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:13.800]   From Mar were, they do a lot of good iPod cases.
[01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:18.120]   They make the Eco Flip, which opens portrait-wise.
[01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:21.400]   And this is the Eco View, which is a landscape mode.
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:24.440]   And at $45, I think they're a little bit back-ordered right now.
[01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:25.520]   They dropped the price recently.
[01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:27.920]   I think this is really the best iPad case.
[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:29.720]   And everybody I show it to says, yeah, yeah,
[01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:30.760]   that's the one I want.
[01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:31.840]   It also has, I don't use this,
[01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:33.760]   but I guess if you worked on a factory floor,
[01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:36.520]   it has an elastic strap that you can use
[01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:39.160]   to do one-handed iPad-ing.
[01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:40.360]   - Oh, that's what that's for.
[01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:41.720]   - Yeah, just wondering what that was.
[01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:44.000]   - So you slip your hand through the strap on the back,
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:48.000]   and I guess you'd wanna put the rubber band around the back.
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:48.840]   - Oh, look at that. - What's in the place?
[01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:50.320]   And now you can one-handed.
[01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:52.720]   And I guess if you're a doctor or whatever,
[01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:54.480]   you could just do it like that.
[01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:56.040]   - That's cool, yeah.
[01:34:56.040 --> 01:34:59.760]   - I use it to hold a cleaning cloth, because frankly,
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:02.640]   if you got an iPad, you need a cleaning cloth at all times.
[01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:03.480]   - Yes, you do.
[01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:06.080]   - And now Andrew and Artko with his pick of the week.
[01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:10.640]   - My, there was an app that came out just last,
[01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:12.400]   another iPad pick, I'm sorry,
[01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:16.520]   but it's a key app for the iPad.
[01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:19.920]   Dropbox just came out with an iPad version of their client.
[01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:21.640]   That's what we've all talked about,
[01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:23.280]   Dropbox time and time again.
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:26.600]   Now it's, I really think that Dropbox is starting to become
[01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:30.080]   the three and a half inch floppy of the 21st century.
[01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:32.280]   It's just a service that so many people have,
[01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:34.520]   just as the thing they use to move files
[01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:36.080]   from one place to another.
[01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:39.520]   And the iPad version of this app is just absolutely perfect.
[01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:42.920]   It's absolutely everything that you would want this app to do,
[01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:45.560]   which is simple, like steering wheel interface.
[01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:48.720]   I've got this, obviously I've got this on landscape mode,
[01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:50.880]   but you see all your files over here,
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:53.920]   you just tap, tap, tap to get it,
[01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:59.360]   to view all the different files from your Dropbox right here.
[01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:02.600]   I'm looking in my pictures folder inside my Dropbox,
[01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:07.600]   but it lets you access the full directory structure.
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:10.400]   Obviously it will view PDFs,
[01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:11.640]   it will view whatever you want.
[01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:15.960]   And it also has the killer feature for this sort of thing.
[01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:17.960]   Like right now I've got it,
[01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:21.880]   right now I've got it looking at an RTF file,
[01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:24.360]   but it also has this little send button up here.
[01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:26.200]   Let me see if I can show it to you.
[01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:27.920]   Where if you tap on that,
[01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:30.280]   it will give you a list of every single application
[01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:32.920]   on your iPad that can open that document.
[01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:35.560]   And so if I want to send this RTF file
[01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:37.640]   to the three applications that I have
[01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:39.160]   that are capable of working with RTFs,
[01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:41.720]   I simply tap one of these apps,
[01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:43.320]   and it will launch that app,
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:46.520]   and it will open it within that new application.
[01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:52.080]   That's telling me that I accidentally tapped an application
[01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:53.920]   that needs an update in order to do with this file type,
[01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:55.400]   but you get the idea.
[01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:58.600]   So it really elevates not only the iPad,
[01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:00.280]   but Dropbox in general.
[01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:04.400]   I've been, since the first day I used it,
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:05.760]   I've been a free user of it,
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:07.280]   because I figured that I just want to have
[01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:09.280]   the two gigs free account.
[01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:11.480]   So I don't want to really rely on this too much.
[01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:13.720]   I just want to use it just as that little floppy disk,
[01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:16.720]   so to speak, that I used to move files from one place to another.
[01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:19.280]   But the strength of the Dropbox app for the iPad,
[01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:20.760]   which is free by the way,
[01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:23.120]   made me finally sign up for paid service
[01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:24.240]   so I can get more storage on it,
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:29.240]   because the ability to simply keep my live projects folder
[01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:33.360]   on the Dropbox locally, on my local hard drive,
[01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:35.200]   then simply grab this, go out someplace,
[01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:37.400]   and then know that no matter what I want to edit,
[01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:38.920]   no matter what I want to work with,
[01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:41.560]   that file will be a viewable and editable on my iPad
[01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:42.920]   without having to do with anything.
[01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:45.240]   No syncing, no docking, no nothing.
[01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:47.760]   That really elevates the iPad and shows you
[01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:51.040]   exactly the reason why a device like the iPad needed to be created.
[01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:52.760]   - You get two gigs free, right?
[01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:54.600]   And then you can buy more.
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:55.720]   - Yeah, and you can buy more.
[01:37:55.720 --> 01:37:58.000]   For monthly fee, you can get the,
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.760]   I think it's 15 and then 50.
[01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:01.600]   - Right.
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:02.440]   - I need to double check on it,
[01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:04.000]   but it's not terribly expensive,
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.080]   but obviously for most people,
[01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:08.840]   just having that two gig flash drive, so to speak,
[01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:10.640]   virtually attached to all of your computers.
[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:11.480]   - Even that.
[01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:12.320]   - It's a big one.
[01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:13.160]   - Yeah.
[01:38:13.160 --> 01:38:15.200]   - And it doesn't have that annoying thing
[01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:17.360]   that so many of these cloud services have,
[01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:20.320]   which is to require you to have a connection to the internet
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:21.640]   in order to have access to your files,
[01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:23.760]   because each one of your,
[01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:25.800]   with the Dropbox software installed on your Mac
[01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:27.480]   or your PC or your Linux box,
[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:30.280]   you have a physical directory on that drive
[01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:32.600]   that has all of those files locally.
[01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:34.240]   And with the iPads a little bit,
[01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:35.600]   so if you don't have, even if you don't have a connection
[01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:36.800]   to the internet, you'll still have access
[01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:38.160]   to all your files locally.
[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:40.480]   Now the iPad app works a little bit differently.
[01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:41.960]   It obviously doesn't just simply,
[01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:45.040]   when you launch it, sync down every single file you've got
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:49.000]   on this two 15, 50 gigabyte Dropbox into your iPad.
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:50.920]   But it does something that is just as cool,
[01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:52.560]   which is any one of these,
[01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:55.080]   when you're viewing any one of these documents or files,
[01:38:55.080 --> 01:38:56.480]   if you just click on the star button,
[01:38:56.480 --> 01:38:58.720]   it's not just, you're not just favoriting it,
[01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:01.240]   it will download that file directly
[01:39:01.240 --> 01:39:03.240]   into the application's local storage.
[01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:06.040]   So I might have, when I got my travel documents
[01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:08.440]   for my upcoming trip in June,
[01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:11.200]   as usual I printed it out as a PDF
[01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:13.920]   and saved it to my Dropbox or I'd have it handy.
[01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:15.160]   When I leave the house,
[01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:16.600]   I'm certainly gonna tap the favorites button
[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:18.640]   to make sure that I will have that document,
[01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:21.240]   not only viewable on my iPad via Dropbox,
[01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:23.360]   but it will live in that directory
[01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:24.840]   so that if I'm at the airport,
[01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:27.080]   I'm in a cold zone for coverage,
[01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:28.560]   for Wi-Fi coverage or 3G coverage,
[01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:30.240]   I'll still have access to all my documents.
[01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:31.640]   Just one tap and that's it.
[01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:34.480]   It's hands down the easiest way to move a document
[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:36.240]   from your desktop onto the iPad
[01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:37.600]   and then do useful things with it.
[01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:39.560]   It's one of my highest,
[01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:41.800]   it's one of those things where as soon as it,
[01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:42.840]   as soon as it was released,
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:44.480]   I knew that this is not my iPad,
[01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:47.000]   just magically got cooler than it was 10 minutes ago.
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.600]   - Yeah. - This would be a good case
[01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:52.160]   for use case for Apple to make mobile me free
[01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:54.040]   and make it more competitive with something like this.
[01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:54.880]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:58.280]   The other piece of the Dropbox that I love is sharing.
[01:39:58.280 --> 01:40:01.760]   Being able to say this directory or this folder, share it.
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:05.080]   And now as I collaborate with someone
[01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:08.000]   and they add images to the directory
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:09.280]   or remove or whatever,
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:11.280]   it automatically gets synced down to all my machines
[01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:13.280]   and I can see it from my iPhone or iPad.
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:14.920]   - And of course we do that with this week in photo
[01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:18.160]   when you record the show here in the studio,
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:21.800]   we drop in the Dropbox and it's shared with you.
[01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:25.160]   - Yep, and that's another great feature of the Dropbox app.
[01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:27.720]   There's also a link button at the top
[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:30.400]   so that instead of just simply opening it in a document,
[01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:32.160]   you can actually create a link to this
[01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:33.720]   and then either copy to the clipboard
[01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:35.200]   so you can paste into a mail message
[01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:37.560]   or just simply tap it, email this link to somebody.
[01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:40.440]   Now somebody can actually access that file individually
[01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:42.240]   by that you're on the Dropbox.
[01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:44.960]   - Yeah, it's wonderful, big box of solutions.
[01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:49.040]   - We are at a time, Alex Lindsey is in Africa.
[01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:50.480]   I think he's gonna be back next week.
[01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:53.840]   I think he's found a gigabit connection in Harare.
[01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:55.480]   So that'll be nice.
[01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:58.200]   And Merlin Mann was busy writing,
[01:40:58.200 --> 01:40:59.240]   but he'll be back soon.
[01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:00.800]   We asked Land at Kehaney to join us.
[01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:03.440]   He said, "Not for all two hours."
[01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:06.160]   And we said, "Well, yeah."
[01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:07.560]   He said, "Ah."
[01:41:07.560 --> 01:41:09.800]   So I thought we'd do a shorter show today,
[01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:10.640]   to show him we could do it.
[01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:13.640]   And in fact, we are in fact, one hour and 56 minutes in.
[01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:16.640]   So you see, Leander, you should have been here.
[01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:18.480]   You should have been here.
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:20.400]   Frederick Van Patten.
[01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:21.640]   (laughing)
[01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:23.200]   - Frederick Van Patten.
[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:24.520]   (laughing)
[01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:25.520]   - That's kind of pro-art here.
[01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:27.160]   - I love being Frederick Van Dyke.
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:28.520]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:41:28.520 --> 01:41:30.480]   - Frederick Van Johnson, it was here.
[01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:31.320]   Thank you for being here.
[01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:33.960]   Frederick Van.com is a place to go to learn more about him
[01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:37.080]   and the new company, Mediobytes.com.
[01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:38.680]   - Media, B-Y-T-E-S.
[01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:39.760]   - Yes. - Very cool.
[01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:40.600]   - Thank you. - Thank you.
[01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:41.440]   - Thank you for being here, Frederick.
[01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:42.280]   It's great to see you.
[01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:45.560]   Don't be a stranger now that you're no longer working
[01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:46.760]   for anybody we care about.
[01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:47.880]   - That's right. - Except yourself.
[01:41:47.880 --> 01:41:48.720]   - That's right.
[01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:49.560]   - I like that. - As it should be.
[01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:50.640]   - As it should be. - Yeah.
[01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:52.800]   - Annie Inaco does work for somebody we care about.
[01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:56.120]   The great Chicago Sun Times, one of the last great newspapers
[01:41:56.120 --> 01:42:00.880]   in America and still printing on dead trees since 1869.
[01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:01.800]   And-- - You don't have to worry
[01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:04.120]   about the tree menace, so long as the fine men and women
[01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:05.480]   of the Sun Times are out there post.
[01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:06.480]   - God bless 'em.
[01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:07.680]   - We kill 'em by the millions,
[01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:09.000]   but they're not filing our faces.
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:10.480]   - Absolutely.
[01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:14.680]   And they make wonderful parakeep lineers, cage liners.
[01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:15.800]   - I don't know why such a paper.
[01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:17.280]   - Yeah, I know, of course not yours.
[01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:21.400]   C-W-O-B.com is his website to the Celestial Waste of Ban with.
[01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:22.360]   Thank you, Annie, for being here.
[01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:23.560]   We appreciate it.
[01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:24.960]   Thank you all for joining us.
[01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:27.360]   Don't forget, if you want the opposing viewpoints
[01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:29.640]   from a credible spokesman, we do a Windows show too.
[01:42:29.640 --> 01:42:31.000]   (laughs)
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:32.240]   Windows weekly.
[01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:34.240]   We do that show every Thursday at the same time,
[01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:38.480]   2 p.m. Eastern 11 a.m. PacificLive.Twit.tv, 1800 UTC.
[01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:40.520]   You can also, of course, download Windows weekly
[01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:41.360]   with Paul Thorey.
[01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:46.360]   It's kind of an anodyne to the Mac fanboy.
[01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:47.600]   So those of you who are listening going,
[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:48.880]   I need an anodyne.
[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:50.480]   - Keeps the universe stabilized.
[01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:51.320]   - It does.
[01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:52.160]   It does.
[01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:53.600]   Well, he actually debunks, and I didn't do this story
[01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:54.880]   because he debunked it,
[01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:59.960]   that whole netbook sales declining due to the iPad thing.
[01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:01.680]   We'll talk about that on Thursday.
[01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:04.000]   If you believe what they're saying
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:07.520]   that the iPads kill in netbooks, Paul begs to differ.
[01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:08.640]   And he'll explain why.
[01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:11.760]   All of our shows that were on Twit.tv,
[01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:13.600]   you can subscribe to each and every one of the most
[01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:16.280]   of them in video as well as audio now, including this show.
[01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:19.560]   TWIT.tv/MBW for this show.
[01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:20.400]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:21.240]   We'll see you next time.
[01:43:21.240 --> 01:43:22.640]   All right, now back to work.
[01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:23.800]   Take time software.
[01:43:23.800 --> 01:43:26.400]   (upbeat music)
[01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:28.980]   (upbeat music)
[01:43:28.980 --> 01:43:38.980]   (upbeat music)
[01:43:38.980 --> 01:43:48.200]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
