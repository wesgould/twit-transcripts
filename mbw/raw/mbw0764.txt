[00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.700]   Renee Ritchie.
[00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.260]   The Apple Epic trial started yesterday.
[00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.920]   We've got some highlights.
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.160]   We'll talk about the EU.
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.300]   They're charging Apple with antitrust violations
[00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.660]   on the App Store.
[00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.600]   It's a double-fisted battle there.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.400]   And because it's made the fourth a special visit
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.900]   from a bounty hunter, you may not remember.

[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.120]   we cover the latest news from Apple.
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.200]   Renee Ritchie is not from Apple.
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.400]   He is of Apple.
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.240]   He is by Apple.
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.280]   He is YouTube.com/Renee Ritchie.
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.480]   Apple with Jason.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.000]   Hey, Renee.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.640]   Good to see you.
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.680]   How is the situation in COVID situation in Montreal right now?
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.560]   We're not as bad as Ontario, and we are steadily improving,
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.120]   I think.
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.240]   They're in bad shape.
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.600]   And they're going to move the curfew from 8 till 9.30
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.040]   this week, which I'm looking forward to,
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.840]   because I like to go walking, and I lose track of time.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.240]   So often I'm editing, and I'm like, oh, it's after 8.
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.120]   I can't go out.
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.360]   But now at least I have another hour and a half.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.360]   Bizarre.
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.320]   That's just bizarre.
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.160]   I'm not even sure.
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.280]   I guess that's so people don't congregate in bars.
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.920]   But you should be able to take a walk any time of the day
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:57.680]   or night.
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.720]   You can walk your dog, but I don't have one.
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.680]   So I think some people are getting screen dogs,
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.960]   so they can go out, like dog beards.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.960]   So they can throw--
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.120]   Can I borrow your dog?
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.040]   I'd like to take a walk.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.320]   And when's the vaccine coming?
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.800]   I'm a dog right now.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.040]   When's the vaccine coming to town?
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.920]   I had my first dose.
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.480]   I had AstraZeneca dose one a week ago.
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.080]   And I slept for 22 hours, which is 11 times more than usual.
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.040]   But they're not doing the second dose very quickly,
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.280]   so that's only mid-August.
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.000]   Oh, that's bizarre.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.080]   Yeah.
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.000]   Well, it's kind of--
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.720]   I'm sorry.
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.400]   Yeah, well, it's not really Canada's fault.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.640]   I think it's our fault because we bought up all the vaccine
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.320]   supplies.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.640]   Well, and we don't make it locally.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.800]   Like, we've had to try to get it from the US and from EU
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.840]   because we, in our infinite wisdom,
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.800]   shut down all the places that could have produced it years
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.600]   ago because who could have predicted this except for everybody
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.360]   in the field?
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.040]   Oh, nuts.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.040]   That's Andy and Ico, WGBH Boston.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.320]   Good to see you in IHNATKO.
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.960]   Happy Orthodox Easter.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.560]   Yes.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.280]   Thank you very much.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.400]   In our family house, this was known as the--
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.120]   OK, not as nice as the second Christmas dinner
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.960]   because this is the now today.
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.440]   We're going to have the same.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.240]   We're going to honor the present food of our Russian, Eastern,
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.520]   European, four bears.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.520]   It's going to be cold kilbasa.
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.960]   We're going to have--
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.760]   Sour crowd.
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:21.760]   Birogi.
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.760]   Yeah.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.760]   No, meow.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.960]   Actually, I do like cold kilbasa with mustard.
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.520]   So that's pretty good.
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.440]   It trained me to like--
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.520]   And borsed is supposed to be cold.
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.720]   So it's OK.
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.080]   It's great to see you, Andy.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.360]   Are you fully vaccinated?
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.520]   Yes.
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.000]   Yep, got my second on Thursday.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Yes.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.320]   I didn't-- and I had the same reaction as Renee,
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.360]   although it was hard to-- it's hard to know for myself
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.120]   if I'm sleeping a lot because my sleep schedule is so weird
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.160]   anyway.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.640]   So if I sleep until like 3 p.m. the next day, it's like, OK,
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.440]   is it because I got my second dose or is it because you maybe
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.280]   got like four hours of sleep if that--
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.600]   like the night before?
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.360]   So I used the excuse to get paid.
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.680]   The media, Andy.
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.760]   Lisa's second shot.
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.480]   She had the second Pfizer and she was really down
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.360]   for the count for quite a few days.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.320]   I had no--
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.080]   I had more dare and I had no reaction.
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.280]   Just went about my business.
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.120]   Everybody varies.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.400]   Some people get hit with the first shot.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.600]   Some people with the second shot.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.800]   I feel like that.
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.640]   I think it's because I have no immune system left,
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.400]   sir, or something.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.520]   I don't know.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.320]   You're too important.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.640]   The Pfizer knows that.
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:29.640]   It respects that.
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.480]   Yes, that's why they gave you apple juice instead
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.600]   of an actual vaccine.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.640]   And hello, Alex Lindsey from--
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.480]   Oh my god.
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.120]   May the fourth be with you, Rum Sleg.
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.040]   He's a bounty hunter with a galactic republic.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.160]   Nice.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.560]   Very nice.
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.880]   You know, I brought it up this May 4th because I didn't know
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.600]   until maybe a month ago or two months ago
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.600]   that the action figure had actually come out.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.400]   I was at a--
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.480]   What is Rum Sleg?
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.840]   Is he a bounty hunter?
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.320]   He's a bounty hunter, evidently.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.280]   I didn't know that when I was doing it.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.480]   I didn't really know what to do.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.840]   Is he from the original Star Wars universe,
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.360]   or is he--
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.160]   No, he's from Phantom Menace.
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.400]   Oh, OK.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.280]   So what happened-- the story behind it was that they--
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.120]   I was working at ILM.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.240]   And when you need extras, there's no reason
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.520]   to hire extras at ILM.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.320]   Someone just walks in and says, you, you, and you.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.800]   And they--
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.320]   Especially because you're wearing a costume
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.720]   that you can't really see.
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.520]   Well, that's the whole point.
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.160]   You can't see them.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.280]   And so anyway, so I was picked because I
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.440]   think I looked like I would probably fit into the given suit.
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.280]   And so they put me in a suit.
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.080]   They had another-- someone else was supposed to be with me.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.560]   I'm actually-- I look in the movie like I'm talking to somebody.
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.680]   And I was talking to Jonathan Rothbard.
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.000]   That's you?
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.320]   That's you?
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.840]   Yeah, that's me.
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.520]   You are Rumsleg.
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:48.520]   I am Rumsleg, yeah.
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.120]   It's a far worse character.
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.200]   That's my-- and so what's funny is that-- so that's me walking--
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.600]   I was forced-- of course, I was just walking--
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.880]   Did you have to wear that outfit?
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.640]   Yeah, I wore the outfit, the whole outfit.
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.400]   It was just me in front of a green screen
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.240]   with Jonathan Rothbard.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.960]   And Jonathan Rothbard got--
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.360]   I think that they ended up rotoing him out
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.160]   because you could see his face too clearly.
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.760]   But I don't know for sure why they did that.
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.800]   But so now I'm looking at myself.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.880]   Yeah, I was wearing that mask.
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.360]   I mean, there was nothing changed.
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.680]   And you were talking to somebody who got rotoed out.
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.200]   They rotoed, they got rotoing him.
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.480]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.400]   I stayed in.
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:27.840]   Now we have to do a new Star Wars edit with that guy rotoed back in.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.840]   Yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly.
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.560]   So anyway, so I was-- when you finished it, when I finished it,
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.600]   I walked off and they said, OK, we need you to do T-Poses.
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.240]   And I was like, T-Pose is what you do for 3D modeling.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.000]   And I was like, why do you need a T-Pose?
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.520]   And they were like, oh, it's for the action figure.
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.520]   I was like, I'm going to have an action figure.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.440]   And they were like, well, they said, we'll see.
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.640]   It depends on the third demand.
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.160]   Yeah.
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.640]   They said, we just have to take the picture.
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.960]   You're in the third tier or fourth tier.
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.280]   It's like, the idea is, if you sell enough of the first one,
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.160]   you go to the next tier.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.920]   If you sell enough of that, you go to the next tier.
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.160]   And he said, but Star Wars, it could work.
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.360]   This was the one, the first one.
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.320]   We didn't know what was going to happen.
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.720]   Anyway, it didn't go very well.
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.000]   And there's no Rob Slick action figure, folks.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.400]   Well, no, no, there wasn't at the time of the movie.
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.760]   But on the 10th anniversary, they released a new set of action
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:18.120]   figures.
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.880]   Oh, no.
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.040]   There it is.
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.680]   That's Alex Lindsay.
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.360]   So that means you're canon.
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.880]   You are canon.
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:27.960]   So you're official.
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.480]   So hopefully someone will put that moment.
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.440]   You didn't have a Disney Plus series, Alex.
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.440]   Oh my god.
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.560]   I've known you 20 years, and I never knew this.
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.080]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.240]   Well, it wasn't-- it was something that I didn't think about
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:39.800]   that much.
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.040]   But so I don't know what got--
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:41.920]   How about the guy who got wrote it out?
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.560]   Do he get an action figure?
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.760]   Did he get put in the book of Boba Fett?
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.040]   You should call them right now and say you wanted to book a Boba Fett.
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.120]   If you get an empty box Star Wars action figure, that's him.
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.160]   Yeah.
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:57.480]   So I've decided that I think this is going to be my Halloween--
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.400]   like if I go out with my kids, it'll be a little scary.
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.880]   I should do a hell of a costume.
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.160]   Did you get to keep the costume?
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.000]   Probably not, right?
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:03.800]   They keep that.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.600]   It wasn't-- I'll be honest.
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.760]   It's a movie.
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.040]   It wasn't really that great.
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.560]   It's not like a costume that would have held up.
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.720]   It was the one that I'll probably end up making for Halloween.
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.840]   It'll be much better, right?
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.120]   It's really good.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.080]   Yeah, 3D.
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.400]   Yeah, so--
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:23.880]   Yeah, Alex, would you like to know that the hard plastic
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.800]   prototype for that action figure is now on eBay?
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:27.200]   I know.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.280]   I know it is.
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.680]   I can't-- I know that because I just bought my own action figure.
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.680]   Yes.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:34.440]   Nothing.
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.440]   There's a rum.
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.440]   It was a rum.
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.440]   That's awesome.
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.240]   It was funny.
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.280]   I tweeted it this morning.
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:42.560]   I went to eBay and there was like 29 people watching rum.
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:44.600]   We just watching Rub's leg on eBay.
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:49.040]   Obviously, I made sure to buy a couple before I post today.
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.880]   So I have my supply.
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.240]   There is a prototype up there.
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.200]   Now, unfortunately, we've talked about it on the show.
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.640]   It'll probably be gone.
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.560]   But I wasn't willing to pay.
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.520]   I looked at it a month ago and I was like, I'm not
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.840]   going to pay $545 for a--
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.360]   I'm going to do a rum's leg.
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:10.120]   Yeah, I have new sympathy for you, though.
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.480]   The fact that all the conventions are canceled
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.560]   for the past two years, that's kind of really cut into your
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.560]   income.
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.280]   Happy on the side to the boots side.
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.120]   There's a guy in the corner who's sitting at a table.
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.960]   He says he's rum's leg.
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.560]   Well, I really think he's a mom.
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.080]   I don't know.
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.240]   I want to do a fan film.
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.080]   They're building up all these--
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.480]   as Renee was saying, they're building up all these
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.480]   marble things.
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:32.120]   The adventures of rum's leg, I think, are on their way.
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.680]   The book of rum's leg.
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:34.680]   Yeah, the book of rum's leg.
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.600]   Let me ask you in this--
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.320]   Phantom Menace, are you on Tatooine?
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.080]   Is that where you are?
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.240]   We're in the center of Tatooine.
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:43.800]   Yeah, at the Moss-Eisley space.
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:44.640]   That's pretty cool.
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.280]   Did you go into the cantina while you were there?
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:47.880]   Have a drink?
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:48.640]   It's a green screen.
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.480]   It's all green screen, baby.
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.160]   I could imagine going to the cantina.
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.400]   We almost built one for something.
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:57.880]   Because I think if rum was drinking rum in the cantina,
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.400]   that would be pretty exciting.
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.000]   Well, I think--
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.440]   I funny if he asked for rum.
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:01.920]   Is it rum?
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.680]   What I really want is my own brand of rum.
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:04.680]   Yeah, it's rum rum.
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:05.680]   It's leg rum.
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:06.360]   Sleg rum.
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.200]   Rum's leg.
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.880]   Rum's leg rum.
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:13.280]   That is totally a move that a star wars actor who's had one
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.720]   of those one-line appearances at the booth.
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.200]   You'd be able to buy rum's leg brand,
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.000]   because he knows a guy in the liquor industry.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.440]   But it won't be a problem because it's
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.280]   like a slag.
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.360]   We'll just call it slag.
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.240]   And it'll be slag rum.
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:24.720]   Slag.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.400]   Everyone will know.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.360]   You need to know.
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:31.320]   Apparently, you were cheering Saboeba at the pot race.
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.360]   So that wasn't me.
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.040]   So there's two of us, actually.
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:34.920]   That wasn't-- I wasn't--
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.360]   That was the other rum's leg?
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.000]   That was the other rum's leg.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.560]   You were a hero now at the stand-in.
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:40.040]   Wow.
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:40.880]   I had the major one.
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.840]   But yeah, I had somebody else stand-in.
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.400]   I didn't have time to do that one.
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.720]   I was on another.
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.000]   Officially in the can of folks.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.840]   It was a lovely moment for your lighting
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.520]   double to get that moment.
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.480]   Because I tell those kids--
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.480]   Did you attend?
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.120]   Was that you at the Bunta Classic?
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.680]   I saw it at the Bunta Classic Eve.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:58.920]   Was that you?
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:10:59.920]   Yeah, no.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:00.720]   I don't know.
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.720]   I don't know who got to wear that suit.
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.960]   That's his HGI.
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.280]   Yeah, I don't know who else wore the--
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:06.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:07.560]   --the HGI from his rum's leg.
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:08.520]   And I apologize.
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.360]   A guy bidding on the prototype right now.
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.200]   That's a little sweaty when I got into it.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.360]   Who was the guy in that fin suit?
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.520]   That must have been terrible.
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:16.640]   Oh, the fin suit.
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:17.960]   That's so hard to wear.
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.480]   You don't want to be fin.
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.360]   I will say the rum's leg suit was pretty hot.
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.120]   It's a scuba suit.
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.520]   It's like one of those--
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.880]   In this shot, actually, it looks pretty ratty.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.040]   I'll be honest.
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:28.440]   Yeah.
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:28.920]   It looked better.
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:29.440]   It looked better.
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:32.440]   And you don't take it too far.
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.960]   That's honestly why I thought that it might have been--
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.200]   when I first saw that shot that you put up,
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:42.280]   I thought it might have been from episode the original Star Wars
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.800]   because it did look like, OK, what
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.000]   have we got in the prop house that we just sort of put together
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.320]   randomly when you put a Halloween mask underneath it?
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.600]   See, it's not a scuba suit in the--
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.440]   --and then actually a figure.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.160]   --because it's got little wrinkles and stuff.
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.480]   Yeah, the action figure looks way better than the actual--
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.880]   the reality was much not nearly as good at the action figure.
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:04.760]   It was-- it didn't-- like, I was like, really?
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:07.320]   This is how all-- it was a little bit of a--
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.480]   This is really how all these suits were.
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.280]   That's called movie magic, baby.
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.720]   But 24 frames.
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.280]   That's how we make it.
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.520]   Well, it was all that way.
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:16.200]   We were playing around with what I thought
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:21.120]   was a toy prop of Han Solo's blaster in the ranch.
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.080]   We were like, I was thinking about real deal.
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.680]   So was it put the blaster down?
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.080]   That's the original--
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.080]   Wow.
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:28.880]   It was OK.
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:29.680]   OK, I'll put it down.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:30.480]   Wow.
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.280]   So yeah, so--
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.280]   By the way, they had it up.
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.280]   Day off at the ranch.
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:35.960]   May the fourth.
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:39.240]   The memo went out by an email saying,
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:42.040]   take time for yourself today to do whatever you want.
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:43.680]   So everybody look as--
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.080]   May the fourth be with you.
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.280]   May the fourth be with you.
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.720]   I love it that they celebrate that as a holiday at the ranch.
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:49.880]   And also with you.
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:51.440]   That's hysterical.
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.600]   That's hysterical.
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.160]   Did you get fully vaccinated, Alex?
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.360]   I forgot.
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:00.080]   No, I have to do some medical tests before I can do that.
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.480]   The last vaccine I took, I almost ended up
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.560]   in intensive care in India.
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:04.960]   Oh, no.
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.360]   So I have some--
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.240]   all of them have been traumatic.
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.760]   All the vaccines I had before I was 20, I was fine.
[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:17.280]   After that, my body has had some pretty horrible reactions.
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:20.160]   So I have to get some checkouts before I figure that out.
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.960]   They're not at the ranch anymore.
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.480]   I'm told they're at the Presidio and in Burbank, Vancouver,
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:25.360]   and London.
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.240]   Everybody, there we go.
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:29.800]   I think retcon five is the only guy left at the ranch.
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.680]   He's gone, do I get the day off?
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.360]   I don't know.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.960]   There's still some people at the ranch,
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:35.760]   but it's not nearly as--
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.080]   It doesn't have the Star Wars.
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.680]   Yes, it's not as busy as it used to be.
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:39.040]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:44.520]   The only reason I asked about the vaccine
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:49.160]   is because I think we can officially say,
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.360]   John and I are taking off the masks today.
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:56.120]   And we had the rule that they couldn't cross the camera line.
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.880]   You can now--
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.600]   We're waiting on Burks a second.
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:04.400]   But John, you can come on this side of the studio now.
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:07.880]   Anytime you want-- and I'm going to unlock my office door--
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:10.560]   long deferred maintenance.
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.080]   Much needed.
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.480]   Not just on that studio, but on my eyebrows, it turns out.
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.680]   I'm just looking at it, boy.
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.480]   Anyway, yeah, I'm sorry to say, Renee.
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.520]   I hate to say it to you, but we're slowly coming out last night,
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:24.080]   Lisa and I.
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.000]   Yeah, you guys are doing great.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.160]   Went to dinner and danced with other people.
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.520]   So it's amazing.
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:36.600]   I've gotten pretty burrowed in.
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.680]   Yeah, I feel bad for you.
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:39.680]   So--
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:40.440]   I don't feel bad for you.
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.040]   What are you going to do?
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:41.880]   Well, I mean--
[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:44.880]   My biggest problem is that I don't have--
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.840]   my Herman Miller chair hasn't shown up.
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.000]   Then everything will be complete.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.080]   Then life would be good.
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.080]   Yeah.
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:50.920]   Nice.
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.400]   First-streaming problems.
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.960]   So this morning, I woke up.
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.040]   Well, first of all, I just want to say,
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.760]   I am now with the cool kids.
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:14:59.760]   I gather--
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:00.600]   I use a tag deal.
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.880]   You can-- this is not an Hermes.
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.040]   I'm sorry.
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.960]   But I did spend the-- whatever.
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:10.440]   The Apple leather key chain ring is more expensive
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.040]   than the air tag itself.
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.240]   Well, they have legal bills to play.
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:18.400]   I got a monogram with the most dopey monogram, which is Leo.
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:21.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:22.880]   It's such a-- when you think about it,
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.200]   it's such a quint-- it's quintessentially Apple product
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:29.560]   where, essentially, they're charging you $35 for a hole.
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:32.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.360]   It's like--
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:35.920]   It's like--
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.480]   even the hole is a dongle.
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:40.520]   For God's sake, Apple, what are you doing to yourselves?
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.120]   I have to say, I am very--
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.880]   the pairing is exactly as easy as I thought it would be--
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.400]   and you know this, Renee, because you've had them for a while.
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.160]   But it's just like the AirPods.
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.240]   It's just you open up--
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:55.280]   there's a little plastic tape in there
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:58.600]   that's protecting the battery, and you pull that out.
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.760]   It goes, "Piddly?"
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:02.640]   And then your phone pops up and it says, "Air tag,
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.960]   you get to name it."
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:07.400]   And you can rename it, because I named it something wrong
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.680]   initially, but I decided to name it.
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:11.600]   Here's Leo's keys.
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:12.880]   That's the name of this one.
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:16.280]   And then it's in Find My On the Phone.
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:21.960]   What's funny is it's not in Find My On the Web, which is weird.
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:22.480]   They're--
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.720]   They're like a whole year to do this, too.
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.400]   I mean, come on, Apple.
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:29.600]   Do you think there's some rationale behind that?
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.080]   I don't understand it.
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:33.440]   I remember when the HomePod didn't have a feature,
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.200]   and then you found out it was one engineer working
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.360]   on the HomePod software.
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:39.480]   And you said, "Ah, you're a trillion dollar company."
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.040]   But I haven't lost it yet.
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.080]   But if I do, I'll be looking forward to--
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.920]   I'm looking-- I'm going to leave it somewhere,
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.480]   so I can find it again.
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.840]   Apple has revealed more.
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.200]   There's been considerable concern.
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:55.040]   In fact, the domestic violence of a nonprofit group
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:58.040]   has said, "Apple, you need to make some changes
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.640]   to your air tags."
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:02.000]   That was a long, mashable article,
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.760]   where she demonstrated that, in fact, the air tags were kind
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:06.400]   of usable for stalking.
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:10.600]   Apple has said a little bit more about their protection.
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:14.160]   This is from Fast Company.
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.680]   The National Network to End Domestic Violence
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.440]   and Leading Nonprofit with the Goal of Ending Violence
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:25.320]   Against Women has said that Apple needs to maybe--
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:27.720]   they say, "Well, air tags are cheap and easy to use product
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:28.560]   to find a lost item.
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.200]   They're a worrisome surveillance tool
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:33.040]   that could be leveraged by an abuser to discreetly
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:36.480]   track a partner."
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:39.600]   Apple's response-- I don't know.
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:40.720]   What do you think, Renee?
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.200]   You kind of are more up on this.
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.280]   You got briefed by Apple.
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:47.720]   We talked about the usual places thing.
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.520]   In the mashable article, she said,
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:56.240]   it took three days before the device notified anybody
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:59.800]   that it was lost or missing.
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:00.300]   Yeah.
[00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:01.520]   I think it's tough, because you also
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:02.840]   have on the other side, you have a bunch of people
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:06.520]   who are super angry that it doesn't work better for theft--
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:10.280]   for catching thieves, because it's not monitoring consistently
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.280]   24/7, my new thing.
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:12.280]   Well, I'm not to do that.
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.280]   Yeah.
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:16.560]   It's like Brenda Stollier, I'm referring to,
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.720]   which is titled, "AirTags are Scarily Good Attracting Items
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:20.440]   and People."
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.640]   I know, because I tried--
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.880]   with their knowledge, gave it to roommates
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:28.680]   and was able to track them right down to their address
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.520]   for a long time.
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:33.320]   The biggest problem is, if you have an iPhone with 14.5
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:35.960]   on it, you'll know.
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:36.680]   You'll be notified.
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.800]   But so many people don't.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.600]   And if you have an Android phone, really,
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:43.400]   if it's well hidden, you're not going to find it for a lease.
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.200]   And is it reset?
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.400]   So if you come back to a house--
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.120]   like if you had it in your backpack,
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:49.920]   and you don't have your house, or--
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.960]   Well, let me put it this way, Alex.
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.880]   Let's say I have an eye on you.
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.560]   And while we're at a coffee shop,
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:58.800]   I surreptitiously put it in a pouch,
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.480]   an unused pouch in your bag.
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.960]   You're never going to go to my house.
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.320]   So that isn't going to solve anything.
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.600]   But no, but if I know where you were--
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:08.120]   And that's what I designed.
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:10.360]   But for instance, if I put it in my--
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:14.240]   So we are constantly figuring out where our kids are
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.760]   when we need to pick them up at the park.
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:19.040]   So this is my number one need for two of these.
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:22.920]   And the idea is that they know that it's there.
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:24.600]   It's in their backpack.
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:28.480]   And it seems like if they're not being--
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.760]   when they come back home, they're near my phone again,
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.840]   it would just keep resetting, right?
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.360]   That it's just like, oh, I found it.
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:34.960]   The three day--
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:35.160]   Oh, it's gone.
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:35.760]   Yeah, yeah, the three day.
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:36.520]   Oh, I found it.
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:42.480]   And I feel like that is a bit of a balancing of need
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.520]   in that sense.
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:47.000]   Because it helps us, again, my kids would know it's there.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.640]   It's not like we're trying to track them.
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:51.240]   But it is nice when we're trying to meet them, especially
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.080]   if you think about--
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:56.160]   if someday we go back to going to things like baseball
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.800]   parks and arenas, it'd be super useful to have somebody
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.280]   have a tracker so you knew where they were.
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.120]   Let me show you what it says in the article.
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:09.280]   So if I slip it into your bag and you
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:10.720]   have an iPhone with 14.
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:13.800]   5 on it, it will give you a safety alert.
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.440]   Your current location can be seen by the owner of this air tech.
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:17.720]   So that's good.
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.960]   But the problem is not everybody has an iPhone with 14.
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:21.640]   5 on it.
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:23.160]   And you don't get this right away.
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.960]   Apple says, over time--
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:32.520]   and in her tests, over time could be quite a while.
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:33.240]   It's varied.
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:35.640]   There have been some tests where people didn't get it for two
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:35.880]   days.
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.840]   And there have been some tests where they got them very fast.
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:39.840]   And it seems to depend on location.
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.040]   And what I would really like-- because this
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.760]   is a really difficult balancing act
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.880]   between finding things and not tracking people--
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:46.880]   is there to be modes.
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.920]   So if the air tech is just on somebody
[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:51.160]   and it's not doing anything, that's fine.
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.760]   But if you go to your phone and start tracking that air
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:56.680]   tech, I would love it to relay an immediate pop up that
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:58.360]   says this air tech is now being tracked.
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.600]   And that doesn't matter if you're at significant location,
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:02.560]   if it's been whatever--
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.280]   But again, if you can dismiss it--
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:08.640]   If Alex didn't have an iPhone, it would chirp.
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:11.280]   And it chirps after three days, according to--
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.800]   But I think it should chirp if it's being tracked.
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.760]   Like if someone puts it in the fact mode--
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:17.160]   And they could fix this.
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:19.720]   And I hope they do, because that's all software.
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:20.960]   But according to Brenda Stolier, you
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:21.880]   are running in Mashable.
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.120]   It took three days before it started chirping.
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:25.680]   But the anti-theft people will hate that,
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.480]   because they'll think it'll chirp and they won't just
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:27.680]   get rid of it.
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:28.680]   They won't be able to find it there.
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:29.440]   Well, I'd be throwing trackers.
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.720]   I would throw trackers into my luggage,
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:33.400]   but not if it's going to chirp, because someone's
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:34.320]   going to open it up.
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.040]   Well, and that's exactly why Apple doesn't
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:37.040]   chirp for three days.
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:40.160]   They said, that's a perfect example.
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:43.480]   If it doesn't chirp for your flight until you get--
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:44.440]   then that's fine.
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:45.560]   Or your wallet.
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:48.640]   Someone finds it takes all your money and then leaves it.
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:53.400]   So obviously, it's a balance.
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.440]   And it's not been a problem with previous trackers,
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.240]   because they weren't very good.
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:00.480]   But Apple with a billion phones out there is pretty accurate.
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.000]   Yeah, it's pretty accurate.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.600]   If someone's serious about it--
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:07.920]   I guess I feel like it's a balance from people like me
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:11.000]   who want to track things for lost items or lose
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.160]   a lot of things often.
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:15.440]   And so wanting to know where they are is pretty useful.
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.280]   And again, trying to be able to find people--
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:18.720]   I think that there's a balancing act there,
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.880]   because I can tell you, if you want to track someone,
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:21.720]   it's not very hard.
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:23.920]   Like, there's a lot of great technology to do that right now.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.560]   If someone's serious about doing that,
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:28.000]   you can go to Alibaba or some--
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.080]   You could buy a lot of places.
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:29.840]   Yes, devices.
[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.760]   You can download so much stuff that it's so effective
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:33.360]   to do this.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.000]   And it wouldn't be--
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.200]   There's a difference.
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:35.840]   Here's the difference.
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:37.600]   GPS, if it's in a bag, isn't going to work.
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.000]   If you're inside, it's not going to work.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.320]   These air tags work everywhere.
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:42.800]   I don't know.
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.720]   Can you buy a device that's going to work as well as the air
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.520]   tag?
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:46.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:47.360]   Buy better stuff.
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:48.920]   Because GPS is not.
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.760]   GPS is not.
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.680]   No, you can--
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.320]   It's not going to be more accurate.
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:59.600]   So the air tags have the ability to be plus or minus centimeters.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.520]   That's the big advantage there.
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:04.120]   But if you are from a tracking perspective,
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:07.800]   as far as works everywhere, works anywhere in the world,
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.640]   the GPS is super effective.
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:11.640]   And yeah, when you go into a building,
[00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.120]   I can't do it, but it knows what building you're in.
[00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:16.600]   And so it's pretty accurate.
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:17.320]   And it's pretty useful.
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:18.320]   It's not very expensive.
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:18.920]   The other hand--
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.240]   Sisted GPS.
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:23.880]   So they just pull your cell tower location anywhere.
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:26.560]   On the other hand, we do hold Apple to a higher standard
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:29.320]   than random seller on AliExpress.
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:31.880]   So Apple has a much higher profile,
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:33.360]   and therefore, a much higher responsibility.
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.600]   There's an Australian store called OfficeWorks
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:39.120]   that has already pulled them from the shelves due to this.
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:40.960]   Yeah.
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.560]   If I was going to--
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:43.880]   I guess if I was going to track somebody,
[00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:45.600]   I would never do it with this because of the chance
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.120]   that if I don't get it back in three days,
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:47.640]   I'm going to get--
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:49.120]   I'm just going to start chirping.
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.560]   That's the three days is the thing.
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:51.320]   I would never do that.
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:52.320]   Actually, I'd take it back.
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.480]   But your OfficeWorks pulled it because children
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:55.480]   could swallow the battery.
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:58.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:23:59.920]   Well, then that's the ultimate--
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.480]   That's another safety issue.
[00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:02.880]   But if it wasn't user-replaceable,
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:03.800]   it'd swallow the whole thing.
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:04.920]   Right.
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:05.960]   Yeah, it could easily.
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.200]   It's not that big.
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.280]   You could swallow the whole thing.
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:13.840]   The other argument is that it is just as scary because--
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:17.160]   when I lock up my bike, I'm not worried
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.320]   about the professional thieves who
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:21.480]   have the angled rinder because there's
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:22.480]   no way you can defeat them.
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.360]   They're going to find a way to commit the crime they're going
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:24.920]   to do.
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:26.840]   What I'm worried about is the knuckleheads.
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:28.680]   The ones that-- well, if I just--
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:31.000]   I'm just going in for like 45 seconds.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.400]   I'm just dropping off this package.
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.760]   I'm coming right back out again.
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.240]   I'm worried about the knuckleheads.
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:37.240]   Like, hey, look, free bike.
[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:38.760]   And toss it off with it.
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:41.080]   And that's the sort of knucklehead behavior
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:42.040]   that could be possible.
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:43.320]   If you have, hey, here's something,
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:44.280]   you can go into the Apple Store.
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:46.920]   Hey, I've heard of it because Apple's promoting this everywhere.
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.800]   Hey, look how easy it is to do.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.280]   Hey, wouldn't it be funny if I just
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:54.920]   drop this tracker into my friend's bag
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:57.480]   or my girlfriend's bag or whatever,
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:59.400]   just to see where she's going?
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.880]   That's the sort of knucklehead behavior
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:02.360]   that can be really, really dangerous.
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:04.920]   And that's Apple should be worried about trying
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.840]   to block off.
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:09.880]   And the truth is there's nasty stuff
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:13.440]   that you can download and put on a girlfriend's phone.
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.600]   Or if you can get somebody's phone,
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:16.760]   then all that's rough.
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:20.080]   You're carrying an amazing tracking device, Android,
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.480]   or iOS is actually easier on Android.
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:23.720]   So that's--
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:30.720]   You feel more evil installing malware on someone.
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:33.400]   We're asked, hey, I wonder if she really
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.720]   is going up with her girlfriend's night.
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:37.720]   And that is just as much of a breach of trust
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.960]   as more serious stuff.
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:41.280]   Anyway, something to be aware of.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:42.480]   I'm actually a little more concerned.
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.040]   The fact that it's not an iCloud.
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:46.320]   I can't find my stuff on iCloud.
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:47.080]   I have to have a phone.
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:48.560]   What if I lost my phone and my keys?
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:49.240]   Now what do I do?
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:51.240]   What?
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:53.360]   I'm going to go buy an Apple watch.
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:57.040]   Keys, themes, Bible-- yeah, exactly.
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:58.160]   They're devious.
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:00.280]   Oh, they got you coming and going.
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:02.200]   I'm scared of how much you're in tune
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:05.320]   with the Apple way of thinking, Renee.
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:06.600]   Well, don't you have a watch?
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:09.680]   Come on.
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:13.280]   The EU, as we had predicted, did charge Apple
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:14.680]   with antitrust violations.
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:17.560]   This is the so-called Spotify case.
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:22.200]   It was Spotify's complaint against the EU against Apple's
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:27.400]   App Store and their 30% that has caused the EU to say,
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:30.680]   Apple distorted competition.
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:32.640]   Partly their complaint is that they--
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:37.480]   Apple not only charges a 30% but forbade apps to say,
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:42.160]   hey, you could buy a cheaper online, which I think--
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:45.240]   yeah, I can't understand what there's.
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:48.680]   The case says Margarit Vestiger, who
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.720]   is the competition czar in the EU.
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:53.600]   The case is about the central role of app stores
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:55.000]   in the digital economy.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.120]   An app store can become a gatekeeper,
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.400]   and particularly if there is only one app store available
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:00.480]   in a mobile ecosystem.
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:02.240]   Well, yeah, in fact, I think Apple would say, yeah,
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:03.000]   we're the gatekeeper.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   That's exactly the point.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.960]   We have a costume and everything.
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:12.240]   At the core of the case is Spotify, she says,
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:15.280]   is Spotify's demand they should be able to--
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:15.920]   oh, no, I'm sorry.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:17.000]   This is an Apple spokesman.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.520]   At the core of the case is Spotify's demand,
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.600]   they should be able to advertise alternative deals
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:26.280]   in their iOS app, practice no store in the world allows.
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:26.920]   I guess you're right.
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:27.840]   If you go to Target--
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:28.760]   People have cleared out--
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:30.320]   There's not going to be a sticker on here.
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.320]   So you get a cheaper down the road.
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:34.280]   But the-- well, I mean, people find out
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:36.680]   that the packaging often has the website of the company
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.280]   that makes the doohickey on it.
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:39.760]   And once you look at the doohickey,
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:42.160]   you see their www.doohickey.com.
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:45.320]   Well, there are apps you can scan a barcode,
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:46.920]   and I'll say, here's where you can get it cheaper.
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:50.120]   So yeah.
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:51.280]   I think this is going to be--
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:53.640]   I think Apple's big worry was that initially when they first
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:57.560]   made IAP in app purchases, you couldn't use them in free apps.
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.560]   And then they said you could use them in free apps.
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:01.440]   But I think their worry was that everyone
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:03.960]   was going to move the entire economy outside the app store.
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:05.440]   Like everyone would make a free app,
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:06.800]   and then you'd go there, and it would tell you
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:08.040]   where you could go buy stuff.
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:09.720]   And so they clamped it down, which I think
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.480]   was probably fine in 2010, 2012.
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:14.200]   But it's 2021 now.
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:17.160]   And I think just the lack of evolution in the app store
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:19.680]   is going to bite it with these sorts of trust cases,
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:20.320]   anti-trust cases.
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:22.200]   So I don't know if there's a trial, but Apple--
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:22.920]   there's something.
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:25.040]   There's some sort of proceedings in which Apple
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:29.360]   will be able to argue its case before the European Commission.
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:31.800]   If they're found guilty, they could face a fine of 10%
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:36.320]   of annual revenue and be forced to adjust business practices.
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.600]   But there is also an appeal process,
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.360]   and they could take it to court, which so this
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:42.640]   is going to go on for a while.
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:44.160]   I mean, this is going to be Apple.
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.080]   I mean, Apple is technologically significantly
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:49.720]   far ahead of everybody else right now,
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:51.320]   in a variety of different--
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:53.000]   in a variety of different business areas.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.440]   And their business model is really, really strong.
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:00.800]   Their customer loyalty is really, really strong.
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:04.240]   And they just have-- they're in an incredibly dominant position,
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:07.320]   even though their market share is less than 50%,
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:10.440]   which in the United States, all these antitrust stuff
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.240]   in the United States is not going to go anywhere.
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:15.160]   But EU is a much different set of rules.
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:18.760]   And especially when it's Spotify, I feel like the EU court
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:22.520]   oftentimes is desperate to try to make sure that they
[00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:25.320]   can protect European interests, because otherwise,
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.320]   you just get plowed over.
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:28.960]   Spotify is Swedish.
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:31.000]   Swedish, somewhere over there.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.640]   And so I think that that-- the different set of rules--
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:41.920]   and the next decade is going to be Apple's real--
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:44.880]   they don't have competition, really.
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:47.560]   What they have is dealing with antitrust,
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:51.000]   because they're moving at the speed of a startup,
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.520]   but at the size of a M1 tank.
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:57.720]   And that will scare a lot of people for a long time.
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:59.280]   That sounds like we call Blitzkrieg,
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.720]   and it has a bad history.
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:04.160]   Well, it's just that it's that they're--
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:04.760]   The masterite.
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:09.000]   We're actually-- usually a company at this size
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.440]   loses its vitality.
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.040]   And the problem is that Apple keeps
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.840]   on adding to what it's doing.
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:18.280]   So the M1 process is going to really push things forward.
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:20.040]   AR is going to keep on pushing things forward.
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:22.480]   They have a much better business model
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:24.960]   with their store than everybody else.
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:27.920]   And so the thing is, is they have all these advantages,
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:30.240]   and they are a very tightly run company that
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.360]   doesn't have all the craziness that a lot of other companies
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:32.640]   have.
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:36.120]   And so it's just going to be almost impossible for anyone
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:37.320]   to compete with them.
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:39.880]   So that's going to be who's going to compete with them
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:41.640]   as the government's trying to figure out
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:44.760]   how they deal with it, because they're not doing anything.
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:47.040]   I mean, they're not doing anything out rightly wrong.
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:48.600]   I think that the complicated part for Apple--
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:49.360]   Well, they might be--
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:52.000]   I mean, they may be in violation of any trust rules.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.240]   I don't think that that's--
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:55.160]   Again, in the US, it's really hard
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:56.720]   to get in violation of antitrust when
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.440]   you have a minority stake.
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:30:59.560]   In the EU, they kind of--
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:01.160]   I don't believe that that's the case.
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:03.320]   When it says, when is anybody who has--
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:06.600]   Anybody who had a minority thing been hit with antitrust,
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:07.840]   ever.
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.680]   Since the Sherman Act was created,
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:12.760]   I don't think anybody with a minority stake in a market,
[00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:17.080]   unless you can define the iPhone as a majority of itself,
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:19.120]   which is just insane.
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:20.680]   All these phones look exactly the same.
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:21.560]   They do exactly--
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:22.600]   That's what they're doing, though.
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:24.200]   They're defining it as the iOS market.
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:24.840]   It's like the internet--
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:26.800]   They're trying to, but it's market.
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:28.520]   And I would refer you to the case
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:32.680]   of the city of Wichita versus Kansas City brick.
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:34.160]   OK.
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:35.920]   OK.
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:38.000]   But in a federal case that would stand up
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.560]   in the current Supreme Court, it's a pipe dream.
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:43.520]   And so the thing is is that it is--
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:45.280]   so the United States is not really the issue,
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.080]   but the EU kind of makes up all their own rules.
[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:49.320]   That case, by the way, didn't make it to the Supreme Court.
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:51.440]   The Supreme Court did, I believe,
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:53.480]   find in favor of Kansas City brick.
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:55.720]   But, however, the fact is that when
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:32:01.920]   the case of the Supreme Court shows you that it is still
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:05.520]   potentially risky for Apple, Senator Amy Klobuchar--
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:06.400]   No, it's--
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:08.720]   So I noted in this Wall Street Journal article saying
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:11.160]   the charges brought in Europe only reaffirmed
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:13.280]   that App Store policies and conduct
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:15.800]   deserve both careful scrutiny and action in our own country.
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:18.600]   Apple, of course, had the testified--
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:21.120]   or was asked to testify at a Senate antitrust hearing
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.800]   last week over this.
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:25.640]   I don't agree with your assessment.
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:27.840]   It's not going to be a problem in the US.
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:30.120]   No, it may not be as bad as it is in the EU,
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:32.040]   but I think this is going to be a problem everywhere.
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:34.240]   It won't be a problem in the courts.
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:37.480]   It'll be a problem for them if there's legislation
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:38.800]   that changes the rules.
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:40.720]   So you'd have to change the rules that they're playing under.
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:42.920]   But I don't think that there's any valid--
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:43.560]   All right, fine.
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:44.560]   I don't think any can happen in the courts.
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:47.200]   So it could be an issue in Congress then, not in the courts.
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:47.560]   Yes.
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:48.880]   But the problem is, is Congress is--
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:51.480]   The current Congress will only last another 18 months,
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:52.400]   and then it'll be over.
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:53.400]   Like, it'll be a whole different one,
[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:54.200]   and I'll have to start over again.
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.560]   Yeah, it won't.
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:56.560]   It won't.
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:33:00.480]   This is a strongly bipartisan effort
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:03.600]   to reign in tech companies.
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:08.120]   Both sides of the aisle have very, very passionate reasons
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:11.720]   to go after big tech, partly for good reasons,
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:14.800]   partly because they have an immense amount of power
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:18.080]   that has gone unchecked initially in the '90s,
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:19.800]   in 2000s, for very good reasons.
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:23.160]   But now, there are huge, titanic monsters
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:25.840]   that can basically do whatever they want
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:28.560]   without having to answer to anybody pretty much.
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:29.120]   Both parties.
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:30.080]   And it's pretty funny to have it.
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:34.720]   But we're not talking about Klobuchar being voted out,
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.040]   and suddenly your problem goes away.
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:38.760]   Now, you've got 18 others that you've got to deal with.
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:40.680]   You've got to deal with--
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:43.520]   It's a resharpful effort.
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:44.240]   It's a party.
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:46.720]   No, this is not going away.
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:49.360]   They got three years to write this out,
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:51.360]   if they can write this out.
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:53.720]   The funny thing is that we have a bunch of people
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:56.040]   that are legislating about tech that probably
[00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:56.680]   don't know how to use it.
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:59.000]   Most of the people who are legislating don't use email.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:33:59.960]   I don't think they don't--
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:01.000]   They don't-- they literally don't.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:01.520]   They disagree with you.
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:02.520]   I disagree with that.
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:03.520]   I disagree with that.
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:04.520]   I disagree with that.
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:05.520]   You know, yes.
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:06.520]   But I don't think your opinion is the only opinion.
[00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:08.040]   And I think there's a very, very, very strong case
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:10.440]   against the way Apple runs its app store.
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:12.800]   And we disagree on that.
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:16.000]   But the fact that you believe so strongly that Apple is justified
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.520]   does not mean they're going to get away with this at all.
[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:19.360]   No, no.
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:21.520]   I don't think that they're going to get away with it.
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:22.520]   I think that they're going to have to--
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:24.520]   What I was talking about is that with the antitrust,
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:25.720]   they're going to have to move things around.
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:28.040]   And I think that they're going to have to look at giving--
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:30.720]   I think they're going to have to give other stores a chance.
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:33.320]   And other payment-- maybe at least other payment systems
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:34.640]   a chance.
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:35.480]   I think that you're right.
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:38.080]   And I think that the cost that people are going to find,
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:39.760]   though, the question is, is what do you--
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.160]   Well, what would be wrong if you had a second--
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:43.400]   what would be wrong if instead of having to pay Apple,
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:45.200]   you had to pay Stripe or somebody else?
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:45.840]   No, no, no, no.
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:46.960]   What would be wrong with that?
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:49.160]   What would be the risk inherent in that?
[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:52.800]   What Apple should do-- in my opinion, what Apple should do
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.200]   is give people another store.
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:55.760]   Like, let people have another store.
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:58.480]   But you can't use any of their platform.
[00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:00.120]   You can't use any of their copy protection.
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:02.680]   You can't use any of the things that makes their platform
[00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:03.920]   the value that they bring to it.
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:06.480]   OK, but sort of giving them another store is crazy.
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.040]   One of the solutions-- and I suspect this
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:10.960]   is going to be the solution that ends up happening--
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:13.600]   is, OK, you don't have to give us 30--
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:14.920]   well, I guess you'd have to do another store.
[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:17.480]   Wouldn't you if you're doing a payment to somebody else,
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:19.320]   Apple doesn't get to carry your app?
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:20.720]   They could just let them use Apple Pay,
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:22.160]   which is what a lot of the companies want.
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:24.360]   They just want to only pay the credit card fees.
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:25.480]   And they say, what about that?
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:26.120]   What if they did that?
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:27.080]   That's a good way to do it.
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:28.560]   There's a whole bunch of remunerations.
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:31.520]   They all have consequences intended and unintended.
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:33.320]   But Apple's going to have to compromise on some of them.
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:37.240]   So you can start paying for all the downloads for your app.
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:38.560]   You know, like, if you want to do that,
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:40.080]   it happens everywhere else.
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:41.600]   What about it, Steve?
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:45.360]   What about if Steve wanted to run a store on iOS or Epic?
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:46.040]   I think that--
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:47.080]   I think if they want to run a store--
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:48.640]   They don't just want a store.
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.000]   They want the store on the app store,
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.560]   because they're still-- they're suing Google as well as Apple.
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:55.080]   And Google has way more liberal policies than Apple.
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:56.160]   But it's still not enough on them.
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.200]   They want the store on--
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:57.680]   What Epic wants--
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:58.880]   They want all the marketing benefits and everything.
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:35:59.080]   Yeah.
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:03.040]   What if would it solve the problem if you had an Epic store in there?
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:04.760]   It's like they want to go to the mall.
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:06.520]   They want to place in the mall.
[00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:07.760]   And they want all the security.
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:08.680]   And they want the power.
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:11.720]   And they want the traffic and everything else of the mall.
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:12.880]   But they don't want to pay for it.
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:14.840]   Like, they don't want to pay for being in the mall.
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:16.520]   They want to--
[00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:18.320]   Like, I should have exactly the same deal
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:19.320]   I have outside the mall.
[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.360]   You pay rent to be in the mall, but do you
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:24.560]   pay 30% of your revenue to the mall?
[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:26.440]   But you could--
[00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:28.040]   that would be a different business model.
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.760]   The malls may turn to that.
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.840]   So anyway, but there's a whole bunch of people
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:32.720]   on the other side of that--
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:34.160]   It's an appropriate analogy, because it's not--
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:34.520]   I know.
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:37.280]   But at the same time, if you put up a free application,
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:40.240]   you're not paying anything for the PR, the distribution,
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:42.560]   all of those things are--
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:44.840]   You're getting for free.
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:45.360]   And if you--
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:46.880]   Could not be enough for everybody?
[00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:48.120]   Say again, be keeper.
[00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:48.960]   Be keeper.
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:51.280]   If they just allow a gatekeeper, because then you'd have to use--
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:53.280]   like, you wouldn't be able to use your payment system on the app
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:56.040]   store, but people could the same way they can on a Mac,
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.040]   change their settings, and then go and download things
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:00.160]   from websites the same way you can on Android.
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:02.040]   Again, it's not enough for Epic, but I think it would be enough
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:04.000]   for a lot of developers.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   I'm going to take a break and do an ad.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.160]   What I'm going to do is we have a stage going in our Club
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:13.680]   to Discord, and I'd be curious what some of our listeners
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:14.600]   have to say about it.
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:18.160]   If you have a thought on this app store,
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:20.960]   do you want to defend Alex and say he's right?
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:24.680]   There's at least one person in the Discord chat who says that.
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:27.000]   Maybe you think there's another solution.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:27.720]   Raise your hand.
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:30.480]   It's at the bottom of the page in the stage, East Side Life
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:31.120]   Stage.
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:32.360]   There's a little hand raise icon.
[00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:36.760]   Press that, and we'll give you a chance to speak in just a minute.
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:41.720]   We showed it a brought to you by our good friends at Molecule.
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:42.840]   Got Molecules everywhere.
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:45.880]   Boy, when COVID hit, I made sure we had molecules in the studio.
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:48.080]   We already had Molecules at home in our bedroom
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:49.680]   and in Michael's bedroom.
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:50.280]   Molecule.
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:52.320]   We're all spending a lot more time indoors.
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:55.440]   And if you're unfortunately going back to the office where
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:59.800]   it's sealed, your indoor air can be bad, up to five times worse
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:00.520]   than outdoor air.
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:02.800]   And that's according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:06.040]   That's why Molecule is reimagining the future
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:08.600]   of clean air starting with the air purifier.
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.800]   This is not a filter.
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:13.680]   It's not just existing technology refined.
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:15.720]   It's a breakthrough in air purification.
[00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:17.680]   They use something called Pico.
[00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:18.920]   That's their core technology.
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:23.840]   PECO stands for photo, electrochemical oxidation.
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:26.640]   And it actually doesn't trap bad stuff.
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:29.080]   It actually destroys harmful pollutants in the air.
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:32.640]   Destroyes them, like viruses, bacteria, and mold.
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:35.040]   They're designed to protect homes, businesses, and medical spaces.
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:39.840]   You're destroying the pollutants with light and providing clean air.
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:42.400]   It's really kind of a miracle design.
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:47.120]   There's now a variety of molecules available at their website.
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:51.440]   That, by the way, that's M-O-L-E-K-U-L-E, Molecule.com.
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:54.200]   The Molecule Air Mini for rooms up to 250 square feet.
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:57.040]   We have the Air Pro because we have a pretty big studio.
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:59.760]   We have the Air in our home and the Molecule Air Pro
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:01.840]   for rooms up to 1,000 square feet.
[00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:05.080]   There's also the Mini Plus now, which helps protect small rooms
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:07.720]   of the particle sensor and auto-protect mode
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:09.840]   that adjusts the fan speed based on the sensor.
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:11.680]   If you're in a small room, you kind of want that.
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:13.080]   You don't want it to be loud.
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:16.320]   You want it to be as loud as it needs to be,
[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.800]   but quiet when it doesn't need to be.
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:21.240]   There's also, for medical offices, dental offices,
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:25.080]   the Molecule Air Pro RX cleared for medical purposes
[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:27.440]   to destroy bacteria and viruses.
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:29.920]   Cleaning their air is more important than ever.
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:31.520]   Molecule's Pico technology meets the
[00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:34.080]   performance requirements and FDA guidance for use
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:37.440]   in help reducing the risk of exposure to the COVID-19 virus
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:38.880]   in healthcare settings.
[00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:41.440]   We've been using this since the pandemic started,
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:44.440]   along with hand washing and social distancing and masks,
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:47.080]   and I'm very happy to say nobody at TWIT
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:49.040]   has contracted COVID-19.
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:51.600]   I think part of that's thanks to the Molecule.
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:57.760]   Do check out the Molecule reviews to see not only customer reviews,
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:59.920]   but there are scientific articles from places
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:03.040]   like the Lawrence Berkeley Labs,
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:05.560]   where they actually tested the Molecule and found it really
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:09.840]   did a good job of eliminating volatile organic compounds.
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:12.000]   Molecule's technology and filtration systems
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.800]   have been tested and verified by many independent third party
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:15.680]   labs.
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:18.240]   It's for your whole home and beyond.
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:20.880]   They now offer breakthrough Pico technology across a range
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:21.600]   of products.
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:23.920]   Pick the unit that's best for your space
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:25.200]   or create a discounted bundle.

[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:28.720]   Wow.
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:30.720]   I think they upped that on Molecule Air Purifiers
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:32.720]   by visiting Molecule.com.
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:36.320]   Here's the promo code MACBreak120.

[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:56.560]   Molecule.com, we thank them so much for their support
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:58.320]   of MACBreak weekly.
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:02.240]   And for keeping us safe for this whole pandemic,
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:05.160]   Molecule.com, the MACBreak120 code
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:08.240]   will save you $120 on selected purifiers.
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:11.720]   MACBreak120.0.
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:13.160]   Let's head to the Discord.
[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:14.840]   Something I'm trying these days.
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:17.240]   I'm going to invite Kovaar, a Braille teacher,
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:18.560]   and Joe up onto the stage.
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:23.680]   We'll start with whoever unmutes their mic first.
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:24.640]   Kovaar.
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:25.680]   Hey, Kovaar, welcome.
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:29.840]   Hey, I think it's a great discussion.
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:32.560]   I bounce back and forth every time I hear it.
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:33.520]   So do I.
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:34.040]   So do I.
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:35.600]   I know what you mean, yeah.
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:40.400]   And maybe just as a retailer myself,
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:44.240]   I maybe side a little bit with Alex on this.
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:45.800]   But I didn't just want to clarify.
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:47.800]   The Mole analogy is kind of interesting,
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:52.400]   because big moles, what you think
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:53.640]   of traditional Molecule, not strip malt,
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:58.920]   actually do often charge for a percentage of your revenue
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:00.200]   to be paid out each quarter.
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:00.880]   Oh, they do.
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:02.000]   So it is an exact--
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:02.440]   Yeah.
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:03.120]   OK.
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:03.800]   There you go.
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:07.800]   Yeah, that's in addition to their normal large fat flat fee.
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:09.960]   Yeah, you get the rent and a percent.
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:10.880]   All right.
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:11.920]   So it's a perfect analogy.
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:14.280]   It's not 30%, though, that's for sure.
[00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:15.920]   Yeah, but I have to point out 30%
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:18.560]   is pretty much the going rate on PlayStation, Xbox,
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:19.960]   and a lot of other app stores.
[00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:22.480]   It's not an unusual number.
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:23.800]   So, yeah.
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:27.000]   Yeah, and of course, the products we take are usually 50%.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.280]   Yeah, what's the markup in your retail store, exactly.
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:29.960]   Yeah.
[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:31.520]   Yeah.
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:32.240]   Thank you, Kovaar.
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:34.440]   Where are you located?
[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:35.440]   Raleigh, North Carolina.
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:35.920]   Very nice.
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:37.840]   And what's your store?
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:39.840]   That would be Ultimate Comics.
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:41.120]   Oh, I've talked to you before.
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:41.840]   He's a comic book.
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:42.400]   Very, yeah.
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:43.280]   Yeah.
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:47.000]   And we talked about-- because normally May 1 is a free comic
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   book day, but they're putting it off thanks to COVID
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.680]   till the fall.
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:52.720]   That's right, August 14.
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:53.640]   OK, August 14.
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:56.200]   All good comic stores everywhere.
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:56.960]   Thank you, Kovaar.
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:58.120]   What's the name of your comic book store?
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:42:59.480]   Tell everybody.
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:00.280]   Ultimate Comics.
[00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:02.440]   Ultimate Comics in Raleigh.
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:03.160]   Yep.
[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:04.000]   Go on in there.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.760]   Say hi.
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:07.360]   Thanks, Kovaar.
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:10.640]   I'll invite Braille teacher up onto the stage.
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:12.800]   I think I remember the name is Vicky.
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:14.480]   Hi, Vicky.
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:15.280]   Hey, Leo.
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:17.080]   Hi, everybody.
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:18.640]   First, I want to say I love the show.
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:20.640]   And thank you for letting me speak.
[00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:21.640]   Always a pleasure.
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:23.360]   Thanks for calling.
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:26.160]   Whatever you did, raising your hand.
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:27.920]   Press the button.
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:28.440]   Me too.
[00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:29.440]   I'm there with you.
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:31.160]   Thanks.
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:36.040]   What you said about the 30% is what everybody else charges
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:37.640]   for apps.
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:39.200]   And I'm a big Apple fan.
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:39.760]   I admit it.
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:41.000]   It's true.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.400]   But I just want to say, I know enough about security
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:47.240]   to be dangerous to myself.
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:52.600]   So I like the fact that Apple is easily secure.
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:56.160]   If I just do what they tell me, everything will roll right
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:59.480]   along unless somebody is after me.
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:02.560]   You know, if somebody's after me, just like everybody says,
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:04.760]   right, there's nothing I can do.
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:07.240]   But basically, Apple is a no-brainer for me
[00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:10.600]   to just be keep my security basic and easy.
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:12.440]   And that's why you use it.
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:15.720]   I have to say that's why I use it too, as well as the privacy
[00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:16.320]   element of it.
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:19.840]   So I mean, I'm sorry about the antitrust stuff.
[00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:22.600]   I understand they need to be more open.
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:25.440]   But please, Apple, keep it as secure.
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:28.160]   Make those other people stay outside the walled garden.
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:29.280]   I like the walled garden.
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:30.280]   It's good for Vicki.
[00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:31.960]   I like it in here.
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:33.600]   It's the key secret garden.
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:34.360]   Thank you, Vicki.
[00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:36.160]   Where are you calling from?
[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:36.880]   Memphis.
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:37.840]   Memphis.
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:39.120]   Nice to see you.
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:40.240]   I'm going to move you back to the audience.
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:41.680]   We'll take one more, and then we'll move on,
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:43.600]   because I want to talk about the Epic case.
[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:46.040]   You can unmute Joe.
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:46.920]   Hi, how are you guys?
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:47.720]   Hey, Joe.
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:49.240]   Thank you for having me.
[00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:50.840]   Real quick, so just a suggestion of something
[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:52.680]   that I think could potentially work
[00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:57.080]   if the disagreement here is the rev share itself,
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:59.680]   allowing developers to link out to Safari,
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:01.320]   in addition to in-app purchases.
[00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:03.960]   And then you can complete your transaction there.
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:06.640]   You can use Apple Pay, PayPal, Stripe, whatever.
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:09.600]   I think most people, well over 90%,
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:11.240]   will still opt for in-app purchases,
[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:12.800]   because it's just like to Vicki's point.
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:16.160]   It's just easier, and people feel safer doing it.
[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:19.040]   But I think that could be a potential solution
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:23.400]   to not compromise the security of the actual app store itself
[00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:28.760]   by having people sideload, but still letting developers potentially
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:30.480]   bypass the 30% rev share.
[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:33.440]   Again, I don't think most consumers will opt for that,
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:34.480]   but that's an option.
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:37.520]   That's what Microsoft's doing with their X Cloud,
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:39.760]   and that's what-- who else is doing that?
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:40.760]   So you could play games.
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:44.600]   You could play as a PWA, a progressive web app.
[00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:46.680]   And then, of course, once you're in a browser,
[00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:49.080]   you can sell anything, because Apple's not
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:50.560]   going to take a cut at that.
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:53.680]   So I think that that actually exists already.
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:56.080]   Where are you located, Joe?
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:57.960]   Yeah, I mean, you actually, well, that exists,
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:01.480]   but you can't link out to Safari from--
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:03.120]   Yeah, they prohibit that.
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:04.280]   Yeah, they prohibit that.
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:08.560]   Although, interestingly, Amazon made some sort of deal,
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:11.600]   and I think this was tied to something about Amazon Prime
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:12.840]   on the Apple TV.
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:14.480]   But Amazon's made some sort of deal
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:19.480]   where you can now buy Kindle books and Audible books in the app.
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:23.040]   And I-- because Amazon for a long time said, no, no,
[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:24.920]   on the Kindle app, you couldn't buy a book.
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:26.820]   You had to buy it on this-- you had to know enough.
[00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:28.480]   They couldn't even tell you this, but you had to know enough
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:31.120]   to buy it on the store and then read it in the app.
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:33.760]   They charge more for Audible if you buy it in the Apple.
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:34.560]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:35.920]   Yeah, so they're doing it.
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:38.880]   They just-- they passed that 30% onto the consumer,
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:40.600]   but they're not even allowed to say,
[00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:42.900]   oh, but it costs you a little bit less if you open up
[00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:43.720]   Safari that--
[00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:45.080]   That Spotify's gonna play it as well.
[00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:46.760]   The Spotify does the same thing.
[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:48.160]   Thank you, Joe, from New York.
[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:48.720]   Thank you.
[00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:50.160]   Take care.
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:51.880]   A little visit to our Discord chat room.
[00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:53.800]   And just a little quick plug for a ClubTwit.
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:56.200]   That's a ClubTwit feature.
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:58.560]   We can't do-- we have the chat room, the IRC,
[00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:01.400]   and I will still and I'll always do read it and quote from it.
[00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:03.360]   But if we want to hear from you, you
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:05.400]   have to be a ClubTwit member to get into the Discord,
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:08.120]   and that is at twit.tv/clubtwit.
[00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:11.960]   Nice way to help support our efforts here, $7 a month,
[00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:15.760]   ad-free programming, the Discord, which is a lot of fun,
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:17.400]   and Twit+ feed of extra stuff.
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:18.800]   Go ahead, Andy, sorry.
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:21.280]   I was just gonna say that is an excellent point
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:25.200]   about how Apple prevents companies
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:27.200]   from disclosing certain things about Haters.
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:29.800]   Here's why we have to charge a little bit more for this.
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:32.080]   And here's the restrictions that we're under.
[00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:33.360]   I think that this is--
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:35.360]   Apple can make a very, very, very good argument
[00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:41.080]   about how the App Store policies contribute
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:42.880]   to the security of the entire platform
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:45.520]   and as a benefit to users as a whole.
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:51.120]   They can't necessarily defend why can't we say that here
[00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:53.960]   is something that's going to really confound and annoy you,
[00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:57.520]   but here is why we have to do this as consumers.
[00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:00.720]   No, we would love to allow you to buy things directly
[00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:02.000]   within our app, but then we would
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.640]   have to-- Apple then force us to charge a lot more for it.
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:10.080]   There's a difference between eating dirt and eating dirt
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:11.960]   and forcing someone to also call it ice cream.
[00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:14.080]   And that's part the cup.
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:16.160]   Not only are we gonna take me for you to do this,
[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:21.680]   but we have to make sure that you're not able to let people know
[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:26.040]   that there's a downside to this that they're probably not aware of.
[00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:27.840]   Well, and again, I think that the big thing
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:30.280]   is that the business model of we're
[00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:32.880]   providing the space for you to actually get out there.
[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:35.360]   As someone who used to-- I mean, we'll be soon releasing
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:37.080]   more apps on the App Store and paying 30%.
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:44.920]   The big thing is, I mean, I just feel like--
[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:47.480]   I did this in the early-- in the aughts, right?
[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:50.880]   In the 2000s to 2010, I did a lot of software sales.
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:54.920]   And I had to deal with copy protection.
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:56.480]   I had to deal with distribution.
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:59.640]   And I had to deal with all of these things that went away.
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:03.440]   And the thing is, is that that's why I guess I feel like people
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:06.960]   don't know how good it is because they didn't have to deal with that.
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:09.760]   And it was a nightmare.
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:11.280]   Like we should probably sold--
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:13.120]   It's not the little guys that are complaining.
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:14.280]   It's the big guys, right?
[00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:15.880]   It's the spot of fires of the world.
[00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:16.920]   It's the billion and--
[00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:18.160]   Yeah, and then say trillionaires.
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:20.560]   And let's make sure-- I want to make sure we're clear
[00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:24.480]   with the little guys is that the little guys who are putting free apps up,
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:27.360]   for instance, they get off the ground or all that's paid for
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:30.680]   by the big guys that are making-- writing that 30% check,
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:34.880]   is that money coming in under underwrites all of those places
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:36.520]   where you can put up an app and not charge anything.
[00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:39.720]   I mean, because literally, you can put up an app and not charge anything.
[00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:42.800]   And all your bandwidth is taken care of, your securities taken care of,
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:47.440]   all these other things are managed by Apple for free.
[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:50.080]   So the thing is, is that there is a lot of things that we get for free
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:51.320]   on the other end.
[00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:54.480]   And again, and by the way, the little guys aren't paying it anymore.
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:55.960]   They're paying 15%, right?
[00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:58.000]   So they're on their first million.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:01.920]   And that's 98% of the market from a revenue perspective.
[00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:08.600]   So just very quickly, my position has always been that I think this is a good topic for debate.
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:13.120]   The one thing that I'm 100% behind is Apple being forced to go to court
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:15.480]   and explain and defend all of their policies.
[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:18.160]   We're asked for years now, they're allowed to simply say,
[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:22.640]   oh, well, this is why we have this wonderful, perfect, secure, walled garden.
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:25.360]   Oh, well, this is the value that we're providing to people.
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:29.560]   Again, I don't necessarily think that you're lying, but guess what?
[00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:32.080]   Now you're going to have to come in with spreadsheets and actually show
[00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:34.200]   that these things that you're claiming are actually true.
[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:38.280]   And this kind of pressure that is the reason why the smaller developers
[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:39.920]   now are paying a smaller cut.
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:44.600]   And this is why it's forcing them to not to not even necessarily against their will,
[00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:47.720]   but saying, well, this is probably a good is probably a good time for us
[00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:52.320]   to revisit all of these policies that we we established back when this was all completely
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:54.600]   new, when we could get away with absolutely anything.
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:59.000]   Is this now that we are a behemoth, now that we are a $2 trillion company,
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:02.760]   are some of these restrictions we're putting on the app store still necessary?
[00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:05.880]   Or is this things that we can now revise?
[00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:11.360]   And it's 60, 70, 80% of the market, I think that those would make those
[00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:16.720]   would be a lot more valid at least less than half, you know,
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:20.200]   depending on what region you look at, never more than 50% of the market.
[00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:21.960]   People do have a choice to go somewhere else.
[00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:24.240]   The problem is, is that no one's doing it very well.
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:27.440]   Other than Apple, but it doesn't mean that those those options aren't there.
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:31.000]   And I think that the problem that that Apple users have, I think for the for
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:35.880]   the most part is what was brought up a little bit from our folks from club twit.
[00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:38.160]   Is that everyone's going to tell you that, oh, we could just open this app and
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:40.760]   your life would be exactly the same and you don't know that.
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:43.040]   You don't know what makes the magic of what things work.
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:44.160]   We don't know that.
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:47.520]   And so you start opening that up and for instance, you let everyone tell you
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:48.040]   that it's cheaper.
[00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:52.960]   Now, now we as a user are going to be, you know, this is going to be just chaos.
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:54.120]   It will be chaos.
[00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:56.640]   It'll be all these people trying to send you to their websites and
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:52:01.480]   everything else and it will not be the easy experience that we had before.
[00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:04.960]   You know, of just I can just buy the stuff on my, you know, it'll be back to
[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:08.080]   like cable with the stupid codes and everything else.
[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:11.680]   And, you know, and so because they're all trying to bypass that, that, you know,
[00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:12.880]   that percentage.
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:17.320]   And so the thing is, is that as a user, you know, I mean, Apple is very user centric.
[00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:20.760]   And the thing is, as a user, I don't really care.
[00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:23.280]   And even as someone who's going to put it up, I'm just going to make it 30% more
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:26.000]   than what I need, you know, and I'm just going to, that's, that's what the cost
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:29.480]   of the Apple is, you know, yeah, that's fine.
[00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:35.840]   The thing is that I do think that you're kind of optimistic in thinking that the
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:39.840]   regulators that and the people in Congress that, well, they don't even use email.
[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:41.600]   The thing is like, we have this.
[00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:42.600]   I'm not being optimistic.
[00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:43.600]   I'm being pessimistic.
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:45.600]   They have no idea what they're talking about.
[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:46.600]   Well, I totally best.
[00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:47.600]   That's what I said.
[00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:48.600]   That's what I said.
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:49.600]   That's what I.
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:50.600]   That's what I.
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:51.600]   That's what I disagree with.
[00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:54.960]   So, Strom Thurman has been out of office for quite a while.
[00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:57.640]   South Carolina voted him out three years after he died.
[00:52:57.640 --> 00:52:58.640]   Thank goodness.
[00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:00.880]   Mostly, no one noticed for the first two years.
[00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:01.880]   They need to be fair.
[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:02.880]   Exactly.
[00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:04.800]   They just kept voting for voting of the party ticket.
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:09.760]   But the thing is like, it's hard to acknowledge the fact that most of the people who are in
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:12.520]   Congress right now are our age or younger.
[00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:17.720]   And they're also being advised by people who are our age or much younger than that.
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:23.960]   They have staff that have to spend all of their lives 18 hours a day, if not 20 hours
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:27.920]   a day, looking at each one of these issues and making sure they're hip to the things.
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:30.440]   These are people who grew up with the internet.
[00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:33.200]   These are people who suddenly grew up with it with iPhones.
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:41.560]   So, we're even seeing some of the older guard capable of going for abstract thinking about
[00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:47.560]   first amendment issues in Section 230 issues where it's not necessarily true that just
[00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:53.800]   because Apple is not AT&T does not mean that they have 100% dominance over one specific
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:59.680]   market if, as we said before, if we define this as people who have iPhones, are they likely
[00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:03.400]   now to get rid of their iPhone and switch to Android over the small issue?
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:07.240]   No, but that doesn't mean that that's not still going to be an issue for these users.
[00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:09.680]   So, I don't think that they come very 18 years ago.
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:10.680]   Moving on.
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:11.680]   Moving on.
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:12.680]   Moving on.
[00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:13.680]   Moving on.
[00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:14.680]   What is it?
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:15.680]   Is it...
[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:16.680]   We don't need to guess on whether they know what they're doing or not.
[00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:20.280]   The only thing to do is watch the Facebook, Twitter, whatever little thing that they did.
[00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:22.240]   They don't even know how to use their webcams.
[00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:23.240]   Like, it's just...
[00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:27.400]   So, the thing is, is that they obviously are completely unteky because every time they
[00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:31.880]   show up, they don't know how to use the tools that they have in front of them.
[00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:32.880]   And so, the thing is that...
[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:34.720]   And so, these are the people making those decisions.
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:36.120]   I don't need to guess.
[00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:39.800]   I happen to have just one lot of knowledge in this area.
[00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:42.600]   My fear is a little bit more, I think, cynical than Alex is even.
[00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:46.640]   I think they do know because when you watch any of the congressional hearings, they do
[00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:47.640]   circus stuff.
[00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:52.120]   Like, it is the most ridiculous, extremist buffoonery you can imagine.
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:56.320]   But then, every one of them, for a few minutes, becomes an incredibly competent litigator
[00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:57.320]   and lawyer.
[00:54:57.320 --> 00:55:00.960]   Like, they show that they are actually extremely competent, intelligent people.
[00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:04.640]   Everything else is like gladiatorial circus crap for their bases.
[00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:05.640]   But they know what's going on.
[00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:09.520]   And I think that makes it worse because they will do things that is not following the law,
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:12.800]   not following logic, not following reason to score political points.
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:15.480]   And it's hard to keep track of where those points are being scored.
[00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:16.480]   And I think that's...
[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:19.480]   The biggest danger isn't like the threat.
[00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:22.720]   The biggest danger is the drunken, crazy thing that you have no idea what it's going
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:23.720]   to do.
[00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:27.560]   And I think that's the problem that Apple, Google, and Amazon are facing here.
[00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:31.160]   Should also point out, one of the reasons this is going to be a bitter battle is that this
[00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:34.280]   is a very profitable part of Apple's business.
[00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:38.200]   In fact, of late, it's the most profitable part.
[00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:39.240]   It's interesting to look at this.
[00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:43.200]   This is the gross margin, operating margin, and net margin.
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:49.120]   While Apple's had higher margins, if you go back to 2011, in the last couple of years,
[00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:54.000]   the margin growth has all been in services, I think, over the last couple of years.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   And they are now...
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.000]   Hardware is down.
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   Yeah, they're at a fairly high margin of 23.45% on a gross margin of almost 40%.
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.040]   But that's not unusual for services or software.
[00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:05.880]   Like traditional services and software companies have ridiculous margins.
[00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:06.880]   Like, if you look at the margin...
[00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:07.880]   But my point is...
[00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:08.880]   But my point is...
[00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:09.880]   Yeah, it's like Coca-Coins.
[00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:10.880]   But my point is...
[00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:11.880]   It's 99%.
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:12.880]   It's not everything.
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:14.760]   And the App Store is a component of that.
[00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:15.760]   And according...
[00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:22.200]   Now, this we made this mute because this is an epic witness for the trial, which began
[00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:24.000]   yesterday.
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:29.920]   He said this was an expert witness based on documents obtained from the iPhone Maker
[00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:34.800]   that Apple's App Store margin was 78% in 2019.
[00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:38.880]   That may be credible given their margin of 40% overall.
[00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:40.880]   Neil Seibar took that apart yesterday.
[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:41.880]   Did he?
[00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:46.400]   Yeah, I think that's just a number based on what's the highest number we can show math
[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:47.400]   for?
[00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:48.800]   Yeah, I mean clearly it's testifying for Epic.
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:49.800]   So yeah.
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:56.320]   I wonder if Apple gets to get Epic to publish the profit margin of Fortnite.
[00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:57.320]   Yeah.
[00:56:57.320 --> 00:56:58.320]   Not all of Epic.
[00:56:58.320 --> 00:56:59.320]   They make a lot of money.
[00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:00.320]   They make a lot of profit margin of Fortnite.
[00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:02.080]   I promise that it's higher than that.
[00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:05.800]   So what was Neil's take down on that number?
[00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:09.640]   He just went through the... when you look at anything in isolation, doesn't include any
[00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:12.200]   of the costs that are associated with those things.
[00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:17.480]   So even in assuming that they have that figure right, that is if you only box out profit
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:21.920]   for App Store as if it was magically created one day, like you snapped your fingers, there's
[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:26.000]   suddenly an App Store, and there's nothing else that comes off the top of those, which
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.080]   we know not to be the case.
[00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:31.320]   And then I think he went into the breakdown of the actual numbers themselves.
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:32.320]   Yeah.
[00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:36.040]   It's an expert to take it with a grain of salt.
[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:39.160]   But I would think it's safe to say that the profits in the App Store are the highest of
[00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:41.760]   all the profits Apple makes the margin.
[00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:45.280]   The highest of the services, I think it's routinely considered to be.
[00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:47.680]   But almost every analyst that is not as high as we think it is.
[00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:51.480]   But it is high and it does sort of go against the spirit of what Steve Jobs said in the very
[00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:55.680]   beginning when he announced the App Store that it should run at just above break even.
[00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:59.400]   And there were some interesting internal emails about Phil Schiller discussing what happens
[00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:01.920]   when it hits a billion dollars of profitability.
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:05.040]   Do we start to scale back the share that we take?
[00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:09.360]   And I think those were discussions that should have continued inside Apple and sort of in
[00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:11.880]   the spirit of running it just above break even.
[00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:16.400]   It's like I think Apple shouldn't be in the massive App Store profit business and shouldn't
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:17.880]   at all be in the advertising business.
[00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:18.880]   That seems--
[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:19.880]   And it's difficult to the--
[00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:20.880]   I agree.
[00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:21.880]   --to the language that they use when they talk to us.
[00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:27.120]   It seems to have been-- they seem to have revised that, especially in the face of lowered
[00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:29.840]   margins in the hardware business.
[00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:30.840]   Clearly they're looking to serve as--
[00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:31.840]   They're looking to serve as--
[00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:32.840]   --substalk to those some margins.
[00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:33.840]   Yeah.
[00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:35.960]   Well, because they're putting more-- like they're using more expensive parts and that's bringing
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:39.120]   down the margins in hardware and they're using services.
[00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:42.760]   But I think one of the biggest mistakes for me, like clearly the market loved it.
[00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:45.840]   The market loves Apple services more than the ever loved Apple hardware.
[00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:49.400]   And Apple said we're going to double services revenue within this given period of time.
[00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:52.320]   And the App Store was clearly one of the biggest engines for doing that.
[00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:54.960]   And so Tim Cook told Wall Street, I'm going to do this.
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:59.320]   And that totally, I think, misaligned the purpose of their business.
[00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:01.240]   And I'm glad they haven't said that again.
[00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:04.720]   I was incredibly fearful they said that they were going to say we're going to double services
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:09.280]   revenue again because that's a path that leads to Google search deals and high App Store
[00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:14.040]   rates and a lot of other things that, again, I don't think Apple should be involved with
[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:15.560]   that all.
[00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:20.640]   The trial started, as I mentioned, yesterday Apple and Epic, according to 905Mac, go head
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:24.680]   to head in fiery opening remarks.
[00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:26.080]   I missed those.
[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:28.320]   How fiery were they?
[00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:29.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:35.440]   Apple, Epic painted Apple and the App Store as a monopolistic anti-competitive ecosystem
[00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:39.440]   that fails to offer the benefits to consumers that Apple touts.
[00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:46.040]   They had a slideshow, which include internal emails from Apple executives, literally detailing
[00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:51.320]   how they built a wall garden that Vicki likes so much emails from Jobs, Craig Federighi,
[00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:56.120]   Luca Maestri, the CFO, Tim Cook, CEO, Eddie Cute, Scott Forestall.
[00:59:56.120 --> 00:59:58.800]   It's a bench trial though.
[00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:01.160]   Those are really good for the judge, not for the jury.
[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:02.760]   But this judge seems real smart.
[01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:04.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:05.120]   That's interesting.
[01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:11.720]   They still make those kind of, I don't know, overblown statements in the opening arguments
[01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:12.720]   anyway.
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:14.320]   Here's an email from Phil Schiller.
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:15.320]   This is in 2011.
[01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:17.760]   Do we think our 70/30 split?
[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:19.160]   This is the one you were referring to.
[01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:20.640]   We'll last forever.
[01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:22.080]   We're months are making over a billion.
[01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:23.240]   Is that enough?
[01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:24.240]   They did.
[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:25.240]   They have.
[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:30.360]   They're back to 15% for smaller companies, for subscriptions, things like that.
[01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:31.360]   That was genius.
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:32.360]   That was a good move.
[01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:33.360]   Yeah, they just.
[01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:34.360]   Yeah.
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:35.360]   Yeah.
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:41.320]   Here's one from Phil Schiller, urgent, terrible temple jump.
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:42.320]   Temple jump.
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:43.320]   This is the subject.
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:44.320]   Privilege and confidential.
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:47.160]   What the hell is this?
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:50.640]   This is to Eddie Cugh, Greg Jazwiek, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:52.680]   Remember we're talking about finding bad apps with low ratings.
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:56.440]   Remember I talk about becoming the Nordstroms of stores and quality of service.
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:03.240]   How does an obvious rip off of the super popular temple run with no screenshots, garbage
[01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:08.160]   marketing, text and almost all one-star ratings become the number one free app in the store?
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:11.320]   Can anyone see a rip off of a top selling game?
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:14.960]   Can anyone see an app that is cheating?
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:16.640]   He's actually now repeating himself.
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:18.440]   He's so upset.
[01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:22.200]   Anyone see an app that is cheating the system is no one reviewing these apps.
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:23.560]   There's no one minding the store.
[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:24.560]   This is insane.
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:26.560]   One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ex-lays.
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:27.560]   Sadly it's still happening.
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:28.560]   So like it's.
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:29.560]   Phil's right.
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:30.560]   It's only 20 years later.
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:31.920]   There's still scam and yeah, but it's still have.
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:36.480]   That's the thing is like everyone's called for a Bunko squad and it's still happening.
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:39.880]   And I'm sure it's like YouTube gets like this happens on YouTube.
[01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:40.880]   It happens on Twitter.
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:41.880]   It happens on the app store.
[01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:46.080]   So obviously it's hard, but like review the top 100 apps, the top 10 apps.
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:48.120]   Make sure those are pristine.
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:51.200]   It just it doesn't seem to be as just like it should be this hard.
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:57.120]   Apple by the way, in its opening statement confirmed exactly what you said, Alex.
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:01.640]   They focused on the benefits provided to developers from the platforms, including access
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:03.200]   to apples and electrical property.
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:04.200]   It's APIs.
[01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:05.600]   It's developer resources.
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:10.080]   They, you know, it's the battle of the, battle of the emails.
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:17.640]   They, they, in their slideshow at a Tim Sweeney email, he's the CEO of Epic Games talking about
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:21.960]   how he's planning, you know, to go after apple.
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:24.880]   Epic has certain plans for August that will provide an extraordinary opportunity.
[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:30.000]   This is to deal with Microsoft to highlight the value proposition of consoles and PCs
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:36.440]   in contrast to mobile platforms, Apple and to onboard new console users.
[01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:38.360]   Well, I can't share details with any third party at this point.
[01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:42.080]   I give you, I give you Epic's assurance that our efforts will be positive and supportive
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:45.000]   of Microsoft Xbox and Windows.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000]   Yeah, you know.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.440]   So if you want to see the slideshow nine to five Mac has, has all, there's 64 slides
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:53.440]   from Apple.
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:56.960]   There's a hundred slides from Epic.
[01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:58.480]   You can see them all.
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:03.760]   This is why the one absolute winner of all of this is going to be journalists and the
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:08.240]   public because we don't get their, their times work does, we, we were shutting the exact
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:11.320]   same things for years and years and years as in that email.
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:17.240]   And does anybody even look for 10 seconds to see if this, if this app looks like a scam?
[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:18.240]   Yeah.
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:21.600]   And sometimes it feels as though Apple just doesn't get it and it's kind of reassuring
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:25.240]   when you find out that no, there was the, there were these kinds of shouts from inside.
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:27.040]   This is a frustration that goes everywhere.
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:32.400]   This is the probably the only place where we get to find out some important things about
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:37.920]   how this technology is made, what the faults are, what the concerns have been and what the
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:42.720]   birthing process was like and as we continue to rely on so many of these services for
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:46.960]   day to day stuff, including simple things like keeping the lights on by making sure that
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:51.600]   our bills are paid, I think it's, it's, it's very, very valuable that we do get to see all
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:54.160]   of the stuff.
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:04:00.480]   So there's also the argument that browsers cannot necessarily replace the app store Alex
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:07.440]   Russell in his blog posts, infrequently.org is infrequently noticed blog.
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:15.680]   It talks about the fact that Apple's browser needs more investment is underpowered and needs
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:21.200]   to do a better job to support this kind of, you know, thing.
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:26.720]   He says, what follows is not a critique of individuals on the Safari team or the WebKit
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:27.720]   project.
[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:30.960]   It's a plea for Apple to fund their work adequately.
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:34.400]   They are pound for pound some of the best engine developers globally and genuinely want
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:35.400]   good things for the web.
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:42.440]   It's Apple corporate that's at fault, not the engineers who support them.
[01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:48.520]   So you know, it may be that there are reasons that Apple doesn't want the browser to be
[01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:52.520]   a full full-fledged platform on.
[01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:53.880]   Well, they have their platform.
[01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:59.080]   Like they have iOS and Mac OS, they're a platform company and the web is like an adjunct to
[01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:03.800]   them where Google, Google has Android, but Android's never really been a Googly thing.
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:07.840]   They want the web to be a primary platform and because Microsoft couldn't cement their
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:11.760]   own mobile platform, they tried for years and years and years, they're all in on PWA
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:12.760]   as well.
[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:15.880]   So it's one of those cases where both companies, you know, they all have different hammers
[01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:20.520]   and see different things as nails and it behooves Google if everyone moves to the web as successfully
[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:21.520]   as possible.
[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:22.520]   Yeah, that's their business.
[01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:23.520]   Apple would much rather have you use their frameworks.
[01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:24.960]   Thank you very much.
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:29.480]   He says that the insupposed Apple had implemented WebRTC in the Gamepad API in a timely way.
[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:34.560]   Who could say if the game streaming revolution now taking place might not have happened sooner,
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:39.240]   maybe Amazon Luna, GeForce Now, Google Stadia, XCloud could have been built years earlier.
[01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:41.240]   It wasn't secure though.
[01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:42.400]   I mean, they did that with WebGL.
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:46.000]   A lot of companies went ahead with WebGL way before it was anything approaching a secure
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.040]   technology and it took Apple a couple of years longer.
[01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:52.360]   But they, as far as I know, they put out the first secure version of WebGL that wouldn't
[01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:55.840]   just be a nightmare in terms of exploits.
[01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:57.880]   And a lot of these things, it's easy to just implement them.
[01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:01.760]   It's not easy to implement them in a thoughtful, secure privacy centric manner.
[01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:02.760]   Yeah.
[01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:05.000]   Yeah, I don't think this is anti-competitive at all.
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.240]   However, this is something that Apple needs to address if they are going to continue to
[01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:11.040]   rely on the argument that, hey, look, if you don't like our app store, just write it as
[01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:12.040]   a web app.
[01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:17.440]   Their web is a very, very mature web application development platform, then that really is inviting
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:19.080]   people to come back at, well, great.
[01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:22.320]   So you're going to allow us to do local storage.
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:27.360]   Your allow us to be doing your allows to do access to the hardware in ways that our apps
[01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:29.080]   are going to need to do.
[01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:33.960]   And if they say that, well, I know this is a standard, but we are just not making a priority
[01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:37.640]   to support all of these standards that have proven to be working very, very well and very
[01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:40.480]   safely on other platforms.
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:45.320]   And no, we're not going to allow other web renderers to appear in browsers on our platform,
[01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:47.640]   then that's going to be a problem they're going to have to address.
[01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:53.960]   And I should say this author is on the Chromium team has worked on Chromium for 12 years,
[01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:58.760]   and he's currently leading a project called Project Fugu, which is designed to put hardware
[01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:01.200]   APIs into the browser.
[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:03.360]   Let me read his bottom line here, though.
[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:06.440]   You know, Leo, they're going to make web metal, and then it's not going to be compatible
[01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:07.440]   with anything else.
[01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:09.400]   And they're going to say it works just as great as regular metal.
[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:11.640]   And everyone's going to say, but it's not compatible.
[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:12.640]   Yeah.
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:13.640]   You're welcome.
[01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:14.960]   This is, he says, mind the gap.
[01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:15.960]   This is his conclusion.
[01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:21.320]   The data agree Apples web engine consistently trails others in both compatibility and features
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:25.640]   resulting in a large and persistent gap with Apples native platform.
[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:31.600]   Apples wishes us to accept that it is reasonable to force iOS browsers to use this web engine.
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:33.000]   And that, by the way, they do that.
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:37.200]   Even if you're using Chrome on iOS, you're using Apples web engine, which leaves leaving
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:40.080]   iOS on the trailing edge.
[01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:44.280]   The web, Apples also wishes to accept that the web is a viable alternative on iOS for
[01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:48.200]   developers unhappy with App Store policies.
[01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:50.240]   But you can't have both.
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:52.640]   One or the other might be reasonable, together.
[01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:54.280]   Party's interested in the health of the vision.
[01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:55.280]   It's his definition.
[01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:56.280]   Yeah.
[01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:57.280]   Of course.
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:58.280]   And he's a crummy imagine.
[01:07:58.280 --> 01:07:59.280]   It's his definition of trailing edge.
[01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:02.200]   Like Apple's leading edge on privacy and performance and energy efficiency and a bunch
[01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:04.280]   of other factors.
[01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:08.160]   You know, Apples, oh, it's always bugged me that they haven't supported PWAs as well
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:11.000]   as I think they ought to.
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.440]   And then you have to ask the question, why?
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:14.880]   Is it for security?
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:20.040]   Is it for some other engineering reason or is it because you don't want people to have
[01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:24.800]   full fledged applications that you don't control on the iPhone?
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:27.040]   And I guess it depends on who you believe.
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:28.800]   It can be multiple truths.
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:30.040]   And they may both be true.
[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:31.120]   That's exactly right.
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:32.120]   That's exactly right.
[01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:33.120]   All right.
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:34.120]   Enough of that.
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:36.120]   Let's take a breather.
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:37.120]   Okay.
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:40.400]   I'm going to talk about nice things now.
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:41.400]   Can I add one last thing?
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:44.480]   You're like, I think that disappoints me.
[01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:46.520]   I want massive app store reform.
[01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:48.680]   I want it like for the James Thompson's of the world.
[01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:49.680]   Nepal had died.
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:52.760]   It's like, I want all these indie developers to have rock solid futures.
[01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:56.000]   And I want these companies, I want those developers to get everything that they want from Apple
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.080]   and Google and way, way more.
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:01.560]   But we have these litigants who I was originally really happy about.
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:04.800]   And then the more I read about them, it's like these are not the Batman I want.
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:09.160]   They're just terrible, terrible toxic executives who are getting all this attention and their
[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:11.680]   agenda is not the same as the indie devs.
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:16.560]   And I hope that they succeed just far enough to open a beachhead for the indie devs and
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:19.640]   not so far as to become yet another gatekeeper for the in-depths.
[01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:21.280]   I wish them limited success.
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:22.280]   Yeah.
[01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:26.360]   It's hard to make Epic your hero in this battle.
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:29.200]   Well, Epic and Spotify and base camp.
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:33.040]   I mean, this one after another, you read their executive statements and you're like,
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:36.000]   please step aside and let better people do this.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.000]   Yeah.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.000]   Or Facebook.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.000]   Facebook is another one, right?
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000]   None of these.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.000]   Yeah.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.600]   Facebook's gallery are the ones attacking.
[01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:43.600]   Yeah.
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:44.600]   But you make a good point.
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:47.680]   James Thompson, he's complained about some of the Appster policies, right?
[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:49.120]   I mean, he's a guy who's really.
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:50.120]   He goes both ways.
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:53.560]   He's like, part of me wants gatekeeper because it would be a much better way for me to speak
[01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:54.560]   software.
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:57.520]   But part of me also knows it's going to lead to ramp and piracy of my apps because everything
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:09:58.680]   has a repercussions.
[01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:02.520]   So I mean, they're not, they're not easy for us to say solutions, but implementing them
[01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:03.960]   is always a challenge.
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:04.960]   All right.
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:09.800]   I just, currently, the reason that everyone's so upset about this is currently the App
[01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:13.160]   Store is probably the best place, the best thing in the world to release.
[01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:14.760]   That's a good place to release a software.
[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:18.720]   And so nobody would care if it was some crappy mall in the middle of nowhere.
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:23.680]   It is literally you can, it is the best place to launch your software and you can do it
[01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:24.680]   for free.
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:28.520]   You can just put it up and see how things go and what's going to happen.
[01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:32.400]   And there's nothing like that that has ever existed before and Apple created it.
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:35.480]   And the reason I keep on going back to, they have the right to do that is because they
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:38.040]   created something that nobody else has figured out how to do.
[01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:43.040]   And the thing is they have some right to make revenue off of something that everybody else
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:49.600]   screws up, like, royally, like all the other stores are, except for many different Amazon's.
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:51.200]   Holy disagree.
[01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:52.200]   Go ahead, Andy.
[01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:53.200]   Go ahead.
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:57.880]   I just, I rebuttal now from Mr. Inotco.
[01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:03.120]   I think that the Apple's App Store does it better than everybody else.
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:06.640]   I don't think that the Google Play Store does it poorly.
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:12.000]   I think that I think that whereas the Apple, the App Store is a minus B plus, I think that
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:15.280]   the Google Play Store is B, B plus.
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:16.280]   That's not, that's not.
[01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:22.880]   And also it's not as this, this was not like the fact that they are the first people to
[01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:28.760]   make this kind of app store work on this level relied on a whole bunch of different factors.
[01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:35.720]   It's not as though they invented this and they are therefore deserving to reap unrestricted
[01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:36.720]   rewards.
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:39.400]   I think that there are negatives to the App Store.
[01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:42.760]   They're going to be positives the App Store, just like there is no coin that has a heads
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:44.520]   but no tails.
[01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:50.240]   The idea of really making it look like this is a great deal for everybody and that there
[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:52.000]   are no room for improvement.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.240]   This is the sort of stuff that I just want to make sure we don't fall into the trap of
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:58.080]   thinking that, oh, well, geez, what are people complaining about?
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:11:59.720]   They're getting things for free.
[01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:02.640]   There are a lot of other things that you get for free that are taking advantage of you
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:07.560]   in ways that you don't approve of, namely Facebook, namely Instagram, namely Google
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:09.560]   Search, Google AdSense.
[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:11.800]   These are these things that we have to keep an eye on.
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:15.840]   So again, I actually want to be able to argue about this.
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:20.960]   I agree with you that we should always be looking at it.
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:23.600]   I'm not saying that the App Store couldn't get better.
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:24.960]   You can definitely get better.
[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:28.520]   And as someone who's about to start releasing stuff into the App Store, I would love to
[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:31.080]   have a higher percentage.
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.080]   So that's great.
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:35.600]   But I will say that I don't see any other store, including the Google Play Store ever
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:36.600]   catching up.
[01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:39.840]   The Google Play Store is fundamentally flawed in a way that it will never make the kind
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:40.840]   of money.
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:41.840]   Maybe a mobile app or is that?
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:44.080]   But I have to say Steam is as good as the Apple Store.
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:46.840]   If you play games, the Steam Store is literally--
[01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:48.080]   I'm talking about general purpose.
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:49.080]   Yeah.
[01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:53.960]   But Steam's done a very, very good job and has actually empowered gaming even on the
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:57.520]   Mac in ways that are really impressive.
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:12:58.520]   I don't know what their cut is.
[01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:00.640]   I'm sure it's at least 30%.
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:01.640]   I agree.
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:04.720]   I don't know enough about it because I don't really use it.
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:05.720]   But I used it.
[01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:06.720]   You'd be impressed.
[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:07.720]   You'd be very impressed.
[01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:10.440]   Yeah, but I'm just saying as a general app developer, not trying to make a game, just
[01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:17.560]   trying to make a tool, the Apple App Store is just-- that's why everyone or many people
[01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:19.560]   launch their first because it's--
[01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:20.560]   Yeah.
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:21.560]   As long as we're talking about--
[01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:22.560]   It's 30% and then cut it.
[01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:27.880]   As long as I'm talking about this, we should probably talk about this kind of damning report
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:35.240]   from the Me To Be Alliance on school mobile apps and how they share data.
[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:39.240]   And the research showed Android apps are three times more likely than iOS apps to be
[01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:43.720]   sending data to third parties and are much more likely to be sending data to high or
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:45.480]   very high risk third parties.
[01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:51.760]   91% of Android apps send data to high risk third parties compared to only 26% of iOS
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:52.760]   apps.
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:56.320]   And 20% of Android apps send data to very-- I don't know what a very high risk third
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:14:01.600]   party is, but I'll take their word for it compared to 2.6, 20% compared to 2.6% of the
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:03.040]   iOS apps.
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:08.400]   So there's-- I don't know if that's an issue with Android per se, but it's clear that Apple
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:14.440]   does a good job or a better job anyway, policing its store and privacy.
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:19.280]   There are unknown factors that work out very, very positively for the kids in this study,
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:20.280]   yes.
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:21.280]   Yeah.
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:26.280]   Let's take a time out for a second and we'll come back because there is news.
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:35.320]   Yes, the first news is I woke up this morning and I got iOS 14.5.1.
[01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:38.440]   They're on a rather brisk cadence.
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:39.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:41.920]   It's sexist on beta already.
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:42.920]   14.5.1.
[01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:47.760]   And by the way, also Mac OS 11.3.1.
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:52.120]   These are patches for, oh, what a surprise, WebKit flaws.
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:55.760]   And the really important thing to note is they may have been actively exploited.
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:15:02.360]   In other words, there's zero days, which means it is fairly important that you patch your
[01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:09.960]   Mac OS, your watch OS, your iPad OS, and your iOS as quickly as you can.
[01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:10.960]   All four were updated.
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:11.960]   iOS, iOS 14.5.1, iOS 12.5.3.
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:14.960]   Everything is a zero day now.
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:15.960]   You never know.
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:19.640]   You never know who's doing what where-- what nation states sounded before the person we
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:20.640]   disclosed to it.
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:21.880]   Apple detailed a couple of flaws.
[01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:28.160]   One meant that processing maliciously handcrafted Web content-- my favorite kind, by the way.
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:29.160]   Artisanal.
[01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:30.400]   Yeah, artisanal Web content.
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:32.400]   May lead to arbitrary code execution.
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:34.640]   That is not good.
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:37.640]   And that was a memory corruption error.
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:42.200]   Apple says it's fixed the state with a quote "improved state management."
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:47.840]   Another flaw dealt with the same potential for malicious Web content, potentially executing
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:49.680]   arbitrary code.
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:52.360]   Apple says it may also have been exploited in the wild.
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:56.240]   If a company says this may have been exploited in the wild, that means there are instances
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:58.200]   where it has been.
[01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:00.960]   You have to assume someone else found the same thing that your security researcher who
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:02.520]   declared-- disclosed it to you.
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:03.520]   Yeah.
[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:04.520]   It's not safe.
[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:09.520]   It was-- Apple solved the problem with an integer overflow and improved input validation.
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:15.360]   So these are very serious zero days that you should absolutely fix.
[01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:16.360]   Pronto.
[01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:22.160]   And you know, it's a pain because iOS takes half an hour.
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:25.240]   I don't know how long the big Sir update took because I walked away.
[01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:26.480]   Mac is always longer for me.
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:27.480]   iOS downloads.
[01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:28.680]   And but I can keep using it.
[01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:30.240]   And then it reboots in its pretty serious.
[01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:32.720]   Mac OS is like 33 minutes to update this.
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:34.320]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:37.280]   But you should do that.
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:40.640]   The new 12-point-inch iPad Pro.
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:41.640]   Anybody?
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:42.640]   Ordered?
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:43.640]   Anybody?
[01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:44.640]   I know Michael ordered one.
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:45.640]   Oh, look at that.
[01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:47.640]   Yeah, 100 times.
[01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:50.080]   I mean, look at it, Leo.
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:52.040]   The ride was a little rough at 5.
[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:53.040]   It was--
[01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:54.040]   It was--
[01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:55.040]   It was funny.
[01:16:55.040 --> 01:17:00.480]   On office hours, there was a whole bunch of us on office hours together at 5 AM, all
[01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:01.480]   trying to order.
[01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:02.480]   And it was all like--
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:03.480]   It's in the bag.
[01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:04.480]   It's not in the bag.
[01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:05.480]   It's in the bag.
[01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:06.480]   OK, you're going to try to order.
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:07.480]   No, it's not-- you can't.
[01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:08.480]   No, no, OK.
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:09.480]   You get all the way to the order?
[01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:10.480]   No, it's not available anymore.
[01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:11.480]   You're like, it just got released.
[01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:12.480]   It can't be--
[01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:13.480]   It's gone.
[01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:14.480]   It didn't go down.
[01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:15.480]   Yeah.
[01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:17.080]   And I'm like, please take the store down next time.
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:18.080]   Yes.
[01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:19.080]   Yeah.
[01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:21.800]   Can we do a restart, please?
[01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:22.800]   So what did we all do?
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:24.200]   I'm surprised you got one, Andy, because you were--
[01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:26.720]   I thought on the fence.
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:32.000]   I was simply making sure that I was being devil's advocate and arguing
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.440]   against a $1,400 purchase, which is important every single time.
[01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:41.000]   But it instinctively felt like something that would fit very, very well
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.920]   to solve a whole bunch of problems.
[01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:47.760]   And my mantra to myself and to people is always, don't upgrade
[01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:51.080]   unless this new thing can either create new opportunities
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:52.520]   or solve existing problems.
[01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:57.600]   This one did both, because I do have a very, very important need
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:00.800]   for something that's very, very powerful, but very compact
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:02.600]   and lightweight, because a lot of this--
[01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:08.680]   because most Fridays I'm on the train to Boston to the radio studio.
[01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:10.440]   And I want to be able to work afterwards,
[01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:12.760]   but I'm not going to have a full work day.
[01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:15.440]   In normal times, I'll be in New York for a meeting
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:17.440]   or for an event.
[01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:19.720]   And I'm just there overnight, so I don't need everything,
[01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:23.160]   but I need to be able to write and do really important stuff.
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:24.520]   And even down to the point of--
[01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:25.560]   And by the way, I just want to point out,
[01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:27.840]   you're now hearing the conversation Andy had in his head
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:28.560]   before he personalised.
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:29.240]   No, no, no.
[01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:30.560]   We're rationalising.
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:31.560]   This is--
[01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:32.760]   No, you're not hearing the conversation.
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:38.040]   You're hearing me argue against the dad voice saying that's a lot of money.
[01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:40.040]   But you already have it.
[01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:41.240]   You already have an iPad.
[01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:46.440]   You already spent $1,600 on a MacBook.
[01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:53.600]   But even down to the idea of having a well-upgraded camera with LIDAR,
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:58.720]   because I was actually tempted to buy either at least a second-hand iPhone
[01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:01.760]   with LIDAR, because I want to start doing augmented reality stuff.
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:05.760]   I want to start trying out 3D capture that's capable of LIDAR.
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:09.640]   So it would take me 10 or 20 minutes to go through a list of all the things
[01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:11.440]   that this will be appropriate for me.
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:18.120]   But once again, for $1,400, I really have to spend the last two or three days arguing hard
[01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:20.440]   against it to make sure I'm making the right choice.
[01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:23.400]   In the end, as a matter of fact, I was planning on compromising and saying,
[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:25.560]   well, just get the 256 gig model.
[01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:26.880]   And then I said, oh, you nuts.
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:28.000]   You can't upgrade.
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.720]   You can buy an Apple Pencil next month.
[01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:32.720]   You can't buy an extra 256 gigs of storage next month.
[01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:36.320]   Go for-- if you've got to make a stupid purchase, go ahead.
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:37.360]   Make the big stupid.
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:38.080]   Make it really stupid.
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:39.080]   Did you get the cellular--
[01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:40.600]   What did you get all the-- what did you get?
[01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:41.120]   What did you get?
[01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:41.520]   What did you get?
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:42.040]   Tell us.
[01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:45.680]   I got a 12.9 inch 512 Wi-Fi.
[01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:49.680]   I didn't get 5G because I--
[01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:52.480]   my regular mobile Wi-Fi hotspot will work just fine.
[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:54.720]   Space gray or silver?
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:56.200]   I put-- oh, god.
[01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:57.400]   I wanted space gray.
[01:19:57.400 --> 01:19:58.320]   I had it bookmarked.
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:00.960]   I was trying for five minutes to get space gray.
[01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:05.320]   When I finally found out that I tried to experiment with, oh, what is there--
[01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:06.360]   maybe it's out of stock.
[01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:10.160]   Maybe I could-- what if silver worked?
[01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:12.440]   And so that's what I bought because I was afraid of some point.
[01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:13.600]   You could put it in a case anyway.
[01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:14.240]   It could be in a case anyway.
[01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:14.800]   Exactly.
[01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:15.800]   I mean, it's not what I wanted.
[01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:18.560]   But at some point, I was afraid of if I delay--
[01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:21.880]   if I wait for this to straighten itself out at best, maybe I'll--
[01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:22.640]   So what was the date?
[01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:23.320]   --I'll wait in June to get it.
[01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:24.280]   What was the date difference?
[01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:24.840]   Was it a big one?
[01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:27.840]   Because I bought the space gray and I'm not getting it until June.
[01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:31.520]   I'm getting-- I kept it because I'm getting it the first week.
[01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:31.960]   Yeah.
[01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:32.360]   First week.
[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:33.600]   That was a big--
[01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:34.120]   You got five--
[01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:35.000]   --I was also gigs.
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:35.560]   Who else got five gigs?
[01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:38.560]   Who else got five 12, anybody?
[01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:39.680]   I got one terabyte.
[01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:42.040]   Terabyte, OK.
[01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:44.120]   I decided, you know what?
[01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:46.600]   In for penny, in for pound.
[01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:46.960]   I just--
[01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:47.800]   I got two terabytes.
[01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:52.480]   I got-- I went all the way up on everything because money's just money.
[01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:53.440]   Or $4,200.
[01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:54.720]   I had pro mats.
[01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:56.160]   It was had pro mats.
[01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:58.960]   I'm still possibly having some remorse over the--
[01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:01.640]   Do I get more RAM because of the two terabytes?
[01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:02.400]   What's the RAM?
[01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:03.360]   Yeah, just 16 gigabytes.
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:04.440]   Yeah, just 16 gigabytes.
[01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:05.960]   Well, where do you get 16?
[01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:07.560]   Where does that start?
[01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:08.560]   One terabyte.
[01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:10.600]   OK, so I could have gotten one in 16.
[01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:12.440]   I wanted to make sure I got 16.
[01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:13.240]   Oh, you get more?
[01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:14.240]   I didn't even know that.
[01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:14.840]   I just figured it out.
[01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:15.480]   It's not clear.
[01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:16.480]   They don't tell you that.
[01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:19.000]   It's only because this guy got a briefing.
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.280]   This doesn't say here--
[01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:22.480]   I think they actually put it on the slides for once.
[01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:24.960]   And people were gobsmacked because RAM on an I-US card.
[01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:25.960]   They never mentioned RAM.
[01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:27.120]   Where is the apple you're buying?
[01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:27.600]   But when you're buying--
[01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:28.520]   What do you do with the real apple?
[01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:30.760]   When you're buying, it shows you more storage.
[01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:33.360]   It doesn't tell you, oh, by the way, when you go from 512
[01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:35.840]   to a terabyte, you're going to get more RAM.
[01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:38.280]   So I think that's in the tech specs.
[01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:41.000]   Is it way down here at the bottom and the lower--
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.800]   Get up the buying page.
[01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:45.240]   What color keyboard?
[01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:46.880]   There were a lot of footnotes here.
[01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:49.840]   Let's see, a footnote one, available space varies.
[01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:52.240]   Pre-installed apps used for--
[01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:53.320]   It's not in the fine print.
[01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:54.720]   So it's in the specs, huh?
[01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:55.560]   OK.
[01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:58.240]   So you're supposed to know that before you are plucking down
[01:21:58.240 --> 01:21:59.160]   your cash.
[01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:00.800]   You're supposed to do a little bit of research
[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:02.160]   before spending $2,000.
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:02.760]   Yeah, that's--
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:03.400]   2,000--
[01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:04.200]   That's probably good advice.
[01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:05.360]   It was $2,400.
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:09.840]   And then I found out that the $350 magic keyboard
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:12.040]   that I bought for the last one.
[01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:13.640]   Well, it'll sort of fit, right, Renee?
[01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:14.240]   What is the deal?
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:15.360]   It kind of fits?
[01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:16.040]   Yeah.
[01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:16.720]   No, it fits.
[01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:19.680]   There's just slight differences that--
[01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:21.360]   It will irk some--
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:22.800]   Anyone who works in human interface design
[01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:25.080]   will be irked by the minuscule differences.
[01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:27.120]   But it'll work acceptably.
[01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:28.680]   No, it's like the cutout, I think,
[01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:30.160]   for the cameras may be slightly different.
[01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:31.160]   And it's also a little bit thicker.
[01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:33.120]   So if you have that plus a screen protector,
[01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:35.640]   it might not close as completely level flat--
[01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:38.840]   Because I bought it on iPad last year in the magic keyboard.
[01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:40.840]   And I really don't feel like I should have to buy--
[01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:41.640]   You can still use it.
[01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:42.480]   No, you said it on my--
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:45.160]   Almost identical magic keyboard.
[01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:48.920]   So with an exacto knife, I could fix it.
[01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:51.400]   Yeah, you can shave off a little bit of a white pad.
[01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:52.080]   That's a--
[01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:53.760]   That, by the way, is not back-ordered.
[01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:54.800]   That'll show up in two hours.
[01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:56.560]   Well, you might order it right now for two hours.
[01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:59.960]   So I'm all excited because last week, oh, two packages
[01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:00.760]   came from Apple.
[01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:01.760]   I'm so excited.
[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:03.120]   Of course, it wasn't the air tags.
[01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:04.960]   It was the keychain.
[01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:06.960]   I got separate boxes for each one.
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:08.760]   And separate for each one.
[01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:11.200]   They took away my charger because they said
[01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:13.120]   that it was taking up too much spaces in the box.
[01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:15.360]   And then every accessory I got came in its own separate box.
[01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:16.360]   Oh, it's own separate cases.
[01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:17.280]   There's five of them.
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:17.880]   What can I say?
[01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:19.640]   It's the skew.
[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:21.880]   Yeah, here's the-- here, thank you, Doug M.
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:23.240]   Running to rub this in.
[01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:25.960]   Here is from the specs.
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:28.440]   Nicely highlighted, so I won't miss it.
[01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:31.960]   16 gig grams on models with one or two terabytes.
[01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:34.280]   So Alex, you're cool, man.
[01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:39.320]   I thought it'd be fun to have 5G in an iPad.
[01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:41.360]   I got 5G.
[01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:43.200]   Unobtanium.
[01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:44.120]   I don't care about 5G.
[01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:45.320]   I have made out of unobtanium.
[01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:49.920]   I have 300 down on 5G for two blocks around my house.
[01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:49.920]   Oh.
[01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:51.960]   And since I can't leave my house, it's fine.
[01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:52.920]   Yeah, nice.
[01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:54.480]   But then I don't need 5G because I'm at home.
[01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:56.560]   This whole thing is very confusing to me.
[01:23:56.560 --> 01:23:58.160]   I just view it as because we have 5G,
[01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:00.680]   we'll never have fiber to our houses because everyone--
[01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:02.480]   it'll be good enough, but not great.
[01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:03.600]   And so I'm just angry.
[01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:06.240]   You know, just like, you know, I just
[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:07.800]   feel like it's all burned.
[01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:08.560]   No, like it's because--
[01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:11.320]   Using MMWave to replace fiber on the towers now to Alex,
[01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:13.320]   so you'll never get any fiber anywhere.
[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:16.280]   They're using MMWave to replace fiber on the towers now too,
[01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:18.680]   so we'll never get fiber anywhere again.
[01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:20.600]   Oh, just--
[01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:21.800]   Suddenly you got the mouse.
[01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:25.240]   All new construction will look like the Black Rock City
[01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:27.400]   burning man just like because there's
[01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:29.360]   a tower with MMWave and everything has to--
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:32.600]   all the houses have to be within a radius of it
[01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:34.260]   at varying heights to make sure there's always
[01:24:34.260 --> 01:24:35.960]   line of sight within close proximity.
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:37.160]   I have a moral quandary.
[01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:37.660]   Yes.
[01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:38.920]   Maybe you guys can help me with.
[01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:40.360]   I have a-- when I got back to my car,
[01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:42.360]   I had a very nicely written letter from a neighbor.
[01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:45.160]   I'm not sure which one saying that COVID was a hoax
[01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:47.600]   to do experimental medical treatments on us.
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:51.200]   But this same neighbor wears a metal band around her head
[01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:54.280]   because she's afraid that MMWave is being used to mind
[01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:57.120]   and control us, and we don't have MMWave here.
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:24:59.400]   So my moral quandary is, can I tell her
[01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:01.640]   that a mask will protect against 5G?
[01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:04.360]   Oh, that's brilliant.
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:06.680]   Now you're cooking with gas.
[01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:07.280]   That's funny.
[01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:09.520]   Yeah, she'll wear a metal band, but not a mask.
[01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:11.040]   Why don't we start spreading that around?
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:11.840]   So I'm thinking--
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:13.920]   5G is dangerous and you should wear a mask.
[01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:14.880]   Then people will put it on.
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:16.400]   Like they won't put it on for COVID.
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:16.920]   No.
[01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:17.720]   They'll put it on.
[01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:19.440]   No, they like imaginary foes.
[01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:20.240]   It's much more fun.
[01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:20.840]   I will admit that--
[01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:22.960]   I put the fins in your teeth.
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:25.240]   I went through probably 30 masks over the last year.
[01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:27.240]   Now that I've settled into masks that I like--
[01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:28.040]   I kind of--
[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:29.240]   I want to keep it.
[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:29.440]   I think I'm--
[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:30.840]   It's so funny because--
[01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:33.720]   You know, remember, I was hand stitching my own masks
[01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:35.720]   back when you couldn't get them, right?
[01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:39.280]   Then I went through a mask fitter.
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:41.160]   They're literally where these phases--
[01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:44.160]   a mask fitter phase, which is just a seal of the fabric.
[01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:47.120]   That was because of you, Alex, and the Bellos 3D.
[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:49.200]   And then the guy who made my mask fitter
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:52.520]   sent me a plastic bane mask that goes.
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:55.080]   Then you wear a surgical mask over that.
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:57.360]   And then I finally was able to get N95 masks.
[01:25:57.360 --> 01:25:57.760]   And you know what?
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:25:58.760]   Those are pretty nice.
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:01.440]   So I've been wearing those.
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:02.680]   And I got--
[01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:06.560]   And right at the beginning of the quarantine,
[01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:09.440]   John and I bought on Kickstarter--
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:11.240]   they were more than 100 bucks, right?
[01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:15.880]   Ultraviolet wave masks that have fans in them.
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:20.120]   And they suck the air through a vortex of ultraviolet.
[01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:21.080]   Did you get one of those?
[01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:22.960]   I finally came.
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:23.600]   Is it cool?
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:24.120]   Is it cool?
[01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:25.920]   It's heavy.
[01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:28.600]   We knew it would be because it's got a big battery.
[01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:30.280]   I'll bring it in next week.
[01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:33.080]   I was just surprised that we never got-- no one made
[01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:35.000]   like a mask production of the dune.
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:35.880]   The dune one.
[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:36.280]   As soon as--
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:37.800]   This looks like the dune one.
[01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:38.520]   Yeah.
[01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:40.800]   But the thing is, is that when I saw the trailer for dune,
[01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:42.920]   I was like, why is not someone not marketing that right now?
[01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:44.360]   Because I would totally buy one of those.
[01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:47.080]   Like, I would totally buy a dune one that pops open like this.
[01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:48.080]   Yeah.
[01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:48.600]   It was in.
[01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:49.240]   It's like, that was awesome.
[01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:51.400]   These were the masks that didn't just--
[01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:52.960]   they captured your water vapor.
[01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:54.800]   Not your-- they weren't protecting you.
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:57.400]   Because there was-- in fact, look, here's somebody on Reddit
[01:26:57.400 --> 01:26:59.000]   saying I would pay good money for a mask.
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:26:59.680]   See?
[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:00.240]   With this pen.
[01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:01.240]   It's still suit, right?
[01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:01.840]   A still suit.
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:02.920]   It's part of the still suit.
[01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:03.920]   Yeah.
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:05.120]   Because water was--
[01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:08.400]   Yeah, the Fremen warm, because water was so scarce on--
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:09.280]   Yeah.
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:09.960]   --errakis.
[01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:11.200]   Is that the name of the planet--
[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:12.600]   God created the--
[01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:15.160]   Was it God created a rakis to test the faithful?
[01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:17.160]   When does not go against the word of God?
[01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:17.640]   That's--
[01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:18.140]   That's--
[01:27:18.140 --> 01:27:21.140]   So I'm not going to get a dune mask for my new iPad,
[01:27:21.140 --> 01:27:23.100]   but I would like to get a keyboard.
[01:27:23.100 --> 01:27:25.180]   So the question is, which do you get?
[01:27:25.180 --> 01:27:30.380]   Logitech has-- now, remember, Apple's Magic Keyboard's $345.
[01:27:30.380 --> 01:27:30.900]   I don't know.
[01:27:30.900 --> 01:27:33.220]   I have a feeling I'm going to be discomfitted
[01:27:33.220 --> 01:27:35.780]   by the poor fit on the new one.
[01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:39.660]   So should I get the Logitech Combo Touch, which is--
[01:27:39.660 --> 01:27:40.820]   You already have the old one.
[01:27:40.820 --> 01:27:42.140]   So this would be another one.
[01:27:42.140 --> 01:27:43.260]   Like, you don't have to choose it.
[01:27:43.260 --> 01:27:44.420]   You can have both.
[01:27:44.420 --> 01:27:46.660]   Or should I get the bridge?
[01:27:46.660 --> 01:27:48.900]   Both of them are about $100 less.
[01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:51.940]   The bridge is metal, which is kind of cool.
[01:27:51.940 --> 01:27:52.780]   I don't know.
[01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:54.060]   Anybody have an opinion on that?
[01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:55.220]   Jason, like the new bridge?
[01:27:55.220 --> 01:27:56.940]   I forget if Jason liked the new bridge or not.
[01:27:56.940 --> 01:28:01.180]   I actually think I have both for older iPads in my drawers.
[01:28:01.180 --> 01:28:07.220]   In the afterwards, you built the four iPad.
[01:28:07.220 --> 01:28:08.540]   It adds significant weight.
[01:28:08.540 --> 01:28:10.860]   Both of them do.
[01:28:10.860 --> 01:28:12.180]   And that's kind of the problem.
[01:28:12.180 --> 01:28:15.660]   The bridge adds 2.1 pounds to your iPad.
[01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:18.300]   I think that Logitech is close to 2 pounds.
[01:28:18.300 --> 01:28:20.780]   Maybe it's maybe even more than that.
[01:28:20.780 --> 01:28:21.660]   I don't know.
[01:28:21.660 --> 01:28:23.180]   Because it has to have a weight to serve as a base.
[01:28:23.180 --> 01:28:25.660]   That's the downside about having the computer behind the screen
[01:28:25.660 --> 01:28:29.460]   that you still have to have weight underneath the keys.
[01:28:29.460 --> 01:28:30.700]   Difficult.
[01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:31.340]   Challenging.
[01:28:31.340 --> 01:28:32.140]   Let me see what you do.
[01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:33.780]   This is terrible combo.
[01:28:33.780 --> 01:28:36.180]   The nice thing about Logitech Combo is it's really--
[01:28:36.180 --> 01:28:37.940]   but both of them are more casey.
[01:28:37.940 --> 01:28:40.380]   And the combo has this kickstand, right?
[01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:43.380]   Which is very surface-like.
[01:28:43.380 --> 01:28:45.300]   No.
[01:28:45.300 --> 01:28:48.020]   How much weight does it add?
[01:28:48.020 --> 01:28:50.140]   Not a significant amount.
[01:28:50.140 --> 01:28:52.380]   I warrant.
[01:28:52.380 --> 01:28:56.940]   That's why they're putting it way down at the bottom of the page.
[01:28:56.940 --> 01:28:59.340]   I remember it was like 2 pounds.
[01:28:59.340 --> 01:29:01.460]   Wait.
[01:29:01.460 --> 01:29:09.920]   Combo Touch 4 iPad Pro 12.9 inches, 25.27 and 1/2 ounces.
[01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:11.700]   How about 16 ounces and a pound?
[01:29:11.700 --> 01:29:14.300]   So it's less than 2 pounds.
[01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:15.220]   All right.
[01:29:15.220 --> 01:29:16.900]   I've done my math problems for the day.
[01:29:16.900 --> 01:29:20.180]   What else?
[01:29:20.180 --> 01:29:24.340]   Before we wrap this thing up, any other--
[01:29:24.340 --> 01:29:25.580]   we talked about the update.
[01:29:25.580 --> 01:29:30.460]   Apple Watch.
[01:29:30.460 --> 01:29:33.020]   Even Hackett found out you can put air tags inside the wheels
[01:29:33.020 --> 01:29:33.740]   on your Mac Pro.
[01:29:33.740 --> 01:29:35.500]   And I thought that was brilliant engineering.
[01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:36.460]   That they fit just perfectly--
[01:29:36.460 --> 01:29:37.180]   Oh.
[01:29:37.180 --> 01:29:37.980]   --inside the wheel.
[01:29:37.980 --> 01:29:39.540]   Oh.
[01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:41.580]   That's a clever thing.
[01:29:41.580 --> 01:29:43.020]   You don't really need it on a Mac Pro,
[01:29:43.020 --> 01:29:46.860]   because it's got fine mind as part of the operating system.
[01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:48.380]   But maybe somebody would steal the wheels.
[01:29:48.380 --> 01:29:49.500]   They are $100 each.
[01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:50.300]   They're not.
[01:29:50.300 --> 01:29:51.540]   They're wisdom.
[01:29:51.540 --> 01:29:53.100]   And it's like upgrading your rims.
[01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:55.580]   I mean, it's just baller.
[01:29:55.580 --> 01:29:57.820]   Put the silver side out for real.
[01:29:57.820 --> 01:29:58.900]   Real sharp.
[01:29:58.900 --> 01:29:59.660]   Air mez ones.
[01:29:59.660 --> 01:30:02.820]   Get four air mez ones and then put those inside the wheels.
[01:30:02.820 --> 01:30:05.660]   That's really $150 per wheel.
[01:30:05.660 --> 01:30:10.300]   We had seen rumors, thanks to the 14.6 beta,
[01:30:10.300 --> 01:30:15.300]   that Apple was going to start a high res or lossless audio
[01:30:15.300 --> 01:30:18.220]   streaming service.
[01:30:18.220 --> 01:30:21.300]   Yes, you credit that?
[01:30:21.300 --> 01:30:22.940]   It seems like a logical thing to do.
[01:30:22.940 --> 01:30:23.940]   Yeah.
[01:30:23.940 --> 01:30:24.860]   It's catch up.
[01:30:24.860 --> 01:30:29.460]   And also, if Apple is as proud of their high fidelity
[01:30:29.460 --> 01:30:32.780]   enough to build a $400 smart speaker,
[01:30:32.780 --> 01:30:33.900]   that has really no feature.
[01:30:33.900 --> 01:30:36.620]   But it's fidelity, then, yeah, that's a natural thing.
[01:30:36.620 --> 01:30:37.540]   It's just catch up.
[01:30:37.540 --> 01:30:39.060]   There's buttons in the music app that
[01:30:39.060 --> 01:30:42.020]   specify Dolby Atmos, Dolby Audio, and lossless.
[01:30:42.020 --> 01:30:44.260]   What's the difference between-- what's Dolby Audio, Alex?
[01:30:44.260 --> 01:30:46.260]   Is that surround?
[01:30:46.260 --> 01:30:47.260]   Is that--
[01:30:47.260 --> 01:30:50.500]   No, it's-- well, there's a couple things--
[01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:53.860]   I'm not certain how they're using that.
[01:30:53.860 --> 01:30:56.820]   But I believe that it is a lot of noise reduction.
[01:30:56.820 --> 01:31:00.220]   So basically, it can help clean up the audio.
[01:31:00.220 --> 01:31:00.740]   If you're using--
[01:31:00.740 --> 01:31:01.900]   Oh, you mean doubly.
[01:31:01.900 --> 01:31:03.900]   It's doubly.
[01:31:03.900 --> 01:31:05.020]   Never mind.
[01:31:05.020 --> 01:31:05.900]   That's a very good reference.
[01:31:05.900 --> 01:31:06.460]   I got that.
[01:31:06.460 --> 01:31:08.300]   I will send you a receipt for that final test
[01:31:08.300 --> 01:31:10.300]   reference to you.
[01:31:10.300 --> 01:31:11.580]   But I will say that--
[01:31:11.580 --> 01:31:13.580]   I mean, I spend a lot of time listening to Atmos.
[01:31:13.580 --> 01:31:14.860]   And the title has it.
[01:31:14.860 --> 01:31:15.980]   So you can listen to it there.
[01:31:15.980 --> 01:31:16.740]   I mean, if you want to--
[01:31:16.740 --> 01:31:17.940]   So atmos, you need up a lot of money.
[01:31:17.940 --> 01:31:18.980]   I mean, down firing speakers.
[01:31:18.980 --> 01:31:20.860]   You need speakers in the ceiling, right?
[01:31:20.860 --> 01:31:21.380]   No.
[01:31:21.380 --> 01:31:22.020]   Or special audio.
[01:31:22.020 --> 01:31:23.660]   Yeah, I mean, Atmos can work in anything.
[01:31:23.660 --> 01:31:26.140]   Because what happens is that Atmos has--
[01:31:26.140 --> 01:31:30.460]   basically, Atmos is a mixture of sound beds that work in 5.1
[01:31:30.460 --> 01:31:35.260]   or the 7.2 or 7.1 space.
[01:31:35.260 --> 01:31:37.220]   So you have beds of audio.
[01:31:37.220 --> 01:31:38.620]   And coming out of certain speakers,
[01:31:38.620 --> 01:31:39.660]   and then you have objects.
[01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:43.660]   And you can have, I think, up to 128 or something, objects.
[01:31:43.660 --> 01:31:46.500]   Those objects can be basically animated
[01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:48.540]   around throughout the--
[01:31:48.540 --> 01:31:50.740]   throughout whatever you're listening to, whether it's a movie
[01:31:50.740 --> 01:31:53.660]   or whether-- now, when you define it as Atmos,
[01:31:53.660 --> 01:31:56.700]   it means that it can go any setting you put it into,
[01:31:56.700 --> 01:31:59.260]   whether it's a 5.1 or 7 or whatever.
[01:31:59.260 --> 01:32:01.500]   It'll figure out what speakers it should go out of,
[01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:03.900]   because it's kind of like an illustrator to Photoshop.
[01:32:03.900 --> 01:32:07.100]   So Photoshop being the speakers, just the pixels.
[01:32:07.100 --> 01:32:08.900]   And Illustrator being it.
[01:32:08.900 --> 01:32:10.260]   So it's defined in space.
[01:32:10.260 --> 01:32:14.620]   And then it figures out the decoder, your AVR.
[01:32:14.620 --> 01:32:16.900]   Will know where to put what speaker to put it out of,
[01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:20.420]   based on the position that it was, put into Atmos.
[01:32:20.420 --> 01:32:22.100]   Now, if you have something that can read it,
[01:32:22.100 --> 01:32:23.980]   because it still has to go down to speakers.
[01:32:23.980 --> 01:32:26.700]   But those speakers could be 16 speakers, or five speakers,
[01:32:26.700 --> 01:32:27.820]   or eight speakers.
[01:32:27.820 --> 01:32:29.580]   And so all of those things, it figures out
[01:32:29.580 --> 01:32:31.740]   where to put them at the highest resolution
[01:32:31.740 --> 01:32:37.220]   that your home system or theater can handle.
[01:32:37.220 --> 01:32:38.020]   So that's cool.
[01:32:38.020 --> 01:32:38.940]   Anyway, so it's--
[01:32:38.940 --> 01:32:40.300]   And it is--
[01:32:40.300 --> 01:32:41.300]   So I've been working--
[01:32:41.300 --> 01:32:41.900]   --the music in it.
[01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:43.900]   This is a word for the AirPods, the spatial audio.
[01:32:43.900 --> 01:32:44.400]   Yeah.
[01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:45.380]   Oh, yeah.
[01:32:45.380 --> 01:32:46.980]   Apple should release, though, something
[01:32:46.980 --> 01:32:48.300]   a little more high fidelity.
[01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:51.540]   If it really wants to start talking about lossless
[01:32:51.540 --> 01:32:54.780]   and spatial audio, I don't think even the AirPods
[01:32:54.780 --> 01:32:56.940]   max are that high fidelity.
[01:32:56.940 --> 01:32:57.540]   But I will say--
[01:32:57.540 --> 01:32:57.820]   I will say, when--
[01:32:57.820 --> 01:32:59.380]   --that they can take any--
[01:32:59.380 --> 01:33:00.380]   Sorry.
[01:33:00.380 --> 01:33:01.380]   Go ahead.
[01:33:01.380 --> 01:33:03.100]   No, I was going to say the whole point of their system
[01:33:03.100 --> 01:33:05.500]   is that they can ingest any sound that's available to them
[01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:08.460]   and then build a 3D sound stage out of it for spatial audio.
[01:33:08.460 --> 01:33:10.860]   So if you give them all the information of Dolby Atmos,
[01:33:10.860 --> 01:33:12.860]   they will just take that and say, thank you very much.
[01:33:12.860 --> 01:33:14.500]   If not, they will break everything down
[01:33:14.500 --> 01:33:16.660]   and build their own sound stage based on their models,
[01:33:16.660 --> 01:33:19.580]   their ML models, for where different sounds should be.
[01:33:19.580 --> 01:33:22.380]   And the more data you feed it, the better that model becomes.
[01:33:22.380 --> 01:33:26.380]   So it should really scale gracefully from the worst MP3.
[01:33:26.380 --> 01:33:27.980]   Like, the whole idea of this was that, even if we give you
[01:33:27.980 --> 01:33:32.020]   terrible MP3, it'll still sound great on the AirPods
[01:33:32.020 --> 01:33:33.260]   max and the HomePod.
[01:33:33.260 --> 01:33:35.580]   But if you give us a better signal, it'll sound even better.
[01:33:35.580 --> 01:33:37.460]   And now they're busy upgrading all the--
[01:33:37.460 --> 01:33:39.860]   finally, after upgrading all the video audio for a couple
[01:33:39.860 --> 01:33:41.900]   of years, they're finally upgrading the audio audio.
[01:33:41.900 --> 01:33:45.780]   Well, and the thing is that the big difference between--
[01:33:45.780 --> 01:33:47.740]   I've been trying to explain this to folks,
[01:33:47.740 --> 01:33:51.140]   because I listen to so much of it that's in Atmos,
[01:33:51.140 --> 01:33:52.980]   that you get used to it.
[01:33:52.980 --> 01:33:54.460]   And everything feels very constrained.
[01:33:54.460 --> 01:33:57.340]   And the way I kind of describe it is that stereo is in your head.
[01:33:57.340 --> 01:33:58.380]   You know, you put headphones on it.
[01:33:58.380 --> 01:34:01.260]   It kind of feels like the music's in your head.
[01:34:01.260 --> 01:34:05.660]   Spatial-- immersive is outside your head.
[01:34:05.660 --> 01:34:08.260]   It feels like you're in a place.
[01:34:08.260 --> 01:34:09.700]   Rather than it happening inside your head,
[01:34:09.700 --> 01:34:11.100]   it feels like it's all around you.
[01:34:11.100 --> 01:34:13.380]   And that's what-- it changes when you turn your head.
[01:34:13.380 --> 01:34:15.420]   And it feels like it's all-- you can feel like it's
[01:34:15.420 --> 01:34:17.540]   in front of you and to the side of you and around you.
[01:34:17.540 --> 01:34:19.060]   And it's just the difference--
[01:34:19.060 --> 01:34:22.340]   I just always want to say the difference between stereo--
[01:34:22.340 --> 01:34:25.380]   mono and stereo is like 10% the difference between stereo
[01:34:25.380 --> 01:34:26.740]   and immersive.
[01:34:26.740 --> 01:34:30.020]   And I didn't believe that until I got title
[01:34:30.020 --> 01:34:32.740]   and started listening to a bunch of the stuff that's in Atmos.
[01:34:32.740 --> 01:34:35.260]   And it's just stunning.
[01:34:35.260 --> 01:34:36.860]   You know, it's just so much more--
[01:34:36.860 --> 01:34:38.180]   But again, my question is--
[01:34:38.180 --> 01:34:40.620]   I mean, especially if you're going lossless,
[01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:44.460]   I would love these Apple spatial features in a--
[01:34:44.460 --> 01:34:48.060]   I mean, why don't they release something--
[01:34:48.060 --> 01:34:52.140]   do they consider the AirPods Max to be as good as it needs to be?
[01:34:52.140 --> 01:34:53.300]   It's still not.
[01:34:53.300 --> 01:34:54.460]   I think it's a progress.
[01:34:54.460 --> 01:34:55.500]   I think it's--
[01:34:55.500 --> 01:34:57.700]   maybe they don't want to do $1,000 headphone.
[01:34:57.700 --> 01:34:59.940]   I mean, maybe they feel like that's just two.
[01:34:59.940 --> 01:35:00.740]   They're a sweet spot.
[01:35:00.740 --> 01:35:01.900]   Well, there's a flat phone.
[01:35:01.900 --> 01:35:03.900]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:35:03.900 --> 01:35:06.900]   If they thought they could, they would.
[01:35:06.900 --> 01:35:09.140]   It was meant for people who had enough money,
[01:35:09.140 --> 01:35:10.820]   but really listened to Web Audio.
[01:35:10.820 --> 01:35:11.340]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:35:11.340 --> 01:35:14.300]   How to make Web Audio sound as good as it possibly can.
[01:35:14.300 --> 01:35:17.660]   Like if you're watching TV+ and you're listening to Apple music,
[01:35:17.660 --> 01:35:18.860]   how can we make that sound great?
[01:35:18.860 --> 01:35:20.980]   And it'll sound better when they get higher.
[01:35:20.980 --> 01:35:22.700]   Is there-- so there's nothing besides--
[01:35:22.700 --> 01:35:24.100]   is there anything besides Apple that
[01:35:24.100 --> 01:35:26.500]   does Apple's spatial audio?
[01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:27.300]   Oh, yeah, there's lots of--
[01:35:27.300 --> 01:35:28.180]   oh, there's lots of spatial--
[01:35:28.180 --> 01:35:29.700]   Because it's just--
[01:35:29.700 --> 01:35:30.700]   It's just--
[01:35:30.700 --> 01:35:32.860]   There's Atmos and Sony has their own--
[01:35:32.860 --> 01:35:34.020]   So I could get--
[01:35:34.020 --> 01:35:37.540]   I could get high-end headphones that would support spatial audio.
[01:35:37.540 --> 01:35:38.700]   That's not an Apple thing.
[01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:39.220]   Oh, yeah.
[01:35:39.220 --> 01:35:42.220]   Oh, no, there's Sennheiser, I think, makes the--
[01:35:42.220 --> 01:35:43.340]   but the Sennheiser ones are like $1,000.
[01:35:43.340 --> 01:35:44.980]   Those are $60,000.
[01:35:44.980 --> 01:35:47.940]   There's a $60,000 pair of Sennheiser--
[01:35:47.940 --> 01:35:50.260]   I think that there's like a $100,000 Sennheiser.
[01:35:50.260 --> 01:35:52.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:35:52.260 --> 01:35:53.700]   Yeah.
[01:35:53.700 --> 01:35:57.980]   The Sennheiser Orpheus, it's $55,000.
[01:35:57.980 --> 01:35:58.940]   I'm sorry.
[01:35:58.940 --> 01:35:59.940]   I'm sorry.
[01:35:59.940 --> 01:36:00.940]   I'm sorry.
[01:36:00.940 --> 01:36:01.940]   I got a headphone.
[01:36:01.940 --> 01:36:03.180]   I got a vacuum tubes, right?
[01:36:03.180 --> 01:36:03.740]   It said--
[01:36:03.740 --> 01:36:04.580]   I have a vacuum tubes at the cost.
[01:36:04.580 --> 01:36:05.700]   Yeah, there's the headphones.
[01:36:05.700 --> 01:36:08.140]   You look like you're wearing a pancake on your head.
[01:36:08.140 --> 01:36:09.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:10.460]   It's a system.
[01:36:10.460 --> 01:36:12.580]   Because you see, it's also got these amp, the tube.
[01:36:12.580 --> 01:36:15.100]   And then it's got things that come out and raise up.
[01:36:15.100 --> 01:36:16.180]   And oh, my--
[01:36:16.180 --> 01:36:17.260]   You don't have tubes.
[01:36:17.260 --> 01:36:18.820]   You don't understand these.
[01:36:18.820 --> 01:36:20.420]   These are aspirational.
[01:36:20.420 --> 01:36:21.620]   There you go into the store.
[01:36:21.620 --> 01:36:23.340]   You see the $55,000 one.
[01:36:23.340 --> 01:36:25.500]   And it's only the $23,000 that headphones.
[01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:26.020]   Seems not so.
[01:36:26.020 --> 01:36:27.300]   It seems like more reasonable.
[01:36:27.300 --> 01:36:28.900]   And that's what you buy.
[01:36:28.900 --> 01:36:30.700]   So--
[01:36:30.700 --> 01:36:34.060]   And I bet you it doesn't lose facial on the other--
[01:36:34.060 --> 01:36:35.540]   Hoot on that.
[01:36:35.540 --> 01:36:37.420]   It's probably just left-right stereo.
[01:36:37.420 --> 01:36:42.460]   But hey, if it's music in your head, that's $55,000 good.
[01:36:42.460 --> 01:36:43.620]   That's fine.
[01:36:43.620 --> 01:36:48.020]   But what 18 to 19-year-old who didn't just
[01:36:48.020 --> 01:36:53.320]   found a tech startup in 1993 has enough money for headphones
[01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:56.640]   that can actually suit their entire 18-year-old child
[01:36:56.640 --> 01:36:58.120]   like range of hearing.
[01:36:58.120 --> 01:36:59.500]   Because once you're--
[01:36:59.500 --> 01:37:00.600]   Yeah, my age.
[01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:02.440]   That quality's gross off at 26.
[01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:03.840]   Yeah, I saw the shame.
[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:11.120]   Now I'm flummoxed.
[01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:13.920]   There was one member that I really liked.
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:15.440]   Yes, rumors.
[01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:17.680]   A Minchie Quo is saying that there's
[01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:20.880]   going to be an updated iPad mini the second half of 2021,
[01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:22.360]   which got me really excited because I
[01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:24.920]   think the iPad mini is one of the superstars of the iPad.
[01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:26.640]   There was a rumor that they were going to announce that
[01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:29.400]   at this last event, and they didn't.
[01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:29.920]   So that's--
[01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:31.360]   I always heard later in the year.
[01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:33.520]   I never heard it was for this event.
[01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:35.880]   And a foldable phone by 2023.
[01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:37.360]   But a really good foldable phone.
[01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:40.160]   And the reason a quote would be the guy to quote on this
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:44.640]   is he has the supply chain inside track.
[01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:47.000]   And so they'd be making parts for this
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:50.040]   so that you would start to see these mini-sized touch
[01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:51.840]   panels and things like that.
[01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:53.440]   Yeah.
[01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:56.120]   I still have, I think, a third generation iPad mini,
[01:37:56.120 --> 01:38:00.040]   and I still use it all the time because it's just perfect.
[01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:01.040]   Perfect.
[01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:04.000]   It's the reason why I really don't feel like I
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:05.480]   need a maxi-sized phone.
[01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:09.880]   If it has mini-LED screen, would it be the mini-mini?
[01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:10.680]   Micro.
[01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:11.480]   Micro-mini-mini?
[01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:14.360]   Micro-femto-ado.
[01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:16.400]   So by the way, that was one of the reasons
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:19.160]   I wanted to get this new iPad is the mini-LED screen.
[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:21.080]   I imagine Alex, you're very interested in that too.
[01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:23.440]   It's a reference quality screen, right?
[01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:27.600]   Well, yeah, I mean, the main reason I wanted is that.
[01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:28.560]   Yeah.
[01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:29.040]   Yeah.
[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:30.120]   I'm curious to look at it.
[01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:34.840]   Is that the first mini-LED screen we in common use?
[01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:36.840]   They've had them at CES for televisions and stuff.
[01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:37.360]   Yeah.
[01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:39.920]   But they were big and expensive.
[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:43.160]   Not to be confused with Micro, which is the giant--
[01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:44.000]   Self-submitting.
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.760]   And that yet, Micro is a direct--
[01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:49.280]   Deep pixels is almost so on display.
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:52.760]   And the mini is just a mini backlight on an LCD screen.
[01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:54.120]   Yeah, local dimming zones.
[01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:54.620]   Yeah.
[01:38:54.620 --> 01:39:03.400]   I had heard that mini-LED yields were poor,
[01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:04.720]   which would explain why you wouldn't
[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:06.760]   see this rolling out on everything.
[01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:10.960]   But you think Apple will put mini-LED on its laptops?
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:12.040]   I want it so badly, Leo.
[01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:12.960]   6-inch MacBook Pro.
[01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:14.280]   I think the higher-end stuff will get it,
[01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:15.960]   because it's additional cost.
[01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:17.880]   And they want to always maintain their entry-level price
[01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:18.380]   points.
[01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:20.380]   I think that's why the 11-inch didn't get it.
[01:39:20.380 --> 01:39:23.240]   And I don't think maybe the lower the entry-level MacBooks
[01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:24.600]   or iMacs will get it.
[01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:27.100]   But I'm hoping there's enough to absorb the cost on the higher
[01:39:27.100 --> 01:39:29.960]   end, because I really want that in a 16-inch MacBook Pro.
[01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:31.280]   I know what it is.
[01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:31.780]   It is.
[01:39:31.780 --> 01:39:32.640]   It's a great way to do it.
[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:33.800]   Do you imagine editing video?
[01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:34.460]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:39:34.460 --> 01:39:39.220]   You get an M1X or M2 and a 16-inch with a mini-LED screen.
[01:39:39.220 --> 01:39:41.840]   Well, M2 would probably be low power again.
[01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:43.120]   So it's like an M2X.
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:44.520]   Yeah, I just want an i-Power.
[01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:45.020]   It'll be an X.
[01:39:45.020 --> 01:39:46.320]   And mini-LED.
[01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:48.240]   And I would never leave.
[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:49.360]   Lee, I'd be sitting here in front of it,
[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:50.280]   letting you guys in HDR.
[01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:53.080]   I think it was a quote that said that they have stepped up.
[01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:57.240]   They have production now of a higher-end M1 chip.
[01:39:57.240 --> 01:39:58.500]   So I think that's in time for--
[01:39:58.500 --> 01:39:59.260]   Performance of that, too.
[01:39:59.260 --> 01:40:00.760]   Yeah, 12 to 16 cores.
[01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:01.560]   Yeah.
[01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:02.760]   That would be next month, right?
[01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:04.080]   That would be at WWDC.
[01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:06.320]   I hope I need it, Leo.
[01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:07.000]   You don't need it.
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:07.500]   Price was flow.
[01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:09.120]   You don't need it.
[01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:09.800]   I need it.
[01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:10.880]   Don't tell me I don't need it, Leo.
[01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:11.920]   I'm buying it now.
[01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:17.520]   I'm going to replace all the Macs in the tire place.
[01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:19.600]   I was happy to give Lisa my iMac Pro.
[01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:22.320]   I neglected to mention that it will be obsolete in minutes.
[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:23.720]   But you know--
[01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:24.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:40:24.220 --> 01:40:29.600]   32-inch iMac M1X iMac Pro.
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:30.680]   What do you think?
[01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:33.440]   OK, so I went on record in the Twitch forums
[01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:36.720]   at WWDC Community on my predictions.
[01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:39.360]   I think the 14 and 16 in June.
[01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:43.240]   But I would hold out hope for the Pro stuff.
[01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:45.360]   That's going to be in the fall or even later.
[01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:47.760]   I'm going to say an iMac--
[01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:51.480]   higher end iMacs in September and a December announcement
[01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:52.840]   for a Mac Pro.
[01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:56.960]   And I'm hoping a Mini Mac Pro--
[01:40:56.960 --> 01:40:57.460]   Yes.
[01:40:57.460 --> 01:40:57.960]   --the half-point.
[01:40:57.960 --> 01:40:58.360]   And half-point.
[01:40:58.360 --> 01:40:58.840]   And half-point.
[01:40:58.840 --> 01:40:59.760]   Yeah.
[01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:02.600]   Well, no, it's not a Mac Mini, but a Mini Mac Pro.
[01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:03.280]   Yeah.
[01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:05.360]   So not a Mac Mini Pro, but a Mac Pro Mini.
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:06.120]   So that was the--
[01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:07.440]   I was actually answering the question.
[01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:09.040]   Somebody was saying, when is the--
[01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:11.600]   where is a higher-end Mac, Mini going to come out?
[01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:15.480]   And some people said-- and I think not without reason--
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:18.600]   Apple doesn't typically do that with the Mini, right?
[01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:19.080]   Do they?
[01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:19.680]   I mean, they--
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:21.680]   No, they will, because they currently
[01:41:21.680 --> 01:41:22.920]   still have the Intel--
[01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:24.240]   So they have to replace the Intel.
[01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:25.440]   --M1 is silver.
[01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:26.800]   Yeah, and the Intel is space gray,
[01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:28.280]   and space gray means professional.
[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:30.840]   So will there be a space gray Mini and when?
[01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:32.720]   I think there'll be an M1X with more ports.
[01:41:32.720 --> 01:41:35.120]   At the same time, we get the M1X iMac.
[01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:36.400]   I think they'll do the desktops.
[01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:37.960]   You agree with me, September?
[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:42.080]   Usually, October is there at Mac event, but it's 2021, Leo.
[01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:42.600]   We don't know.
[01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:44.160]   Last year, it was in November.
[01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:45.720]   So at some point this fall--
[01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:46.600]   So how about--
[01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:47.840]   How about the September's iPhones?
[01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:48.280]   No, you're right.
[01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:49.320]   September's iPhones.
[01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:52.520]   October iMacs, and then November of December,
[01:41:52.520 --> 01:41:55.440]   I think the Mac Pros will be revved or made--
[01:41:55.440 --> 01:41:56.480]   Or do they just tease us?
[01:41:56.480 --> 01:41:57.760]   Do they say the Mac Pro is coming,
[01:41:57.760 --> 01:41:58.440]   but it's only coming--
[01:41:58.440 --> 01:41:59.440]   That's what they traditionally do.
[01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:00.280]   --because they have to finish the next year--
[01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:00.760]   --to finish everything.
[01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:01.920]   Yeah, traditionally that's what they do.
[01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:02.800]   I'd say it's coming.
[01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:03.240]   Yeah.
[01:42:03.240 --> 01:42:05.000]   They did that with the Trash Can Mac.
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:06.160]   They announced in December, which
[01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:08.320]   couldn't get it till January.
[01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:09.200]   I wouldn't be surprised if--
[01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:11.440]   It was announced in June, and you couldn't get it till December.
[01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:14.520]   And the same thing with the 2019 iMac Pro.
[01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:15.000]   Right.
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:16.200]   They announced in June, and, yeah,
[01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:17.480]   and you couldn't get it till--
[01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:19.200]   You got like three of them shipped before December,
[01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:20.480]   so they could make them out the date.
[01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:23.760]   So I guess they could announce this at WWDC, all the pro stuff,
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:25.280]   and say, hey, down next--
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:27.120]   At the end of the year, you'll be able to order the iMac
[01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:27.960]   Pro and the Mac Pro.
[01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:28.440]   Yeah.
[01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:30.680]   In 2017, they did the iMac Pro at WWDC,
[01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:31.840]   and it didn't come out till December.
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:32.840]   There's a trend.
[01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:34.240]   There's a trend for the Pro machine.
[01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:34.880]   OK, good.
[01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:38.640]   [SIGHS]
[01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:39.520]   There's all your money, Leo.
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:44.240]   Alex, do I need new headphones if I want to do Toby Stoveo?
[01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:44.440]   Or--
[01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:44.920]   No, no.
[01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:46.600]   I could do spatial with just the AMP.
[01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:47.120]   Tell him yes.
[01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:47.920]   Tell him yes.
[01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:50.280]   Well, you could-- I mean, literally the--
[01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:55.440]   I'm listening to it mostly in the iPad and the iPod Pros.
[01:42:55.440 --> 01:42:57.440]   Yeah, but those are crappy headphones, dude.
[01:42:57.440 --> 01:42:58.320]   It still sounds good.
[01:42:58.320 --> 01:42:59.760]   I'm just saying that it's--
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:01.880]   when I'm listening-- now, when I'm listening to it in my office,
[01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:04.320]   I'm listening to it on 10 speakers.
[01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:06.480]   So the-- so I have 10 discrete speakers.
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:06.840]   Am I off?
[01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:09.360]   But if I had regular headphones that were
[01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:13.560]   driven with a spatial audio receiver of some sort,
[01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:16.720]   box, AMP, that would give me-- because all you have
[01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:19.880]   is two speakers in all of these above, right?
[01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:22.240]   It's the computer--
[01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:24.320]   I don't know how the Sennheiser works.
[01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:31.760]   Well, we actually pushed some feeling of spatial audio over Zoom,
[01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:32.760]   just as long as you have stereo.
[01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:33.120]   You can--
[01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:35.520]   Well, remember, we did a Mac break weekly many, many years
[01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:38.320]   ago using that Dolby headphone technology.
[01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:38.840]   Right.
[01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:39.040]   Right.
[01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:40.600]   So I hear it, but--
[01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:41.320]   I did it.
[01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:42.120]   Yeah.
[01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:44.960]   So yeah, but I think that--
[01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:48.120]   I'm just saying that you can do it with anything.
[01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:51.120]   And I haven't invested in really high-end headphones,
[01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:55.160]   because I've got good speaker systems that I can listen to it in.
[01:43:55.160 --> 01:43:57.480]   So in a variety of different places.
[01:43:57.480 --> 01:44:00.760]   And so I haven't-- so when I'm talking about it sounding really good,
[01:44:00.760 --> 01:44:02.480]   I'm usually listening to it that way.
[01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:04.680]   But when I'm driving, I'm still--
[01:44:04.680 --> 01:44:05.560]   oh, no, I'm driving.
[01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:07.840]   But when I'm walking around, I'm still listening to it
[01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:12.400]   in Atmos, just in my little AirPod pros.
[01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:14.240]   And I think that-- so people shouldn't feel like they need
[01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:18.080]   to have more than that to get the experience.
[01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:22.520]   But you can definitely buy, obviously, the new AirPod,
[01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:23.680]   the bigger ones over the year.
[01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:26.240]   Or you can get-- again, the Sennheiser's, I think,
[01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:30.440]   are in the $1,600 or $2,400 range, which are the--
[01:44:30.440 --> 01:44:32.000]   I believe they have more drivers in them.
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.760]   But I'm not 100% certain.
[01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:36.400]   So complicated.
[01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:40.920]   Yeah, so it's really impressive.
[01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:45.720]   It's just a really great way to listen to music and watch movies.
[01:44:45.720 --> 01:44:47.760]   When you watch it, you get used to that, too.
[01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:51.480]   All that stuff works when you're watching the movies as well.
[01:44:51.480 --> 01:44:53.960]   But I think we're going to see a lot in--
[01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:56.280]   so I think that what will spark this industry,
[01:44:56.280 --> 01:45:00.840]   because there's still only a handful of people doing immersive.
[01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:03.320]   And we're within office hours.
[01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:04.760]   We have our own band.
[01:45:04.760 --> 01:45:06.120]   I think I mentioned that before.
[01:45:06.120 --> 01:45:07.600]   And so they finish the song.
[01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:10.280]   They're doing another song that come out sometime in May.
[01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:13.440]   And then they're going to do another song.
[01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:15.280]   But after that one, sometime this year,
[01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:17.720]   we're hoping to do one all in "Atmos."
[01:45:17.720 --> 01:45:21.200]   Like just in "Atmos Music" and just play with it
[01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:23.800]   and take it in a song and move it all around.
[01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:26.960]   But I think that we're going to see more and more demand for it,
[01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:28.600]   because as soon as Apple turns it on--
[01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:30.440]   I mean, title turning it on proved that it worked.
[01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:33.480]   But it's not a very large market.
[01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:35.480]   It just reminds me of that fabulous song,
[01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:39.840]   "Turn the beat around, left to hear percussion."
[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:41.160]   "Work a step on."
[01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:42.000]   No.
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:43.640]   "Turn it upside down."
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:45.240]   "I'm a curious person."
[01:45:45.240 --> 01:45:46.080]   "Yeah, listen to the percussion, isn't it?"
[01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:47.760]   "Love to hear percussion."
[01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:48.320]   Yes, it is.
[01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:49.840]   No, I think that--
[01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:51.240]   Yeah, that would be a fun one.
[01:45:51.240 --> 01:45:54.080]   Yeah.
[01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:56.720]   They played it on the radio show for me the other day.
[01:45:56.720 --> 01:45:57.520]   We were talking--
[01:45:57.520 --> 01:45:58.080]   It's not stuck in your head.
[01:45:58.080 --> 01:46:00.160]   Now it's in my head, unfortunately.
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:01.160]   They inserted the word.
[01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:02.480]   They need to live.
[01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:05.240]   It's not a bad earworm, if you're going to have an earworm.
[01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:06.400]   Yeah.
[01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:10.920]   Anything else to say before we get to our picks of the week--
[01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:15.080]   and of course, this week, Alex Pick is going to be the eBay
[01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:17.120]   version of Rumsleg, I'm sure.
[01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:18.320]   But we'll see.
[01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:18.840]   It's not.
[01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:19.800]   I don't make any money on that.
[01:46:19.800 --> 01:46:20.760]   I don't know why I'm doing that.
[01:46:20.760 --> 01:46:22.120]   Oh, and I plugged that.
[01:46:22.120 --> 01:46:23.280]   Wow, I'm so plugged in.
[01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:25.000]   I'm buying them slowly like Apple stock.
[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:26.600]   You know, just slowly pulling them in.
[01:46:26.600 --> 01:46:30.240]   If you autographed Rumsleg, it would be worse more.
[01:46:30.240 --> 01:46:31.880]   I'm just saying, the autograph.
[01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:33.280]   I'm saying autograph them.
[01:46:33.280 --> 01:46:35.040]   Autograph the box.
[01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:37.200]   I already got a spot on my shelf for the one
[01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:38.400]   that I ordered an hour ago.
[01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:40.320]   It's the next time you come over to it.
[01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:42.880]   I absolutely did.
[01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:46.560]   There's going to be a silver Sharpie park right next week.
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:47.280]   Oh, you're really funny.
[01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:49.720]   It's being really valuable because the autograph
[01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:52.160]   ones and the thing is no one else has that.
[01:46:52.160 --> 01:46:53.560]   I mean, everybody's got this guy.
[01:46:53.560 --> 01:46:54.720]   You're the only one who have wrongs.
[01:46:54.720 --> 01:46:56.600]   What I think is going to be really, really
[01:46:56.600 --> 01:47:00.560]   historically funny is when all these eBay stores that
[01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:03.360]   have these automated systems that adjust the prices,
[01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:06.120]   like, oh my god, there must have been some sort of announcement
[01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:06.800]   about Rumsleg.
[01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:09.640]   He's going to have his own Disney Plus show.
[01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:11.960]   Suddenly, let's charge $300 for it.
[01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:13.520]   And then they wonder, wait a minute,
[01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:14.840]   why are these $300 on?
[01:47:14.840 --> 01:47:15.880]   Why is nobody buying them?
[01:47:15.880 --> 01:47:18.360]   I thought there was going to be this rumor about Rumsleg.
[01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:20.880]   Or Disney realizes that we have it.
[01:47:20.880 --> 01:47:23.440]   Why are we tracking prices of collectibles?
[01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:25.680]   And suddenly, this Rumsleg character is really, really
[01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:26.960]   popular all of a sudden.
[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:28.880]   It's getting lots of Marvel hits.
[01:47:28.880 --> 01:47:29.440]   Exactly.
[01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:31.080]   We need the Rumsleg movie.
[01:47:31.080 --> 01:47:32.120]   Quick.
[01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:33.480]   Will there be a star--
[01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:37.480]   isn't there supposed to be a Star Wars movie every December?
[01:47:37.480 --> 01:47:38.440]   There wasn't one this year.
[01:47:38.440 --> 01:47:40.640]   Well, I think that they went at least.
[01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:41.560]   Yeah, they backed away.
[01:47:41.560 --> 01:47:46.160]   Well, here's the thing about that.
[01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:49.160]   I think that Marvel's doing--
[01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:54.040]   Marvel/Disney is doing really well with series.
[01:47:54.040 --> 01:47:57.920]   If you think that subscription is your future,
[01:47:57.920 --> 01:47:59.480]   the movies become less of a thing,
[01:47:59.480 --> 01:48:01.320]   and the series become more of a thing.
[01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:03.240]   And I think we saw that with WandaVision,
[01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:06.920]   and we really saw that with Winter Soldier and the Falcon.
[01:48:06.920 --> 01:48:10.280]   That you can't put that story in two hours.
[01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:12.920]   And so at first, it was like, oh, we'll
[01:48:12.920 --> 01:48:19.000]   take the smaller brands and put them into a series that
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:19.500]   was--
[01:48:19.500 --> 01:48:21.080]   What's happening is is that we actually
[01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:24.280]   are getting more out of that character.
[01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:27.840]   We don't contain them inside of the film structure.
[01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:33.600]   And we let them spread out over multiple seasons
[01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:34.880]   and all those things.
[01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:36.040]   And so I think that--
[01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:38.960]   The Mandalorian was such a success that they realized
[01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:39.760]   that they were wasting it.
[01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:40.120]   I don't know.
[01:48:40.120 --> 01:48:41.280]   He didn't have the showrunner.
[01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:42.400]   They didn't have Kevin Feighy.
[01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:43.920]   And I think that hurt them.
[01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:45.000]   He's going to get three to four--
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:46.000]   So Disney+--
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:46.720]   Or are we still here?
[01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:49.080]   In December, Disney+ is going to have them.
[01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:51.200]   This really sounds like it should have been the Rumsleg
[01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:53.880]   movie, the book of Boba Fett.
[01:48:53.880 --> 01:48:54.480]   Damn him.
[01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:56.640]   He always gets all the attention.
[01:48:56.640 --> 01:48:59.320]   And the Rumsleg is really upset about the whole Boba Fett
[01:48:59.320 --> 01:48:59.600]   thing.
[01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:00.600]   He just thinks that.
[01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:03.160]   But Rumsleg is obviously a three of Mandalorian.
[01:49:03.160 --> 01:49:05.920]   You know, what we could turn out is that Rumsleg is actually
[01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:07.400]   Boba Fett's real father.
[01:49:07.400 --> 01:49:08.400]   Aha.
[01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:09.000]   You know, like that's the--
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.480]   Ahsoka is getting her own movie.
[01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:12.800]   Ahsoka Tano.
[01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:15.080]   I don't know why.
[01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:16.440]   But it's Rosaria Darcy.
[01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:16.960]   That's why.
[01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:18.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:21.080]   Rangers of the New Republic is coming.
[01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:22.760]   This is all from Eton.
[01:49:22.760 --> 01:49:23.680]   I think I'm just on--
[01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:26.560]   I think this is all Dave Fouloni and Jim--
[01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:28.880]   John Favreau and Dave Fouloni are becoming the Kevin Feighy
[01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:30.960]   of Star Wars and putting together a much more cohesive
[01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:32.440]   plan and series.
[01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:34.440]   Like, they didn't even plan the sequels.
[01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:36.520]   Arguably some of the most important movies of all time.
[01:49:36.520 --> 01:49:37.720]   They had zero plan.
[01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:39.920]   Kevin Feighy had 24 movies mapped out.
[01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:40.920]   We started filming them.
[01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:41.920]   And they didn't have three.
[01:49:41.920 --> 01:49:44.040]   And I think you can see the difference in success levels.
[01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:45.440]   And they're taking that approach now.
[01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:46.520]   Here is Andor.
[01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:49.040]   This was going to be the Rumslag origin story.
[01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:51.800]   But I think they ended up--
[01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:52.520]   It's still could be.
[01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:53.020]   Yeah.
[01:49:53.020 --> 01:49:53.680]   I don't know underneath that.
[01:49:53.680 --> 01:49:54.180]   It's still could be.
[01:49:54.180 --> 01:49:55.120]   Oh my god.
[01:49:55.120 --> 01:49:58.880]   Alex, you have to do a Rumslag sizzle reel.
[01:49:58.880 --> 01:49:59.920]   I do.
[01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:03.200]   You have so many resources to do that so well.
[01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:06.360]   And just like put it up on Reddit on an anonymous account
[01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:06.520]   that--
[01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:10.240]   Oh, I just found this on some server.
[01:50:10.240 --> 01:50:12.760]   I am your father, Boba Fett.
[01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:15.400]   That's how Deadpool got made.
[01:50:15.400 --> 01:50:16.840]   Is it really?
[01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:18.840]   They did a sizzle reel and they made the movie because--
[01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:19.840]   Leaked.
[01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:23.000]   There was a leaked trailer, a quote unquote leaked trailer
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.400]   that got so much buzz that they cleaned with the movie.
[01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:26.720]   Wow.
[01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:27.640]   Wow.
[01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:29.400]   That Ryan Reynolds has never admitted to leaking.
[01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:31.440]   So we only played 10 seconds of that Disney.
[01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:33.520]   Don't get mad at me.
[01:50:33.520 --> 01:50:36.160]   I think they should let you play sizzle freaking reels.
[01:50:36.160 --> 01:50:36.920]   Disney is good.
[01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:38.880]   Warner is traditionally bad.
[01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:39.880]   But Disney is usually--
[01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:40.400]   Come on.
[01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:42.240]   Sizzle reel is an ad.
[01:50:42.240 --> 01:50:43.280]   I'm giving you an ad.
[01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:44.320]   I'm not as fair use.
[01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:44.800]   It's very use.
[01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:47.720]   If you turn off the audio and set it to less than 2/3
[01:50:47.720 --> 01:50:48.840]   of the screen, it probably won't.
[01:50:48.840 --> 01:50:49.880]   Then they don't notice the way.
[01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:53.480]   Obi-Wan Kenobi is coming on Disney+.
[01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:55.240]   It's about time.
[01:50:55.240 --> 01:50:56.520]   With Hayden Christensen.
[01:50:56.520 --> 01:50:58.800]   Oh, not Ewan McGregor?
[01:50:58.800 --> 01:50:59.560]   Oh.
[01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:00.080]   No, no, Ewan--
[01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:00.240]   Both.
[01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:01.200]   They're going to have both.
[01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:01.680]   Anakin.
[01:51:01.680 --> 01:51:04.200]   Older and younger, OK?
[01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:05.720]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:51:05.720 --> 01:51:07.560]   Ewan McGregor is Obi-Wan.
[01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:09.040]   As he was, Obi-Wan.
[01:51:09.040 --> 01:51:12.040]   And Hayden Christensen will be--
[01:51:12.040 --> 01:51:13.240]   Tiny Fistid Vader.
[01:51:13.240 --> 01:51:14.440]   Tiny Fistid Vader.
[01:51:14.440 --> 01:51:16.200]   I like it.
[01:51:16.200 --> 01:51:18.360]   I like it.
[01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:20.280]   I didn't want to give any spoilers.
[01:51:20.280 --> 01:51:24.240]   But for Cry That Lad, what is the statue of limitations?
[01:51:24.240 --> 01:51:25.160]   The acolyte?
[01:51:25.160 --> 01:51:27.040]   Absolutely.
[01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:29.560]   That's from Leslie Hedlund, who is--
[01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:31.440]   I love Russian doll.
[01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:34.000]   I think that's based on their new Republic universe.
[01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.440]   It's not the current timeline, but it's the older stuff.
[01:51:36.440 --> 01:51:37.440]   Yeah.
[01:51:37.440 --> 01:51:39.560]   It's a mystery thriller that will take us into a galaxy
[01:51:39.560 --> 01:51:42.400]   of shadowy secrets and emerging dark-sized power
[01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:45.280]   in the final days of the high republic era.
[01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:48.280]   See, I'm a kind of high republic guy.
[01:51:48.280 --> 01:51:50.440]   Rogue Squaz, I'm going to say--
[01:51:50.440 --> 01:51:52.440]   I like the fashion as well.
[01:51:52.440 --> 01:51:57.800]   The Disney's purchase of Pixar, Lucasfilm, and Marvel
[01:51:57.800 --> 01:52:00.920]   is probably one of the most valuable set of purchases
[01:52:00.920 --> 01:52:02.240]   in the history of media.
[01:52:02.240 --> 01:52:02.840]   Like, it just--
[01:52:02.840 --> 01:52:03.920]   It's amazing.
[01:52:03.920 --> 01:52:06.600]   They're just-- that is a gold mine
[01:52:06.600 --> 01:52:08.200]   that goes all the way to the center of the Earth,
[01:52:08.200 --> 01:52:10.080]   because you can do so much with the stories.
[01:52:10.080 --> 01:52:11.560]   They're all developed.
[01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:12.560]   It's a universe.
[01:52:12.560 --> 01:52:13.560]   It's a real universe.
[01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:14.400]   It's just an universe, yeah.
[01:52:14.400 --> 01:52:14.920]   Unlike the eight--
[01:52:14.920 --> 01:52:15.400]   They bought three--
[01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:16.560]   --the front-to-front properties, which keep getting
[01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:17.800]   resold.
[01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:20.280]   So once a year, we'll do this on May 4th,
[01:52:20.280 --> 01:52:21.360]   and that's it.
[01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:24.280]   That's our star-versed update.
[01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:26.240]   We just made a whole bunch of collectibles
[01:52:26.240 --> 01:52:27.680]   we bought in the past three months.
[01:52:27.680 --> 01:52:28.400]   Tax it up.
[01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:29.520]   Well, thank you very much.
[01:52:29.520 --> 01:52:30.920]   Yeah.
[01:52:30.920 --> 01:52:33.640]   Thank you, federal government, for that tax break.
[01:52:33.640 --> 01:52:35.640]   If Alex gets a show that we're going to break into life
[01:52:35.640 --> 01:52:37.720]   coverage, right?
[01:52:37.720 --> 01:52:38.920]   Hell yeah.
[01:52:38.920 --> 01:52:40.440]   We've got breaking news.
[01:52:40.440 --> 01:52:42.120]   I have to make the rum's leg trailer now.
[01:52:42.120 --> 01:52:43.280]   I'm afraid that we're going to have to--
[01:52:43.280 --> 01:52:44.960]   Please, sizzle reel.
[01:52:44.960 --> 01:52:47.920]   I'll buy a green screen if I can be in your rum's leg drawer.
[01:52:47.920 --> 01:52:52.040]   The best part is my offices sit in the old ILM main stage.
[01:52:52.040 --> 01:52:54.000]   Like they sit not in it, but they sit next--
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:55.080]   they're in the same building.
[01:52:55.080 --> 01:52:56.400]   So I can actually have--
[01:52:56.400 --> 01:52:59.440]   Now I'm telling you for the last time, rum's leg,
[01:52:59.440 --> 01:53:02.280]   you've got a contract with specific terms.
[01:53:02.280 --> 01:53:03.280]   We're going to use your new--
[01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:08.280]   If you kill outside the terms, we do not fulfill the contract.
[01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:10.880]   OK, so if we do it, you guys have
[01:53:10.880 --> 01:53:12.680]   to do voices for some of the characters.
[01:53:12.680 --> 01:53:14.680]   Andy does, for sure.
[01:53:14.680 --> 01:53:16.200]   Andy's made to do this.
[01:53:16.200 --> 01:53:17.200]   Yep.
[01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:18.640]   All right, we'll talk Andy.
[01:53:18.640 --> 01:53:19.800]   We'll talk Andy.
[01:53:19.800 --> 01:53:23.200]   We'll have to work out all the participation.
[01:53:23.200 --> 01:53:25.160]   You know, find your best patience.
[01:53:25.160 --> 01:53:27.280]   Remember, this is a business.
[01:53:27.280 --> 01:53:31.960]   Your feelings do not come into this at all, rum's leg.
[01:53:31.960 --> 01:53:34.400]   And by the way, it's orthodox-easter.
[01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:37.400]   So have a chocolate bunny.
[01:53:37.400 --> 01:53:39.040]   We brace yourselves.
[01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:43.440]   The picks of the week are coming up next.
[01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:47.480]   Starting the picks of the week this week with Renee Ritchie.
[01:53:47.480 --> 01:53:50.160]   What do you got for us?
[01:53:50.160 --> 01:53:53.840]   So my pick of the week is just one of those little things
[01:53:53.840 --> 01:53:56.120]   that you need to fix just so that everything goes back
[01:53:56.120 --> 01:53:57.880]   to being harmonious in the universe.
[01:53:57.880 --> 01:53:58.400]   Yes.
[01:53:58.400 --> 01:53:59.560]   And this is Dbrand.
[01:53:59.560 --> 01:54:02.840]   They have released black bezels for the IMAC.
[01:54:02.840 --> 01:54:05.400]   Because Apple decided to differentiate the new IMAC
[01:54:05.400 --> 01:54:07.840]   by making the bezels not white, but off white.
[01:54:07.840 --> 01:54:08.960]   They're not iPod white.
[01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:13.400]   They are slightly offy whittier than an iPod would be.
[01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:15.520]   And unless people know you have the new one,
[01:54:15.520 --> 01:54:17.280]   and I guess it looks nice and clean,
[01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:20.760]   but if you think like me that bezel should be black,
[01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:23.240]   Dbrand will sell you those black bezels.
[01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:25.480]   And you can apply them to your fancy new IMAC
[01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:28.440]   and restore order to the universe.
[01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:32.400]   You stole my pick because I've been beta testing this product
[01:54:32.400 --> 01:54:34.280]   for the past four months.
[01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:35.640]   And I'm very, very happy with this one.
[01:54:35.640 --> 01:54:39.000]   Andy has some black painter's tape or electrician's tape.
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:40.480]   Well, Dbrand does the cutting for you.
[01:54:40.480 --> 01:54:41.760]   You don't have to be red, green, or ambient.
[01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:42.600]   Oh, that's gaffer's tape.
[01:54:42.600 --> 01:54:44.400]   Like, well, it's actually the expensive stuff.
[01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:45.240]   That's the good stuff.
[01:54:45.240 --> 01:54:45.760]   Exactly.
[01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:47.320]   Well, it is an Apple product, of course.
[01:54:47.320 --> 01:54:47.760]   Yeah.
[01:54:47.760 --> 01:54:49.280]   Apple gaffer tape.
[01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:50.120]   I just know--
[01:54:50.120 --> 01:54:51.520]   I just go big.
[01:54:51.520 --> 01:54:52.240]   Oh, look at that.
[01:54:52.240 --> 01:54:54.120]   That's the wide gaffer tape.
[01:54:54.120 --> 01:54:55.440]   I think Andy's might be better.
[01:54:55.440 --> 01:54:57.600]   I couldn't figure out why I was waving so much.
[01:54:57.600 --> 01:54:59.240]   I think maybe I should have gotten Andy's.
[01:54:59.240 --> 01:55:02.000]   I remember when the trash can mat came out.
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:05.320]   Burke made me a model of the trash can mat
[01:55:05.320 --> 01:55:08.120]   out of six rolls of gaffer's tape,
[01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:09.960]   which we kept around until I found out
[01:55:09.960 --> 01:55:12.000]   how much gaffer's tape costs.
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.520]   It costs almost as much as the max.
[01:55:14.520 --> 01:55:15.440]   I thought I put that much back.
[01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:17.400]   We're taking this body apart.
[01:55:17.400 --> 01:55:19.320]   Not buying it over the Quaker Rooks box.
[01:55:19.320 --> 01:55:21.160]   Holy cow.
[01:55:21.160 --> 01:55:21.760]   Holy cow.
[01:55:21.760 --> 01:55:25.040]   Presumably, when we get the slate-gray iMac Pro,
[01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:26.480]   it will not have a white bezel.
[01:55:26.480 --> 01:55:26.960]   In fact--
[01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:28.760]   Yeah, there's going to be a surcharge for black.
[01:55:28.760 --> 01:55:29.840]   Black is a pro color.
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:31.200]   That's a pro color.
[01:55:31.200 --> 01:55:32.440]   Or how much are the dbrand?
[01:55:32.440 --> 01:55:35.080]   They're actually surprisingly expensive.
[01:55:35.080 --> 01:55:36.120]   They're 50 bucks for the best.
[01:55:36.120 --> 01:55:37.640]   I can't imagine it's a huge order.
[01:55:37.640 --> 01:55:40.200]   It's probably like they whipped this out as fast
[01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:42.440]   and as fast as much as they could.
[01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:46.200]   If you want the entire body, it's $500, man.
[01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:49.200]   Now I know why Marquez Brownlee's getting the good money.
[01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:49.800]   Whoo.
[01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:50.320]   Yes.
[01:55:50.320 --> 01:55:51.080]   Man.
[01:55:51.080 --> 01:55:52.040]   The dbrand money.
[01:55:52.040 --> 01:55:54.240]   Holy cow.
[01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:56.600]   Three-quarters of that goes to Marquez.
[01:55:56.600 --> 01:55:59.240]   Andy and Ico, your pick of the week.
[01:55:59.240 --> 01:56:01.880]   Well, again, Renee stole my pick of the week.
[01:56:01.880 --> 01:56:05.440]   So I thought I'd show off of a cassette player
[01:56:05.440 --> 01:56:07.640]   that I've been looking for for the past couple of years
[01:56:07.640 --> 01:56:10.600]   because it's just like when the coolest designs I've ever seen.
[01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:17.000]   This is the General Electric G3700 from 1967.
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:20.560]   And it's bright, bright orange with a white handle.
[01:56:20.560 --> 01:56:25.520]   It's got this amazing logo on it of West World
[01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:28.480]   because this was part of an entire line of--
[01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:30.480]   That is, this the West World logo.
[01:56:30.480 --> 01:56:31.200]   Almost.
[01:56:31.200 --> 01:56:32.200]   Almost.
[01:56:32.200 --> 01:56:33.360]   Exactly.
[01:56:33.360 --> 01:56:36.000]   Because GE, like in 1967, realized--
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:37.440]   it's actually part of history, I think,
[01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:39.840]   because this is when GE realized that, hey, wait,
[01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:41.400]   there are kids who are intertechnology
[01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:43.080]   and into music and stuff.
[01:56:43.080 --> 01:56:45.320]   Let's make a line of music players and stuff that
[01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:48.120]   are for this youth generation, so to speak.
[01:56:48.120 --> 01:56:51.400]   But also, I legitimately think this is just terrific design.
[01:56:51.400 --> 01:56:55.400]   So the handle is actually part of the door loading mechanism.
[01:56:55.400 --> 01:56:58.040]   So to put a tape in, you lower the handle like this.
[01:56:58.040 --> 01:56:59.040]   Oh, clever.
[01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:01.840]   That exposes the cassette.
[01:57:01.840 --> 01:57:03.320]   Actually, I brought this in eBay, of course.
[01:57:03.320 --> 01:57:05.000]   It came with a carpenter's cassette.
[01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:06.640]   So that's my difficulty for you.
[01:57:06.640 --> 01:57:09.840]   You've only just begun.
[01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:11.800]   And so because this isn't a recorder,
[01:57:11.800 --> 01:57:12.720]   all it is is has like one--
[01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:14.880]   Stop or play.
[01:57:14.880 --> 01:57:15.680]   But it's a rocker.
[01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:16.200]   That's nice.
[01:57:16.200 --> 01:57:18.360]   It's a rocker switch big, big play.
[01:57:18.360 --> 01:57:20.160]   That's well designed.
[01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:21.360]   Well, well, get this.
[01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:23.960]   I didn't get this until I actually got it.
[01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:24.440]   Guess what?
[01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:27.720]   So we already established that you have to lift up
[01:57:27.720 --> 01:57:31.040]   the handle to lower the handle to get at the cassette.
[01:57:31.040 --> 01:57:33.280]   So when you lower the handle all the way,
[01:57:33.280 --> 01:57:37.120]   it actually clicks the stop.
[01:57:37.120 --> 01:57:38.160]   Oh, no, you can get that.
[01:57:38.160 --> 01:57:41.640]   That is one of the most clever, just simple ideas I have ever seen.
[01:57:41.640 --> 01:57:42.640]   That's really nicely done.
[01:57:42.640 --> 01:57:43.720]   Somebody thought about that.
[01:57:43.720 --> 01:57:44.760]   This is almost exactly.
[01:57:44.760 --> 01:57:46.400]   This is like extremely good.
[01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:48.240]   If we could just make it out of machine aluminum,
[01:57:48.240 --> 01:57:49.480]   I would buy one.
[01:57:49.480 --> 01:57:50.800]   Yeah, we could be talking about--
[01:57:50.800 --> 01:57:51.840]   Yeah, we could be talking about--
[01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:52.840]   Yeah.
[01:57:52.840 --> 01:57:53.320]   Yeah.
[01:57:53.320 --> 01:57:54.600]   And so, yeah, when I saw--
[01:57:54.600 --> 01:57:57.560]   I originally saw this in an ad--
[01:57:57.560 --> 01:57:58.040]   Here it is.
[01:57:58.040 --> 01:57:58.680]   A couple of years ago.
[01:57:58.680 --> 01:58:02.640]   Your master of ceremonies playing the gang's favorite music
[01:58:02.640 --> 01:58:07.080]   and stories on GE's handy battery operated tape player.
[01:58:07.080 --> 01:58:09.760]   Just pop in the pre-recorded tape cartridges.
[01:58:09.760 --> 01:58:14.760]   Visit your GE man soon.
[01:58:14.760 --> 01:58:16.760]   Apparently, they thought that was hip with the kids
[01:58:16.760 --> 01:58:19.120]   to put the word man in there inappropriately.
[01:58:19.120 --> 01:58:22.840]   Your GE man soon, just 1995.
[01:58:22.840 --> 01:58:27.040]   This is-- hey, this isn't like your dad's general electric man.
[01:58:27.040 --> 01:58:29.080]   Slightly higher in the southwest.
[01:58:29.080 --> 01:58:30.840]   Your parents probably wouldn't understand
[01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:33.160]   this compact cassette player, because this wasn't intended--
[01:58:33.160 --> 01:58:36.440]   Depending on terrain and conditions.
[01:58:36.440 --> 01:58:39.440]   This is made by the general electric radio receiver
[01:58:39.440 --> 01:58:42.800]   department, Utica, New York.
[01:58:42.800 --> 01:58:46.520]   We're also making bomb mechanisms for radio bomb mechanism.
[01:58:46.520 --> 01:58:47.400]   He was a very rare person.
[01:58:47.400 --> 01:58:52.200]   But yeah, we took the cost of $20 in 1967
[01:58:52.200 --> 01:58:54.600]   and this equaled $160 today.
[01:58:54.600 --> 01:58:57.360]   I got it for substantially less than that.
[01:58:57.360 --> 01:59:00.520]   But if you go on eBay for them, it's such a cool--
[01:59:00.520 --> 01:59:17.700]   Rep
[01:59:17.700 --> 01:59:22.700]   also like C-Mobile.
[01:59:22.700 --> 01:59:24.900]   Although, what kind of battery is it up?
[01:59:24.900 --> 01:59:26.220]   It takes four--
[01:59:26.220 --> 01:59:27.380]   Comphem-- four--
[01:59:27.380 --> 01:59:28.380]   D-cells, probably.
[01:59:28.380 --> 01:59:29.380]   C-cells.
[01:59:29.380 --> 01:59:31.220]   D-cells, right.
[01:59:31.220 --> 01:59:31.740]   But--
[01:59:31.740 --> 01:59:33.580]   Which means-- by the way, that adds four pounds
[01:59:33.580 --> 01:59:35.660]   to the weight of the thing.
[01:59:35.660 --> 01:59:40.500]   And also means it's got a cost like $8 to run it
[01:59:40.500 --> 01:59:42.220]   for two hours at a time.
[01:59:42.220 --> 01:59:43.380]   So yeah.
[01:59:43.380 --> 01:59:44.580]   But yeah, everything about this--
[01:59:44.580 --> 01:59:47.700]   By the way, that's $100 in 1966.
[01:59:47.700 --> 01:59:48.260]   That's exactly--
[01:59:48.260 --> 01:59:48.980]   Holy cow.
[01:59:48.980 --> 01:59:53.940]   The GE master of ceremonies.
[01:59:53.940 --> 01:59:57.620]   I have been the life of every party ever since this arrived.
[01:59:57.620 --> 02:00:01.420]   All my peers have been showing up for sock hops
[02:00:01.420 --> 02:00:04.220]   and the ladies gather around and do not
[02:00:04.220 --> 02:00:08.460]   go as he plays master of ceremonies.
[02:00:08.460 --> 02:00:09.900]   Are the hickeys showing up on camera?
[02:00:09.900 --> 02:00:12.300]   Because oh my god, the hickeys I've been getting
[02:00:12.300 --> 02:00:14.420]   since the word has spread in the neighborhood.
[02:00:14.420 --> 02:00:15.260]   I have this ad.
[02:00:15.260 --> 02:00:16.540]   Is this from a comic book?
[02:00:16.540 --> 02:00:18.060]   Where did you find this?
[02:00:18.060 --> 02:00:19.660]   It is from a comic book.
[02:00:19.660 --> 02:00:23.300]   I was reading like old online comics and found this.
[02:00:23.300 --> 02:00:24.180]   And yeah.
[02:00:24.180 --> 02:00:25.940]   Now you had to have it.
[02:00:25.940 --> 02:00:28.740]   By the way, I don't know why, but it's slightly higher cost
[02:00:28.740 --> 02:00:31.700]   in the south and the west.
[02:00:31.700 --> 02:00:32.180]   It's like--
[02:00:32.180 --> 02:00:34.620]   Well, it costs us more to ship it, I guess.
[02:00:34.620 --> 02:00:35.180]   I don't know.
[02:00:35.180 --> 02:00:36.620]   Maybe.
[02:00:36.620 --> 02:00:37.620]   Oh, yeah.
[02:00:37.620 --> 02:00:38.180]   Also, I love the--
[02:00:38.180 --> 02:00:39.180]   By white and screen.
[02:00:39.180 --> 02:00:39.540]   I love 1967.
[02:00:39.540 --> 02:00:40.900]   They weren't about the Vietnam War.
[02:00:40.900 --> 02:00:42.180]   I hadn't really gotten out yet.
[02:00:42.180 --> 02:00:44.980]   So they got-- one of the panel above it is like this kid.
[02:00:44.980 --> 02:00:46.540]   Like, hey, look, I'm in the war.
[02:00:46.540 --> 02:00:48.500]   And I'm in the jungle with my walkie talkie.
[02:00:48.500 --> 02:00:49.620]   You're a squad leader.
[02:00:49.620 --> 02:00:52.500]   Calling up reserves via Geez, walkie talkie.
[02:00:52.500 --> 02:00:55.620]   Has Morse code printed right on it.
[02:00:55.620 --> 02:00:56.420]   That didn't age well.
[02:00:56.420 --> 02:00:59.420]   And a 48-inch whip antenna.
[02:00:59.420 --> 02:01:02.100]   Holy cow, that's four feet.
[02:01:02.100 --> 02:01:04.180]   Range up to one third mile, depending
[02:01:04.180 --> 02:01:05.620]   on terrain and conditions.
[02:01:05.620 --> 02:01:06.660]   Again, it's like millimeter wave.
[02:01:06.660 --> 02:01:08.580]   You have to be a direct line of sight.
[02:01:08.580 --> 02:01:11.180]   That's kind of four foot antenna.
[02:01:11.180 --> 02:01:14.660]   That's a powerful quarter wide transmitter there.
[02:01:14.660 --> 02:01:16.780]   You don't want to miss around.
[02:01:16.780 --> 02:01:19.100]   All right, I thought, wow, that's great.
[02:01:19.100 --> 02:01:19.900]   That's great.
[02:01:19.900 --> 02:01:21.340]   That was one quarter of an Alex.
[02:01:21.340 --> 02:01:24.140]   And now, ladies and gentlemen, the actual Alex Lindsey.
[02:01:24.140 --> 02:01:25.660]   Before you give your pick of the week,
[02:01:25.660 --> 02:01:28.860]   I do want to mention I'm going to be on office hours on Thursday,
[02:01:28.860 --> 02:01:29.460]   right?
[02:01:29.460 --> 02:01:29.780]   Yeah.
[02:01:29.780 --> 02:01:31.260]   Let's see who's attracted that now.
[02:01:31.260 --> 02:01:32.700]   No, no, we've already told everybody.
[02:01:32.700 --> 02:01:33.940]   So if you don't show up, I'll look back.
[02:01:33.940 --> 02:01:34.180]   I will be there.
[02:01:34.180 --> 02:01:36.700]   What time?
[02:01:36.700 --> 02:01:40.620]   Well, we would love to have you come on it for the mic check at 640.
[02:01:40.620 --> 02:01:41.860]   8 o'clock is when we'll have you come on.
[02:01:41.860 --> 02:01:43.180]   I'll be there at 640.
[02:01:43.180 --> 02:01:45.540]   No, I want to do whatever you tell me to do 640.
[02:01:45.540 --> 02:01:47.020]   You just come on and just do the mic check.
[02:01:47.020 --> 02:01:48.740]   And then you can turn off your camera or whatever.
[02:01:48.740 --> 02:01:50.420]   I'll play Valentine for a couple hours.
[02:01:50.420 --> 02:01:51.980]   And then come back at 8 o'clock.
[02:01:51.980 --> 02:01:55.340]   8 o'clock on we'll be talking to you about.
[02:01:55.340 --> 02:01:55.820]   Should be fun.
[02:01:55.820 --> 02:01:58.420]   Club, Twitch, and podcasting, and whatever else
[02:01:58.420 --> 02:01:59.260]   people ask questions about.
[02:01:59.260 --> 02:02:00.700]   You know ours is just questions.
[02:02:00.700 --> 02:02:04.980]   So it's youtube.com/AlexLindsay for the--
[02:02:04.980 --> 02:02:07.900]   does that one get recorded or is this like the last one I did?
[02:02:07.900 --> 02:02:09.020]   I'm going to just--
[02:02:09.020 --> 02:02:09.740]   No, it's recorded.
[02:02:09.740 --> 02:02:10.220]   OK.
[02:02:10.220 --> 02:02:11.220]   OK.
[02:02:11.220 --> 02:02:12.220]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:02:12.220 --> 02:02:13.220]   Because the last one wasn't, right?
[02:02:13.220 --> 02:02:14.420]   I was just-- you had to be there.
[02:02:14.420 --> 02:02:16.020]   We-- so yeah, we--
[02:02:16.020 --> 02:02:17.340]   so one of the things that we had to do
[02:02:17.340 --> 02:02:19.340]   is we had to kind of get the critical mass.
[02:02:19.340 --> 02:02:22.660]   And so streaming it was not going to help us get that.
[02:02:22.660 --> 02:02:25.380]   Because everything about office hours is conversation.
[02:02:25.380 --> 02:02:26.740]   Yeah, you want people in there.
[02:02:26.740 --> 02:02:27.660]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:02:27.660 --> 02:02:30.980]   And now that we've gotten to the point where just a lot of people
[02:02:30.980 --> 02:02:32.980]   show up because they want to be part of that conversation,
[02:02:32.980 --> 02:02:35.260]   both on YouTube and in Zoom.
[02:02:35.260 --> 02:02:39.260]   So we've got total uniques.
[02:02:39.260 --> 02:02:40.740]   It's like 400 to 600 people a day.
[02:02:40.740 --> 02:02:44.340]   And then it usually runs about 300 concurrent.
[02:02:44.340 --> 02:02:47.060]   So it's pretty-- it'll be more on Thursday
[02:02:47.060 --> 02:02:47.580]   when you show up.
[02:02:47.580 --> 02:02:51.700]   The last time we almost ran out of seats in office hours.
[02:02:51.700 --> 02:02:52.580]   So it should be--
[02:02:52.580 --> 02:02:54.860]   Ryan Rood says, I should stay for the first hour
[02:02:54.860 --> 02:02:55.700]   and answer questions.
[02:02:55.700 --> 02:02:58.220]   So I'll get in there and I'll try not to be groggy.
[02:02:58.220 --> 02:03:00.380]   I'll have coffee.
[02:03:00.380 --> 02:03:02.660]   But before we-- now that we've said that,
[02:03:02.660 --> 02:03:04.780]   let's talk about your pick of the week.
[02:03:04.780 --> 02:03:08.980]   Well, actually, we just had these folks on yesterday
[02:03:08.980 --> 02:03:09.820]   in office hours.
[02:03:09.820 --> 02:03:11.180]   And so if you want to see a longer one,
[02:03:11.180 --> 02:03:12.780]   you can actually go to office hours yesterday and see it.
[02:03:12.780 --> 02:03:14.300]   But this is from FX Home.
[02:03:14.300 --> 02:03:16.700]   And they've been around for-- I didn't realize 20 years
[02:03:16.700 --> 02:03:21.340]   making software that is really designed around making
[02:03:21.340 --> 02:03:22.300]   visual effects.
[02:03:22.300 --> 02:03:25.140]   And so it's called HitFilm and HitFilm Pro,
[02:03:25.140 --> 02:03:26.660]   or HitFilm Express and HitFilm Pro.
[02:03:26.660 --> 02:03:31.340]   But what they have out that's really cool is CamTrack AR.
[02:03:31.340 --> 02:03:34.660]   So what CamTrack AR does is let you bring--
[02:03:34.660 --> 02:03:39.660]   you can actually bring in USDZ models
[02:03:39.660 --> 02:03:41.460]   and then drop them into a scene.
[02:03:41.460 --> 02:03:42.540]   You just put up your camera.
[02:03:42.540 --> 02:03:45.380]   And if you've got the tracking, if you've got the LiDAR,
[02:03:45.380 --> 02:03:47.060]   it'll actually grab onto the scene.
[02:03:47.060 --> 02:03:48.580]   You can throw your model in.
[02:03:48.580 --> 02:03:51.660]   And you can-- if you had someone-- you can basically
[02:03:51.660 --> 02:03:56.020]   create moves around that and see it tracked into the scene.
[02:03:56.020 --> 02:03:57.980]   But it'll also save that data out.
[02:03:57.980 --> 02:04:00.340]   So you can export it out to their own software HitFilm,
[02:04:00.340 --> 02:04:02.020]   but also to After Effects.
[02:04:02.020 --> 02:04:03.820]   And they told us yesterday they're
[02:04:03.820 --> 02:04:06.060]   working on an export to motion.
[02:04:06.060 --> 02:04:09.860]   And so there's a lot of really cool effects
[02:04:09.860 --> 02:04:13.700]   that you can set up and then-- especially for PreViz.
[02:04:13.700 --> 02:04:16.300]   So if you're doing a fan film, or if you're getting started,
[02:04:16.300 --> 02:04:17.740]   you want to do have some fun on TikTok,
[02:04:17.740 --> 02:04:18.780]   you want to do that kind of thing.
[02:04:18.780 --> 02:04:20.220]   Or if you're doing PreViz--
[02:04:20.220 --> 02:04:22.540]   Or doing the Rumslig sizzle reel.
[02:04:22.540 --> 02:04:24.300]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[02:04:24.300 --> 02:04:28.580]   So it's an incredible application.
[02:04:28.580 --> 02:04:32.340]   And so a lot of us are playing with it as--
[02:04:32.340 --> 02:04:34.620]   and it's evolving very fast right now
[02:04:34.620 --> 02:04:38.020]   because it's connected right to the AR system.
[02:04:38.020 --> 02:04:40.780]   And the fact that they're bringing in USDZ
[02:04:40.780 --> 02:04:45.540]   and managing the AR and exporting motion data out
[02:04:45.540 --> 02:04:47.780]   is a really, really interesting app
[02:04:47.780 --> 02:04:52.700]   to check out for pre-visualization, effects for your home
[02:04:52.700 --> 02:04:55.060]   stuff, even corporate where you want to have a little bit
[02:04:55.060 --> 02:04:57.340]   of an edge or education of your teacher.
[02:04:57.340 --> 02:04:58.420]   And you want to do something that's
[02:04:58.420 --> 02:05:02.060]   a little bit more fun than what you can do with it.
[02:05:02.060 --> 02:05:03.980]   With just the basic apps.
[02:05:03.980 --> 02:05:04.660]   It's pretty cool.
[02:05:04.660 --> 02:05:07.740]   So we had them on.
[02:05:07.740 --> 02:05:09.740]   Josh showed it to us yesterday.
[02:05:09.740 --> 02:05:13.460]   And we were really impressed.
[02:05:13.460 --> 02:05:16.380]   I think a lot of us went all in and got it.
[02:05:16.380 --> 02:05:19.860]   So featured in the spring-loaded event, apparently.
[02:05:19.860 --> 02:05:24.780]   Camtract AR, 3D tracking video capture from FX Home Limited.
[02:05:24.780 --> 02:05:26.900]   It's free with an app purchases.
[02:05:26.900 --> 02:05:29.620]   iPhone and iPad.
[02:05:29.620 --> 02:05:35.500]   And he did mention that the new iPad might be really fast.
[02:05:35.500 --> 02:05:37.740]   Oh, oh.
[02:05:37.740 --> 02:05:38.700]   Yeah, he would know, right?
[02:05:38.700 --> 02:05:41.700]   I mean, he would see the performance difference.
[02:05:41.700 --> 02:05:43.420]   He'd know intimately.
[02:05:43.420 --> 02:05:44.700]   Very interesting.
[02:05:44.700 --> 02:05:47.940]   Obviously, you'd have to have a LIDAR equipped device.
[02:05:47.940 --> 02:05:49.180]   It will do it.
[02:05:49.180 --> 02:05:51.700]   I think it'll actually do it with parallax.
[02:05:51.700 --> 02:05:53.460]   But it will do better with the LIDAR.
[02:05:53.460 --> 02:05:54.380]   It'll snap in fast.
[02:05:54.380 --> 02:05:56.100]   You have to move the screen back and forth.
[02:05:56.100 --> 02:05:57.620]   I was like this to get it.
[02:05:57.620 --> 02:05:58.380]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:05:58.380 --> 02:05:59.340]   I played with it.
[02:05:59.340 --> 02:06:00.460]   Well, just to get started, because it just
[02:06:00.460 --> 02:06:01.380]   has to know where it's at.
[02:06:01.380 --> 02:06:03.620]   But I played with it, and I couldn't believe how good
[02:06:03.620 --> 02:06:04.300]   the tracks were.
[02:06:04.300 --> 02:06:05.940]   I mean, the tracks were just spot on.
[02:06:05.940 --> 02:06:07.580]   It was just grabbing onto things and then sticking.
[02:06:07.580 --> 02:06:09.300]   That's the big thing is it's sliding
[02:06:09.300 --> 02:06:10.060]   against the background.
[02:06:10.060 --> 02:06:13.980]   And it's exceptionally good at sticking to it.
[02:06:13.980 --> 02:06:17.660]   Because of the LIDAR, it's getting a lot of really good data.
[02:06:17.660 --> 02:06:20.180]   Ladies and gentlemen, I hope the May the 4th
[02:06:20.180 --> 02:06:21.460]   has been wonderful to you.
[02:06:21.460 --> 02:06:27.260]   I know it's been great to rum-slag in his band of outlaws.
[02:06:27.260 --> 02:06:29.300]   Oh, no, he's a good guy, right?
[02:06:29.300 --> 02:06:30.580]   Are batting under his good guys?
[02:06:30.580 --> 02:06:31.700]   No, he's not a good guy.
[02:06:31.700 --> 02:06:32.580]   He's not a good guy.
[02:06:32.580 --> 02:06:33.500]   Well, here's the deal.
[02:06:33.500 --> 02:06:35.420]   Rumslag, I think, is misunderstood.
[02:06:35.420 --> 02:06:37.980]   You know, I think that he had a hard life,
[02:06:37.980 --> 02:06:40.140]   and he's a little edgy.
[02:06:40.140 --> 02:06:42.500]   Kind of, he's a little like Boba Fett in that sense.
[02:06:42.500 --> 02:06:42.980]   He's a little edgy.
[02:06:42.980 --> 02:06:43.460]   Little edgy.
[02:06:43.460 --> 02:06:44.180]   He's misunderstood.
[02:06:44.180 --> 02:06:45.740]   There's been some stuff that he's done that might have been
[02:06:45.740 --> 02:06:46.740]   a little shady.
[02:06:46.740 --> 02:06:48.380]   He might have shot first a couple of times.
[02:06:48.380 --> 02:06:49.220]   Is that what you're saying?
[02:06:49.220 --> 02:06:50.900]   Yeah, or almost all the time.
[02:06:50.900 --> 02:06:54.220]   And so it's a little--
[02:06:54.220 --> 02:06:56.580]   I've got four different contracts out there.
[02:06:56.580 --> 02:06:57.540]   You're right now.
[02:06:57.540 --> 02:06:59.820]   But why is it that no one can destroy you
[02:06:59.820 --> 02:07:02.740]   as much as you destroy yourself?
[02:07:02.740 --> 02:07:05.220]   You got a higher ante for the sizzle reel I'm telling you.
[02:07:05.220 --> 02:07:08.500]   It's almost as if you've got some sort of secret burden
[02:07:08.500 --> 02:07:12.060]   on your emotional toll that we could buy out for three seasons.
[02:07:12.060 --> 02:07:14.340]   Is he a Scot's Russian or a Russian Scot's?
[02:07:14.340 --> 02:07:15.180]   That's what I'm confused.
[02:07:15.180 --> 02:07:15.860]   Exactly.
[02:07:15.860 --> 02:07:18.380]   I keep my origins close to the rest.
[02:07:18.380 --> 02:07:20.820]   I do not tell.
[02:07:20.820 --> 02:07:22.820]   Once people know your secrets, they
[02:07:22.820 --> 02:07:25.420]   know how to make you die.
[02:07:25.420 --> 02:07:25.900]   That's it.
[02:07:25.900 --> 02:07:29.620]   There are not many people my age in this position, Mr. Leo.
[02:07:29.620 --> 02:07:33.380]   I will give you $5 if you use that voice and WGBH this week.
[02:07:33.380 --> 02:07:35.420]   I'm just saying.
[02:07:35.420 --> 02:07:36.420]   I'm just saying.
[02:07:36.420 --> 02:07:37.820]   Actually, it's public broadcasting,
[02:07:37.820 --> 02:07:39.580]   so that might actually be a good percentage
[02:07:39.580 --> 02:07:41.580]   but for me.
[02:07:41.580 --> 02:07:43.740]   When will you be on next?
[02:07:43.740 --> 02:07:49.260]   Friday at 1, I will start doing my vocalizations.
[02:07:49.260 --> 02:07:51.620]   I'll just-- Alex and I will start
[02:07:51.620 --> 02:07:53.020]   workshopping things a little bit.
[02:07:53.020 --> 02:07:53.460]   So just--
[02:07:53.460 --> 02:07:54.460]   Yeah.
[02:07:54.460 --> 02:07:54.960]   Yeah.
[02:07:54.960 --> 02:07:55.780]   We're working on that.
[02:07:55.780 --> 02:07:58.180]   You must understand about the European Union
[02:07:58.180 --> 02:08:03.460]   is that they're very proactive about marketplaces.
[02:08:03.460 --> 02:08:06.820]   Oh, so was there ability to influence most?
[02:08:06.820 --> 02:08:08.780]   This is the part you were born to play, Andy.
[02:08:08.780 --> 02:08:09.300]   I don't know.
[02:08:09.300 --> 02:08:10.820]   I don't know how you missed you.
[02:08:10.820 --> 02:08:11.340]   Thank you.
[02:08:11.340 --> 02:08:12.660]   I didn't want to come out and say it.
[02:08:12.660 --> 02:08:14.140]   You don't even, frankly, you need--
[02:08:14.140 --> 02:08:15.100]   Now that it's out there--
[02:08:15.100 --> 02:08:16.220]   Make up or costume change.
[02:08:16.220 --> 02:08:19.020]   You're just-- you're ready to play.
[02:08:19.020 --> 02:08:20.020]   OK.
[02:08:20.020 --> 02:08:23.420]   If that gets me the job, I won't be insulted by Alex.
[02:08:23.420 --> 02:08:25.940]   Lindsay, he's the guy doing the hiring.
[02:08:25.940 --> 02:08:30.780]   Alex is, of course, the guy at 0900.media.
[02:08:30.780 --> 02:08:32.820]   He's also the head of office hours.
[02:08:32.820 --> 02:08:34.620]   I don't know where he spends most of his time.
[02:08:34.620 --> 02:08:35.740]   I think it's on office hours.
[02:08:35.740 --> 02:08:38.220]   If you want to know more, follow him on Twitter,
[02:08:38.220 --> 02:08:43.060]   a-l-e-x-l-i-n-d-s-a-y or go to youtube.com/AlexLinz.
[02:08:43.060 --> 02:08:43.060]   Yeah.
[02:08:43.060 --> 02:08:45.020]   And it all happens first thing in the morning specifically
[02:08:45.020 --> 02:08:45.620]   because I go to work.
[02:08:45.620 --> 02:08:46.780]   Because then you go to work.
[02:08:46.780 --> 02:08:47.780]   Like it just like--
[02:08:47.780 --> 02:08:48.780]   It all--
[02:08:48.780 --> 02:08:48.780]   It's amazing.
[02:08:48.780 --> 02:08:50.220]   Everyone's like, why is it so early?
[02:08:50.220 --> 02:08:52.380]   It's because I have meetings at nine.
[02:08:52.380 --> 02:08:53.820]   Like, I go to the side.
[02:08:53.820 --> 02:08:54.740]   You get out of there at nine.
[02:08:54.740 --> 02:08:56.820]   You know you're going to be done.
[02:08:56.820 --> 02:08:57.340]   Yeah.
[02:08:57.340 --> 02:08:58.300]   Yeah.
[02:08:58.300 --> 02:09:00.620]   I think it's good to have a morning show.
[02:09:00.620 --> 02:09:03.460]   And by the way, you guys also have an excellent Discord.
[02:09:03.460 --> 02:09:07.020]   We modeled money of our Discord features on yours.
[02:09:07.020 --> 02:09:09.380]   It's a pretty amazing community.
[02:09:09.380 --> 02:09:09.900]   Yeah.
[02:09:09.900 --> 02:09:10.900]   That's there.
[02:09:10.900 --> 02:09:12.020]   I do like Discord.
[02:09:12.020 --> 02:09:15.420]   I really feel like Discord is--
[02:09:15.420 --> 02:09:18.060]   I've learned a lot from you and others using it.
[02:09:18.060 --> 02:09:21.740]   And it really is a great, powerful platform.
[02:09:21.740 --> 02:09:24.340]   I think it's the future of social, frankly.
[02:09:24.340 --> 02:09:28.540]   Look at all the categories you guys have for your Discord.
[02:09:28.540 --> 02:09:29.620]   And we make it very hard.
[02:09:29.620 --> 02:09:31.540]   It's not easy to get into our Discord.
[02:09:31.540 --> 02:09:34.380]   You can't do something easy to pay for it.
[02:09:34.380 --> 02:09:39.900]   You have to show up at 6.40 AM to when we do the--
[02:09:39.900 --> 02:09:40.660]   we put it out.
[02:09:40.660 --> 02:09:42.060]   And it only lasts a half an hour.
[02:09:42.060 --> 02:09:42.740]   You don't like it this way.
[02:09:42.740 --> 02:09:43.780]   And you have to be there.
[02:09:43.780 --> 02:09:47.700]   You have to-- there's very strict rules about your avatar.
[02:09:47.700 --> 02:09:48.380]   Oh, yeah.
[02:09:48.380 --> 02:09:49.020]   You have that.
[02:09:49.020 --> 02:09:51.180]   Anyway, I would--
[02:09:51.180 --> 02:09:53.740]   I can always tell who's in our club
[02:09:53.740 --> 02:09:57.420]   to it that is from your server because they have their first name
[02:09:57.420 --> 02:10:00.260]   space, last name dash location.
[02:10:00.260 --> 02:10:03.100]   And they have an avatar with a white background.
[02:10:03.100 --> 02:10:05.780]   And that's like the secret handshake all over Discord.
[02:10:05.780 --> 02:10:08.260]   It's totally, totally-- it's like a giveaway.
[02:10:08.260 --> 02:10:10.260]   It's the giveaway.
[02:10:10.260 --> 02:10:11.500]   Your gang colors.
[02:10:11.500 --> 02:10:12.460]   Yeah.
[02:10:12.460 --> 02:10:13.780]   It's pretty funny.
[02:10:13.780 --> 02:10:15.540]   And then, of course, there's Renee Richie.
[02:10:15.540 --> 02:10:16.900]   We love you Renee.
[02:10:16.900 --> 02:10:19.660]   He's at youtube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[02:10:19.660 --> 02:10:23.260]   He does a great show also on YouTube with Georgia Dow.
[02:10:23.260 --> 02:10:25.300]   It's called Apple Talk.
[02:10:25.300 --> 02:10:27.940]   What are you working on these days?
[02:10:27.940 --> 02:10:29.980]   Oh, I just did two Silicon videos back to back.
[02:10:29.980 --> 02:10:32.540]   One, explaining the difference between an M1X,
[02:10:32.540 --> 02:10:34.620]   a theoretical M1X, and an M2.
[02:10:34.620 --> 02:10:37.500]   And then one, explaining how Apple put an M1 into the iPhone
[02:10:37.500 --> 02:10:39.460]   because I got so many questions about that.
[02:10:39.460 --> 02:10:40.620]   Oh, interesting.
[02:10:40.620 --> 02:10:41.300]   The iPhone?
[02:10:41.300 --> 02:10:43.020]   You mean the iPad?
[02:10:43.020 --> 02:10:44.660]   No.
[02:10:44.660 --> 02:10:46.660]   Where's Apple putting the M1 in the iPhone?
[02:10:46.660 --> 02:10:47.900]   When's Apple putting the M1 in the iPhone?
[02:10:47.900 --> 02:10:50.700]   Like, they put the M1 Jr. in the iPhone last October.
[02:10:50.700 --> 02:10:51.860]   You can go get one right now.
[02:10:51.860 --> 02:10:52.700]   You're good.
[02:10:52.700 --> 02:10:54.700]   Yeah, that's the really interesting point
[02:10:54.700 --> 02:10:58.220]   is that the M1 is the A14X, right?
[02:10:58.220 --> 02:10:58.900]   It's the same--
[02:10:58.900 --> 02:10:59.740]   Yes.
[02:10:59.740 --> 02:11:00.260]   So--
[02:11:00.260 --> 02:11:01.660]   It's a few of Mac specific things.
[02:11:01.660 --> 02:11:05.060]   It's just they decided to name it the M1 and the iPad.
[02:11:05.060 --> 02:11:08.260]   And you'll get that in your next iPhone, right?
[02:11:08.260 --> 02:11:10.180]   I guess, or something like that.
[02:11:10.180 --> 02:11:12.620]   Now, when the iPhone has two thunderbolt ports
[02:11:12.620 --> 02:11:15.140]   at 16 gigs of RAM, that's when I'm going to sit up and take--
[02:11:15.140 --> 02:11:17.220]   They're getting good at all the ports.
[02:11:17.220 --> 02:11:18.420]   They're taking them all away from you.
[02:11:18.420 --> 02:11:19.180]   Thank you, Renee.
[02:11:19.180 --> 02:11:20.460]   Thank you all for joining us.
[02:11:20.460 --> 02:11:23.340]   We do Mac Break Weekly on a Tuesday morning for me.
[02:11:23.340 --> 02:11:24.540]   It might be afternoon for you.
[02:11:24.540 --> 02:11:29.460]   It's 11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern, 1,800 UTC.
[02:11:29.460 --> 02:11:32.660]   So it's the evening around London.
[02:11:32.660 --> 02:11:34.340]   All you have to do to watch us do it live
[02:11:34.340 --> 02:11:37.060]   is go to twit.tv/live.
[02:11:37.060 --> 02:11:38.380]   There's live audio and video there.
[02:11:38.380 --> 02:11:43.140]   If you're watching live, chat with us live at irc.tv.
[02:11:43.140 --> 02:11:44.860]   Always there, always free.
[02:11:44.860 --> 02:11:48.980]   There's an on-demand community forum, if you will,
[02:11:48.980 --> 02:11:50.980]   at www.twit.community.
[02:11:50.980 --> 02:11:54.460]   There's also a Mastodon instance, a twit.social.
[02:11:54.460 --> 02:11:55.740]   We keep talking about that Discord.
[02:11:55.740 --> 02:11:57.860]   That's part of Club Twit.
[02:11:57.860 --> 02:12:00.820]   If you want to support our shows and get
[02:12:00.820 --> 02:12:02.940]   ad-free versions of them, join us in the Discord
[02:12:02.940 --> 02:12:06.780]   plus get a special feed of cutting room floor stuff,

[02:12:08.580 --> 02:12:11.460]   All you have to do is go to twit.tv/clubtwit
[02:12:11.460 --> 02:12:13.700]   to sign up $7 a month.
[02:12:13.700 --> 02:12:14.700]   It really helps us.
[02:12:14.700 --> 02:12:15.700]   We appreciate the support.
[02:12:15.700 --> 02:12:16.860]   Thank you very much.
[02:12:16.860 --> 02:12:19.380]   And I think it's a pretty fun place to be.
[02:12:19.380 --> 02:12:21.700]   Our website is twit.tv.
[02:12:21.700 --> 02:12:25.140]   I think I might have mentioned that the web address
[02:12:25.140 --> 02:12:28.540]   for Macbreak Weekly is twit.tv/mbw.
[02:12:28.540 --> 02:12:30.260]   When you get there, you'll notice also a link
[02:12:30.260 --> 02:12:31.340]   to our YouTube channel.
[02:12:31.340 --> 02:12:33.980]   There's a whole Macbreak with the YouTube channel.
[02:12:33.980 --> 02:12:36.260]   There's also links to your various podcatchers.
[02:12:36.260 --> 02:12:39.620]   We're on every podcast, of course, software,
[02:12:39.620 --> 02:12:43.260]   but you could subscribe in pocket casts or stitcher,
[02:12:43.260 --> 02:12:44.460]   slack or whatever you like.
[02:12:44.460 --> 02:12:46.140]   And that way you'll get it automatically.
[02:12:46.140 --> 02:12:47.540]   The minute the show is available.
[02:12:47.540 --> 02:12:49.900]   And if they ask or offer reviews,
[02:12:49.900 --> 02:12:51.500]   please give us a five star review.
[02:12:51.500 --> 02:12:53.380]   We would sure appreciate that.
[02:12:53.380 --> 02:12:54.580]   Thanks everybody for being here.
[02:12:54.580 --> 02:12:59.340]   Time to get back to work though, 'cause break time is over.
[02:12:59.340 --> 02:13:00.500]   - Hope you enjoyed that episode.
[02:13:00.500 --> 02:13:03.420]   If you would like to laugh while learning about how to
[02:13:03.420 --> 02:13:07.380]   take control and take advantage of all of the features
[02:13:07.380 --> 02:13:09.660]   that your iOS devices provide,
[02:13:09.660 --> 02:13:12.060]   then you should check out iOS today.
[02:13:12.060 --> 02:13:14.780]   The show Rosemary Orchard, my co-host
[02:13:14.780 --> 02:13:18.820]   and I, my cusargent host, every week on the Twit Network.
[02:13:18.820 --> 02:13:22.260]   It's all things Apple all the time.
[02:13:22.260 --> 02:13:24.840]   (upbeat music)
[02:13:24.840 --> 02:13:27.420]   (upbeat music)
[02:13:27.420 --> 02:13:30.000]   (upbeat music)
[02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.580]   (upbeat music)
[02:13:32.580 --> 02:13:34.580]   You
