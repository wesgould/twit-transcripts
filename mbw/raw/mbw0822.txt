[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. Alex Lindsey's here. Andy Inaco and back from his trip to Cupertino.
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.360]   Renee Ricci will share some of the things he gleaned last week at WWDC. Looks like you'll
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.680]   be able to order your first M2 device on Friday. We'll give you the deets on that. And we'll talk
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.840]   about the iPad and iPad OS. And what Apple's plans really mean? It's all coming up next.
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:32.960]   I'm Mac Break Weekly. This is Detroit.

[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:44.880]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the latest news from Apple. Renee Ricci has returned
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.480]   bearing gifts for all of us, a 13" MacBook Pro. Renee, that's really too kind of you.
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.560]   You are absolutely welcome. I threw in a midnight, you know, nice indigo.
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:02.080]   Oh, actually, Mike has already announced to me that he will be ordering the midnight
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.600]   MacBook Air on my card. And I said, go ahead because I want to see it. You said,
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.360]   engines, Mike, I can do a lot with that. Yeah, no, I'll be. Good news is Renee was on
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.520]   Twitch. So I get all my personal questions answered already. But we'll get your questions
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.080]   answered just a bit. Annie and I go also here, WGBH Boston. Hello, Andrew.
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.800]   Hello. Yeah, normally I prepare for Mac Break by looking at the show doc, making sure if there's
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.880]   any story that I'm not familiar with, that I'm up to date, checking like up to the minute news,
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.560]   see if there's anything breaking. But the first week after WWDC, when Renee comes back in,
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.640]   I prepare by buying a container of the Twenters cheese balls. Because I know that I'm going to be
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.680]   spending like the first half hour just enjoying the taste of these. Oh, look, you have cheese balls.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:53.200]   I mean, which is very important. I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just here to listen.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.200]   Because if cheese ball fall out, is that the,
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:01.600]   No, I put this along because I realized that, you know, gray on gray is a little bit
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.600]   dour in some. Oh, no, I like it. No, that's good. But you're, you're, you're familiar with like
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.800]   cheese, like using cheese snacks for this is the first I've seen. And frankly, I've, I've been
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:17.600]   meaning to ask you, because I don't know how, how, how planters cheese balls compare to the original
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:24.800]   cheat toes. Well, consistency of spherosity is one orange, but not frighteningly orange.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.760]   Okay. They come, they come in this tin, so you don't have to like reach your
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:35.440]   balls. Yeah, that concerns me. I mean, the tin must weigh an ounce. There's nothing in that.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.800]   Yes, but those, they also, they also protect like the balls of cheese. These are only puffed
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.880]   air in the structural integrity is not much. But I'm surprised, especially someone who spends
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.280]   some time, there's a comic strip that introduced me to this idea. It's just a comic strip of someone
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.760]   saying, well, you're eating cheese with chopsticks. Yeah, it keeps all that cheese dust,
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.800]   the crap off my fingers. And then the last panel is just modern Prometheus hailed as genius.
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:05.280]   Actually, many, many years ago, more than 20 years ago on tech TV, I had a producer who said,
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.960]   she had invented cheeto gloves for the eating of cheetos. But I think the chopsticks is actually
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.960]   better because your hands are on and compers. Things are great. The other can I also say,
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.840]   finally, the final argument is that it also helps to slow me down. Yes, as opposed to like
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.040]   handful after handful, these, these delicious, carbocrunchie, every single, every single button
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.440]   in my, in my head being pushed for like, truthfully, eating pleasure. I look at that can I go,
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.440]   well, that's not enough. That's gonna last 30 seconds. Yeah, it also, well, see also, that's the
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.880]   other thing with a bag, like a crumple. So you don't know how much you can really see the progress
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.080]   bar as you eat. And so this is why like this tin has like lasted me like two or three days,
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.200]   or as a bag of like jacks would cost would last about half a movie. Andy has invented the
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.560]   cheese ball progress bar. Thank you very much. The hail the second modern Prometheus. I'm just,
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.680]   I just want to leave a impression. I just want to contribute to society.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.480]   You have you have you have you can die happy. Also with us, of course, from office hours.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:12.800]   Global Alex Lindsey. Hello, Alex. We were talking before the show and I'm very curious.
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:21.920]   You on office hours in your cover coverage of the, what is it the Cine, Cine gear, Cine gear
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:30.400]   conference, duplicated this famous Craig Federighi run from WWDC. Let me just show the run
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.160]   because what I want you to do, I have it, I have it here. I can work it down for you. Because you said,
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:41.360]   you see, I said, well, one thing to do the run, I could do that with slow motion and fast motion,
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.000]   but you said, no, that's that this is harder than this elevator, which I thought would be the hardest.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.680]   So show us the run here. What's going on? So here, here we go. He's gonna. So he's in the
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:57.200]   the top deck of the Steve Jobs Theater. Is that right? Right. Yeah. Well, he's in, I don't know where
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.040]   that is. That's not where is that. You know where that is a garden behind him. It's beautiful.
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:07.040]   Is that his corner office? Yeah. There's no corner offices in the round circle. Oh, yeah, that's right.
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:13.280]   So we stay in front of the medical school. So this is he that's just fast forward, right?
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:19.840]   It's probably a little bit more than that. If you look at it, it's um, they're they're running,
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.000]   but he's they're definitely doing some effects there. You can see the blur. Yeah. There's a blur.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.400]   Yeah. It's not just a blur. It's giving that kind of you can see behind him. Yeah. Like that wouldn't
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:33.520]   that that he's like almost like a little smoke there. Something like trails. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And so
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:41.840]   then he's going there. Now the thing about this is that they they added this is so so this is
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:47.360]   why you have to admire his stoicism. Yeah, exactly. So this is vector motion blur. This is not real
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.360]   motion blur. So that's that's part of it. I mean, they're they're doing something there to it.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.640]   The process. He's running. I think he's running on a treadmill and they're moving. That's a CG
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.760]   background because look at how when he sharpens, well, look at how quickly that sharpens. Yeah.
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.320]   He's CG Alex. And then no, no, I don't know. Yeah, he's not CG. He's buff. I gotta tell you.
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:11.600]   He's been lifted. He's doing well. Yeah. So but as he's running, obviously his highlights on his
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:16.160]   on either side don't change. So that he's he's not moving anywhere. He's not going anywhere. He's
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.080]   not going because the lights are running. You're right. Exactly. So then they start and then what
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.080]   they do. But it makes it much easier to shoot the shot, right? Sure. Because now they only have to
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:29.360]   he's running on. He's running a treadmill in slow motion and then they they start to animate
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.760]   the background. So they just start pushing that that 3D scene behind him. Yeah, there's some
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:38.960]   motion. There's some motion blur at the background. Yeah. But the motion the motion in the background
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:44.320]   is and then you see how they then they add that effect. Transition. Yeah. That's all men. And then
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:49.600]   they put him in a hallway that doesn't exist. And then but that's that's like a this is like
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.040]   this is like an effect is it almost looks like the Hobbit. You know when he puts the ring on?
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:58.400]   It's you know, it's not real motion, right? Which we now want to announce the brand new
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:05.520]   Greg Fettegrege motion blur plugin for final cut. Like last year he was teleporting like last
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.800]   year he was teleporting everywhere and this year he's got a Maglev and Flash by Love It.
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:13.520]   They may you know, I think they're smart. They've made him the star of the show, right? Yeah.
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:19.040]   Yeah. Yeah. He's got charisma. He's got personality. He's not he's not gonna he can explain all this.
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:25.280]   The problem with Craig's part of the show is that it's always this feature dump of here is like
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.920]   all the stuff in iOS and Mac OS, pop up up up up up up up up up up and unless you have
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:34.320]   know somebody who can really ride that speed bike and handle every single corner and get us through
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:39.200]   it, you need personality to get us through it. You can't just simply say now look at the response
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:45.040]   of the frequencies. I think the heat registers in Crete. You know, that's I prefer it as a rest
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:49.440]   stop, not a speed bump. But okay, I get your point. No, no, I just I just say speed bump.
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:56.480]   You got to enjoy looking at him. You got to enjoy his attitude and he's got to bring up the energy
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:02.480]   and the joy that with which he presents is pretty great. Well, the big news today is that
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:10.720]   Apple has given us a date and it's Friday that you can order the M2 MacBook Pro, not the
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:20.160]   MacBook Air. 9am Friday. Yeah. So, um, the old model with the new chip. Yeah, that's because they
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:24.320]   didn't have to redesign it at all. Right. So they just, yeah, yeah, they just wanted people who would
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:28.560]   still buy it because they still want the fan to be able to do persistent workloads over 20 minutes.
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:32.320]   And they just didn't want them to still get the M1. They figured they might as well get the latest
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:37.520]   chip. Which is nice. I like that. I think they should always keep the stuff upgraded.
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:43.280]   Good. Modern. Yeah. Touch bar though. I'm sorry, you know, might as well give us the
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:52.000]   butterfly. Yeah, and I'm sure it won't. So this is the one to get if you think you're going to do
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:59.440]   work that requires sustained throughput, sustained full CPU speeds for an actual Mac Pro. That's a
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:04.320]   weird sort of like the little sliver that this exists in is that the MacBook Air isn't quite
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:08.560]   enough for you because you've got enough stuff that just lasts maybe 30 minutes. But also,
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.400]   you don't want to carry a 14 inch MacBook Pro around with you, which would give you way more
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:16.480]   capabilities. And also, you don't care about the extra ports or the ability to run more than one
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:21.600]   external display. And like, I know that's not nothing. I know it's not nobody, but it just, it feels,
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.440]   and I know feels over facts is the worst thing. But that seems like a very narrow customer.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:30.000]   Well, it's the most popular laptop. So what do I know? Really? It almost, I bought one,
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.720]   when the M1 came out and I Lisa has it now when I got the MacBook Pro 14 inch.
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:42.080]   But I'm not, honestly, not tempted this time. Am I right not to be tempted? Is this faster than
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:48.240]   my M1 14 inch MacBook Pro? No, maybe marginal. Single core, single core is it?
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:52.720]   Do we know what the, so the single core clock speed is faster or just the, the micro code is
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:57.040]   faster is more efficient? No, the clock, so you've got, you've got uplift just because you have the
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:04.080]   N5P process generation that gives you 5%. It's 5% frequency boost. A15 already had that, so this
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:08.400]   might be a little bit higher than that. So up to about 10%. And then the cores have new micro
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:14.160]   architecture. They went from ice storm and fire storm to blizzard and avalanche. And so the E cores
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:18.240]   are about 30% faster, which is a pretty big deal because it means they can do more work and you
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:23.200]   don't have to engage the performance cores. So those are massively faster. And then the P core is
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:29.440]   because a lot of their gains are through cash. It varies from about 3% to about 25% depending on
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:34.320]   the latency of the workload you're doing. They have told like they said 18% uplift on the.
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:38.560]   They've given it more cash. That's, that's always a good thing. Right? This is so cool.
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:43.120]   The whole system has more cash. The P cores, the performance cores have individually more cash.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:47.760]   Okay. And the crazy thing to me is that they did all that and made it more efficient than M1.
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:52.080]   So like you could, they can put all this extra, like it's got more transistors. It's like 25%
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:57.040]   bigger and it still has the same battery life, which like, I think like it's easy. People forget
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.640]   this. Like a lot of times people complain that performance isn't higher. Performance is really
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:04.480]   easy. All you have to do is increase voltage. You, you, they could make like the fastest ships in
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:08.080]   the world tomorrow if all they wanted to do was increase voltage, didn't care about battery life
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:12.240]   for performance off power or the size of the enclosure, the noise of the fan, any of that.
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:17.360]   But to increase performance and increase efficiency is really, really hard. So I, I am liking the
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:22.960]   M2 quite a lot now. I would think that that's what a Mac Pro though might do is say, okay,
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:28.320]   TPU be damned, full, full speed ahead. For dies. I mean, that's going to be a lot of power no matter
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:33.280]   out. It'll be less power than, than, than an Nvidia 3090, but it will be a huge amount of power
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:43.680]   from Apple. Right. 20 billion transistors, uh, 20, as you said 25% more and 20 hours of battery life.
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:49.200]   And LPDDR5. So you have much higher memory bandwidth and you also have access to all the DR5.
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.800]   Although the DR5 did arrive in the Mac studios didn't. I think they have.
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:56.080]   It came with the Mac Pros and the Mac studios, but like that's, that's the thing. I think people,
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.840]   like they look at the M1 and they just think all the other ones were extra M1s. And now we know what
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:05.520]   M2 is. We know what M2 Pro and, and Macs will be, but Apple didn't just scale out the cores. Like
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:10.400]   the M2 added the rendering, sorry, the M1 Pro added the rendering engine. It added LPDDR5.
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:14.160]   It added very specific things that made it way better than just a bigger M1. Right.
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:18.800]   So I'm super interested to see how M, M2 gets the same sort of like maybe some A16,
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:23.600]   IP in there somewhere, maybe another feature, another specific silicon block we haven't thought
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:31.680]   about yet. I'm excited. Who should order on Friday? Somebody with an Intel back. Someone who was
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:37.840]   going to buy the, because of cost and size, someone who was going to buy the M1 Mac book pro anyway,
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:42.160]   decided for whatever reason the M, the M2 air isn't enough for them. And they're just going to get
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.800]   the extra chip. Like you're buying the same laptop you were going to buy last week,
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.960]   you're just getting the better chip. If you want a touch bar,
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:56.000]   yes, that would be a reason. If you want sustained throughput greater than the Mac book air, in other
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.200]   words, I was 20 minutes to cut off. If you're going to keep that processor maxed for more than
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.120]   20 minutes, because it has a fan, you're going to want the work loads is no different. But if
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:09.360]   a sustained workload is over 20 minutes, then yeah, you'll want the fan. The fan is this, or the,
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.880]   what they call active cooling. Yeah, let's get that. Let's get that straight.
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:17.840]   So they're not, I mean, I wonder if they're, if they're shipping this little early, remember,
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:22.000]   they said it was going to be next month, the pre-orders have begun, because they know this is not
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.440]   going to the people are, why are they doing this early? It's in stock. Like the, they have it.
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:31.200]   They made it. They could make it. They'll move it. Nothing new they're waiting for.
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.720]   Okay, got it. I mean, you also have the money for people we're heading to. Yeah.
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:38.800]   Yeah. And you know, you're near the end of the quarter. So you might as well,
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:43.840]   oh, that's true another week. June 30th. So is it, yeah, solid 15 days of orders there. So,
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:47.440]   yeah. So that's something you can put in the report. I did Leo, I have to admit,
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:51.520]   embarrassingly, I did, I did see Johnny Saruji. I got to say hello. And I act on it with Taylor
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:56.800]   Swift. Yeah, fanboy. Oh, no, I don't do that for many people. I feel like John Deen Andrea,
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.840]   if I'd seen him, I've done that once before. And Johnny Saruji, I just,
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:06.640]   me too. Tim Cook. Okay, fine. But Johnny Saruji. Now, Tim Cook is like, he's wonderful.
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:10.160]   They're like the weird thing about Apple executives is they are exactly like they are on stage in
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.280]   person. Like that, that is just how they are. And it's always a little bit unsettling because
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:16.960]   you figure the stage is an act. And then they talk to you exactly the same way. But like they're
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:21.200]   all, they're all super nice and stuff. But like, I'm a huge Silicon nerd. And I see the guy who's
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.800]   like changed the way I think about the look in. Yeah. That was a little bit. Yeah. And boy,
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:29.840]   don't be fooled on this. I'm the same way in person as I am on the air. And it's all an act.
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:36.160]   If you knew me, you'd hate me. Or maybe you'd love me. I don't know. Maybe you hate me now.
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.880]   I don't know. I play Pokemon Go more in real life than I do.
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:47.520]   Get out of my way. I see a, well, there's a new thing Lisa wants me to get that everybody has,
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:51.440]   but she doesn't have it yet. Lisa and I became, became buddy friends. We get to have a special
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:56.320]   trade next time I see a special trade time. Yep. That's so special.
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:08.880]   Come on, Leo. I'm jealous. I'm jealous. I'm jealous. I think a good take from Harry McCracken
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:16.800]   on Fast Company. He says, Apple finally turned all its devices into one big platform last week at
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:24.080]   WWDC. He calls it the matched set. Yeah. I think that's accurate. Yeah. I know. I think
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:28.880]   that it's a lot of the stuff is the look and feel across all the different platforms is slowly
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:32.960]   coming together. It did feel like they were doing lots of different things. They've been slowly
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:37.760]   pulling together. And it's something that is uniquely Apple. It's very hard. Nobody else covers
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:42.160]   that much gamut to be able to pull all these devices so that they all feel like they belong
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:48.160]   together and they can work together. Universal control and continuity and now stage manager on
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:54.400]   the iPad. I think iPadOS is a massive iPadOS. And we talked about this last week is the tell.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:17:00.480]   If we finally understand now what Apple has planned, why they put an M1 in an iPad a year ago,
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:04.240]   we were all scratching our head. People are so angry. Like last year they were so angry that
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:09.280]   Apple put an M1 into the iPad and didn't give it any M1 specific features. So this year Apple's
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:14.400]   like fine. We'll give you some M1 specific features. And now they are so angry that they're M1.
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.200]   Well, most of the people are angry. I bet are people who don't have.
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:21.600]   Yeah, last year, the other people were angry. This year, they don't have M1 angry. So I was like,
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:26.720]   yeah, what's almost going to be angry or more more particularly people who bought an iPad recently.
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:31.440]   Like they if they bought 2021 hardware, but they didn't buy the M1 variant and they're thinking,
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:38.800]   yeah, I spent like $900 for this iPad. This is a defining feature and my iPad. You feel as though
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:44.960]   there's been like a fence to suddenly dropped between the haves and the have-nots and that you
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:51.440]   don't want to be on the have-not side of that fence. Apple gave you a statement about the M1.
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:57.840]   Should we call it a stage manager gate? I don't know. And then Federighi went,
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:03.520]   talked to Matthew Padd and Reno about it. Yeah, Panzerino got a good. So you got the PR
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:09.280]   quote. You want to read it to us? Do you know it offhand? I don't have it in front of me. Oh,
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:17.840]   I'll have to look up. Let's see, Renee Ritchie. That was a great video. M1 iPad. See, I have to go
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:21.760]   and research. I have to talk to engineers. I have to watch WWE's. It takes me like three days to make
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:26.560]   a video and panzers goes, yo, Craig, yo, Craig, yeah, yeah, can you explain this to me? I mean,
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:30.320]   that's what you get if you're like, if you're on tech. I understand. It was kind of a marketing
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:34.720]   easing something about blazingly fast. I think they're worried with that people were just
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:38.720]   concentrating on the RAM and they're saying like it was just the RAM and well, six gigabytes is
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:44.400]   close to eight gigabytes. And you had, you know, you had the A12Z could run the developer
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:49.120]   trade transition kit, even though they had to give a 12 gigabytes of RAM to do that. And Samsung
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:53.440]   can do decks. You know, even though a Samsung phone has eight to 12 gigabytes of RAM and decks is
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:58.640]   limited to five like productivity style apps. But it was like a lot of confusion initially.
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:02.000]   And it's, it's an interesting problem because like some people are upset they didn't get the
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.320]   interface. I don't, I don't love the interface, but like some people like it's just new. So they
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:10.080]   want it. I get it. Other people were upset. They didn't get full screen support, which I think
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:13.760]   is totally valid. I would love for Apple to spin off full screen support for an external
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:17.920]   display as a separate feature. I think, you know, that that would just make a lot of it's not a big,
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:21.840]   like very, very few people do that, but the people who do it really want it. That's great.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:26.160]   But the memory, like the ability to swap pages of memory to RAM is the big deal.
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:31.120]   And a series silicon just never was never designed for that. Apple doesn't make commodity chips.
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:34.480]   Like with Intel, they never know which chip is going to go into which machine. So they have to
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:39.600]   support as much as possible in every chip. But Apple, like they know that iOS has no concept of
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:45.360]   swap. So they never built any of the memory, the memory compression or the ultra, the ultra fast
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:51.680]   storage controllers, the ultra fast MVNE SSDs. They never built any of that into previous generations.
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:55.520]   And now that they have that from the Mac, because the Mac absolutely needed that,
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:59.600]   they're taking advantage of it and selling, like telling Photoshop, okay, you're no longer
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:04.080]   constrained to four gigabytes of RAM, where Jetson will yoke you off the operating system.
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:09.040]   Now you can just page out to disk as if you were a Mac app. And that's the transformational thing,
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:13.840]   but it's only ever existed for the iPad in the M1. And I think that's, it's the most important
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:18.080]   thing and the thing they just can't work their way around. Yeah. Like Andy said,
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:22.560]   sad for people who bought an A series chip. It is surprising though that Apple usually is very,
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:26.960]   very good at communications that they didn't, that they couldn't have predicted that,
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:31.760]   again, they have put of necessity, but they have put a wall between the haves and half nuts,
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:35.520]   that it would have been a good idea to have a white paper or have something on the site,
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:41.120]   or at least make sure that in the talking points for the, for the engineers who speak to people,
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:45.280]   to the press on that day, they say, Oh, by the way, here is why they're, we're not,
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:50.000]   we're not just being cheerlish. We're not just trying to, to, to, to tricky into buying a better
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.160]   iPad. There are actual technical reasons why we didn't, we didn't make this available for other
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.600]   ones. And that would at least people have people would grumble, but they would,
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:01.680]   smarter people would be able to sort of say, yeah, I mean, you know, but there's, there's reason.
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:05.200]   Do you want nobody to have this feature or do you want to have this feature really?
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:10.800]   I cringed a little bit when the first statement, which you got Renee stage manager is a fully
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:16.080]   integrated experience that provides all new windowing experience that is incredibly fast and
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:20.320]   responsive and allows users to run eight apps simultaneously across iPad and external
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:25.360]   display with up to six K revolution. Delivering this experience with the immediacy users expect
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:30.400]   from iPads touch first experience requires, and this is what bugged me, large internal memory,
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:35.680]   incredibly fast storage and flexible display IO all of what you're delivered by M1. It's
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:40.720]   had a little bit like a pitch, but it is, I mean, it's a root, the reason and the, the
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:46.160]   crake was a little bit more technical, gave the technical explanation that you wanted and I wanted
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:51.360]   Andy, he said, in order to reach, this is what panzerino wrote, in order to reach that level of
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:56.560]   responsiveness, several factors needed to collide combination of a lot of RAM and extremely fast
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:02.960]   IO virtual memory, virtual memory. So you, in other words, that's the storage, we're needed to host
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:08.880]   multiple apps in the active bucket. Only the M1 iPads combine the high DRAM capacity
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:14.960]   with very high capacity high performance NAND that allows the virtual memory swap to be super fast.
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:19.920]   So that's the technical information, which is in order for stage manager to work, it has to page
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:27.120]   out into the storage, the SSD, what's going on, and that needs to be fast enough so that you have a
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:32.480]   fluid response. Andy's point, I think like, because when we talked to PR, like we talked about this
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:36.560]   before, Apple doesn't really have crisis PR, like it's just their product PR people handle it,
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:42.400]   and that's, it's a very different thing. Their job is very different. Like, they, I think,
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:45.520]   and I don't want to say it's naive because it's not, but they're like, people were so upset last
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:48.720]   year when we didn't give them anything that really took advantage of the M1, we're going to give
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:52.400]   them something that takes advantage of one and they're going to be so happy. And like, that's like
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:56.720]   the little box that they've decided that they're in and then people aren't happy. What is happy?
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:00.080]   But last year you said, and I think that that's the part they didn't get their heads around.
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:02.800]   Shouldn't have said happy. And the anger from last year would be different
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:06.560]   than the anger from this year. I think it's a 10% of people. This happens all the time.
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:12.480]   There's new hardware. There's new capabilities. The new capabilities require the newer hardware.
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:18.720]   Frankly, Apple is saying you can do this on a year old iPad is better than a lot of companies,
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:23.600]   which is say, and if you want to use it, you'll need to buy a new iPad. So I think it's a little
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:28.000]   like the iPhone 3GS had video recording and people were so angry it wasn't on the iPhone 3G
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.600]   and then when jail broke, didn't brought it back. And it was 12 frames per second. And Apple's like,
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.200]   we can't ship 12 frames per second.
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:37.760]   Only people who are angry are people who haven't been around long enough or just don't understand
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:42.800]   how tech works or something. And you're right, Annie, and somebody who just bought an iPad
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:47.920]   and it didn't have an M1. And although the the errors have M1s, so it'll work on the errors,
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:52.400]   right? I mean, I would say is one of the specific reasons I got the iPad with the M1 is I figured
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:57.360]   I would be part of the future of what's happening not the past. We said that a year ago. We said that.
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:03.680]   Yeah, I'm sorry. And we said we were disappointed that there was nothing that took advantage of it.
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:11.200]   Right. Right. Yeah. But but again, history history of Apple. I'll make this short, but yeah,
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:17.760]   one of my Apple, my relationship with knowledge of Apple led to two things. Number one,
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:23.680]   I did buy like the very first iPad Pro like first generation. And number one, it meant that
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:28.800]   even in 2021, it was still working great. It was still totally useful. I still had no complaints
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:34.240]   about it. It was still a core of my of my workflows, both inside the house and outside the house.
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:38.960]   And two, the other thing that knowing about Apple meant for me is that when Apple came out with an
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:45.200]   M1 version of the iPad, I knew that that was going to be super significant that I knew that I did
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:49.760]   that I had some inkling of what they were planning to do with an M1 inside an iPad. I knew it had
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:54.640]   nothing to do with running Mac apps on an iPad. But I was confident that this would pay off. And
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:25:00.240]   it was worthwhile to finally replace this five year old iPad that was essentially working just
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:03.920]   fine for me. And I'm glad and it's been paying off in so many different ways.
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:10.640]   I think the part of the problem that Apple has is that I bought the first Pro 16 inch or whatever
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:15.520]   for my kids. They're still using that one quite happily. Like nothing happened. Like nothing
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:21.680]   pushed it that they are missing anything, etc. And there just hasn't been enough to really push the
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:25.920]   the iPads hard that you feel like you have to upgrade because they do everything pretty well.
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:30.800]   And so I think that that is the real challenge. And I think finally, I think with the M1, Apple's
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:36.960]   going to start pressing down on their own to really push the outer envelope. But they can't. But what
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:41.360]   Apple's not known for and never has been probably never will be is backwards compatibility. And if
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:44.320]   you're buying into the ecosystem, you always have to kind of take that into account.
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:49.200]   That's exactly what Craig. This is actually it's funny you should say that because that's exactly
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:53.440]   the quote that I thought was most salient from Craig when he talked to Panzorino. He says,
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:57.840]   this is the experience we're going to carry into the future. We didn't want to constrain it
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:02.720]   as I did something lesser. We're setting the benchmark for the future. So they didn't want to say,
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:07.120]   oh, let's let's dumb it down so it'll can run a older iPads. And I think that's appropriate.
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:12.800]   And for the record, Samsung does have decks. It's great. It's wonderful. I don't have a phone that
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:17.120]   supports it. But every time I was I had a Samsung phone on loan and use it, I was very, very impressed
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:22.240]   with how flexible it makes the phone. But it is nowhere near as ambitious as what Apple is doing
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:28.400]   with M1 iPads. This is DEX is simply the Linux that's baked into the phone. They basically added a
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:33.920]   window manager and a way of managing apps to go to go larger screen. This really is a whole new
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:38.960]   paradigm and a whole way to integrate the tablet experience and the desktop experience in a
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:42.560]   way that I don't think I've ever seen before. So more ambitious.
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:49.440]   Harry says, consider all of these features. This is Apple kind of coalescing.
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:55.840]   It's, you know, it's full range of products. Stage manager, Mac OS Ventura and iPad,
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:27:04.080]   OS 16, iOS is lock screen customizations. And Micah noted this, considerably inspiration from
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:08.800]   how watch faces work on Apple Watch. Those are like complications from the watch.
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:12.160]   It's the same code. Yeah. Is it the same code? That's interesting.
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:15.680]   So what they did is they created the complications and that's, and then they spun that into widget
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.480]   kit, which they actually made open to developers, which I thought we talked about that on Twitch,
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:22.800]   but Apple made everything an API this year, which was incredibly exciting for me. No one-year
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:26.960]   wait for them to dog food it. So that's all widget kit now. So it's the same stuff that you're
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:30.560]   already familiar with building all these things across watch all the way through
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:35.920]   iPhone, iPad and Mac. Yeah. And by the way, yeah, we're going to repeat some stuff that we talked
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:41.120]   about on Twitch, but I'm presuming that not everybody listens to all of our shows.
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:48.320]   Yes. That's okay. You know, don't apologize for overlapping. A little repetition. It makes it
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:51.760]   stick in the brain longer. And that's the origin of Swift UI too. I mean, a lot of stuff was
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:55.840]   originally written up for the watch team to be able to quickly make visual interpretations of
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:59.040]   apps for the watch that were super power efficient. And then Craig saw it and said,
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:03.040]   why be stingy? Can we have that everywhere, please? It became the UI.
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:08.080]   Well, and then the always on feature of the Apple watch, which requires a screen that can go down
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:14.720]   to one Hertz, one refreshes second. Now it's going to come pretty sure to the iPhone,
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:20.160]   because the iPhone is going to have variable refresh rate. Apple fitness now will be available
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:26.640]   to people on the phone that don't have the watch. So that's good news. Mail and messages are
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:32.640]   getting new features that will debut on iPhone, iPad and Mac at the same time. This new free form
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:41.040]   thing, which I still think is a stealth kind of something, maybe AR tool. I can't imagine Apple
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:45.920]   would just do a whiteboard app. Well, again, they pulled everything out. Like before,
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:49.920]   share play was neat, but it was bound and constricted to apps and now share play is pretty everywhere.
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:55.520]   So you can imagine messages. I'm playing a game and I'm like, Alex, Leo, Andy, come play
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:59.440]   Star Trek with me. And suddenly we're all in our VR headsets. And it's just a little ping that
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:03.360]   goes out. And we're all playing. And then Leo says, stop, stop. The space time equations are wrong.
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:07.520]   And he starts whiteboarding how we can get past the ketomer maneuver. You know, it'll be fantastic.
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:09.680]   You think no, no, normal people are going to use whiteboards.
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:16.720]   Shared collaborative whiteboards. In business, maybe. I can't wait for clever whiteboard
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:23.200]   publishing of like covering of keynotes and stuff like that. I've been talking a lot of the
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:26.720]   boards and all the boards of like comic artists and illustrators I've seen. I love those.
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:31.920]   I can't wait to get they want to just go to the same event and be doing jam pieces on the same
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:36.480]   canvas. Oh, that's really interesting. I'm sure the great thing about Apple users is that
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:41.120]   they're weirdos in the best possible way. They they they figure out ways to use things that are
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:46.560]   applicable and relevant and exciting to them. So I really do. It's not exciting as Microsoft,
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:51.280]   we just say, Oh, and for productivity teams, workspaces, verticals. Whereas Apple just says,
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:54.960]   here's a big here's a big white space, put whatever crap you want on it,
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:59.440]   but invite whoever you want to put their own crap on it and use it as a shared existence.
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:04.640]   So I really think that this is like their first augmented reality, like metaverse is this is
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:10.160]   this white space app. I still think there's and I may be completely off base. It could just be,
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:14.720]   you know, somebody's 20% time. Look, I made a whiteboard. Okay, let's put it in.
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:20.160]   But I think there's more to it, especially it because you can embed objects in it
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:26.080]   that is more than just drawings that is video experiences. Yeah, I feel like and imagine taking
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:30.080]   away the whiteboard and having that near augmented reality glasses, those floating objects.
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:35.920]   Imagine I'm sorry, Alex, just very, very quickly. That's fine. Imagine being able to place a 3D
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:40.800]   object and that 3D object not being, Hey, look, here is an here is a dinosaur that we can all
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:45.280]   gather around and look at and teach about or imagine it's like no, it's like Minecraft. I can put
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:50.000]   buildings here. I can put spaces here. This is I agree with you. I agree with you. I think that
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.880]   this is going to be at least the fore cursor to something much, much bigger. Alex, you agree?
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:31:00.320]   Yeah, I mean, I do. I think that you're the AR guy, right? So I'm giving you ammunition here.
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:05.280]   Well, I think that you know, when we see USD Z, you know, dropping, you know, being dropped into
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:08.960]   into this, can you you're going to be able to? Well, I mean, did I mention that? I think you
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:13.200]   could haven't mentioned that, but I think that, you know, but but the main thing is, is the experience
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:16.880]   will look a lot like this where you're sitting here and you're going, you know, look at this 3D
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:22.880]   object, you know, and I can circle things and go like this and do this, you know, and talk about it.
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:26.640]   And someone else can be talking about that. Like, Hey, can you rotate this around and you
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:31.200]   rotate it around like this? This is the clarity, you know, IO thing that we worked on. And but
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:35.600]   you can sit there and go, you know, this thing is going to connect it over here. And then somebody
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:39.120]   else mentions the antenna and someone else mentions this and how things go through here.
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:42.800]   That's VR with the whiteboard, but take away the whiteboard. Suddenly it's AR.
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:49.440]   Yeah, but yeah. And I think that it's but but you could be it's very, very useful as a 2D
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:55.760]   experience with USD Z. Yeah. It's super useful on its own. And then when you add AR and VR,
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:32:00.400]   absolutely, it's more useful. But the thing what Apple is doing really, really well with a lot of
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:07.440]   these pieces that are coming together is doing things that are very, very useful in a 2D environment
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:13.440]   that then can be, you know, slowly expanded into into the VR world and into the AR world
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:17.360]   in a way that you know, and it allows them to get all these reps. And what the problem that
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:22.800]   that Facebook and Google have had is that they jump into these things into the deep end and they
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:28.160]   drown. Right. You know, like, like, good ideas around it. Well, I mean,
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:32.160]   I mean, she and Tocani wrote a whole book about Google Wave minutes before they cancelled.
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:37.120]   Time Google Google had Google had a LIDAR on their phone. They had yes,
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:41.120]   support for the LIDAR, but not on their own phones. Yeah. You know, and and the problem that we had
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:48.160]   was sure we could we were importing these LIDAR Google phones to to do R&D. And the main thing is,
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:51.440]   is that, well, how do you get stuff into it? So it becomes hard even for us to get stuff into it.
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:55.600]   When we got into it, it was amazing. Yeah. You know, and there's so many things we could do with it,
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:33:02.000]   but they didn't have the entire support ecosystem that was required for those to instantly take off.
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:07.440]   And I think that what Apple is doing is they're building this ecosystem very, very methodically,
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:13.280]   as they work out all the really hard, you know, eight, you know, six K per I or eight pay K per I,
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:17.520]   and how many M one or M two processes are they going to need and and what it's going to look like
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:21.920]   and all those other things as they work all of those things out, which are very, very hard problems
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:26.880]   that everybody's having trouble with. They're building this massive ecosystem skill sets,
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:32.560]   tool sets, you know, and giving people giving developers time to work on it. It's it's a again,
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:39.520]   I will say that I think that that's why this is going to be whenever it happens 2023, 2024,
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:43.200]   it's going to be a big deal because because there's been years and years and years of,
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:47.920]   of, you know, planning and prop, you know, preparing everybody for that next piece. And again,
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:52.800]   it's not like, here's a great tool that you may someday use. It is a great tool today,
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:56.400]   doing what you're doing right now. And eventually it'll just get better.
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:59.920]   Yeah, to me, that's the through line of WWDC. And it's what Harry McCracken was saying,
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:06.000]   is that we're starting to see the outlines now coming out to come into focus. I when they announced
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.600]   free for my, I looked, and this is an article from 2020, two years ago, there are at least seven
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:18.080]   digital whiteboard solutions for iPad and Mac. So this isn't a new arena. This isn't something
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:25.840]   not well served. So I have to think there's a reason Apple's doing this, right? It could also be
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:33.280]   just because it's just remembered that there was also a time when the iPad doesn't didn't have a
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:37.360]   file manager app. And there was a big market still is a big market for file management app.
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:42.000]   It's possible that Apple realized that, okay, there was a big hole in this device when
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.920]   preinstalled software that exactly the shape of a files management app, we need to, we need to
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:50.160]   patch that whole immediately because without it, we won't be able to do the next thing we want to
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:54.720]   do. Yeah, although, you know, no one's going to develop a file manager app for iOS because that's,
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:35:00.000]   that's a fool's here. Only Apple could do that. Right. I mean, the thing that Apple struggles
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.120]   with and well, there's two things. One, FaceTime was just left follow, like for so long, it was not
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:09.680]   competitive. And they finally, during the, during the lockdowns realized this isn't good enough,
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:13.520]   we have to improve it. And so for the last two years, three years, we've gotten an astonishing
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:19.280]   array of finally upgrades. But isn't FaceTime a non starter until it's cross platform? I'm sorry.
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:25.600]   You can't get zoom if you're only Apple. Well, Apple has the affordest of only wanting to serve
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:28.880]   their customers. Yeah, they, they want that to be there. But I think the biggest battle of
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:33.760]   fighting is that what does an iPad Pro mean? Because for some people, it means I wanted to do
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:38.480]   exactly what my MacBook Pro mean does. I just want to have an iPad that does it instead. And Apple's
[00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:42.880]   been fighting against that. They want to make an iPad Pro that is, that is for people who don't
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:48.640]   aren't served by the Mac Pro. So like for architects and UI designers and storyboarders and teachers
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:52.960]   and real estate agents, they want to create a different experience. But there's a very vocal
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:57.760]   contingent of people who just want it to be their MacBook Pro, have the exact same apps and experience.
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:01.440]   And then they can take it around as a TV viewer when they don't have it. And I think things like
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:05.280]   the whiteboard, that doesn't work as well on a Mac. Like that's a, that's a pretty unique,
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:09.760]   large screen, pencil-enabled experience. And they want to lean into that to sort of show people
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:15.120]   what, what is different, what were, why the iPad should still exist, basically. Yeah. And the
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:18.560]   thing is, is that they can, I don't think they have to be zoom. I don't think they have to serve
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:23.520]   the same market. I think that, I mean, I use lots of things and I use messages for certain things,
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:28.080]   but I chat with lots of people on lots of different things. So it's probably why I'm not that
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:33.680]   sensitive to messages being one way or the other. It just is what it is. But it, but it, it slows
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:37.120]   down their ability to innovate if they're slowed down by the other platforms, you know,
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:40.800]   which is essentially what will happen is the platform, the other platforms are pretty far behind.
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:46.960]   And, and they're gonna, and so you have to now wait for them or persuade them to add the hooks
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:52.160]   that you need to make that work to have it have the same thing when Apple owns the chat function.
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:56.320]   And by the way, I, I don't really like FaceTime. Like, like, I just, I drive me absolutely crazy.
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:00.160]   So I don't think they proven that they can do anything well with FaceTime yet. I love messages.
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:04.800]   I love most of Apple. What Apple does, FaceTime is not one of them. All the little bubbles that
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:07.920]   keep on going back and forth and all the little things that it does drives me a little nutty.
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:14.080]   And so, so I don't think that they're doing that necessarily well, but I know that they can't,
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:17.120]   they won't be able to take full advantage of a fully media rich environment
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:22.880]   if they, if they tie themselves down to trying to support other platforms to do what they're doing.
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:27.600]   They, by owning the hardware, owning the OS and owning the service, they're able to innovate a
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:31.360]   lot faster. Right now, I don't think they're innovating in the right direction, but maybe they'll get
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:32.480]   around to it. Yeah.
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:33.920]   Emoji alice is pretty dope though.
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:38.960]   I love emoji. We, the emoji is great. I only wish that I could, it was easier to export stuff out,
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:40.880]   but yeah, like three. But anyway,
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:46.000]   the big challenge though is that the function of a, the function of a communications app is not
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.120]   emoji. The function of communications is to communicate is to support whatever social
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:55.680]   ring, whatever social network. I don't mean a commercial now. I mean, like your circle of
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:59.680]   friends, your circle of work, work friends, work groups, circle of neighbor friends.
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:05.520]   And you can't do that if no, it's going to be impressed that, okay, so all but 30% of the people
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:10.720]   who need to get these messages can get these messages, but the 70% who do can have a cowboy hat
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:16.240]   on their little cartoon face. And again, all this stuff is really great and I don't, yeah, exactly.
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:22.560]   So this is, this is, this is why I really do wish that Apple appreciated that again, the
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:29.520]   the purpose of a communications app is to communicate and, and respecting the social network that you
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:33.600]   yourself are bringing to that app is more important than almost any other thing. You can do whatever
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:38.000]   you want after you do that. But it's like, like a bridge that it looks beautiful, but it's
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.760]   weighs so much in the, in the wind, you have to call it, you have to, you have to shut it down
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:46.960]   during bad weather. That's not a bridge. That's, that's a, that's a beautiful landscaping object
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:51.200]   that can occasionally support traffic. And that's sometimes what FaceTime feels like in messages.
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:54.400]   Yeah. And I, and I don't know whether it's, you know, I think it also depends on what environment
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:39:00.000]   you're in. I, I get, I get so few green messages. Now, and I don't know whether that's just because
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.680]   I'm in, I'm modal, you know, I'm talking to some people on signal and
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:10.000]   mostly signal. So other than other than I messages. And, and I just don't have that.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.880]   I feel like, you know, most of my environment, and this is across many companies and across
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:19.840]   many friends, it just all seems to be a lot of blue bubbles. And so I guess for me, I think it
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:23.920]   depends on what environment you're in and what your network is as to whether you're really impacted
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:27.440]   by that or not. I think almost everybody that I, that I interact with on messages
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:31.520]   is, is, is in that bubble. And so I don't, and it's really nice bubble.
[00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:34.160]   So it's, you know, it's a green bubble.
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:36.800]   Yeah. But Andy is my only green bubble.
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:41.040]   Exactly. No, but isn't that, isn't that a, isn't that a self, isn't that a self-indeed
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:47.200]   obviously that, that, that, that the reason why you see so few green bubbles is that all of us who
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:51.200]   have Android phones are probably talking to you on signal or something. We can have that rich
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:55.120]   media rich social experience without, you know, having to,
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:59.040]   I think it was a very slow to respond because it only shows up on my phone. Like the green
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:03.360]   bubble only shows up on one phone and the blue bubble show up everywhere. And so I, I'm very,
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:09.280]   you know, but it's, but I think that, uh, I just think that as a user of the, as a blue bubble,
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:15.200]   you know, user, if someone said, would you like to have more access to people or have Apple be
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:19.680]   able to move faster? Most of us would say faster. Like, you know, like, we'd like to go,
[00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:23.280]   we would like a faster unless, unless you're an Apple investor and from your, your
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:26.080]   Ron Apple investors, they put away care about Apple. Yeah. Cause they're really
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:27.440]   hurting because I'm really having trouble.
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:32.400]   It's like, yeah, all my media friends who use both Android and iPhone only ever DM me,
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:35.840]   no matter what I do, they'll only ever do like everyone agreed in tech media that Twitter is
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:39.440]   going to be our universal platform, probably because we all have 18 other ones we don't want to bother
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:46.160]   with. Yeah. Yeah. Apple's not going down as fast as Bitcoin, but it has been going down.
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:52.240]   Yeah. Yeah. But the stable coins, the stable coins, those stable coins are so stable, aren't they?
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:57.040]   They're not so stable. Let's take a little break. Lots more to talk about. We're just,
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:01.600]   can I just quickly add that the Quebec pension plan invested in the, in the Celsius one,
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:05.120]   I assume, because they thought it was metric. Oh, God. And so thank you. Thank you so much for
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:09.840]   that Quebec pension plan. Oh my God. You know, I, I had mentioned this before. There was an
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:15.200]   advertiser came to us and said, we want to, uh, uh, uh, talk about, uh, how people can use Bitcoin
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:21.680]   in their 401k. I said, no, you're not. Not my show. Not my show. Danger. Danger. Danger.
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:25.280]   Stories are horrible. It's like people like I put my life savings, my house, my kids college fund,
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:29.440]   because they promised me 10% interest. And I'm like, there's no way they could give you 10%
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:35.200]   interest. This is, but this is, this is also why you, uh, only this is why they have qualified,
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:40.880]   the SEC qualified writers is to understand that you, you spread it out. But, but, but thanks to the
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:46.080]   jobs act, it's much more open now than it used to be. And they're not banks. Remember that it's got
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:49.760]   the guy who ran Celsius said, it's like your neighbor borrows you some sugar and then brings
[00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:53.760]   it back to you with a, an extra teaspoon in it. That's not a bank. We shouldn't be regulated like
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:59.440]   banks. We're a commodity. Yes. We're just sugar, baby. Where's all my sugar? This, this, this actually,
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:04.400]   we're too agile for you. This story grind is my gears. Just it's completely off topic,
[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:09.920]   but I'm going to mention Jay Z. This is a motherboard story is giving back to the community. He grew
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:17.200]   up with a Bitcoin Academy. He's teaming up with Jack Dorsey to teach, to teach residents of public
[00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:24.480]   housing projects about Bitcoin. It's a crypto kids camp for kids five to 17.
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:33.920]   Does that, if I, no, I'm sure, no, I don't want to, I don't want to be that person. I'm sure there
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:39.680]   are fabulous uses for the technologies that involve like federated groups and, and blockchains and
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:44.480]   non-fungible tokens. I'm sure like the same way we did not know the, like with the consequences of
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:49.120]   OAuth and asynchronous like, you know, Ajax and all those things back in the day, but it is just
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:54.800]   such a grifter's minefield that you have to, you have to look across the horizon until well
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:59.760]   established, you know, beneficial use cases come out. If that was what the Academy was all about,
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:06.160]   which by the way, that's a one day event. Don't do this. Don't go near it. It's all a scam and
[00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:11.040]   you're going to get ripped off. What really saddens me is so many of my friends,
[00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:17.520]   so many people I know are flogging NFTs now. And, and yeah, I mean, that's the whole attitude is,
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:21.040]   oh, you're just a boomer. You're old man. You just don't understand this is your future.
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:28.480]   Well, if the future is people losing their houses, I guess, well, again, it's, it's, you know,
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:32.880]   the nature of speculation, like, and because of the stability of the, of the currency,
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:39.040]   it can't really be used as currency. It's not current. You don't sell the coin anywhere. It's like,
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:42.720]   yeah, but I'm saying it's not, but it, but it doesn't act like currency. It acts like a
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:47.360]   speculative market because, yeah, you know, like, so you don't want to sell it when it's going up
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:52.000]   and you obviously, you know, you know, so you don't, you're not using it. I wouldn't necessarily buy
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.480]   this dip of Bitcoin, however. Well, there, I mean, but there are like academic and artistic uses
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:44:00.000]   that, that aren't about money that are beautiful and interesting and might go somewhere. And I
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.280]   don't ever want to disparage those because they're not, they're not grifting anybody, but there's
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:08.800]   just so much. Well, all right, I'll disparage them because it really is all about grift. And
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:14.960]   that's the excuse that grifters use is, oh, you just don't understand the technology. Well,
[00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:17.280]   guess what? I actually understand that you understand the grip.
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:24.720]   They say, it's, it's, since time immemorial, since, since, since Mr. Ponzi started having
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:30.960]   male coupons. You know what? The reason why you don't succeed is because you don't dare to
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:38.560]   succeed. Dare I say courage favors the brave. Yeah. And also not to mention the environmental
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:44.400]   impact of all this stuff. It's the last thing we need to be doing. You like an artist by a print.
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:49.520]   One of my very favorite artists, own name names, doesn't sell prints anymore. She sells NFTs.
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:55.520]   And how's she doing? Probably doing great. But I feel those people are buying the NFTs
[00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:59.600]   maybe not so much. And I want to pray. And it only made up his own monkey. Like he would have,
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:02.000]   he would have saved himself. Yeah. $600,000 by now.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.640]   How much do you pay? He paid a hundred thousand more to the guy who got bought from the guy who
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:12.000]   stole. And then the original fee that he paid for, oh, that's right. So it's 600 total. Yeah.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.800]   Yeah. But the thing is, is that the whole art market is irrational. Like it's, it's, it's,
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:23.600]   at least you get a painting when you buy one. Come on. You know, instead of a URL. Oh, I got a URL.
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:34.320]   That's great. Thank you. Okay. To be, to be fair, what you get is an item in a Swiss customs house
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:39.760]   where it exists in a tax limbo and a piece of paper. I don't like those people either. I agree.
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:44.320]   Okay. You're right. I don't like those people. But it's, don't look a beautiful art in a warehouse
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:47.840]   either. I guess I would just say it to me, the whole thing is like no new tale to tell. Like,
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:51.840]   it's just, it's just another version of the thing that I have. Tale is always to watch go buying.
[00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:54.480]   Yep. Yeah. And it's, you know, people have been, but, uh,
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:46:01.120]   specular. Yeah. But the problem is it has that shiny gloss of the modern and of tech. And, uh,
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:05.120]   and I think people get sucked into it because, and influencers that people like, and that's
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:10.000]   take like, that's what bugs means. People like Jay Z, uh, flogging this. Well, as people with like
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.880]   great audience, if you have great audience, I really deeply believe that you have great
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:16.800]   responsibility, but there are a lot of people who don't feel like they have to add value or give
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:20.560]   value, but they have to extract money. Like those people are dumb, like idiots who they're just
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:25.760]   going to take all this money from. And we seem to mistake celebrity for authenticity and, uh,
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:29.920]   sincerity and, you know, like honesty. And we really, really shouldn't. It's to our detriment
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:34.480]   every time. Yeah. Our show today brought to you by Kaleid. I do think this is a really cool thing.
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:43.520]   If you are in a business that uses Slack, this is, I think the best way to, to improve your security
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:51.360]   by educating your employees. Slack is in contrast the old school device management tools like MDM,
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:57.280]   you know, locking employees devices, you know, just saying, no, you can't, uh, uh, it's, you know,
[00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:04.960]   putting glue in the USB port, that kind of thing. Uh, you, and of course, what happens is you
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:08.640]   frustrate your end users so badly that eventually they throw up their hands and start using their
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:14.880]   own devices, which is actually worse for everyone all around. Kaleid is very different. It was built
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:20.400]   by like-minded security practitioners who in the past saw just how much MDM was disrupting their
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:26.960]   end users and really disrupting their end goals of being secure. Kaleid, instead of locking down a
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:32.080]   device, it takes a user-focused approach. It, it communicates security recommendations to your
[00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:37.760]   employees directly on Slack. And I think this is so cool. It starts with the end users installing
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:42.160]   their own endpoint agent. It says, hi, I'm Kaleid in the Slack. And let's install this endpoint
[00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:48.800]   agent to help keep you more secure. Uh, as after it's set up, it device security turns from a black
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:53.120]   and white state into a dynamic conversation. In fact, you'll see we're showing it on the video,
[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:58.080]   but if you, if you don't know the video, if you're listening, go to kaleid.com/macbreak. K-O-L-I-D-E
[00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:04.240]   dot com/macbreak. And you can see some examples of the messages Kaleid sends whenever it says
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:09.280]   there's an insecure issue or whatever, it'll send a message and walks the employee through
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:13.520]   why it's a problem and what they can do about it. Things, simple things like maybe your lock screen
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:18.000]   isn't set up right so that, you know, somebody during lunch, your screen saver comes on, but
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:23.440]   somebody can still sit down and use your, your company email to send a message in your name.
[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:29.280]   But also hard to solve the more nuanced things that actually collide to such a good job of explaining.
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:35.440]   As an example, somebody who has, you know, downloaded their two factor backup codes,
[00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:39.040]   there were, you know, their emergency codes, but just stored them in the clear and their
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:45.040]   download folder. And they may not know that what that's a problem. Why? And then Kaleid explains,
[00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:49.840]   it says here, let me help. Let's do this together. Because it's talking directly to employees,
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:55.200]   by the way, without a lot of work on your party, either this is all automatic, Kaleid is educating

[00:49:50.560 --> 00:50:02.000]   Kind of trouble brewing in Europe over oddly enough app tracking transparency. This seems to me
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:09.840]   like the EU and its following in the footsteps of Great Britain and Germany.
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:14.640]   Kind of looking at app tracking transparency. Do you think this is because
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:21.760]   Facebook complained and people like Facebook complained? Yes. Everyone tracking us is complaining.
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:26.640]   Everybody. You would think this is like the EU would like this, right?
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:29.520]   Well, Google doesn't care because they have perfect platform knowledge through Chrome and
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:33.360]   Android, but like Facebook, and it's not that anyone's losing advertising. The studies show that
[00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:36.560]   they're still getting advertising is just no longer going through Facebook's collection,
[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:39.600]   so they don't see it in Facebook, but they still see it in their own ledgers now.
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:44.720]   Yeah. Super interesting. Germany's antitrust watchdog is the latest probing ATT.
[00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:51.600]   The Federal Cartel office has just announced it's investigating the framework over concerns
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:57.120]   that Apple could be breaching competition rules by self-preferencing, which is not, you know,
[00:50:57.120 --> 00:51:02.800]   that might be a nuance, but that's a good point is first party tracking. Just as you said, Google
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:06.400]   doesn't lose the information they were having on this first party. Right.
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:11.200]   Knowledge on the iPhone. The thing to me is like, I understand why even Steve Jobs did I add,
[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:14.720]   like, so people who said Steve Jobs would never, he did. He did ever. He did I adds,
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:17.520]   but like, I don't think it's a good business for Apple. I think it's corrosive. I think they
[00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:21.760]   can make money in it, but it's not a business they should be in. And they're not even great at it.
[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:26.880]   Like they do ads in three places. They do it on, well, they do trailers in TV plus, but they do ads
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:32.080]   in news. They do ads in the app store. It's a terrible experience. Nobody likes it. I can't
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:36.800]   imagine it's a lot of business for them. Just get rid of advertising and be like,
[00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:40.000]   they're completely unadulterated. They don't need to do this. No controversies.
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:45.600]   Yeah. I agree. I think Google made a mistake by getting into the content game,
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:49.600]   getting into shopping, and then it looks like whether they're doing it or not,
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:53.360]   they're self-preferencing their properties in search results. It's a conflict of interest.
[00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:59.120]   It's an apparent conflict of interest, if not a real one. Yeah, just it's Apple doesn't.
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:02.560]   And if it was a huge percentage of their income, I think it would make sense, but it's really
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:03.840]   on. Right. And it just--
[00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:06.080]   They're fighting wars over. You have the worst businesses.
[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:08.800]   So they exempts their own apps from ATT.
[00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:15.120]   They don't. But their apps don't do any third party. So ATT is designed to prevent them from
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:19.920]   tracking between apps and across the web. And Apple only ever contains you in one app. And
[00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:23.600]   they say expressly, they don't share data from news, but data from any other app.
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:27.200]   So they don't do it, but it looks like people are like, well, why? And it's just--
[00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:30.160]   Because you don't get that pop up that says, do you want this app to drag you?
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:32.880]   Because it's not. People think they're exempting themselves. They're not.
[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:35.760]   Because they already know. We're not. Right. Okay.
[00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:37.440]   Yeah. All right. And it's also--
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:38.880]   And it's also-- How do you explain that?
[00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:41.440]   Right. Well, I didn't know. So there you go.
[00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:48.480]   But this is how transparency happens. I think a company like Apple particularly,
[00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:54.320]   they have their secrets, but it's not as though they're deliberately swirling away
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:57.360]   every piece of information they're not legally required to put out.
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:01.600]   But sometimes they're just not aware of how much damage they can do to themselves
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:06.000]   and to an ecosystem by simply not saying, here's our position, here's what we do,
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:10.480]   here's what we don't do. It's OK. I think it's perfectly appropriate for the EU,
[00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:14.640]   for the German government, for our government, for any government to say,
[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:19.760]   guess what? You're going to explain to us how the system works. You're going to defend it,
[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:22.400]   and you're going to convince us that this is an anti-competitive.
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:25.520]   Because the answer could be that, OK, now that we know how this works,
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:29.200]   this is an anti-competitive. Thanks for coming in. Go
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:32.240]   enjoy the gift shop on the way out of Congress.
[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:39.600]   And in any event, it will encourage companies like Apple and Microsoft and Google to be more
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:44.800]   transparent in the future to realize that we-- even Caesar's wife must be beyond reproach.
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:48.640]   It doesn't matter that you're internally, you've got standards and principles.
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:53.520]   You have to also make sure that it is known that you have standards and principles.
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:59.360]   Apple developer's lawsuit, the judge, has accepted a $100 million deal.
[00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:05.200]   But then says, but why do lawyers get $27 million that--
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:07.520]   That's a lot of photocopy.
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:15.200]   Like, that $3 check that you got from Bank of America, for some settlement, the lawyers got
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:21.280]   $27. It's actually pretty low for a lawyer. It's usually depending on--
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:23.760]   It's usually $27. It's like half, right?
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:29.760]   It's usually $25 to $40% is a pretty normal-- I come from a family of lawyers.
[00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:37.920]   $27% is actually pretty low, especially if they charge you for it, it'll be a lower number.
[00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:42.160]   If they don't charge you, then they're investing in your lawsuit.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:48.960]   If they're investing in your lawsuit, then they expect to get the percentage that they got,
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:51.920]   because you wouldn't win it without the-- like it's--
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:54.240]   Lawyers always win the argument.
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:58.640]   So the suit was over the same thing in the epic suits over, which is the requirement to use the
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:07.360]   app store. Apple has settled for $100 million, proposing a small developer assistance fund,
[00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:12.800]   which has created as part of the settlement, which will benefit over 99% of US iOS developers
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:16.640]   whose proceeds from app and in-app digital product sales through all associated accounts
[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:22.000]   were less than a million dollars. They've been very kind to the people who make less than a million
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:25.440]   dollars, because they got so much from the people who make more than a million dollars.
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:32.240]   You will be able to claim a sum from the fund ranging between $250 and $30,000,
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:36.080]   depending on your participation in the app store ecosystem.
[00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:42.800]   You have until May 20th. Well, wait a minute, is this an old story? Now I'm concerned. Oh, is that
[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:51.600]   of next year? You have until May 20th. Oh, so if-- okay, so if you didn't-- so actually,
[00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:57.280]   that period is obviously over. If you didn't request to participate, you will not be participating
[00:55:57.280 --> 00:56:00.240]   in this. So I hope you did. I hope you knew about it.
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:03.840]   It's like, I know this is not everyone, but like what really depresses me is that a lot of the
[00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:09.120]   people who are highly active in the anti-app store movement, the one that's named,
[00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:12.720]   are companies that are just-- if you spend two minutes looking into them, they are the worst
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:17.520]   companies. They have the grossest of allegations against them, and they conduct business in such
[00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:22.320]   a abhorrent way. I wish there was the indie developers that I love had the finances. Someone
[00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:28.160]   should just bankroll them. Let them get their concerns. They don't want to be the next app store.
[00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:31.760]   They're fighting-- we're having billion dollar companies fight trillion dollar companies to be
[00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:35.680]   the next gatekeeper. And I just want indie developers to get paid without all of their
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:40.400]   nonsense. People like Thompson, it should just be, you know, get right in my check apple. Just give
[00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:45.040]   them a spotify match. And like, you spend two minutes looking at the allegations, and you're just
[00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:49.680]   like, no, I don't want you to win either. I do that all the time. I mean, GitHub now has a way to
[00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:54.720]   donate to developers. And a lot of open source developers just give freely. And if I use their,
[00:56:54.720 --> 00:57:00.240]   you know, a lot of their tools and stuff, I will donate to them on GitHub. There are ways to--
[00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:04.400]   we can do that. But I think companies that are benefiting like Apple, that are benefiting for
[00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:10.640]   the laborers of these people should also kick in a little bit. It's again, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rodgers.
[00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:18.640]   She's in on everything. She talked to the lead counsel, Stephen Berman of Hoggins-Burman-Sobel
[00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:24.160]   Shapiro. She said, "You need to submit a mathematical breakdown of how much each class member would
[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:31.200]   receive if I gave you 25 million instead of 27 million." She says, "It could make a big difference
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:36.000]   for small developers who are the people taking the brunt of this." And she's right. That's why I
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:42.560]   want to see the numbers. I don't know if it'll make a big difference. I mean, it's 2%. It'll get
[00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:49.680]   them 2% more. I mean, it's fine. I mean, it is fine to ask for 2 million. And they can afford it,
[00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:53.360]   I'm sure. I'm sure they made a lot of money on this thing. But to say that it's actually, it's
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:58.880]   going to be--their check is going to be 3%. It's going to be 2% more. So if they got $300,
[00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:04.000]   they'll get $306. It's not like it's going to be either suddenly going to get $600.
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:11.920]   It's a lot of money. And I think that the whole thing's a sham. I think the whole way that we do
[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:16.400]   this--these class action lawsuits is a sham. So it's not like I'm agreeing with it. I'm just
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:19.200]   saying that-- >> But that deal. >> --that that-- >> --for her to say that somehow it's going to make
[00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:23.440]   a difference for the developers. >> Right. >> Yes. >> Well, that was super interesting.
[00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:28.160]   >> Go ahead, Andy. >> Can I just say that it has already made it a difference for developers.
[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:34.160]   >> Right. >> Unless-- >> No, it has now. >> --unless we all think that Apple is just going
[00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:40.960]   to start waiving fees for low-income--low-revenue developers to begin with. Sometimes, I think
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:46.000]   you're absolutely right that in terms of doing what you imagine a class action suit should do,
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:51.360]   providing relief and recompense to people who have been hurt by a company action. You're absolutely
[00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:57.280]   right. But this is the sort of stuff that it is--it's not just a nuisance, even if it's some--and
[00:58:57.280 --> 00:59:01.760]   even if it's $100 million, I know, well, Apple could just try to check from pocket cash.
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:06.160]   It's still a nuisance. It's still an inconvenience. It's still something that basically tells that--
[00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:08.320]   >> I'm not arguing with you. >> --okay, I just want to-- >> That's not my argument.
[00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:13.360]   >> I'm glad you brought it up. But that's not my argument. My argument is it's the change between
[00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:19.920]   27 and 25 that I think is the movie. I think that having a ruling that forces a company to go down
[00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:24.000]   a path, I think, is fine for a class action lawsuit. It's just the way that they're structured,
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:28.240]   that everyone gets $0.10. It's just kind of like it's really there for the lawyers.
[00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:33.680]   It pays the lawyers to do what they do. >> Well, but-- >> And that's what a judge could weigh in on.
[00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:35.520]   And it is only-- >> Mm-hmm.
[00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:40.480]   >> --2%, which is silly. But it's better than nothing. And I think judges should weigh in
[00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:42.720]   more on these kinds of things. >> Sure.
[00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:46.160]   >> Because-- >> It's just a funny detail to dig into.
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:47.120]   That's all this-- >> Strange.
[00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:52.000]   >> As someone who's grown up in that environment, for someone to dig into 2% on a 100-odd thing.
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.560]   >> Let's really do it. >> Well, or just have a perspective.
[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:59.200]   I'm sure that it was agreed to at some point. She's trying to change the agreement.
[00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:04.320]   That's the thing that it's just like-- and it's like if they had lost, they would have gotten nothing.
[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:05.680]   >> That's true. >> That's the risk.
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:08.880]   >> Yes, and that's the risk. >> One of the things I found super interesting was that--
[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:12.560]   like, this is the battle for the narratives. I think it's indisputable that Apple hasn't made--
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:16.640]   you know, Apple left to their own brothers, hasn't made significant improvements in the App Store
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:20.640]   since, I don't know, 2012. And the world has changed so much in the last decade.
[01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:23.760]   And the App Store really didn't account for that. Things that were fundamentally true,
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:27.840]   like, yes, you improved on the retail experience. You improved on a lot of the web delivery experiences.
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:31.280]   But the world is matured, and that's not enough anymore. And the App Store should have been evolving
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:34.880]   this whole time. And this has pushed a lot of that forward. But at the same time, you know,
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:38.720]   Apple was there saying, "You look on Twitter, and all you see is a lot of like,
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:42.480]   DHA--" they didn't use any names, obviously. But like, you know, DHA just spouting off about how
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:46.160]   angry everybody is, and someone else is saying, "You know, there's a revolt of developers." And
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:50.320]   you get to WWDC, and there are people there who've made like a fortune. Obviously, they'd want
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:54.480]   more money, but they made a fortune. They are so happy they have these frameworks. They talk
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:58.640]   about how easy it is to make apps, like especially the young developers. Like, they would never
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:01.280]   have been able to do this app on their own. They have all these frameworks. And they're happy.
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:05.200]   They'd like to adjust the bargain. But they're not like the rage hate-fueled mob that you
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:10.400]   sometimes see on Twitter. And it was interesting to see sort of those two things meet in the middle.
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:13.440]   I don't think either one of them is necessarily true. I think the App Store needs to evolve.
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:18.960]   But also like the rampant torches and pitchforks are probably quite a bit performative at this stage.
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:22.960]   - So I just was looking here is from tortreform.com.
[01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:28.400]   Article says, "Class-action lawyers often take more money from settlements than the members of the
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:33.040]   class." - So the lawyers make more lawyers always win.
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:38.000]   - Yeah, lawyers always win. - The value of a class-action lawsuit
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:45.680]   is to heavily reward a lawyer for bringing it up so that it can be handled. Because without the
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:50.800]   big payoff, these law firms wouldn't bother. And to go up against a very large company,
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:56.960]   the lawyers are spending millions of dollars on it. I'm sure they made a great margin. But
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:02.000]   they definitely did spend some expense on this case. My guess is they probably put five or 10
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.840]   million dollars for this thing to get it out. And some of those, they lose. And then that money
[01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:11.040]   just goes away. So they're in the same way that if you're an investor hopes that one out of every
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:16.400]   five or one out of every 10 things pay off, the lawyers are taking on these class-action
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:20.480]   lawsuits and they're basically speculating on whether they can win or not on their own
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:25.200]   skill set on their own, those kinds of things. So I think that it's not as unread as a sound.
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:28.720]   - I understand what's going on. - But what I would say is that I don't have...
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:34.080]   But I do think sometimes when you get these nitty... This one is not this way. But I have...
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:37.200]   The reason I'm so think... I thought about it this morning because I got some check about
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:40.080]   for $2.30. - Oh, I get those all the time.
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:47.040]   - I got a bag of pop chips once. There was a big lawsuit against pop chips for saying they
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:52.160]   were healthy or something. - But the value isn't the money to the class-action receivers. It's more
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:56.480]   most of the time. What it really is is it is telling that company they can't do that anymore.
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:04.960]   - Putting something on it. - Yeah. There was a class-action against pop chips from playing
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:11.440]   that their flavors, including barbecue, sweet potato, and cheddar, were all natural when they
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:16.640]   actually contained artificial and synthetic ingredients, which I knew, which is why I like pop chips.
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:22.880]   - Out of bulk, it's a feature. - It's a feature. It's like those balls that you read.
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:26.640]   I don't think that those are... Is there real cheese in there? I don't know.
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:32.240]   According to the settlement terms... - Excuse me. There was authentic CHEZ in every single...
[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:36.240]   - By the way, that's why they call it CHEZ. - They don't want to imply...
[01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:37.920]   - It's chocolatey, right? - Yeah.
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:42.240]   According to the settlement terms, class members can receive, and I was in this class,
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:48.480]   either a dollar cash refund or two $1 vouchers for up to 10 bags of pop chips products.
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:50.960]   Thank you. I'm so grateful.
[01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:54.880]   - Actually, no joke. - It was in 2013.
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:04:01.360]   - Ingraduate number three, remember that the product labels are...
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:03.920]   ingredients are by volume percentage.
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:08.720]   Dry cheese blend, wave from milk, semi-soft cheese, pasteurized milk, cheese culture,
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:10.320]   salt and enzymes. - Okay.
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:13.760]   - It's CHEZ-Pry products is what it is, but that's okay.
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:15.600]   You know what? I like vell meat. - I'm getting dairy.
[01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:19.760]   Everybody tells me there's some magic... when you're making queso,
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:23.200]   you need to put velveeta in because there's some ingredient...
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:27.520]   velveeta that makes CHEZ melt. So you put in a little...
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:32.320]   it's like a little sourdough starter. You put in a little velveeta, gets the other cheese to melt.
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:36.240]   - I think about it, but I just can't bring it. - I know. I can't eat it.
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:38.400]   - No. - I grew up on it.
[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:40.080]   - Sure. - And it just...
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:44.800]   - But I'm just kind of like... - The kid likes American cheese on his
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:51.200]   burgers. We've slowly weaned him off of that with just orange cheese, but of course no cheese is
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:57.200]   orange. It's orange because he put carrot in it. But at least it looks like it's velveeta.
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:01.520]   - It's user interface. I'm sure it's user interface. That's how you know it's cheese flavored.
[01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:07.760]   What's app is finally making it easy to move from Android to iOS?
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:13.840]   This is partly because of what's app itself. The app is adding a feature to help you move
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:20.000]   your content over, and it'll be part of Apple's moving to iOS tool. So Apple's going to help.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.960]   - Isn't it wild? It doesn't. - Because every other service you just log in and all your stuff comes down.
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:27.120]   - Why wouldn't they? - Well, I'll tell you why.
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:34.000]   Because the encryption is an issue, right? And encryption. In fact, this was to the horror of
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:41.840]   some defendants. This was the revelation that when you use iCloud backup, your WhatsApp messages
[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:46.960]   are backed up in the clear to Apple servers where they can be handled.
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:52.320]   - They're encrypted, but Apple has a key. Yeah. - Yeah. I call that not encrypted.
[01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:58.560]   - Hacksores can't get in, but Apple can't. - Okay. And is glad to hand them over.
[01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:06.080]   We won't go to politics of it, but nevertheless, this is still end-to-end encrypted.
[01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:09.520]   So that's the thing that has to be. - But other services, like you log in and
[01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:12.400]   they're end-to-end encrypted and there's no backup and it's still like,
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:17.200]   well, there is, I guess, a cloud store of truth for the messages or some persistence level
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:21.920]   and they come down. But this is great because it, and what I like is the info sec is really smart.
[01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:26.240]   It's like the, I got to talk to some of the Facebook, I can't call them Facebook anymore,
[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:28.720]   damn it. Some of the meta people and some of the other people about it.
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:33.360]   And it's super interesting because you, yeah. So basically you go through this process
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:36.880]   and it down, it puts like a little placeholder for the app on your screen.
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:41.040]   It doesn't download it until you tap it. But in the meantime, it takes all your messages,
[01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:44.720]   encrypts them in this bubble so that Apple can't see them, you know, Facebook can't see them.
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:48.640]   It just downloads directly to your phone and it's all put in the right place, but it stays
[01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:53.520]   encrypted until you tap on the app and then it finishes downloading the app and opens it.
[01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:58.800]   And then you have to still insert your WhatsApp credentials to unlock the secure bundle that has
[01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:03.520]   all of your messages in it. So it's highly resilient against people trying to abuse it,
[01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:07.200]   like trying to just like set up somebody else's messages. But it also manages to transport all
[01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:12.240]   that back history, which for some people is apparently everything like photos and videos going back
[01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:15.120]   years and years and years and years and years, just large amounts of data.
[01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:20.320]   Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think it's a good thing. And WhatsApp is widely used outside the US.
[01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:26.800]   It's the number one messaging app in many countries like Brazil. So this is good. This is in effect
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:33.440]   giving end to end encryption and portability to hundreds of millions, if not billions of users.
[01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:43.120]   Good thing. Let's see. We're going to get new iPad pros according to German in the fall.
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:50.640]   They better have an M1 in them. I don't know. New models on the way.
[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:54.960]   We're joking, but the rumor today, like there's a different rumor than Marx today about a large,
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:08:00.000]   like the bigger Mark and the guy from display consulting are going back and forth on this stuff.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.960]   But a bigger iPad pro like the 14, I had bigger pro. But not being a pro, like not having
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:09.920]   pro version, not having a mini LED display. And it's like you're making a bigger peasant iPad.
[01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:14.320]   I don't understand anything. Oh, wait. None of these rumors are actually true until Apple ships
[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:19.360]   something. Yes. Yes. It doesn't make sense that they make a fort. Well, right? I mean,
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:22.800]   if you're making unless the cost or exor, I don't know. Yeah, maybe they can't.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.080]   The only part of the argument that made any sense to me was the idea that with the cost of those
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:33.520]   traditional panels coming down that they could offer a 14 inch experience for pretty much not
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:38.720]   much money, not money more than a point nine inch experience. Yeah, exactly. Or if they wanted to,
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:44.720]   if they wanted to make an offering to the creative community and the artistic community,
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:49.600]   to say here is more surface for you to draw on. Here is just that little extra space for you
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:52.320]   to have your timelines when you're editing video and doing stuff like that.
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:58.400]   And the idea of having building a 14 inch panel with the exact same specs at the 12.9 inch pro,
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:02.640]   that might be kind of deadly. I mean, because at some point, you'd be at some point, if you're
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:08.960]   trying to make a $2,000 iPad, you may as well start making a $2,500 Mac tablet, I think at that point.
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:14.400]   So it could so that's the only but as Renee says, believe nothing. It's something that's
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:19.680]   supposed to go up next year. Yeah. Yeah. So that's the German rumor was it would be with the M2 chip,
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:26.960]   it would be a mini LED display 14.1 inches high end high end and you're right, $2,000.
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:31.280]   I mean, Apple could do anything, but it's just not the tick talk that they've been doing for a
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:36.160]   long time. I mean, usually March is the time that they release the new iPad and it's kind of the
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:40.480]   framework for that. So it's not that they couldn't do it in the fall or they have never done something
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:44.480]   in the fall, but it seems like they have a lot to release in the fall right now and between the phone
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:51.920]   and the new Macs and potentially updates to Apple. I want to see an M1 mini to be honest with you.
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:58.240]   I don't really want a 14 inch iPad. That sounds awfully big, but I would use my mini all the time
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:02.720]   and I think it'd be really great if I could. If I could. The thermal envelope would be hard.
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:08.560]   Yeah. Yeah. I guess it already strains it and I'm in an air. Does it really? Oh, the air? Yeah.
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:16.480]   And I'm also kind of I really wish that Apple would try to figure out how to make the iPad mini
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:26.320]   into into essentially the the the the I. I'm sorry that the iPad mini is now like so expensive
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:32.720]   and so full featured when I think that the butter zone for it is a $299 device, which is the big
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:38.960]   screen content consumption and limited content creation device that I loved in previous iPad
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:44.240]   mini. It's it's just such a gorgeous form factor. It's like the perfect size much bigger than your
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:48.560]   phone screen. So you'll have a much better experience if you're reading or watching video or even
[01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:54.160]   trying to compose a compose an email with it with a keyboard, but still so small that you don't feel
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:58.400]   like you're breaking your promise that no, no, honey, I promise we're not no work this weekend. I'm
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:02.320]   just gonna bring the phone and I just want to read. I just got to read the comics all weekend. Yeah,
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:12.880]   exactly. Let's see. I want to get everything excited about past Keys Leo. I don't know if I'm
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:18.800]   ruining your your show. No, no, no, no, no, no, we mentioned on Twitter, I said this is one of the
[01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:23.360]   I think one of the most important announcements from WWDC, not most important to Apple, but most
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:28.960]   important to users Google and my other software managers were happy. Were they part that I loved
[01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:33.120]   just like they weren't like one password. And I think a couple are like, we're joining this alliance,
[01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:35.840]   you know, we're all like it wasn't like, Oh, what are you doing to us with a whole,
[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:39.360]   no, it's like we want to we want to make things better for everybody too. Well, how would one
[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:47.280]   password work with so the premise of past Keys is no more passwords that the biometric identification
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:53.920]   in your phone, or in some cases, your Mac is sufficient to prove you are who you say you are,
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:59.280]   that every time you visit a new site that wants you to sign up, that new site will be sent a
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:05.440]   it's a hash of your, I think of your public token. Yeah. And that site. And it will have a token.
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:10.400]   And all you'll have to do is authenticate and the site will say, Oh, yeah, Leo, welcome.
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:12.640]   And that's it. And that's it. We'll do now.
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:18.560]   Passwords. Yeah. And a lot of you see that single sign on with individuals like enterprise,
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:21.920]   like solving this for enterprise, for example, like, you know, if you're in a business,
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:25.680]   how you want to share your past Keys, I think that's going to be a ripe area for for a little
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:30.000]   one. Also, it's going to take a long, it's going to take a long time, you know, for this to happen.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.960]   And for for one password and last pass, having the past them adopting the past key means that I
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:39.360]   get to use the past key with their service. Right. So I, so I'm not, I don't have that because right
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:44.000]   now the weakest point in last pass or one password is the one password that you use to get in.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.800]   So getting rid of that is what makes them much, much more secure. Good point. And then they provide
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:56.000]   that service to get to, because like for me, I have a very long phrase that I use in last pass to get
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:04.000]   in. And, and I, but then everything else, unless they limit me, everything else is a 26 character hash.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:08.960]   You know, just every website that I go to, everything that I log into is a 20, I just have it set to
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:14.640]   26 letters and it just puts in random stuff. And so I'm already gone way down that path of I just
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:22.400]   need that. So being able to have the passcode be able to do that just with last pass, for my case,
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:28.000]   would make me feel much more secure. Also one password would, they've joined the Fido Alliance.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:36.640]   They would do Apple sort of solving this by talking about storing your pass keys in the in
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:41.680]   iCloud. iCloud will have a secure on Clive, where your your pass keys can be safely stored.
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:46.320]   You of course keep your public, your private key to yourself, but the all the keys that you've
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:51.520]   established with all these sites have to be stored somewhere. And so by iCloud doing that,
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:56.080]   and by the way, Steve Gibson's concern last Tuesday, and we'll probably talk about it today,
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:14:02.480]   was that's fine as long as Apple lets you export that so you can move somewhere else. And they do,
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:07.440]   right? They, they answer. Yeah, absolutely. But what one password saying, yeah, but the problem
[01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:14.240]   is that they're tied to this device. And so we want to provide the authentication back end,
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:18.960]   the web auth and back end, so that you're not tied to an individual device.
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:24.720]   It gets complicated play. Yeah, this is this is their video here. I'll show you.
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:34.080]   So let me turn on the audio. Oh, that's on. You save your credentials to one password.
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:41.040]   The audio is just music. So we don't care. So you still get the benefit of it, but you don't
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:45.200]   have to use a phone. You can, in other words, you could authenticate without biometrics. I
[01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:50.160]   perversely prefer to use biometrics. Yeah, I guess if one password says, well, you had to use
[01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:57.120]   biometrics to get into one password, that would be okay. We just need everybody to buy in,
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:00.400]   or it's never going to be a thing, and it needs to be a thing because passwords are such a bad
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:03.920]   solution. I think it's going to happen fast, actually. I think it's going to have a fashion.
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:07.680]   It's a thing of the past. Social engineering is a thing of the past. I think the main
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:13.040]   poison looks even better, but it eliminates so many common. Yeah, so many of the common attacks.
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:16.080]   There'll be new ones, of course, but it prevents so many of the existing ones.
[01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:20.480]   So if you have, when you sign into Windows for instances these days,
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:26.000]   you don't enter a password, even the first time you sign in, it says, what's your Microsoft
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:33.120]   account email? You enter that and it says, oh, good. I'm sending to your phone three number.
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:37.600]   You identify that number on your phone, and of course you log in with a authentication
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:44.080]   using touch ID or face ID or your PIN, and then it will ask you again, okay,
[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:51.200]   you enter the, say, the number is 24, and then it does another face ID, and then without any
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:55.280]   password, you're logged into your Microsoft account. So that's the kind of thing we'd see everywhere.
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:58.160]   Of course, the problem you worry about, and this is why they have to iron this out,
[01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:02.640]   as YouTube was doing that for a little while, where they would say, open up YouTube on your phone
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:05.920]   to log into an account that you have been in, and then the phone didn't work.
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:12.560]   I literally for a while until they fixed it, there was like two weeks I could get into one of my
[01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:18.960]   YouTube accounts. I found out about that. It turns out YouTube, again, we might have mentioned
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:22.640]   before, I apologize, but YouTube has two different authentication systems. One for sign-in,
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:27.600]   one for verification, the sign-in one was fully, was feature complete, the verification one was
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:33.280]   not. So where the sign-in one would say, pick a device, pick an authenticator, we'll text you
[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:38.000]   a message, give you multiple options, the verification one would only pick a random device
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:43.200]   that you may or may not have with you and say, please open that device. And everybody got locked
[01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:48.800]   out of YouTube every time they traveled. I had the device opened, I'm staring at it,
[01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:51.760]   the number pops up, and when I selected nothing happens.
[01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:52.960]   It was just like, you were--
[01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:55.360]   I was on iPhone 7, I sent back to Apple three years ago.
[01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:59.200]   Oh, that's not good. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So that's part of the reason why this has to be portable.
[01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:03.680]   That's why Apple wants to put it in the cloud. So it isn't exactly tied to your phone. So one
[01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:07.680]   password, last password, is saying, or if you don't want to use iCloud, you could use us as
[01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:12.960]   the store. Somebody's got a store somewhere so that you're not tied to that device.
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:18.240]   And again, whoever it is that does that, there's another decade of the transition. I mean,
[01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:21.840]   a lot of it, I think, will happen over the next two or three years. So within two or three years,
[01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:28.320]   60, 70, 80% of the things we do will not require, because it'll feel weird. It'll go from,
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:34.880]   we're all used to passwords, to why am I doing a password? And should I even be on this site?
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:37.920]   That's the direction it will go. And I think--
[01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:42.640]   That's why I think it's going to happen fast. With Google, Microsoft, and Apple all in,
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:46.720]   it depends on how long those implementations take to get to the phones. But once they're on the
[01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:51.120]   phones, I can't imagine any site not turning it on, except for the blogs and stuff.
[01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:55.120]   Right? Yeah, exactly. I mean, the thing is, is that it's the smaller site.
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:18:04.000]   Oh, guys. Yeah. I mean, our Twit community, our discourse forum supports squirrel. It wasn't so
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:10.880]   hard to do it. So I certainly would be implementing that kind of thing as soon as I could,
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:16.240]   if it's-- It might not take quite so long either, because most-- I mean, if you're building a website
[01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:19.440]   and you're doing e-commerce on that site, you're probably not writing your own solution. You are
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:23.760]   probably releasing a solution that's already been built, and you're probably going to select a
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:30.080]   solution that has the most up-to-date, easy-to-use thing. Yeah, word press will do it. That's 60%
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:36.800]   right there. It's only going to take a few of the big guys to come along to make this really happen.
[01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:41.760]   I think it-- I hope you may be right, Alex, but I do hope it happens quick.
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:46.000]   And it's the same team at Apple that made the-- You know, you got a text message
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.840]   and it autofills it for you. It's that team. So as delighted as you are by that, I'm imagining
[01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:53.200]   we're going to be as delighted by that. Do they say-- Go ahead, Alex.
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:58.480]   That's always a great-- That's always a great implication. I love a team that creates a feature
[01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:02.880]   because something annoyed the hell out of them personally. And they realized that they had the
[01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:07.280]   power to make their phone do this thing. Those are the people who find great solutions to problems,
[01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:11.920]   and having them on the solutions for passwords is just, yeah, do that thing. Do--
[01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:17.680]   be the most selfish team whatsoever. Do everything for your own benefit because it will benefit all
[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:24.320]   of us. Do they say anything about TVOS in the subsequent? Yes. Not in the keynote, but TVOS is
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:29.200]   getting a couple things that are interesting to it, like a minority of people. Samsung refuses to
[01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:32.880]   license Dolby Vision, so a lot of people with Samsung TVs have been really upset that they
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:37.120]   couldn't get the same quality of experience. So now they're going to support HDR 10 plus,
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:41.840]   which is not exactly the same thing, but it's better than HDR 10. So I'm super happy because
[01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:49.200]   the Duke Samsung QDL OLEDs are fantastic, fantastic TVs, and everyone was waiting for the sharp or
[01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:54.960]   some other version to come out instead. But now that works. And they just fixed a lot of little
[01:19:54.960 --> 01:20:00.160]   things along the way, like things that were not quite audio cinema file perfect. They did a lot
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:05.760]   of work. I needed a new Apple TV, and I waited till after WWC to buy it, just in case. But I did
[01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:12.800]   buy it for an HD TV. So I didn't get the 4K version. I just got the HD. And it actually is on sale
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:18.720]   right now, which is concerned to me. But I needed it. And for the gym, because we didn't have our
[01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:25.360]   Apple TV failed. So do you think they'll be a new Apple TV next week? My guess is that they didn't
[01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:29.440]   do a big update, and they're also waiting on new hardware. Because again, my understanding is the
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:34.560]   experience for the VR headset is going to be very similar to Apple TV. It's basically instead of
[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:39.120]   getting a $300 box for your family, you'll get a $3,000 box for your face. That's a way better
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:44.320]   business to be in. It'll have a similarity in feature sets. So they'll have hardware that's
[01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:48.320]   capable of taking advantage of a living room experience for everything they're rolling out
[01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:55.280]   for the head experience. Speaking of a $3,000 experience, we talked on Sunday on Twitch,
[01:20:55.280 --> 01:21:01.440]   you and I and the rest of the panel about the Apple car interface that they showed.
[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:04.720]   Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot. The one other thing that people were super happy about is Nintendo
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:08.560]   controller support, because people were super jealous that had Xbox and PlayStation. Now it's
[01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:24.880]   gotten Nintendo. So yes, right. Okay, fine. I mean, okay, good. I guess that display that they
[01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:31.680]   showed, which obviously no car maker is going to implement. What do you think Apple intended?
[01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:40.080]   I don't know if it's no car maker. I think if you're in a commoditized section of a group of
[01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:46.480]   cars and you want to stand out and you're in the middle of the pack or the bottom of the pack,
[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:49.280]   Apple probably won't. If you're the bottom of the pack, they probably won't want to do something
[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:53.840]   with you, but maybe. But if you're in the middle of the pack and trying to move up a position or two,
[01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:57.520]   you know, the idea, unless you're really good at your industrial design, you may say,
[01:21:57.520 --> 01:22:00.160]   hey, I'm going to put this in. I'm going to take advantage of the fact that Apple's going to talk
[01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:04.320]   about me on people are going to. I mean, I have to say that after looking at that interface,
[01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:08.480]   that's what I want. I got back in my car and I was like, well, this is bad. You know, like,
[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:12.400]   you know, and it's kind of ruins the kind of as an Apple user, because the thing is I think that
[01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:16.800]   there is there is a value to Apple users who want their entire environment to be what it is.
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:22.000]   And there's a lot of them and they will buy, they'll buy things because it has the
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:25.040]   the integrates with the Apple. This is what Apple's really good at.
[01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:28.880]   Integrating everything together and the idea that their car is going to tie into all of that
[01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:34.400]   is something that I know that as soon as a car comes out, if it's all electric and it has that
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:39.040]   interface, the chances of me buying a different car, if it doesn't have that is very low, like,
[01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:43.440]   you know, and, you know, like I would definitely want that experience unless it would have to be
[01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:47.680]   really the issue is it would have to be really far behind. But if it's neck and neck, which I
[01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:51.520]   for me, most cars are neck and neck. There's like, you know, three or four different
[01:22:52.400 --> 01:23:00.240]   kinds of cars in my eyes. And so if it's if it's like a Ford Fusion, you know, across the board,
[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:06.240]   right, you know, if it's if it's a Honda or, you know, the Accord, the Fusion, whatever the Kia one
[01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:10.480]   is, all of those ones in that price range, and it's electric or whatever. And it has that in one of
[01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:13.920]   them has that interface, they're going to see a bump. Just the way AT&T saw a bump when they when
[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:20.720]   they took on the phone was. Do you think though, Mark Gurman says it's the foreshock to the Apple car
[01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:24.880]   earthquake? Do you think that's I think there's a I think there was something that was missing
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:27.600]   though in a lot of the analysis because also people went and asked the car companies,
[01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:30.160]   they're going to do it and they wouldn't say anything. But like, would you expect them to
[01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:35.840]   Osborne their current cars and car play solutions? No. Yeah, but nobody's going to wait a year or
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:40.000]   two. Yeah, nobody's going to wait three years if they need a car today. But the interesting stat
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:43.680]   was that Apple said like, and as far as I know, this is true because a bunch of us checked like
[01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:49.280]   17, was it 16 or 79% of people who are 79% of people who are going to buy a new car, not a used car,
[01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:55.920]   but a new car want car play on it. And that means 79% of new car customers are iPhone users. And that
[01:23:55.920 --> 01:24:00.720]   gives Apple an incredible amount of leverage because outside the EV makers who are software
[01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:05.200]   first companies, these companies don't have any idea how to do software and they're increasingly
[01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:09.360]   not wanting to put up with the pain of doing software. And if Apple can come in and give them
[01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:13.840]   something that makes their cars more marketable to an affluent, a very large affluent segment of
[01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:17.520]   the economy, I think we're going to be surprised at how many of these start shipping in the next
[01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:22.240]   year. So you don't think this is Apple's kind of way of wink, wink, nudge, nudge, and wait till you see
[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:29.920]   a car that we make? I think the car is still a long way away. This is the rocker before the iPhone.
[01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:35.040]   I do think this is a if to answer your question, I think that this is a way for Apple to start
[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:39.360]   making some money or some juice off of the research that they're putting into the car program,
[01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:43.440]   given that the what they're going to do with this is probably still very much up in the air. If the
[01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:48.880]   if the amount if the revolving door in front of that lab of people entering the team and leaving
[01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:54.960]   the team is anything to go by, I was very I've been looking at that. It wasn't even a demo,
[01:24:54.960 --> 01:25:01.360]   it was just an art mockup. I'm really surprised. It seemed like a very, very non-Apple way of
[01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:05.920]   explaining how they're doing that it was basically here is an enormous display. Let's just fill it
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:11.280]   with crap. I mean, let's put lots of stuff that have nothing has nothing to do with the operation
[01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:15.760]   of a car or the entertainment features. Let's be distracted by what my schedule is. My calendar
[01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:21.200]   is stuff is nothing that would make me feel as though I'm going this is going to benefit my life
[01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:27.040]   in any meaningful way. You don't have a car with car play, do you, Andy? I rent lots of cars.
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:34.480]   Because my I have my calendar every day when I get my car. But would it be like a fixed feature
[01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:40.080]   on the thing? Why not? Why not basically making it make it so that unused space is very, very
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:46.480]   important. And here's something that makes it attractive and we'll take the faux leather from
[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:52.080]   Steve Jobs, a golf stream and we'll make that your faux leather stitched fake console. I mean,
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:56.240]   I think I just I just think that I'll tell you why the calendar is great because if you've got an
[01:25:56.240 --> 01:26:01.040]   appointment and you've got to be there, you can tap the appointment and it will navigate to it.
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:05.360]   This also wasn't the real one that I really wanted to be really silly or stuff like that.
[01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:09.360]   And they said it's going to be branded that all the time. When this all rolls out, it's going to be
[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:12.800]   it's going to be car manufacturer branded. It's not going to look like this. It's going to look like
[01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:17.680]   a Chrysler or like a Toyota or like a so it's going to look very different than this. And and
[01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:21.360]   of all the cars I've gotten into, I've just never seen anyone complain about their screen being too
[01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:28.560]   big. Like I really wish this I really wish the screen was was smaller. You know, they mostly talk
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:33.120]   about how great it is the especially Tesla drivers of giant. Yeah, but practically that's
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:39.680]   Gumbotron. But that's to realize that it's a traditional screen that's set into a conventional
[01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:46.480]   dashboard. The design the design of which has been scrutinized with hundreds of millions of dollars
[01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:52.240]   of brainpower and technology. I mean, you think that Johnny Ives is a design walk. You think that
[01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:57.840]   you think that Mac people are design wonks. I have never met more intense design wonks
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:02.240]   than people who design cars. And I really think that they're going to want to have to put their
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:08.240]   they will want to say that we're not just like Apple will not let you inside load apps onto a phone
[01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:11.840]   because look, that would be a disastrous experience. And we don't want our customers have bad
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:18.960]   experiences. I think that a lot of designers, even the ones that are making luxury cars where
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:23.440]   the differences are very, very fine, are going to want to say that we are not going to create a
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:28.160]   put into feature that will allow people to have an ugly dashboard design or dashboard design.
[01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:32.480]   That's not functional. We're going to design a control system. Let me show you something that
[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:38.800]   is shipping now the Mercedes EQS dashboard, which is all screen all the way across. This is the only
[01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:42.800]   car I know of that actually could do. I mean, there are three different screens, but that could
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:47.600]   do it. And even then I look at that, I go, okay, like the worst part is that is that as soon as I
[01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:52.240]   saw the Apple one, I was like, I don't want to buy another car until that's available. And I literally
[01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:56.320]   look at every car I sit in now going, wow, that dashboard stinks. You know, like, you know, and it
[01:27:56.320 --> 01:28:01.600]   just it literally just seeing Apple put that up had me immediately start having a
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:05.440]   that's what is their way of saying, wait, do we do a car? You're going to love it.
[01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:08.400]   It'll be BMW first, all right? Like we all know it's going to be BMW.
[01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:10.960]   They seem to have the partnership. Yeah.
[01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:17.920]   Just speaking of personal preferences, though, if so, if that becomes like the norm for car design,
[01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:22.320]   they had better put so many controls on the steering wheel, like I like, I agree,
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:26.000]   one racing wheel. That's not what this is doing. That's not what it's doing.
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:29.440]   Flast doesn't give you feedback. And when you're trying to, all you need,
[01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:33.200]   all you want to do is that you are freezing. You're boiling up in this random model.
[01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:37.280]   Three next time. Yeah. Because model, let me take it all those controls out. It's all on the screen.
[01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:40.000]   You can play a Galaga. I mean, you can play Galaga. What else do you need?
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:43.120]   It's I think it's a big mistake. I agree with you. You need some physical controls.
[01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:47.760]   And you get a yoke. But remember, I think within Apple car and what Apple's looking at down the
[01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:52.240]   road is a driverless vehicle, right? So the only thing I'd caution you on Leo is that
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:55.360]   the team that made car play, I don't know if it's changed, but it was a springboard team.
[01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:58.560]   It wasn't a special projects group that does Titan. This looks like springboard.
[01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:02.640]   Yeah. Yeah. There might be philosophical similarities, but I wouldn't think that this
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:07.840]   is actual project Titan tech. Yeah. Is this the Sam said that this is using projection,
[01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:13.680]   that this isn't a car OS? Andrew has a car Apple Google has a car OS.
[01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:16.960]   Yes. It's not an embedded system. This is not a this is not a Titan would be.
[01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:21.520]   This is basically a handshake. So you come in your iPhone like car plays today.
[01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:25.680]   It's a projector. Yeah. The car has a his own embedded system, like whether it's Q and X or
[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:29.040]   embedded Android or embedded Linux or whatever, it negotiates with your iPhone. It says we've
[01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:33.440]   identified it. You have these capabilities and then it takes the iPhones input and creates
[01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:37.120]   right the car play experience and then it communicates back and forth to maintain it.
[01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:42.240]   I have to say I have it and I love it. I would never buy a car without it.
[01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:49.200]   So Apple's won me over. Yeah. And I think that again, the the trajectory oftentimes with
[01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:54.720]   or without an Apple car is is really that you get all you should do is get one one company to do it.
[01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:58.000]   Right. And then they show greater just like a sales. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:01.120]   And then other people start to turn you then you start you just you just take the first one and
[01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:04.960]   you just start flipping them, you know, one at a time over and not all of them will go.
[01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:09.200]   They'll always be a choice to not have the Apple whatever. But the question is, is you know,
[01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:14.880]   but I think it could grow to, you know, a reasonable percentage over a decade, you know, of of time.
[01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:17.680]   It's not like it's going to happen, you know, immediately. And what's it really interesting for
[01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:21.760]   Apple is they're getting to eat the cake and have their cake and eat it to the have they might
[01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:25.600]   provide something for the cars and at the same time they have a car. You know, but I don't think
[01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:29.040]   I don't think these two initiatives have to be connected to each other at all. Like, you know,
[01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:32.080]   one is just making it available for all the cars and the other one is trying to figure out if
[01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:36.000]   they want to build a car. Let me take a little break here. We have more to talk about. Sorry,
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:41.440]   Andy, I'll get you first when we come back. It's like Jeopardy. You start you'll start with
[01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:43.920]   double jeopardy when we return. How about that? Okay.
[01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:49.360]   Draw back. I've heard that I've heard that phrase in my context, my future before.
[01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:55.600]   All right. So they've brought to you by Melissa. If you're in business, you know, those
[01:30:55.600 --> 01:31:02.720]   customer lists are so vital. They're so important. But you also probably know they are rotting away
[01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:09.120]   on those hard drives right now because people move names change addresses, email addresses change,
[01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:15.520]   and poor data quality can cost you a lot, an average of $15 million a year.
[01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:20.800]   That's a lot of money. And of course, the longer poor quality data stays in your system,
[01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:27.760]   the more losses you can accumulate. So to make your business success continue,
[01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:33.520]   you got to keep your customer information up to date. And that's why you need Melissa,
[01:31:33.520 --> 01:31:40.080]   leading provider of global data quality and address management solutions. It's also good for customer
[01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:44.640]   service. Right. If you're on the line with the customer is upset already and you say, oh, and
[01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:50.640]   you live in Miami, right? And they say, no, I live in Illinois, they they're not going to be happy.
[01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:57.040]   They're going to really doubt your credibility. So it's important to have this information accurate.
[01:31:57.040 --> 01:32:02.960]   Melissa's cloud based data cleaning and enrichment tool is easy to use. You can upload a file.
[01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:09.760]   CSV file, Excel file into the first tab, you copy and paste your data, your CSV file into the
[01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:14.720]   second tab, you select a data quality service, you click next, you map the input fields, you say,
[01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:19.600]   yeah, that's the name, that's the address, select the output fields, the data to append and process
[01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:24.640]   your list. Very easy. This is their cloud based solution. They of course also have on-prem.
[01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:30.800]   If you prefer that, they even have apps. They have the lookups app on iOS and Android,
[01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:36.880]   which let you search names, addresses and more right there in the phone. You can you can get
[01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:43.600]   batch address cleaning, which will process an entire address list for accuracy and completeness.
[01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:47.920]   You can use data matching to eliminate clutter and duplicates, which will save you money and
[01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:55.360]   postage, right? Name verification, which actually is really important these days for security,
[01:32:55.360 --> 01:33:02.480]   if nothing else, parse and standardize first and last names for personalization. Melissa can do
[01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:09.440]   so much with this data. You can use you can analyze your data to improve quality over time. You can
[01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:15.840]   verify up to 95% of bad email addresses right from the database. And of course, your data is

[01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:26.160]   in club twit who have really helped us dramatically during the ups and downs now that my Bitcoin
[01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:32.160]   wallet is worth a third of what it was worth before we need you. So that's a joke, obviously,
[01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:37.200]   because the Bitcoin wallet is inaccessible. But we do try to make it worthwhile $7 a month to join
[01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:42.960]   club twit. There's an annual fee, annual fee as well if you want to do it that way, I know subscription.

[01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:04.080]   maybe because I'm active in there and I love it, is the discord. We have a special members only
[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:10.560]   discord because it's members only. It's a great place to hang a great socialization area. You don't

[01:35:55.840 --> 01:36:01.120]   very excited to buy really going to be going to be something I think a lot of people will want.
[01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:05.520]   We're going to use club to it to start up shows with that that don't have enough listeners to do
[01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:10.160]   advertising support. And I want I think we're going to end up doing a lot more of that. That's
[01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:14.800]   how this week in space started. Of course, now they have advertising support. So we really
[01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:20.880]   appreciate your contribution club to it. Thank you in advance. Go to twit.tv slash club.
[01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:33.120]   Twit. Let's see here. What else have we to talk about? Well, the Dutch dating apps apparently have
[01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:39.760]   gained some ground in this never ending. We are always at war with the never ending battle.
[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:46.880]   The the red light district of Amsterdam rejoices. Yeah. Apple has updated rules
[01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:52.320]   which so far the Dutch regulator seems to have approved of. That's really good news.
[01:36:52.320 --> 01:37:01.120]   So Apple will meet the requirements set under European and Dutch competition rules they say.
[01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:08.960]   The rules only affect Dutch dating apps. But it gives you some idea of what Apple will do with
[01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:17.440]   giving enough pressure. They're going to they're going to they could they change the language to say
[01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:23.040]   your payment app your payment will this is what the user will see when they look at the app.
[01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:28.000]   You're payment will be managed by the developer. You'll no longer be transiting acting with Apple.
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:32.240]   All purchases will be processed by a service provider selected by the developer.
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:35.440]   The developer will be responsible for the payment methods and related features such as
[01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:40.080]   subscriptions and funds. App Store features such as your stored app store payment method.
[01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:44.880]   Subscription management and refund requests will not be available. See, that's the best part of
[01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:52.960]   the app store. These I can cancel subscriptions. I love that. Before they would see buttons to say
[01:37:52.960 --> 01:38:00.160]   continue or cancel. Now they say I understand. However, you say that in Dutch. They won't have to
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:05.760]   choose between a third party in that payment or an external payment link. They can use both if they
[01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:11.040]   want. They'll also be able to show how much something will cost Apple use ever rules saying.
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:16.320]   The link to the external payment could not include the price of the items available on the website.
[01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:21.520]   In other words, it's you know, 30% less or whatever actually won't be that much. 3% less.
[01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:28.480]   Anyway, but we kid but this is this is one of the areas of Apple's business that I've always
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:34.000]   always thought was overdue for revolution. I'm not really necessarily talking about external
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:39.520]   payment systems. I'm talking about you have so many rules for their developers that are just
[01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:44.960]   asinine such as no, you can't link back to your own site. No, no, no, you can't make special
[01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:48.640]   op. No, you can't talk to these people at all. You have to go through the rest at all times.
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:51.520]   You don't have to. No, no, no. We're not going to let you learn anything about the customers
[01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:56.480]   we're using your own. There are a lot of stuff that is just again when you've never launched an
[01:38:56.480 --> 01:39:00.320]   app store before, you don't know how well this is going to turn out and you're just talking about
[01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:04.160]   things that maybe would be good for you and good for the app store in a boardroom.
[01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:09.200]   That's one thing. But after we have so much experience that these all just seemed, you know,
[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:14.800]   somebody in the chat room says that, I don't know how true this is, but in the Netherlands,
[01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:19.520]   women are much more likely to ask you out. So you don't really need a dating app. These are
[01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:25.840]   mostly just for professionals. I don't know if that's true. Maybe somebody from the
[01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:30.320]   Netherlands could tell us what's the case? What's the case here? But it was match.com. All of those
[01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:36.320]   match apps that were complaining the Dutch dating dating apps. I'll start doing scare quotes when I
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:43.600]   say that dating apps. Apple has made a deal with Major League Soccer. I don't know. Yes and no.
[01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:52.480]   All MLS matches around the world for the next 10 years will be available in an app that's available
[01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:58.960]   only on the Apple TV. It's not Syria, Alio. It's not. It's like, you're still going to be able to
[01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:05.200]   watch your Manchester United. This is North American. Yeah, MLS. That's rough. No, I'm just saying,
[01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:09.920]   like, if it was Premier League, people would be rioting. Yeah. But if it was Premier League,
[01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:15.280]   people would be rioting. And I believe it's it'll be, you know, Apple TV also, I believe it'll be the
[01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:18.880]   Apple TV app on a lot of stuff. It's the app. So you're roke. So wherever else you have the
[01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:25.120]   Apple TV app, yeah. Yeah. So it's like summer free. But it is an app within the app. Right. So it's
[01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:31.200]   like having an Netflix app. It'll be an MLS app inside your Apple TV app. Yeah. Is that how it works?
[01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:35.360]   If you have an Apple TV app, I don't know. I don't, I don't use those. So I don't let my TV
[01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:40.480]   connect to like, I don't, I don't let my TV. If you know anything about surveillance, never connect
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:46.960]   your TV to it, especially has voice control. Never, ever connect your TV to the internet. Anyway, but
[01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:53.920]   the, the, what I, it's going to be really good for, I mean, there's going to be people that are
[01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:57.040]   set that they have to buy an Apple TV. But for MLS, it's going to be really good. They're going to
[01:40:57.040 --> 01:41:01.280]   get a lot more exposure. They're going to be available in a lot more places to watch it. You
[01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:05.680]   know, they're, and they got a big check. You know, so, so I think that they, for MLS, for the, for
[01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:09.920]   the players, they're going to get a lot more exposure. Because now you can, what's a revolutionary
[01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:16.240]   here is that you can now watch any game anywhere, you know, there. And so you're not, you don't have
[01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:20.480]   all these windowing and all the other things that go on. I mean, I, you know, you can pay for the NFL
[01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:24.240]   app or the NFL streaming or whatever. And then you still can't watch the games you want.
[01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:27.840]   Right. So, you know, like it's just complete. It's a complete, you know,
[01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:33.600]   so there'll be no local blackouts. There will be a, if you're an Apple TV plus subscriber,
[01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:39.360]   you will get a certain number of free MLS and League Cup matches, which is nice. So that's going
[01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:48.240]   to help promote, I think, soccer in the US. And then you can pay and get the full streaming package.
[01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:53.360]   It also potentially allows Apple to innovate because they're the only ones broadcasting.
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:58.960]   And so a lot of like what you can do at a stream on a stream is limited by the broadcasters because
[01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:03.120]   they're way behind, you know, so they're like 1080i and, you know, all this other, you know,
[01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:08.560]   obviously more 4K content on my YouTube TV, which is great because I pay for the 4K.
[01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:11.120]   Yeah, right. There's a lot more 4K content. They used to be.
[01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:16.080]   And, but now Apple's going to be, they could go, they could do like, this is a great place
[01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:23.360]   to do 4K, 4K 60, 4K 120, all things that brought, you could never broadcast out,
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:26.320]   but Apple can do it now. They can, they have something that they can show.
[01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:29.760]   So MLS is going to help with the production of it is like they,
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:34.160]   Oh, yeah. Yeah. I bet you they will. I would be if they, if they, whoever did that,
[01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:38.800]   if they don't do it, whoever made the, whoever decided that should not be at Apple anymore.
[01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:42.720]   I mean, because this is the huge lab for them to be able to take,
[01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:47.840]   yes, be able to take MLS and make it point so that this is a, this is, they don't have to deal
[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:52.640]   with anybody else. They don't have to work on trying to be, to make it compatible with other
[01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:57.760]   devices. They can turn this thing all the way up and show what an Apple TV can do.
[01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:02.960]   They can show how, how you would integrate sports with your AR or VR. They can show how to tie it
[01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:07.920]   into the phone. So it's a huge sales card and it's great for MLS because they're going to look
[01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:11.520]   better than everybody else. I mean, because Apple, if Apple's smart, they're just going to dump a
[01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:16.720]   ton of money into, into this as an R&D to make it a showcase to then talk to MLB and NFL and,
[01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:20.800]   and well, you, we've already, I think we've talked about the USFL and what they're doing.
[01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:24.720]   Their video production is very interesting to own. Eddie's name on the press release.
[01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:27.920]   It's not one of the TV. Yeah, it's a big queue. Yeah. He's like super excited. Yeah.
[01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:32.160]   So the M.O. I'm reading from the press release, the MLS live and on demand content from the Apple
[01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:37.280]   TV app will be available. Anyone with internet access across all devices where the app can be
[01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:45.280]   found, iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, 4K, Apple TV, HD, Samsung, LG, Panasonic, Sony, TCL, Visio,
[01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:51.600]   another smart TV is Amazon, Fire TV, Roku, devices, PlayStation, Xbox, gaming consoles,
[01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:57.920]   Chromecast with Google TV, Comcast, Xfinity and in the browser at tv.apple.com.
[01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:01.920]   And the figure the internet has to be coming though, right? At this point, like there's a group of
[01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:05.920]   people inside Kupertinu have to make the Tizen app of all things. So you've got to imagine at some
[01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:09.040]   point, they're going to realize it's just a money play to make the Android version.
[01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:13.520]   The hard part is that because Apple can do this, you know, with their own devices,
[01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:18.240]   it'll actually, you know, you've all these people, I don't know if Apple thought this far out,
[01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:22.160]   but you've all these people that have Apple TV on all those devices that it cannot,
[01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:26.800]   they cannot do what the Apple TV can do. So if you start pump, you're going, oh, by the way,
[01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:31.680]   if you're using an Apple TV or an Apple device, you can watch it in 4K 120, but not on any of the
[01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:36.720]   devices that are out there because they don't have the horsepower to do that, that's complicated.
[01:44:36.720 --> 01:44:40.640]   You know, like that's a really complicated thing for a lot of folks. But now a lot of those TVs
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:46.640]   might be able to do it, but I can tell you as someone who streams to those TVs that I doubt it.
[01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:52.080]   Like I doubt that they can handle what the Apple TV can handle as far as what Apple could push
[01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:56.320]   down that pipe, which could then be, you know, a pretty interesting pipe, Piper.
[01:44:56.320 --> 01:45:05.920]   Eddie Q says, "For the first time in the history of sports,"
[01:45:05.920 --> 01:45:10.800]   I mean, I want to know what the rest of the sentence says now, "For the first time in the history of
[01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:16.640]   sports, fans will be able to access everything from major professional sports league in one place."
[01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:21.680]   It had to be with MLS. Yeah, premier leagues would never have made this deal, right? They
[01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:26.160]   don't need to. But MLS, it needs more serious or they're resilient.
[01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:31.360]   Yeah, I feel like this is similar to when Apple launched the iPhone, they could not have gotten
[01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:36.560]   the sort of concessions they got from AT&T. They couldn't have gotten them from Verizon. AT&T was
[01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:42.720]   on a really sensitive transitional point in their company history that they needed a huge
[01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:48.320]   catastrophic hit. If there's such a thing as a catastrophic hit, success. And they were desperate
[01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:52.560]   enough or needy enough to say, "Yes, all these things that go contrary to what the traditional
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:56.880]   relationship between a device manufacturer and a carrier has been, we're willing to get rid of all
[01:45:56.880 --> 01:46:01.440]   that. MLS is willing to simply say, "Yes, we will put things in your hands. Yes, we will give you
[01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:06.240]   whatever you want. Yes, we will run things the way you will. Yes, we will give you exclusivity."
[01:46:06.240 --> 01:46:11.760]   And this is the sort of thing you can do when you are targeting sports with a smaller audience.
[01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:19.520]   Also, let's not assume that Apple is going to be 100% successful with all of those. I think this
[01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:23.520]   is going to be some new ground for them as well. One of the reasons why they could not try this
[01:46:23.520 --> 01:46:30.720]   with the NFL MLB Premier League is that the moment that someone brings their own device to
[01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:38.080]   the service and suddenly they can't see the World Cup, you think that the air tags have
[01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:43.600]   been creating PR problems for Apple. This would be just people setting fire to Mac, their own Mac
[01:46:43.600 --> 01:46:46.880]   in the street. Well, these are all the advantages in the early days. Remember those?
[01:46:46.880 --> 01:46:49.520]   Yeah, exactly. Like when the very first couple of years of MLB apps and they went out, people
[01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:53.600]   were just... Are they getting better, by the way, with MLB? I haven't watched it.
[01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:56.160]   They have the best streaming people. Well, they had the best streaming people in the world,
[01:46:56.160 --> 01:46:58.880]   and they got bought up, right? They got that whole engine got brought up and bought up.
[01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:03.040]   No, I understand that the Friday night games are those any better because they were not.
[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:07.120]   Oh, Apple's. Yeah, I don't watch it anymore. I watched the first couple and I was like,
[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:09.600]   well, this is really slow. It's really slow for baseball.
[01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:14.960]   So I think that they're still working on it, I think. But I think that the...
[01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:20.800]   I think MLB... I mean, MLS has a lot of opportunity there. There is a pretty
[01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:23.600]   fervent crowd that are big fans. Absolutely.
[01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:28.720]   And so I think that that's it. And there's a lot of leagues out there that Apple could do this with.
[01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:34.480]   They can't NFL, MLB, NBA, Premier League. Those are probably not the ones that they could do,
[01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:40.480]   but there are other ones that Apple could fill up a fairly large number of these. And it can allow
[01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:47.840]   them five years from now to put pressure on, to make better deals with MLB. I think that by the
[01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:53.760]   end of the decade, the broadcasters won't have access to the games. The streamers are going to
[01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:58.160]   outgun them. And so it's just the beginning.
[01:47:58.160 --> 01:48:02.400]   If you wanted to watch tonight's Seattle Sounders versus the Vancouver Whitecaps
[01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:09.600]   game, you'd have to subscribe to ESPN+, and blackout restrictions may apply,
[01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:14.480]   and access requirements may vary by streaming services. It's not a good experience right now.
[01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:22.800]   I mean, I wanted to watch every stealer game, and I had to sign up in India and then get a VPN,
[01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:27.680]   so that I could watch every stealer game because they were some were blacked out in Europe and
[01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:31.360]   some were blacked out in the United States. So finally, I finally figured out that if I get
[01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:36.560]   vanished, whatever IP or whatever, I could just watch it coming streaming to me from Mumbai,
[01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:39.920]   as I've been turning into a server. It's the only way I can watch it.
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:42.080]   Does it have the same announcers? The American announcers?
[01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:44.960]   Yes, it's a regular game. I'd actually prefer it if they had the Indian
[01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:46.640]   announcer. No, that would be really fun.
[01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:49.440]   I think I'm trying to figure out what game is this?
[01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:50.160]   It doesn't look like cricket at all.
[01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:52.800]   That would be great.
[01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:53.920]   You start dancing.
[01:48:53.920 --> 01:48:59.040]   Soccer has tried and tried and tried in the US to make any headway.
[01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:03.200]   And it's not surprising that since the surprising success of Ted Lasso,
[01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:07.280]   that maybe Apple thinks maybe we can figure the tie ins.
[01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:08.800]   Yeah, look at the tie ins with head lasso.
[01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:12.480]   Maybe we could be the ones that put this over.
[01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:14.640]   It's a very careful thing.
[01:49:14.640 --> 01:49:15.680]   There's more fun to watch.
[01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:16.640]   There's a whole thing.
[01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:19.920]   I love soccer, but I could see that if you're a football fan,
[01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:23.360]   it's like you've been eating, you know, spicy salsa your whole life.
[01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:25.360]   It's somebody says 80 minutes in no place.
[01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:29.280]   You're having a planter's cheese ball.
[01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:30.560]   It's kind of slow.
[01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:35.200]   You've been maligning a wonderful challenge.
[01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:36.880]   I bought your cheese balls.
[01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:46.400]   Can I point out this also presents 2% of the daily requirement of calcium at every complete end of this.
[01:49:46.400 --> 01:49:50.640]   So if you ate 100,000 daily requirements at orange, you'd be all full up.
[01:49:50.640 --> 01:49:54.240]   You turn orange, yeah, but you'd be involved in cancer at calcium.
[01:49:54.240 --> 01:49:57.440]   I think that, yeah, that's why I didn't slip.
[01:49:57.440 --> 01:49:59.120]   What did I say?
[01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:00.160]   4% calcium.
[01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:00.640]   Cancer, yeah.
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:01.120]   Cancer, yeah.
[01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:01.600]   Cancer, yeah.
[01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:03.360]   Whoops.
[01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:07.120]   Anyway, I think, yeah, I think this is interesting.
[01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:09.920]   It makes sense that it's MLS, it makes sense that it's Apple.
[01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:13.040]   And I don't think it's even that it's hard to see these games.
[01:50:13.040 --> 01:50:14.400]   Otherwise, people are going to complain.
[01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:16.160]   You're still going to get a certain number of free games.
[01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:18.160]   I think it'll be still need cricket.
[01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:26.640]   I think the thing is that there is, if Apple takes it, and the reason I think that they
[01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:31.760]   may turn it into a big lab is because they are turning MLB into a lab.
[01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:35.840]   MLB Fridays, they're doing their own thing, and they're not doing it perfectly yet.
[01:50:35.840 --> 01:50:38.960]   I mean, the streaming quality is fine, but the commentary and the content, but they're
[01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:39.840]   experimenting with that.
[01:50:39.840 --> 01:50:47.440]   If they do MLS and they really dig into it and they're not constrained by anything and they just
[01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:50.240]   turn it up and then they get to add tons of graphics and tons of other things.
[01:50:50.240 --> 01:50:55.040]   Because they can spend money that MLS could never spend on a show.
[01:50:55.040 --> 01:50:59.040]   And I don't even know if they, Apple could spend money that the NFL can't spend.
[01:50:59.040 --> 01:50:59.360]   Right.
[01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:02.080]   No, I bet you the owners cover up and down on this one.
[01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:02.320]   Yeah.
[01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:03.760]   It's huge for everybody.
[01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:06.800]   The other big deal is that I think before I've been talking about how,
[01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:11.360]   Gee, I wish that I think that would be a great opportunity for Apple to invest in women's sports
[01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:18.800]   and basically to be the concierge and the go-to place, the go-to channel, the go-to device for
[01:51:18.800 --> 01:51:19.600]   sports.
[01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:23.600]   I mean, I'm surprised to find the WNBA.
[01:51:23.600 --> 01:51:32.320]   In 2022, NBA games are going to be on ABC, ESPN, ESPN 2, CBS, CBS Sports Network, and NBA TV,
[01:51:32.320 --> 01:51:35.280]   which sounds great because it's available in a lot of places.
[01:51:35.280 --> 01:51:40.720]   But if you are a customer of ESPN, how aware of you of when the games are and when the season is,
[01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:45.520]   whereas if Apple only has, has only invested in like two or three leagues,
[01:51:45.520 --> 01:51:51.360]   and essentially everyone is getting notice, is on notice through just little blurbs,
[01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:55.920]   little, whatever is on the app that, by the way, New York Liberty is playing tonight.
[01:51:55.920 --> 01:52:01.600]   There are number three in this league and that the championship is coming up in about a month.
[01:52:01.600 --> 01:52:05.760]   That would get so much more attention than not being aware that, oh, there's no dancing
[01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:08.720]   with the stars tonight because of the NBA's on.
[01:52:08.720 --> 01:52:10.000]   That's never going to happen.
[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:17.520]   Speaking of cricket, actually today, Indian cricket broadcast rights, the Premier League
[01:52:17.520 --> 01:52:27.760]   fetched the largest price ever for a sports franchise, $6.2 billion for broadcast rights,
[01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:30.240]   $6.2 billion.
[01:52:30.240 --> 01:52:38.320]   Television rights went to Star India, the local Disney subsidiary for $3 billion,
[01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:44.640]   and digital rights went to Viacom 18, which is a joint venture between Paramount and an Indian
[01:52:44.640 --> 01:52:51.040]   company, also $3 billion. Both deals for five years. So there you go.
[01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:56.720]   And by the way, when you talk about WNBA, it expires this year.
[01:52:56.720 --> 01:53:00.480]   That's, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's not for the NBA.
[01:53:00.480 --> 01:53:01.840]   It's over there.
[01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:02.960]   Oh, there are there are contractors.
[01:53:02.960 --> 01:53:04.240]   Oh, good.
[01:53:04.240 --> 01:53:04.640]   Yeah.
[01:53:04.640 --> 01:53:08.000]   So you see this kind of, it's going to be so smart for Apple, wouldn't it be?
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:08.720]   Yeah.
[01:53:08.720 --> 01:53:09.440]   Yeah.
[01:53:09.440 --> 01:53:16.080]   And also used WNBA players, like in their promotions, hire them for Apple fitness,
[01:53:16.080 --> 01:53:19.520]   hire them for it would be such an exciting bit of synergy.
[01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:26.560]   But getting back to cricket, that also just demonstrates how a unique aspect of Apple's
[01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:35.120]   marketing and deals can be because the iPhone is a monster product with monster saturation in
[01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:39.920]   the United States of America. Android is still absolutely the dominant phone everywhere else in
[01:53:39.920 --> 01:53:45.520]   the world. And in other places, it is really the iPhone of that country. And if you, if they,
[01:53:45.520 --> 01:53:49.760]   Apple try to make that same move towards cricket and say, guess what? You have to make sure that
[01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:54.560]   your Android apps are, if anything, better than the iPhone app, because that's how most people
[01:53:54.560 --> 01:53:58.560]   are going to be watching this on mobile. This is how they're going to be streaming it on devices and
[01:53:58.560 --> 01:54:04.400]   on TV. Yeah, exactly. Though that would be, see that it's, it's an interesting problem for them to
[01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:10.640]   be facing that unless they have a good $130 phone. Oh, dear. And a number of people say the
[01:54:10.640 --> 01:54:16.000]   miss the show title should be I want and these cheese balls, except that last week, the show
[01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:20.400]   title was blowing cheddar. And I don't, I don't want people to think that we're owned by the
[01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:25.920]   Wisconsin cheese association cheese lobby unless unless they, unless they, unless they become a
[01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:30.160]   normal supporter and advertise. That's true. Exactly. I mean, who doesn't love cheese?
[01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:35.360]   I'm sorry. You said, you started with I would be remiss. And then I cut you off.
[01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:39.920]   I would be, I would be remiss as a Sarah. If I didn't mention that rugby rights would be
[01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:44.400]   grateful and Apple to oh, it's all got a, it's all got as a gentleman's game played by
[01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:48.320]   Hologans and rugby is a hologans game played by gentlemen. I actually think
[01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:55.360]   Aussie rules football footy is, it's not Aussie rules football's footy is the best sport I have
[01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:59.440]   ever seen, which is a little bit of football, a little bit of radian football. Much better.
[01:54:59.440 --> 01:55:02.880]   We have three, three downs and it's a kicker's game Leo really. It's more exciting than that.
[01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:09.360]   A kicker's game. Tell you something right there. Yes. Two teams called the rough fighters.
[01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:14.160]   They changed that, but it took forever. Australian rules football is played by good looking fellas
[01:55:14.160 --> 01:55:22.800]   in short shorts without pads. Yeah. These guys, this is the craziest game ever. It's amazing.
[01:55:22.800 --> 01:55:27.360]   I used to work for prime sports network. I was an ad designer for them. And the only thing I
[01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:30.720]   watched the prime sports network because we had, you know, you had access to all those sports
[01:55:30.720 --> 01:55:39.040]   coming in with Australian rules football. I love the end zone. I love the end zone referees.
[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:42.560]   And they're like special little white hats and like codes. We just go.
[01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:52.960]   Have you seen Invictus? No, is it featured in Invictus? Invictus is rugby. It's the game
[01:55:52.960 --> 01:55:58.400]   between you. Oh, the Invictus. Oh, yeah. With Jonah Lamo, who could basically run over people,
[01:55:58.400 --> 01:56:02.240]   I've never seen an athlete who could, except for Michael Jordan, who could jump over people,
[01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:07.040]   Jonah Lamo could just run over people. It was amazing. And it was right after. I'm pretty sure his
[01:56:07.040 --> 01:56:12.960]   son was on YouTube. Have you seen this? By the way, here's the gesture. Andy was talking about
[01:56:12.960 --> 01:56:15.920]   when they, when they score a goal, watch this, watch this.
[01:56:20.560 --> 01:56:24.800]   It's just like a little point or something. I don't understand that.
[01:56:24.800 --> 01:56:35.200]   Really like the pre show, the pre show for the New Zealand is pretty.
[01:56:35.200 --> 01:56:39.840]   I gotta say the Renee is absolutely right about rugby because it's like,
[01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:45.840]   one of my favorite clips I've ever seen or memes I've seen on the internet ever is comparing like
[01:56:46.400 --> 01:56:53.120]   Premier League soccer with like college league rugby because there's a clip of someone like
[01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:57.360]   running by a soccer player and the soccer player waiting a second then throwing himself to the
[01:56:57.360 --> 01:57:04.560]   ground like, oh, oh, my knee. Oh, my knee. And immediately after a women's collegiate rugby,
[01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:12.960]   basically a woman just getting, boom, not in front of her head to the head to face. And she's
[01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:17.840]   full and she sees slow motion of her just walking like not off the field, but down the field,
[01:57:17.840 --> 01:57:21.680]   like spitting out blood and just like looking back at that person again.
[01:57:21.680 --> 01:57:28.640]   Let's play. Let's play. I'm fine. I'm fine. You continue my loss. You are more tough than
[01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:36.000]   10, you know, a thousand years after I've been buried and turned to granite, I will not be as tough
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:41.680]   as anyone. Yeah, watch on any level. Well, remember, remember, Matt Damon's in it.
[01:57:41.680 --> 01:57:45.760]   Yeah, so the movie, okay, so the movie is related. All right, good. All right. No, I will watch the
[01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:52.880]   movie. Yeah. Of course, Becky Worley, who we love and she's good morning America's tech reporter and
[01:57:52.880 --> 01:58:00.800]   was my producer for years at tech TV was on the US women's rugby team. And I believe, I don't know,
[01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:06.560]   at last count, I think she had had five or six knee replacements, just like, but tough as nails,
[01:58:06.560 --> 01:58:10.640]   right? And she said actually, you wouldn't dare. She said to me, you wouldn't like me if I didn't
[01:58:10.640 --> 01:58:16.320]   play rugby. I get all my aggression. It's more brutal, but it's safer because they're not wearing
[01:58:16.320 --> 01:58:20.560]   pads. So they know their limits, but it's just, it's a really interesting combination of human
[01:58:20.560 --> 01:58:25.920]   will and understanding of your own frailty. Yeah. Honestly, Apple go out and buy the,
[01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:29.680]   buy the rights. They can't be expensive. The US rights to footy.
[01:58:29.680 --> 01:58:36.560]   Or rugby, but I think footy is really the game to me. Alex's point, hitting the hook up
[01:58:36.560 --> 01:58:38.720]   internationally would be so good. Wouldn't that be good?
[01:58:39.280 --> 01:58:43.280]   So good. Yeah. Watching Hawkeye. I would watch a whole channel about
[01:58:43.280 --> 01:58:52.320]   Let's see. What else is going on? I feel like there must be other things to talk about. Apple
[01:58:52.320 --> 01:58:58.800]   headset closer to reality, according to the elect, which has always got some strange stories
[01:58:58.800 --> 01:59:08.160]   because LG display is ordering micro OLED equipment because they want, they want the,
[01:59:08.160 --> 01:59:12.800]   the deal, according to the elect. It's an industry, right? You know, they'll print whatever Samsung
[01:59:12.800 --> 01:59:17.520]   LG think is convenient for their negotiations. But that says, so maybe LG play that,
[01:59:17.520 --> 01:59:21.360]   but they probably right. Yeah. So that's good. They say, we don't know if Apple's got a
[01:59:21.360 --> 01:59:26.240]   virtual reality headset coming, but we're going to buy this equipment. So,
[01:59:26.240 --> 01:59:28.880]   you know, we don't have the contract. So we don't say that we're ready for it.
[01:59:28.880 --> 01:59:34.160]   We're ready for it. We're going to be, we're ready. Here we go. Apple music and gaming. I think
[01:59:34.160 --> 01:59:38.560]   this is ridiculous, but I'm, you know, we're at the bottom of the barrel here. According to JP
[01:59:38.560 --> 01:59:45.520]   Morgan to bring in over 8 billion in revenue by 2025. Service is alone, bringing what 11 billion
[01:59:45.520 --> 01:59:53.280]   last quarter. So rising. I don't know if that's saying much. That's a 36% jump over the next four,
[01:59:53.280 --> 01:59:58.000]   three or four years. Maybe I think it's probably going to be more than 8 billion. That's what I'm
[01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:03.840]   going to say. Leo LaPort said in his note to subscribers, my analyst's note.
[02:00:03.840 --> 02:00:09.360]   So I think we should all get, we should all guess. Yeah. What? Yeah. Let's, let's, we'll get on
[02:00:09.360 --> 02:00:12.480]   record. Yeah. Someone's got to write it down. Someone's got to write it down because a couple.
[02:00:12.480 --> 02:00:16.560]   So revenue, some shows, not even not profits, revenue from gaming and music
[02:00:16.560 --> 02:00:23.280]   by 2025. I say 11 billion.
[02:00:24.720 --> 02:00:29.680]   Okay. I say 9.6 billion. Okay. Andy, you want to play this stupid game?
[02:00:29.680 --> 02:00:35.920]   I think that Dunkin Donuts is going to make a really good buyout offer for Apple.
[02:00:35.920 --> 02:00:39.680]   You have a number. And they're going to cause all that mall real estate is very, very valuable.
[02:00:39.680 --> 02:00:44.800]   I don't think Apple's going to be around then. Now, I'm saying that please, please cut it right
[02:00:44.800 --> 02:00:51.200]   there for the clip because if I'm right, I will look like the most God like business order ever.
[02:00:51.200 --> 02:00:55.200]   I will be able to take that crap to the lecture circle.
[02:00:55.200 --> 02:00:59.360]   The two services are likely to have a combined subscriber base of 180 million
[02:00:59.360 --> 02:01:06.240]   by 2025, but this is, you know, it's hysterical reading after reading the trip,
[02:01:06.240 --> 02:01:10.560]   Mickle book about how kind of the Apple music thing was kind of this weird, you know, they
[02:01:10.560 --> 02:01:16.160]   weren't sure they wanted to do it. But now 110 subscribers for music, 70 million for gaming.
[02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:22.000]   That's an arcade. They're talking about arcade. Yeah. And the Wall Street loves it because they
[02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:30.400]   understand it. They understand recurring revenue. They really do. They work for a reason because
[02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:37.760]   it's really a good business model. It's recurring revenue. Yeah. And the loss is pretty low.
[02:01:37.760 --> 02:01:41.840]   Previously, they had like the gamblers paradox, where it's like, okay, Apple had hit with the
[02:01:41.840 --> 02:01:45.280]   iPhone, but they'll never have another one. Okay, fine. The iPad too. That just makes it even less
[02:01:45.280 --> 02:01:49.600]   likely. They'll have an OK fine Apple watch. OK, AirPods, but they're never going to have another one.
[02:01:49.600 --> 02:01:53.840]   You can't convince me otherwise. And the revenue, but the subscriptions are much easier to understand.
[02:01:53.840 --> 02:02:00.640]   It's just money every month. Yeah. Renee, just a technical note, when you took off your Apple
[02:02:00.640 --> 02:02:04.080]   VR goggles, you left them face down and the light is sort of giving you an update.
[02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:05.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:02:05.680 --> 02:02:07.440]   That's the ATEM Mini, but I kind of fixed it.
[02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:09.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:11.280]   Sure. You have the ATEM Mini. I like the glow, though.
[02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:17.360]   It's good. Yeah. It's that 14.1 inch iPad that's really blasting him.
[02:02:17.360 --> 02:02:21.280]   That's not high definition enough. Yeah.
[02:02:21.280 --> 02:02:23.200]   He's really not easy to fool. He really is.
[02:02:23.200 --> 02:02:26.800]   Although the iPad did. Do you see that? The iPad got high definition scale or not high density
[02:02:26.800 --> 02:02:33.040]   scaling. So now you can-- I thought that was exactly what that means. So the iPad runs it doubled.
[02:02:33.040 --> 02:02:37.760]   Is it doubled resolution? It's not quite doubled. It's displaced scaling. So you basically get--
[02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:41.600]   it's like on the Mac, if you go into the Mac and you switch it away from Best for Retina
[02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:45.280]   and you just put it towards like maximum number, this does the same things.
[02:02:45.280 --> 02:02:47.760]   Instead of trying to match the resolution of the Retina display,
[02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:50.880]   it just gives you as many pixels as it possibly can within the iPad frame.
[02:02:50.880 --> 02:02:52.720]   And that's because the iPad is small. The text gets really small.
[02:02:52.720 --> 02:02:56.000]   It's not one for one because if it did, it would everything be tiny.
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.880]   Yeah. So they do not quite doubling, which is weird.
[02:02:58.880 --> 02:03:03.600]   You would think that they would want to, for scaling reasons, they'd want to be on a multiple.
[02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:07.040]   It would be so small, though, Leo. It'd be like the innovations would be so small.
[02:03:07.760 --> 02:03:13.520]   No, but this is interesting. So if you got four windows open, you've got stage manager running,
[02:03:13.520 --> 02:03:18.480]   and you've got room for it. That's the thing. When I look at stage managers,
[02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:21.040]   that's a big chunk of the-- Yeah.
[02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:24.320]   I mean, you're sure you want it because maybe you got saved.
[02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:29.760]   Yeah. But it would also be super interesting if you are running like three or four virtualized
[02:03:29.760 --> 02:03:32.560]   systems all from that same screen. That's true.
[02:03:32.560 --> 02:03:35.600]   A lot of people have the beta are now using it for virtualization.
[02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:39.440]   They're loving stage manager. How it allows them to keep them on top of
[02:03:39.440 --> 02:03:41.680]   basically use three different operating systems on the iPad.
[02:03:41.680 --> 02:03:44.720]   And you just tap the window you want. It zooms to the doubled size,
[02:03:44.720 --> 02:03:46.800]   and then zooms back out to the small side.
[02:03:46.800 --> 02:03:49.680]   Renee, are you running the developer betters of any of this?
[02:03:49.680 --> 02:03:52.880]   Yes. I put them all on my main devices like I tell everybody not to do.
[02:03:52.880 --> 02:03:53.680]   Crazy man.
[02:03:53.680 --> 02:03:57.360]   Otherwise, I wouldn't use them enough, and then I wouldn't feel like my opinions were valid.
[02:03:57.360 --> 02:04:02.960]   I don't want to love the report too much on people. There's reviews and stuff,
[02:04:02.960 --> 02:04:05.760]   but this is very early days. This isn't even the public beta.
[02:04:05.760 --> 02:04:11.280]   Technically, you're not a lot-- I respect NDA's from Apple because I feel like if I break my work--
[02:04:11.280 --> 02:04:15.120]   if people think it's an excuse to break NDA's with Apple, then why would any developer trust me?
[02:04:15.120 --> 02:04:18.800]   And they explicitly say you shouldn't be sharing screenshots or it's a beta.
[02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:21.840]   It's going to be buggy. It's not the final experience.
[02:04:21.840 --> 02:04:25.360]   Craig said that too, that a lot of things are still coming as we get towards June.
[02:04:25.360 --> 02:04:30.560]   So I always wait for the public beta, which has a very different policy applied to it.
[02:04:30.560 --> 02:04:35.920]   And even then, this isn't my review. This is just my experience using it so far.
[02:04:35.920 --> 02:04:38.080]   So I'm very careful to differentiate that kind of stuff.
[02:04:38.080 --> 02:04:42.560]   So Apple Insider had Apple's Mac OS Ventura beta review.
[02:04:42.560 --> 02:04:49.120]   Great new features, but some concerns. I read it, but I read it with a huge grain of salt because
[02:04:49.120 --> 02:04:51.520]   of course it's not done.
[02:04:51.520 --> 02:04:56.800]   It's like reviewing the rough cut of a movie, which like, okay, but it doesn't--
[02:04:56.800 --> 02:05:01.040]   I mean, people-- I saw people on social media complain about, "Oh my god, I've had the beta,
[02:05:01.040 --> 02:05:05.600]   and it's run so slowly on my iPad." And it's like, it is wired up for so many things.
[02:05:05.600 --> 02:05:08.400]   It's not going to be doing when it finally gets paid for even though you're not--
[02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:11.600]   So they're running debug code. They're not supposed to be writing the circle,
[02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:15.440]   and they're not supposed to share these screenshots. They're violating their NDA to do that.
[02:05:15.440 --> 02:05:17.040]   I don't have any idea.
[02:05:17.040 --> 02:05:21.040]   I guess it depends. Like, people-- you get reminded, when you're at Dub Dub,
[02:05:21.040 --> 02:05:25.120]   you get reminded that this is not like we don't want people sharing.
[02:05:25.120 --> 02:05:28.960]   But people don't seem to care anymore. It was much more of a thing, and Apple was much more
[02:05:28.960 --> 02:05:31.440]   stringent about it a few years ago.
[02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:36.000]   There's so much competition to be first to. Good on you for not falling.
[02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:40.960]   I don't have to be first, Leo. I realized that a while ago, I don't have to cover all this stuff.
[02:05:40.960 --> 02:05:42.400]   I can be very selective.
[02:05:42.400 --> 02:05:46.720]   I'm just amazed at the idea that, look, I promised not to do this thing,
[02:05:46.720 --> 02:05:48.720]   but that doesn't matter. I'm going to do this thing anyway.
[02:05:48.720 --> 02:05:52.800]   You have the option of not promising, not signing the NDA, not taking the software,
[02:05:52.800 --> 02:05:55.600]   not taking the advanced hardware. It's just that simple.
[02:05:55.600 --> 02:05:56.000]   Yeah.
[02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:56.480]   Anyway.
[02:05:56.480 --> 02:05:58.320]   I'll run the last thing.
[02:05:58.320 --> 02:06:01.840]   Like, you feel like you're desperate to get everything up three minutes before it goes live,
[02:06:01.840 --> 02:06:03.520]   and it's just like, I couldn't live like that.
[02:06:03.520 --> 02:06:04.080]   It'll kill you.
[02:06:04.080 --> 02:06:05.760]   That's some of this game.
[02:06:05.760 --> 02:06:06.560]   Give you a heart attack.
[02:06:06.560 --> 02:06:10.160]   And you also become a commodity. Nobody cares anymore about you.
[02:06:10.160 --> 02:06:12.560]   They only care about who had it first, and they'll just go to someone else next time.
[02:06:12.560 --> 02:06:13.040]   That's right.
[02:06:13.040 --> 02:06:14.720]   You're not building any equity in your own work either.
[02:06:14.720 --> 02:06:15.120]   No, you're not.
[02:06:15.120 --> 02:06:18.640]   Public beta, that might be different. We'll probably--
[02:06:18.640 --> 02:06:24.560]   I've given him the new features of iPadOS. I really think I'm going to probably put the public beta on my iPad Pro.
[02:06:24.560 --> 02:06:29.040]   It's not my phone, so I'm definitely going to take the public beta on the iPad.
[02:06:29.040 --> 02:06:29.360]   Yeah.
[02:06:29.360 --> 02:06:33.840]   A lot of people are talking about, I haven't watched it yet,
[02:06:33.840 --> 02:06:39.200]   but there's a conversation in our Twitch forums, the Twitter community about John Oliver.
[02:06:39.200 --> 02:06:42.320]   He did a thing on tech monopolies on Sunday.
[02:06:42.320 --> 02:06:43.760]   Did any of you see it?
[02:06:43.760 --> 02:06:44.480]   I didn't see it.
[02:06:44.480 --> 02:06:45.280]   Yeah.
[02:06:45.280 --> 02:06:47.760]   It's usually blocked in Canada until we get it officially.
[02:06:47.760 --> 02:06:48.400]   Oh, really?
[02:06:48.400 --> 02:06:49.440]   Yeah.
[02:06:49.440 --> 02:06:53.760]   We have a Canadian p-holder who says, "Sad to report."
[02:06:53.760 --> 02:06:55.280]   I cannot see it.
[02:06:55.280 --> 02:06:58.720]   The video is not available in my country.
[02:06:58.720 --> 02:07:00.720]   It is available in Germany, however.
[02:07:00.720 --> 02:07:07.920]   In fact, Big D, who lives as a Brit living in Germany and is a very active member of the forum,
[02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:10.560]   says, "Just watch any twig or twit from the last five years.
[02:07:10.560 --> 02:07:11.920]   You'll get the same message."
[02:07:11.920 --> 02:07:14.240]   Or as Jeff would shout, "Moral Panic."
[02:07:14.240 --> 02:07:16.400]   Well, anyway, just a mention.
[02:07:17.280 --> 02:07:18.160]   A number of people have been chattering.
[02:07:18.160 --> 02:07:21.520]   I'm also talking about it, so I thought I'd bring that up.
[02:07:21.520 --> 02:07:22.160]   Anything else?
[02:07:22.160 --> 02:07:23.600]   What else are we going to talk about here?
[02:07:23.600 --> 02:07:24.560]   Anything else to say?
[02:07:24.560 --> 02:07:27.520]   Is the new iPad going to have an XDR display?
[02:07:27.520 --> 02:07:31.680]   Many LED, if that rumor is true, that would be, wouldn't it?
[02:07:31.680 --> 02:07:32.240]   Or could be?
[02:07:32.240 --> 02:07:33.920]   I guess it depends on which one.
[02:07:33.920 --> 02:07:35.600]   They're talking about the 2022.
[02:07:35.600 --> 02:07:35.920]   2020?
[02:07:35.920 --> 02:07:37.760]   This rumored 14-inch, yeah.
[02:07:37.760 --> 02:07:41.200]   Although probably not the 11, because it's expensive.
[02:07:41.200 --> 02:07:44.960]   I think Apple wants to keep the price of the entry-level iPad Pro low,
[02:07:44.960 --> 02:07:46.320]   and that adds 100 bucks to it.
[02:07:46.320 --> 02:07:47.040]   Right.
[02:07:47.040 --> 02:07:47.760]   Right.
[02:07:47.760 --> 02:07:51.520]   Here's an anime gift once again, just so you know.
[02:07:51.520 --> 02:07:55.680]   See if you can get it from the 1990s,
[02:07:55.680 --> 02:08:00.560]   because they used to dress like well-dressed butchers,
[02:08:00.560 --> 02:08:03.520]   with a white lab coat and a white stethson.
[02:08:03.520 --> 02:08:09.360]   I think it needs to be an animated emoji of you.
[02:08:09.360 --> 02:08:10.560]   It just does that.
[02:08:10.560 --> 02:08:12.240]   Anytime you want to send back, yes.
[02:08:12.240 --> 02:08:12.720]   I like it.
[02:08:12.720 --> 02:08:13.200]   To somebody.
[02:08:13.200 --> 02:08:13.760]   That's it.
[02:08:13.760 --> 02:08:14.400]   You can send it back.
[02:08:14.400 --> 02:08:17.760]   And Andy, you have some competition for your planners.
[02:08:17.760 --> 02:08:19.680]   Apparently, I didn't know this.
[02:08:19.680 --> 02:08:21.760]   Utz makes a giant.
[02:08:21.760 --> 02:08:22.960]   Oh, yeah.
[02:08:22.960 --> 02:08:24.480]   Giant cheese ball.
[02:08:24.480 --> 02:08:25.840]   Barrel-o-cheese balls.
[02:08:25.840 --> 02:08:28.000]   See that?
[02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:31.440]   I've seen those, and that would put a lot of stress in my life.
[02:08:31.440 --> 02:08:34.720]   That not just like, I wouldn't eat the low in one sitting,
[02:08:34.720 --> 02:08:37.520]   but however long it would take me, even if it took me a month,
[02:08:37.520 --> 02:08:40.160]   it would be like, oh my god, I have this obligation to eat,
[02:08:40.160 --> 02:08:41.360]   this immense rest.
[02:08:41.360 --> 02:08:43.760]   This is exactly the right amount of cheese balls.
[02:08:43.760 --> 02:08:47.440]   Like for three or four days of little snacking,
[02:08:47.440 --> 02:08:52.640]   as much as I like the name Utz as a product name.
[02:08:52.640 --> 02:08:53.520]   Is that how you pronounce it?
[02:08:53.520 --> 02:08:54.240]   Utz.
[02:08:54.240 --> 02:08:54.720]   Utz.
[02:08:54.720 --> 02:08:55.280]   Utz.
[02:08:55.280 --> 02:08:55.760]   Utz.
[02:08:55.760 --> 02:08:56.240]   That's how I say it.
[02:08:56.240 --> 02:08:56.720]   You have fun.
[02:08:56.720 --> 02:08:58.160]   It doesn't have Mr. Peanut, though.
[02:08:58.160 --> 02:08:58.960]   No, you got it.
[02:08:58.960 --> 02:08:59.520]   Mr. Peanut.
[02:08:59.520 --> 02:08:59.520]   I thought--
[02:08:59.520 --> 02:09:00.640]   Wait a minute.
[02:09:00.640 --> 02:09:02.240]   Didn't they kill Mr. Peanut?
[02:09:02.240 --> 02:09:04.960]   Like a couple of years ago, did they bring him back?
[02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:09.280]   That was in the two 441 universe here in 616.
[02:09:09.280 --> 02:09:09.920]   He's still alive.
[02:09:09.920 --> 02:09:10.320]   Oh, good.
[02:09:10.320 --> 02:09:10.800]   Thank god.
[02:09:13.440 --> 02:09:17.920]   Thanks to Resuitz in our Discord chat who says,
[02:09:17.920 --> 02:09:19.920]   "Renee Richie, good video.
[02:09:19.920 --> 02:09:21.200]   The M2 info.
[02:09:21.200 --> 02:09:22.400]   He really enjoyed it."
[02:09:22.400 --> 02:09:23.440]   Oh, thank you.
[02:09:23.440 --> 02:09:24.640]   Thank you for that.
[02:09:24.640 --> 02:09:28.320]   You've been doing a great job at youtube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:31.360]   Our picks of the week coming up next,
[02:09:31.360 --> 02:09:34.640]   but first a word from New Relic.
[02:09:34.640 --> 02:09:37.040]   If you're that person, the one who's responsible,
[02:09:37.040 --> 02:09:39.920]   if the apps go down, or the server goes down,
[02:09:39.920 --> 02:09:40.880]   or the cloud goes down,
[02:09:40.880 --> 02:09:44.640]   you probably received that middle of the night phone call,
[02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:46.960]   you're fast asleep, the phone rings,
[02:09:46.960 --> 02:09:49.040]   and suddenly something's broken.
[02:09:49.040 --> 02:09:51.360]   And then it's all on you to fix it.
[02:09:51.360 --> 02:09:52.240]   Your mind's racing.
[02:09:52.240 --> 02:09:53.120]   What could be wrong?
[02:09:53.120 --> 02:09:54.400]   Is it the back end?
[02:09:54.400 --> 02:09:55.280]   Is it the front end?
[02:09:55.280 --> 02:09:56.000]   Is it global?
[02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:56.720]   Is it the server?
[02:09:56.720 --> 02:09:58.800]   I hope I'm not giving you palpitations.
[02:09:58.800 --> 02:10:00.720]   You got your whole team scrambling,
[02:10:00.720 --> 02:10:03.200]   going from tool to tool, messaging each other.
[02:10:03.200 --> 02:10:03.760]   Do you see it?
[02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:04.240]   I don't see it.
[02:10:04.240 --> 02:10:04.960]   Do you see it?
[02:10:04.960 --> 02:10:06.640]   Do you have slow-wet running queries?
[02:10:06.640 --> 02:10:08.080]   Is it the network?
[02:10:08.080 --> 02:10:09.040]   Is it the cloud?
[02:10:09.040 --> 02:10:11.280]   Did you introduce a bug in your last deploy?
[02:10:11.280 --> 02:10:13.840]   Well, you need New Relic.
[02:10:13.840 --> 02:10:15.040]   New Relic just did a survey,
[02:10:15.040 --> 02:10:16.960]   only half of organizations
[02:10:16.960 --> 02:10:18.560]   have implemented observability
[02:10:18.560 --> 02:10:21.520]   for their networks and systems.
[02:10:21.520 --> 02:10:25.200]   That means half of all the engineers out there
[02:10:25.200 --> 02:10:26.960]   are suffering with just,
[02:10:26.960 --> 02:10:29.840]   you know, the fog of war.
[02:10:29.840 --> 02:10:34.080]   Not knowing what's going on when something goes wrong.
[02:10:34.080 --> 02:10:36.880]   That won't happen if you get New Relic.
[02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:40.560]   New Relic is actually 16 different monitoring tools,
[02:10:40.560 --> 02:10:42.000]   all in one place.
[02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:43.280]   Normally you'd buy them separately,
[02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:46.080]   but this way you could see the entire software stack.
[02:10:46.080 --> 02:10:47.280]   In one place you'll get,
[02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:49.360]   among other things, application monitoring,
[02:10:49.360 --> 02:10:49.920]   APM,
[02:10:49.920 --> 02:10:54.400]   which gives you unified monitoring for both apps and microservices.
[02:10:54.400 --> 02:10:55.520]   If you use Kubernetes,
[02:10:55.520 --> 02:10:58.640]   you'll love pixie instant Kubernetes observability.
[02:10:58.640 --> 02:11:00.880]   You can get distributed tracing,
[02:11:00.880 --> 02:11:03.360]   see all the traces without management headaches.
[02:11:03.360 --> 02:11:05.440]   So you can find and fix issues fast.
[02:11:05.440 --> 02:11:07.840]   You get network performance monitoring,
[02:11:07.840 --> 02:11:11.200]   so you don't have to guess where the performance issues start.
[02:11:11.200 --> 02:11:13.440]   Ditch the data silos,
[02:11:13.440 --> 02:11:16.480]   get a system-wide correlated view.
[02:11:16.480 --> 02:11:18.720]   And most importantly,
[02:11:18.720 --> 02:11:19.760]   if you're a developer,
[02:11:19.760 --> 02:11:23.920]   you can pinpoint issues down to the line of code,
[02:11:23.920 --> 02:11:26.800]   so you can know exactly why the problem happened
[02:11:26.800 --> 02:11:27.680]   and resolve quickly.
[02:11:27.680 --> 02:11:30.720]   If it was some commit you pushed five minutes ago,
[02:11:30.720 --> 02:11:33.280]   you can roll it back.
[02:11:33.280 --> 02:11:35.280]   That's why the Dev and Ops teams at DoorDash
[02:11:35.280 --> 02:11:36.640]   and GitHub and Epic Games
[02:11:36.640 --> 02:11:39.280]   and more than 14,000 other companies
[02:11:39.280 --> 02:11:41.120]   use new Relective Debug
[02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:43.200]   and improve their software.
[02:11:43.200 --> 02:11:45.120]   It doesn't matter if you run a cloud native startup
[02:11:45.120 --> 02:11:46.800]   or a Fortune 500 company,
[02:11:46.800 --> 02:11:48.240]   it'll only take five minutes
[02:11:48.240 --> 02:11:50.080]   to set up new Relect in your environment.
[02:11:50.080 --> 02:11:54.160]   And you know that next middle of the night phone calls
[02:11:54.160 --> 02:11:55.920]   just out there just waiting to happen.
[02:11:55.920 --> 02:11:58.800]   Get new Relect before it does.
[02:11:58.800 --> 02:12:01.440]   You'll get access to the whole new Relect platform.
[02:12:01.440 --> 02:12:04.720]   And 100 gigabytes of data free a month.
[02:12:05.360 --> 02:12:06.800]   Absolutely free.
[02:12:06.800 --> 02:12:08.720]   You don't even need to give them a credit card.
[02:12:08.720 --> 02:12:10.400]   Use the entire platform
[02:12:10.400 --> 02:12:14.480]   and get 100 gigs of data free every month forever.
[02:12:14.480 --> 02:12:18.480]   That's a pretty good way to start.

[02:12:25.120 --> 02:12:26.720]   I know when you go to conferences,
[02:12:26.720 --> 02:12:27.600]   people are talking about it.
[02:12:27.600 --> 02:12:29.040]   I know you've heard from your colleagues.
[02:12:29.040 --> 02:12:31.760]   Don't be the one who doesn't know what's going on.

[02:12:42.240 --> 02:12:45.680]   Great way to start new relic.com/mac.
[02:12:45.680 --> 02:12:47.760]   Break pick of the week time.
[02:12:47.760 --> 02:12:49.600]   Let's start with Renee Richie this week.
[02:12:49.600 --> 02:12:52.480]   So I'm being a little selfish this week, Leo.
[02:12:52.480 --> 02:12:55.040]   I'm making a plea on behalf of myself
[02:12:55.040 --> 02:12:58.480]   and my nation for everybody's help with a new law
[02:12:58.480 --> 02:13:01.520]   that they're trying to pass that was intended originally
[02:13:01.520 --> 02:13:06.400]   to bring streaming providers like Paramount+ and Disney+
[02:13:06.400 --> 02:13:09.440]   and Netflix into the Canadian Broadcast Act,
[02:13:09.440 --> 02:13:10.880]   which if you're not familiar,
[02:13:10.880 --> 02:13:13.760]   that does things like mandate a certain amount of Canadian
[02:13:13.760 --> 02:13:16.480]   content and investment in Canada and Canadian artists,
[02:13:16.480 --> 02:13:19.520]   which is great because those services serve Canadians
[02:13:19.520 --> 02:13:22.880]   and it's nice if they reflect back our culture
[02:13:22.880 --> 02:13:24.320]   and our voices to us.
[02:13:24.320 --> 02:13:28.560]   Special interest is that I'm going to be able to put it.
[02:13:28.560 --> 02:13:30.560]   The traditional media companies don't like
[02:13:30.560 --> 02:13:32.800]   that YouTube is user-generated content
[02:13:32.800 --> 02:13:34.640]   and isn't regulated in that way.
[02:13:34.640 --> 02:13:37.120]   They believe it's unfair even though we believe
[02:13:37.120 --> 02:13:38.720]   that we're a bunch of independent people
[02:13:38.720 --> 02:13:40.400]   and don't have the same resources
[02:13:40.400 --> 02:13:42.400]   and shouldn't have the same obligations that they have
[02:13:42.400 --> 02:13:44.720]   in order like in terms of filling out paperwork
[02:13:44.720 --> 02:13:46.160]   to prove you're Canadian,
[02:13:46.160 --> 02:13:48.000]   which are things like you have to have either the director
[02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:49.440]   or the producer as Canadian.
[02:13:49.440 --> 02:13:50.800]   You have to have a certain amount of the whole like
[02:13:50.800 --> 02:13:52.000]   everything that you're familiar with
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:55.920]   from hosting Canadian television for quite a while.
[02:13:55.920 --> 02:13:58.720]   It's a lot and also they want YouTube
[02:13:58.720 --> 02:14:00.480]   to change the way the algorithm works
[02:14:00.480 --> 02:14:05.440]   so that it over samples Canadian content to Canadians,
[02:14:05.440 --> 02:14:07.120]   which is never a good thing algorithmically
[02:14:07.120 --> 02:14:09.120]   because the way it works on YouTube is
[02:14:09.120 --> 02:14:11.280]   YouTube suggests videos for you to watch
[02:14:11.280 --> 02:14:12.960]   based on what you've already watched
[02:14:12.960 --> 02:14:16.160]   and if you don't click on things it de-accelerates those.
[02:14:16.160 --> 02:14:17.760]   So just giving people a bunch of content
[02:14:17.760 --> 02:14:19.200]   that they're not interested in
[02:14:19.200 --> 02:14:21.440]   because it comes from a certain place
[02:14:21.440 --> 02:14:24.400]   from a certain person is algorithmic malfeasance
[02:14:24.400 --> 02:14:27.040]   and it would result in our videos probably being,
[02:14:27.040 --> 02:14:29.440]   you know, I don't know what the right word for it
[02:14:29.440 --> 02:14:31.760]   is de-accelerated throughout the platform.
[02:14:31.760 --> 02:14:33.200]   It would result in things like, you know,
[02:14:33.200 --> 02:14:35.200]   maybe Canadian creators being promoted over
[02:14:35.200 --> 02:14:37.200]   international creators even if the quality of the video
[02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:39.200]   or the experience wasn't as good.
[02:14:39.200 --> 02:14:41.760]   And in general it just, it seems like Canadian YouTube
[02:14:41.760 --> 02:14:45.200]   is thriving two out of the three biggest tech YouTube channels,
[02:14:45.200 --> 02:14:48.480]   Unbox Therapy and Linus, Tech Tips are Canadian.
[02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:51.520]   We've gotten amazing creators, amazing voices
[02:14:51.520 --> 02:14:54.960]   internationally with no help, not even no regulation
[02:14:54.960 --> 02:14:57.680]   but no help like a lot of other businesses get
[02:14:57.680 --> 02:15:00.080]   and it would be sad to see if my YouTube homepage
[02:15:00.080 --> 02:15:01.760]   no longer reflected my tastes,
[02:15:01.760 --> 02:15:04.000]   reflected the taste of the Canadian government.
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.560]   So a bunch of, a bunch of YouTubers from Canada
[02:15:06.560 --> 02:15:08.160]   and a bunch of people who use YouTube
[02:15:08.160 --> 02:15:10.720]   and other platforms like TikTok and Instagram
[02:15:10.720 --> 02:15:13.680]   and Twitch are getting together to try to tell the government
[02:15:13.680 --> 02:15:16.720]   that just specify that we're not included.
[02:15:16.720 --> 02:15:19.120]   We don't, like we don't want you to stop
[02:15:19.120 --> 02:15:23.360]   mandating the broadcast, broadcasters streaming otherwise
[02:15:23.360 --> 02:15:25.280]   do certain things but just carve us out
[02:15:25.280 --> 02:15:27.080]   so we don't have to live with this sort of
[02:15:27.080 --> 02:15:29.280]   Damocles over our head going forward.
[02:15:29.280 --> 02:15:33.120]   Michael Geist who is a great attorney in Canada
[02:15:33.120 --> 02:15:35.520]   and I got to know him when we were working up in Toronto
[02:15:35.520 --> 02:15:38.320]   doing this show, has posted about this on his blog
[02:15:38.320 --> 02:15:39.360]   Michael Geist at Sia.
[02:15:39.360 --> 02:15:43.360]   He also did a law bites podcast on this
[02:15:43.360 --> 02:15:45.200]   and he's pretty head up about it.
[02:15:45.200 --> 02:15:47.680]   In fact the government has cut off debate by the way
[02:15:47.680 --> 02:15:50.880]   even though there's no rush, they're trying to rush this bill
[02:15:50.880 --> 02:15:53.760]   because I think they're starting to realize
[02:15:53.760 --> 02:15:57.120]   that this is a hot potato and they might have screwed up
[02:15:57.120 --> 02:15:57.920]   in any event.
[02:15:57.920 --> 02:16:00.560]   Yeah, I completely agree.
[02:16:00.560 --> 02:16:01.760]   Is there a place people can go?
[02:16:01.760 --> 02:16:04.080]   There's a petition, right?
[02:16:04.080 --> 02:16:05.520]   Did you talk about this before?
[02:16:05.520 --> 02:16:07.760]   Yes, digitalfirstcanada.ca
[02:16:07.760 --> 02:16:10.320]   and the movement was called Fix C11.
[02:16:10.320 --> 02:16:11.600]   The bill was C10.
[02:16:11.600 --> 02:16:13.200]   It was killed when they called an election.
[02:16:13.200 --> 02:16:16.640]   Now it's back as C11 and it's just, yeah,
[02:16:16.640 --> 02:16:19.200]   it's overly broad and lack specifics
[02:16:19.200 --> 02:16:20.400]   that would be very helpful to us.
[02:16:20.400 --> 02:16:24.400]   Yeah, and we really, if you want to defend people like Renee.
[02:16:24.400 --> 02:16:26.720]   I mean he's Canadian for crying out.
[02:16:26.720 --> 02:16:28.560]   I would point out it's not just a Canadian issue
[02:16:28.560 --> 02:16:30.800]   because there are laws on the books in US states
[02:16:30.800 --> 02:16:33.280]   that are going to try to control what the algorithm serves
[02:16:33.280 --> 02:16:34.080]   or doesn't serve.
[02:16:34.080 --> 02:16:36.000]   The EU has said that they want to start doing
[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:39.520]   content adjustment in a terrifying sense of the word.
[02:16:39.520 --> 02:16:42.400]   Russia famously China would love to be able to tell you
[02:16:42.400 --> 02:16:44.960]   what you shouldn't watch and I don't think Canada should have
[02:16:44.960 --> 02:16:46.880]   any part in providing cover or precedent
[02:16:46.880 --> 02:16:50.080]   for administrations who would go even further than they're going.
[02:16:50.080 --> 02:16:54.160]   Especially important if you're Canadian, digitalfirstcanada.ca
[02:16:54.160 --> 02:16:58.240]   you can send a letter they have a proposed text
[02:16:58.240 --> 02:17:01.280]   that you can copy if you want to fix C11.
[02:17:01.280 --> 02:17:04.880]   I probably doesn't make any difference if I write to Ottawa but
[02:17:04.880 --> 02:17:06.960]   I don't know.
[02:17:06.960 --> 02:17:08.640]   Pete Crump watching you on Tech TV, Leo.
[02:17:08.640 --> 02:17:10.400]   Yeah, maybe I should say.
[02:17:10.400 --> 02:17:14.160]   Yeah, I was happy to do Canadian content as the only American.
[02:17:14.160 --> 02:17:17.040]   I think you need to do a special PSA, Leo,
[02:17:17.040 --> 02:17:18.160]   and put it up there.
[02:17:18.160 --> 02:17:20.560]   There's all those cool help folks that are going to do anyway.
[02:17:20.560 --> 02:17:25.280]   There is a letter you can send as a concerned global citizen
[02:17:25.280 --> 02:17:27.040]   in here at DigitalFirst Canada.
[02:17:27.040 --> 02:17:30.000]   So maybe I should do that.
[02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:31.920]   Yeah, yeah, do a little PSA.
[02:17:31.920 --> 02:17:34.720]   Save YouTube, right?
[02:17:34.720 --> 02:17:36.480]   And I'll just add that it's not about politics
[02:17:36.480 --> 02:17:38.640]   because we've had every single government imaginable
[02:17:38.640 --> 02:17:41.520]   over the last 30 years and none of them fixed the CRTC.
[02:17:41.520 --> 02:17:44.400]   It is all of them are happy to take lobbyists money
[02:17:44.400 --> 02:17:46.240]   and the thing they argue with most is each other.
[02:17:46.240 --> 02:17:48.240]   So like, don't worry about the politics at all.
[02:17:48.240 --> 02:17:50.560]   Just figure, think about the YouTube that you want to have
[02:17:50.560 --> 02:17:51.520]   and how you can best protect it.
[02:17:51.520 --> 02:17:54.800]   You're not against the notion of Canadian content, are you?
[02:17:54.800 --> 02:17:56.000]   Not at all.
[02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:59.600]   It just the difference to me is that local and national broadcasters
[02:17:59.600 --> 02:18:02.960]   reflect back Canadian culture to us and that's very important.
[02:18:02.960 --> 02:18:04.960]   But YouTube is an international platform
[02:18:04.960 --> 02:18:05.920]   and instead of restricting it,
[02:18:05.920 --> 02:18:07.760]   we should be using it to broadcast our voices
[02:18:07.760 --> 02:18:09.040]   and our culture to everybody.
[02:18:09.040 --> 02:18:12.560]   And that's what this threatens because it would hurt Canadian creators' ability
[02:18:12.560 --> 02:18:15.360]   to be seen algorithmically outside of our own borders.
[02:18:15.360 --> 02:18:18.160]   It would create like exact opposite of what you'd want.
[02:18:18.160 --> 02:18:18.400]   Yes.
[02:18:18.400 --> 02:18:19.520]   Yeah.
[02:18:19.520 --> 02:18:23.680]   And Canadians would be forced to take us instead of want like,
[02:18:23.680 --> 02:18:25.200]   we're doing great.
[02:18:25.200 --> 02:18:28.000]   Like we're punching so far above our weight already on YouTube.
[02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:29.440]   The only thing this can do is hurt us.
[02:18:29.440 --> 02:18:31.120]   So like we'd rather they just ignore us.
[02:18:31.120 --> 02:18:31.840]   Very good point.
[02:18:31.840 --> 02:18:35.440]   DigitalFirstCanada.ca
[02:18:35.440 --> 02:18:37.360]   And we have Ryan George.
[02:18:37.360 --> 02:18:37.840]   We're fine.
[02:18:37.840 --> 02:18:40.800]   Andy and I go pick of the week.
[02:18:41.760 --> 02:18:45.200]   Actually, I didn't find, I didn't come across anything tech related
[02:18:45.200 --> 02:18:46.880]   that really got me excited this week.
[02:18:46.880 --> 02:18:49.600]   So but one that did get me excited was
[02:18:49.600 --> 02:18:53.920]   I found out about a new bunch of Joy Steedonato vocal master classes
[02:18:53.920 --> 02:18:55.040]   that hit YouTube.
[02:18:55.040 --> 02:18:57.920]   She gave a master class at the San Francisco Academy,
[02:18:57.920 --> 02:19:01.600]   excuse me, Conservatory of Music last month and they just got posted to YouTube.
[02:19:01.600 --> 02:19:05.200]   I love, I mean, I've talked about opera a lot on this show.
[02:19:05.200 --> 02:19:09.680]   But you don't have to be a fan of opera to really enjoy these master classes.
[02:19:09.680 --> 02:19:12.640]   Because they're not, at least especially the way the Joy Steedonato,
[02:19:12.640 --> 02:19:14.720]   one of my favorite Sopranos does them.
[02:19:14.720 --> 02:19:16.960]   It's not about, okay, well, you missed that note there.
[02:19:16.960 --> 02:19:18.640]   You need to hold that note longer.
[02:19:18.640 --> 02:19:22.560]   And if you think you're, I was full that you didn't do that trail thing.
[02:19:22.560 --> 02:19:25.120]   It's always about here's how you approach the work,
[02:19:25.120 --> 02:19:27.600]   especially this creative work and this expressive work.
[02:19:27.600 --> 02:19:30.160]   So there's a student who's a student who's sing for her
[02:19:30.160 --> 02:19:32.080]   and then she works with them.
[02:19:32.080 --> 02:19:33.280]   Oh, that's so cool.
[02:19:33.280 --> 02:19:37.440]   This video is for like four students in a full like auditorium.
[02:19:37.440 --> 02:19:41.040]   And it's treated like a classroom, not as a critique and not as an audition.
[02:19:41.040 --> 02:19:45.360]   So they sing an aria and then she has notes and she talks things out with them.
[02:19:45.360 --> 02:19:51.120]   And maybe they'll redo a few parts incorporating some of the things that she suggested that they
[02:19:51.120 --> 02:19:52.240]   think about or observe.
[02:19:52.240 --> 02:19:53.920]   And like I said, it's not technical stuff.
[02:19:53.920 --> 02:19:58.320]   Well, you sure is rarely about, oh, well, you should be, your neck should be like this
[02:19:58.320 --> 02:20:03.120]   and you're not really, it's more like things like, okay, well, in this part of the aria,
[02:20:03.120 --> 02:20:05.280]   you basically made this gesture here.
[02:20:05.280 --> 02:20:10.240]   But you should understand that like this character, he doesn't have time to make these broad swinging
[02:20:10.240 --> 02:20:12.800]   gestures because she's the situation there.
[02:20:12.800 --> 02:20:17.840]   I mean, the thing it's always so inspirational to me because consistently, and there are hours
[02:20:17.840 --> 02:20:22.000]   and hours and hours of her master classes at the Carnegie Hall and elsewhere.
[02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:27.040]   And they're always about one of the common themes is just that, I mean,
[02:20:27.040 --> 02:20:33.360]   it takes an opera singer, a student like 10 years just to learn how to sing an aria correctly.
[02:20:33.360 --> 02:20:36.320]   And she and her thing is always the, okay, great.
[02:20:36.320 --> 02:20:40.560]   You can, you are now capable of singing this aria and making it a very, very pretty performance.
[02:20:40.560 --> 02:20:41.600]   But that's not enough.
[02:20:41.600 --> 02:20:43.040]   That's now the starting point.
[02:20:43.040 --> 02:20:44.480]   You have not solved this.
[02:20:44.480 --> 02:20:49.840]   You can't ever think that just because you know how to sing this song very, very beautifully,
[02:20:49.840 --> 02:20:53.440]   this is not a solved problem that you just have to repeat now for the rest of your career.
[02:20:53.440 --> 02:20:56.480]   You have to always be thinking about what you're doing, how you're doing it,
[02:20:56.480 --> 02:21:01.120]   what you're trying to communicate, what you're trying to access, and how you should best do that.
[02:21:01.120 --> 02:21:05.840]   And there's so many times where like, you know, if I'm having a crap week of writing or creating
[02:21:05.840 --> 02:21:10.400]   or something, I will put on like, I have a playlist of like a hundred of these things.
[02:21:10.400 --> 02:21:14.960]   And I will put on one of these things and it will basically energize me to go back to my work,
[02:21:14.960 --> 02:21:20.480]   find out what I need to do, find out what I'm not doing, and find a new level that might be there
[02:21:20.480 --> 02:21:21.840]   that's worth seeking out.
[02:21:21.840 --> 02:21:22.720]   It's very, very interesting.
[02:21:22.720 --> 02:21:25.840]   And of course, it's just you're amazed that these are, these aren't professionals.
[02:21:25.840 --> 02:21:27.280]   These are just students.
[02:21:27.280 --> 02:21:29.600]   And they're singing like, oh my God.
[02:21:29.600 --> 02:21:34.320]   And the other magical thing is that at the end, like they will, like they will maybe like incorporate
[02:21:34.320 --> 02:21:37.040]   some of the things that she's been sort of trying to get into them.
[02:21:37.040 --> 02:21:42.960]   And you realize that you were blown away by just how they sung it at the start of the session.
[02:21:42.960 --> 02:21:45.520]   But now you're like, oh my God, now I totally get it.
[02:21:45.520 --> 02:21:51.360]   That was like, that was beautiful, but it wasn't nearly as big and impactful as what I'm just hearing
[02:21:51.360 --> 02:21:52.000]   right now.
[02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.640]   So high, high recommendation for this stuff.
[02:21:54.640 --> 02:21:57.440]   Again, her, she's really, really gifted.
[02:21:57.440 --> 02:22:02.320]   I think that early career she was planning to be a music teacher, not an opera star.
[02:22:02.320 --> 02:22:06.400]   She didn't get into opera until like her mid 20s, which would have been very, very late
[02:22:06.400 --> 02:22:07.440]   for that kind of career.
[02:22:07.440 --> 02:22:10.640]   It shows like how gifted she is as an educator and a communicator.
[02:22:10.640 --> 02:22:17.680]   And as an additional point of interest, her accompanist is apparently using the new 14.1
[02:22:17.680 --> 02:22:20.480]   in Schipad to play his music.
[02:22:20.480 --> 02:22:22.480]   I don't know what he's put that his there, but.
[02:22:22.480 --> 02:22:24.720]   A big old tablet.
[02:22:24.720 --> 02:22:26.400]   Big old tablet.
[02:22:26.960 --> 02:22:28.000]   I don't know what that is.
[02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.160]   Very good.
[02:22:30.160 --> 02:22:31.520]   I'll watch this.
[02:22:31.520 --> 02:22:33.760]   That sounds really interesting.
[02:22:33.760 --> 02:22:35.920]   Thank you, Andy.
[02:22:35.920 --> 02:22:40.320]   Mr. Alex Lindsey wraps it up with his pick of the week.
[02:22:40.320 --> 02:22:44.720]   So a lot of us have a lot of cameras.
[02:22:44.720 --> 02:22:46.240]   Some of us have a lot of cameras.
[02:22:46.240 --> 02:22:49.840]   And one of the big problems that you end up with with these cameras is the wiring.
[02:22:49.840 --> 02:22:56.560]   So you have the power, you have the HDMI or STI, you have possibly
[02:22:56.560 --> 02:22:57.360]   audio going in.
[02:22:57.360 --> 02:23:03.200]   And how do you keep all of those kind of wrangled without too much stress on the connections without
[02:23:03.200 --> 02:23:04.160]   making those things work?
[02:23:04.160 --> 02:23:05.120]   That's always a big challenge.
[02:23:05.120 --> 02:23:05.920]   We use gaff tape.
[02:23:05.920 --> 02:23:07.280]   We use velcro ties.
[02:23:07.280 --> 02:23:08.400]   We use zip ties.
[02:23:08.400 --> 02:23:10.800]   We use all kinds of things to attach those.
[02:23:10.800 --> 02:23:18.960]   And we ran into one at Cinegar, literally hadn't seen it before.
[02:23:18.960 --> 02:23:21.440]   And it's this little thing here called a sprig.
[02:23:21.440 --> 02:23:24.000]   And so this is a company called Sprig.
[02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:27.360]   And basically this little thing goes right into our cage.
[02:23:27.360 --> 02:23:29.120]   I can't believe somebody made a company yet.
[02:23:29.120 --> 02:23:32.960]   So here's what this look like.
[02:23:32.960 --> 02:23:33.600]   I couldn't believe it.
[02:23:33.600 --> 02:23:35.280]   I had this little 10 foot booth.
[02:23:35.280 --> 02:23:36.800]   It is so great though.
[02:23:36.800 --> 02:23:39.600]   So these are just me playing with this.
[02:23:39.600 --> 02:23:40.480]   I literally just got it.
[02:23:40.480 --> 02:23:43.200]   We saw it on Saturday and it arrived yesterday.
[02:23:43.200 --> 02:23:45.200]   I was like, I'm buying bags of these.
[02:23:45.200 --> 02:23:50.240]   So this is kind of routing around one of my cameras.
[02:23:50.240 --> 02:23:52.720]   So now I have this is in place.
[02:23:52.720 --> 02:23:56.080]   This isn't going to get pulled off by just getting pulled here.
[02:23:56.080 --> 02:24:01.040]   So I can get it to route exactly the way I want around that camera.
[02:24:01.040 --> 02:24:04.320]   Now a lot of us have the, it works because a lot of us have these cages.
[02:24:04.320 --> 02:24:06.560]   So we have cages, but you can also put it.
[02:24:06.560 --> 02:24:07.600]   It's just a quarter 20.
[02:24:07.600 --> 02:24:10.320]   So any part of your camera that has a quarter 20 input,
[02:24:10.320 --> 02:24:13.600]   the little place that you put it on the tripod and a lot of these newer cameras
[02:24:13.600 --> 02:24:15.760]   have a couple of those wrapped around it,
[02:24:15.760 --> 02:24:19.200]   you can drop one of these sprigs and start to really manage the,
[02:24:19.200 --> 02:24:21.440]   you know, have some more cable management with it.
[02:24:21.440 --> 02:24:22.800]   And they're cheap.
[02:24:22.800 --> 02:24:26.240]   I mean, they're like eight bucks or 10 bucks for six of them.
[02:24:26.240 --> 02:24:27.280]   It's not a particularly expensive.
[02:24:27.280 --> 02:24:28.640]   You can buy them on Amazon.
[02:24:28.640 --> 02:24:34.400]   And for those of us who have dealt with this for, in my case decades,
[02:24:34.400 --> 02:24:36.240]   it's kind of life changing.
[02:24:36.240 --> 02:24:41.680]   It's like, you can't believe they did it, but it is, but you're just like,
[02:24:41.680 --> 02:24:46.240]   I cannot believe I didn't have something like this to make it work.
[02:24:46.240 --> 02:24:50.800]   So so that's, it's a, it's a, again, if you're not dealing with lots of cameras
[02:24:50.800 --> 02:24:53.120]   with lots of wires, it's probably not as exciting.
[02:24:53.120 --> 02:24:55.840]   But there's, I know there's some people watching this now that'll be like,
[02:24:55.840 --> 02:24:57.600]   they're all running to Amazon.
[02:24:57.600 --> 02:25:00.800]   You should break it right now because, because it will be sold out now.
[02:25:00.800 --> 02:25:03.360]   So the, anyway, it's a great, great product.
[02:25:03.360 --> 02:25:04.480]   And you know, somebody's a gaffer.
[02:25:04.480 --> 02:25:07.920]   If he has the sprig holder on his key chain, right?
[02:25:07.920 --> 02:25:11.200]   Because you never know what you're going to do.
[02:25:11.200 --> 02:25:11.680]   You never know.
[02:25:11.680 --> 02:25:12.480]   And you need a sprig.
[02:25:12.480 --> 02:25:13.200]   Whatever.
[02:25:13.200 --> 02:25:14.160]   Let's put a sprig in there.
[02:25:14.160 --> 02:25:14.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:25:14.800 --> 02:25:16.880]   So that's, that's my, that's my biggest call.
[02:25:16.880 --> 02:25:18.560]   I'm always amazed at what people call with it.
[02:25:18.560 --> 02:25:21.680]   It was like something that I didn't know was missing until I saw it.
[02:25:21.680 --> 02:25:22.640]   And then it was missing a lot.
[02:25:22.640 --> 02:25:24.960]   Now did you get the new glow in the dark color?
[02:25:24.960 --> 02:25:26.000]   Because that would be kind of fun.
[02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:27.520]   I did not, I did not get them.
[02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:28.640]   I guess they're $18.
[02:25:28.640 --> 02:25:29.680]   I didn't know how much it was.
[02:25:29.680 --> 02:25:30.080]   It didn't matter.
[02:25:30.080 --> 02:25:34.000]   I was like, well, funnily enough, the glow in the dark is a dollar less.
[02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:35.040]   It's only 17.
[02:25:35.040 --> 02:25:36.400]   Yeah, cheaper evidently to make.
[02:25:36.400 --> 02:25:37.040]   For six.
[02:25:37.040 --> 02:25:37.920]   So it's maybe.
[02:25:37.920 --> 02:25:42.960]   Yeah, but they're, they're, they're, um, anyway, for, for those of us who do this a lot,
[02:25:42.960 --> 02:25:46.000]   uh, I have a feeling I'm going to end up with bags and bags and bags of them.
[02:25:46.480 --> 02:25:50.160]   Um, the, uh, the other thing I was going to mention that I just got really obsessed with
[02:25:50.160 --> 02:25:52.160]   over the last couple of days is two minute paper.
[02:25:52.160 --> 02:25:53.760]   Uh, it's in on YouTube.
[02:25:53.760 --> 02:25:55.520]   I don't know if you've seen two minute paper.
[02:25:55.520 --> 02:26:00.800]   I will warn you that if you're concerned about our AI overlords, this is not the site to watch.
[02:26:00.800 --> 02:26:06.080]   Um, you know, so, uh, this is, but the video that they show, there's a bunch of videos that
[02:26:06.080 --> 02:26:07.280]   they're just looking at what.
[02:26:07.280 --> 02:26:12.640]   If the eyes do stuff, oh, you got to, you got to watch the one that's on the main one,
[02:26:12.640 --> 02:26:13.920]   the trailer that the, or the main.
[02:26:13.920 --> 02:26:14.560]   Yeah.
[02:26:14.560 --> 02:26:14.720]   Yeah.
[02:26:14.720 --> 02:26:15.840]   The front page.
[02:26:15.840 --> 02:26:16.160]   Yeah.
[02:26:16.400 --> 02:26:20.160]   It's showing, it's showing these little characters and some of them are seekers and some of them are
[02:26:20.160 --> 02:26:21.040]   high, hiding.
[02:26:21.040 --> 02:26:28.560]   And when they start, neither of them know really what to do, but it shows how not only do the,
[02:26:28.560 --> 02:26:33.920]   do they get good at this, but they find bugs inside of the simulator, like physics bugs,
[02:26:33.920 --> 02:26:37.280]   like they figured out that they could just push it through a corner and it would just disappear.
[02:26:37.280 --> 02:26:41.440]   And, and, and just like over a hundred million tries, right?
[02:26:41.440 --> 02:26:43.680]   Like, you know, like, because the simulator just runs and runs and runs.
[02:26:43.680 --> 02:26:46.080]   And the reason I think one of the reasons I'm so excited about this video is
[02:26:46.080 --> 02:26:48.080]   this is almost exactly what I worked on 30 years ago.
[02:26:48.080 --> 02:26:49.120]   I love this stuff.
[02:26:49.120 --> 02:26:56.000]   So I used to have a brief walker, a screensaver that would slowly teach itself how to walk.
[02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:57.440]   These guys were what?
[02:26:57.440 --> 02:26:59.360]   Are they learning how to navigate things?
[02:26:59.360 --> 02:27:00.400]   First they learn, yeah.
[02:27:00.400 --> 02:27:01.120]   Look at this right here.
[02:27:01.120 --> 02:27:01.840]   They don't know anything.
[02:27:01.840 --> 02:27:04.400]   They don't know, they don't know what, why they're even there.
[02:27:04.400 --> 02:27:05.840]   But they have a, they have a goal.
[02:27:05.840 --> 02:27:08.720]   They have a rule that says, yeah, don't get killed.
[02:27:08.720 --> 02:27:09.280]   Don't die.
[02:27:09.280 --> 02:27:09.680]   Don't die.
[02:27:09.680 --> 02:27:10.160]   That's it.
[02:27:10.160 --> 02:27:10.480]   Okay.
[02:27:10.480 --> 02:27:10.640]   Yeah.
[02:27:10.640 --> 02:27:11.120]   Don't die.
[02:27:11.120 --> 02:27:13.760]   And so, or don't get caught or whatever by the seekers.
[02:27:13.760 --> 02:27:16.960]   And so, and the seekers don't even know that they're, you know, like they're getting a
[02:27:16.960 --> 02:27:17.680]   positive reinforcement.
[02:27:17.680 --> 02:27:23.760]   So then over time, they figure out how to block the seekers out, you know, from getting in.
[02:27:23.760 --> 02:27:24.240]   Smart.
[02:27:24.240 --> 02:27:28.640]   And then, and then over time, there's, there's a place where the seekers learn, if you go a
[02:27:28.640 --> 02:27:33.120]   little further forward, the seekers learn how to use that ramp, you know, to get up and over.
[02:27:33.120 --> 02:27:38.960]   And then, and then the little guys figure out how to trap the, throw the ramp away.
[02:27:38.960 --> 02:27:40.640]   And then they figure out how to throw the ramp away.
[02:27:40.640 --> 02:27:42.960]   Like, because right in the corner, there's a physics.
[02:27:42.960 --> 02:27:47.040]   And then the seekers, the craziest one is at the very end, not the very end, but almost to the end.
[02:27:47.040 --> 02:27:53.120]   The seekers figure out how to create a bug in the simulator, in the physics simulator,
[02:27:53.120 --> 02:27:58.080]   to be fired over top of them and hit them while, hit them in the air.
[02:27:58.080 --> 02:28:01.040]   Like it's like total like, it's, it's total like.
[02:28:01.040 --> 02:28:03.920]   So open AI designed the map.
[02:28:03.920 --> 02:28:08.480]   And then is, is doing the solving of them as this is.
[02:28:08.480 --> 02:28:11.920]   So this thing is completely like, like, nobody programmed it.
[02:28:11.920 --> 02:28:12.080]   Yeah.
[02:28:12.080 --> 02:28:12.560]   Yeah.
[02:28:12.560 --> 02:28:13.040]   Yeah.
[02:28:13.040 --> 02:28:14.000]   But it's, yeah.
[02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:17.840]   And all of the stuff is there, they're all, they're all, these are, they're figuring this out.
[02:28:17.840 --> 02:28:18.080]   Right.
[02:28:18.080 --> 02:28:19.440]   Looks to see that.
[02:28:19.440 --> 02:28:20.560]   They got the ramp.
[02:28:20.560 --> 02:28:21.040]   Take it in.
[02:28:21.040 --> 02:28:22.000]   But now you can't get in.
[02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.800]   They still ramp so that they, so that, right, they can't get breach the wall.
[02:28:24.800 --> 02:28:24.960]   Right.
[02:28:24.960 --> 02:28:28.800]   Well, and then, and then this is after, you know, and then there's, there's some point here where,
[02:28:28.800 --> 02:28:30.320]   I think it'll show it really in a second.
[02:28:30.320 --> 02:28:31.600]   Millions of tries though, right?
[02:28:31.600 --> 02:28:32.160]   We're seeing it.
[02:28:32.160 --> 02:28:32.640]   Yeah.
[02:28:32.640 --> 02:28:34.640]   You're seeing, they're just, yeah.
[02:28:34.640 --> 02:28:37.680]   I know you're, I know you're, my hundreds and sometimes hundreds of millions of tries.
[02:28:37.680 --> 02:28:38.080]   Yeah.
[02:28:38.080 --> 02:28:40.320]   But the next one, I think you're almost there.
[02:28:40.320 --> 02:28:40.560]   Hold on.
[02:28:40.560 --> 02:28:44.320]   Let's see. I think that they show one where it figured out, you're giving it more time.
[02:28:44.320 --> 02:28:46.960]   I don't know why they keep on trying it over and over again.
[02:28:46.960 --> 02:28:47.840]   Oh, anyway.
[02:28:47.840 --> 02:28:52.400]   I think later on it shows you the bugs, but they, this one, this one's funny because this,
[02:28:52.400 --> 02:28:57.520]   this guy jumps up on the ramp and he found a bug, which is that you can move, he can move
[02:28:57.520 --> 02:28:57.760]   the box.
[02:28:57.760 --> 02:28:58.320]   You can ride the box.
[02:28:58.320 --> 02:28:58.640]   Ah.
[02:28:58.640 --> 02:29:02.720]   He can ride the box and they said, just because we didn't, we didn't think of him ever being able to,
[02:29:02.720 --> 02:29:03.840]   why would you ever do that?
[02:29:03.840 --> 02:29:06.640]   You know, so he found something that you couldn't, that you couldn't do.
[02:29:06.640 --> 02:29:06.880]   Oh man.
[02:29:06.880 --> 02:29:09.680]   And people say, oh, evolution couldn't happen.
[02:29:09.680 --> 02:29:16.880]   I mean, this is from random, just completely random movements, you finally figure out how to
[02:29:16.880 --> 02:29:18.960]   do something that seems intelligent.
[02:29:18.960 --> 02:29:21.680]   It's kind of incredible, incredible.
[02:29:21.680 --> 02:29:26.480]   So this is, this is a part of a YouTube channel called two minute papers.
[02:29:26.480 --> 02:29:27.600]   What a time.
[02:29:27.600 --> 02:29:31.360]   I was looking for dolly stuff, but yeah, he always says it and then he shows you these
[02:29:31.360 --> 02:29:32.160]   things and goes, what is it?
[02:29:32.160 --> 02:29:33.440]   What a time it is to be alive.
[02:29:33.440 --> 02:29:34.400]   Yeah, it is.
[02:29:34.960 --> 02:29:40.560]   So here's, it does have examples of what you can do with dolly, which is kind of cool too.
[02:29:40.560 --> 02:29:42.720]   Very interesting.
[02:29:42.720 --> 02:29:44.240]   Wow.
[02:29:44.240 --> 02:29:47.280]   I am going to have, I have a feeling this is going to waste a lot of my time.
[02:29:47.280 --> 02:29:50.160]   I apologize because it, I lost, I lost an hour.
[02:29:50.160 --> 02:29:51.200]   Like just watching.
[02:29:51.200 --> 02:29:55.280]   Oh, well, I don't, I've only known about it for like 36 hours.
[02:29:55.280 --> 02:29:58.160]   So I lost one, I'm surprised you showed up at all.
[02:29:58.160 --> 02:29:59.760]   That's hard.
[02:30:01.440 --> 02:30:05.680]   Deep mind, open AI, dolly and video robot arm.
[02:30:05.680 --> 02:30:07.760]   It's all sorts of different ais.
[02:30:07.760 --> 02:30:08.640]   Yeah.
[02:30:08.640 --> 02:30:12.400]   This is a, a primer for where the world is headed.
[02:30:12.400 --> 02:30:17.680]   Here's a, here's the top 10 weird dolly results.
[02:30:17.680 --> 02:30:22.640]   A triangular green clock.
[02:30:22.640 --> 02:30:24.000]   Okay.
[02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:28.400]   A teddy bear and a skateboard and time square.
[02:30:28.400 --> 02:30:30.640]   It's pretty amazing what dolly can do.
[02:30:30.640 --> 02:30:31.600]   I have to say.
[02:30:31.600 --> 02:30:35.760]   My favorite is mid-century modern chair that looks like an apple
[02:30:35.760 --> 02:30:39.840]   and it's a picture of my god that would, that would sell so well.
[02:30:39.840 --> 02:30:42.240]   This one here looks, that's the avocado.
[02:30:42.240 --> 02:30:48.640]   Wow.
[02:30:48.640 --> 02:30:50.240]   Wow.
[02:30:50.240 --> 02:30:51.360]   Very cool.
[02:30:51.360 --> 02:30:52.480]   I will be watching this.
[02:30:52.480 --> 02:30:54.000]   Thank you.
[02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.480]   Two minute papers.
[02:30:56.480 --> 02:30:57.600]   Very, very good.
[02:30:57.760 --> 02:31:05.120]   Um, well, I guess the show's over, but thank you very much.
[02:31:05.120 --> 02:31:07.200]   I hate to end it, but thank you very much.
[02:31:07.200 --> 02:31:10.080]   Renee Richie.com/youtube.
[02:31:10.080 --> 02:31:12.080]   Do watch that M2 video.
[02:31:12.080 --> 02:31:16.000]   There's lots of great stuff at Renee Richie.com/youtube.
[02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:16.800]   I'm going to follow up.
[02:31:16.800 --> 02:31:18.960]   I'm going to post tonight or tomorrow morning on what this means
[02:31:18.960 --> 02:31:20.480]   for the M2 family of chips.
[02:31:20.480 --> 02:31:22.560]   You work so damn hard.
[02:31:22.560 --> 02:31:25.120]   I don't think you do.
[02:31:25.120 --> 02:31:26.480]   So much stuff.
[02:31:27.440 --> 02:31:29.040]   Uh, really, really great stuff.
[02:31:29.040 --> 02:31:30.320]   Here's Alex.
[02:31:30.320 --> 02:31:30.560]   Yep.
[02:31:30.560 --> 02:31:32.000]   Very good.
[02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:36.560]   Yeah, you were on the, uh, the office hours, uh, global, uh, post.
[02:31:36.560 --> 02:31:37.200]   We streamed it to both.
[02:31:37.200 --> 02:31:37.520]   Nice.
[02:31:37.520 --> 02:31:37.920]   Yeah.
[02:31:37.920 --> 02:31:39.200]   I was, I was on two hours.
[02:31:39.200 --> 02:31:42.560]   Well, I can only imagine it's three weeks of coverage in one day on office hours.
[02:31:42.560 --> 02:31:42.880]   Wow.
[02:31:42.880 --> 02:31:43.920]   It was fun.
[02:31:43.920 --> 02:31:44.640]   We had a great time.
[02:31:44.640 --> 02:31:45.120]   Renee.
[02:31:45.120 --> 02:31:45.840]   This was great in the great show.
[02:31:45.840 --> 02:31:50.640]   What wasn't your, what wasn't your pick of the week like mattresses, pillows, you know,
[02:31:50.640 --> 02:31:53.440]   things that could, I don't know, now that I'm going to sleep again,
[02:31:53.440 --> 02:31:56.080]   I'm most, I'm most grateful for
[02:31:56.960 --> 02:31:57.680]   peace and quiet.
[02:31:57.680 --> 02:31:57.920]   Yeah.
[02:31:57.920 --> 02:32:00.240]   Because I share protectors and near muffs.
[02:32:00.240 --> 02:32:01.760]   Yep.
[02:32:01.760 --> 02:32:05.520]   Annie and I, when are you going to be on GBH in Boston next?
[02:32:05.520 --> 02:32:10.880]   I am on a day early because Thursday is being preempted by January 6th commission coverage.
[02:32:10.880 --> 02:32:15.520]   So I'm on tomorrow at, I think like one o'clock, one 10, uh, Wednesday.
[02:32:15.520 --> 02:32:22.080]   So if you go to WGBH news.org, I was also on Bob Sarat's show again on WGN in Chicago.
[02:32:22.080 --> 02:32:26.400]   If you go to WGNradio.com, uh, they actually already have like my
[02:32:26.400 --> 02:32:30.000]   segments as individual stories posted as audio streaming stream that there right now.
[02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:30.400]   Awesome.
[02:32:30.400 --> 02:32:31.920]   Thank you, Andrew.
[02:32:31.920 --> 02:32:33.360]   And of course, Office Hours.
[02:32:33.360 --> 02:32:36.400]   Global is where you'll find Alex Lindsey most of the day.
[02:32:36.400 --> 02:32:41.280]   Just in the morning, actually, just, we got it all done pretty quickly.
[02:32:41.280 --> 02:32:44.400]   And by nine o'clock, I'm off to work, but, uh, it's, uh, they keep going though,
[02:32:44.400 --> 02:32:44.960]   which is great.
[02:32:44.960 --> 02:32:45.440]   Nick.
[02:32:45.440 --> 02:32:45.600]   Yeah.
[02:32:45.600 --> 02:32:45.600]   Yeah.
[02:32:45.600 --> 02:32:46.240]   All day.
[02:32:46.240 --> 02:32:46.960]   They, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they,
[02:32:46.960 --> 02:32:47.440]   they jump in.
[02:32:47.440 --> 02:32:51.200]   I jump in and listen for a little while, because it's like, it's like, uh, the geekiest water
[02:32:51.200 --> 02:32:51.840]   cooler ever.
[02:32:51.840 --> 02:32:52.240]   Yeah.
[02:32:52.240 --> 02:32:54.400]   Um, and, uh, but we, uh, we have Nick Josh,
[02:32:54.400 --> 02:32:58.560]   from Drexel University is going to be talking tomorrow about, um, mesh to metahuman.
[02:32:58.560 --> 02:33:02.640]   So this is the new thing that, that Epic just released, which is you can actually do
[02:33:02.640 --> 02:33:07.200]   photogrammetry of your head and then add it to a metahuman and then animate it and unreal.
[02:33:07.200 --> 02:33:09.360]   So it's, it's yourself.
[02:33:09.360 --> 02:33:13.760]   So it's kind of a, so it, um, that he's going to talk about step by step on how to do that.
[02:33:13.760 --> 02:33:14.560]   So it should be a lot of fun.
[02:33:14.560 --> 02:33:16.800]   I do feel like I'm living in the future with you guys.
[02:33:16.800 --> 02:33:21.040]   I can't see how that could possibly have any bad repercussions for anyone.
[02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:26.160]   I was, I was surprised there was rumors that it, that it was available last year.
[02:33:26.160 --> 02:33:31.120]   And I did a, I did a whole thing with metahuman last year, like a whole, you know, keynote with it.
[02:33:31.120 --> 02:33:35.600]   And, uh, we really want to, that mesh to human thing and we're like, we know you have it.
[02:33:35.600 --> 02:33:36.640]   And they just wouldn't really say.
[02:33:36.640 --> 02:33:37.200]   Sorry.
[02:33:37.200 --> 02:33:39.040]   So it's, so it's out now.
[02:33:39.040 --> 02:33:39.520]   It's out now.
[02:33:39.520 --> 02:33:40.640]   Office hours.global.
[02:33:40.640 --> 02:33:47.360]   If you want to hire Mr. Lindsey for your next streaming event, oh nine, oh dot media.
[02:33:47.360 --> 02:33:49.440]   Thank you, Alex.
[02:33:49.440 --> 02:33:50.560]   Thank you.
[02:33:50.560 --> 02:33:50.960]   Andy.
[02:33:50.960 --> 02:33:51.360]   Thank you.
[02:33:51.360 --> 02:33:51.760]   Renee.
[02:33:51.760 --> 02:33:53.280]   Thanks to all of you for joining us.
[02:33:53.280 --> 02:33:54.400]   We do Mac break weekly.

[02:34:02.720 --> 02:34:04.800]   You could figure out where it is in your time zone.
[02:34:04.800 --> 02:34:09.360]   I tell you the lifetime because you can watch live at live dot twits dot tv.
[02:34:09.360 --> 02:34:15.120]   You can chat with us live at irc dot twit.tv club members, of course, in our discord.

[02:34:23.280 --> 02:34:23.760]   I like it.
[02:34:23.760 --> 02:34:25.040]   I hope you guys like it.
