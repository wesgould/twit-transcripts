[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.560]   And yes, I'm back.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.960]   Thank you, Andy and Micah and everybody for filling in for me last week.
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.560]   Back from CES.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.160]   The whole gang has assembled Renee Richie from iMore.com.
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.240]   Good to see you Renee.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.720]   Welcome.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.520]   Good to see you, Lee.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.440]   I enjoyed yours and Lori's coverage so much.
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.040]   I had massive FOMO not being there this year, but you helped, you helped satiate it.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.200]   It was, you know, in hindsight it was fun.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.080]   It's like having a baby.
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.120]   You quickly forget the pain.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.160]   Lori, it's the only way God can get you to do it twice.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.520]   Lori Gill was at CES from iMore.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.400]   She's managing editor.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.160]   That was great running into you.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.520]   It was great seeing you.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.600]   I wish we'd had more time together, but we both had miles to go.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.680]   Next year, let's plan something ahead of time.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.720]   That way we can like actually do a segment or something like that.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.760]   You should be part of our coverage.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.840]   That's what we should do as we should go.
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.920]   One of the things I neglected to do is go around and see Apple and iPad stuff at CES.
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.280]   There was a bit of it, I think.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.560]   Did you, is that what you covered?
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.000]   Couple of things, yeah.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.480]   Yeah.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.800]   Yeah.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.040]   You know, accessories and cool stuff like that.
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.640]   Also here, Andy Inaco, who is as always homebound from Inaco.com.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.120]   Oh, come on.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.400]   I'm still on crutches, but I'm not like, oh, okay.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.160]   Actually, if anyone wants to drop off home, cook meals, I should play the stuff.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.440]   Oh, we should do a covered dish brigade for Andrew.
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.040]   So he doesn't have to cook.
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.040]   It was great New Year's Eve because I was able to like guilt people to say,
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.120]   well, you know, I'm going to just have an open house on on January 1st.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.280]   So if you want to come over and have some whiskey and watch some movies,
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.040]   but that's okay being a shut in.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.680]   It's all right.
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.880]   I just, I raised my friends so they could have independent lives.
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.520]   He's an old man before his time.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.200]   I want to pity.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.040]   Also with this in studio, Alex Lindsey.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.480]   Did you go to CES or no?
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.880]   No, no, you usually do, don't you?
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.320]   This is the first year in a long time.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.360]   I was just busy.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.200]   I'm going to put some stuff first year in a long time.
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:53.680]   I've gone.
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.720]   I hadn't gone in eight years.
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.920]   I thought if I wait every 10, eight to 10 years before I go.
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:58.320]   It's impressive.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.240]   Yeah, they'll be new stuff.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.120]   It's not that new.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.200]   Although I talked about eight years ago, will actually be available.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.040]   Well, that's a good example because because of course, TVs are always a big part of CES and
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.040]   eight K as you would expect.
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.560]   Oh, by the way, hey, I'm glad to be able to say this for the first time this year.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.760]   Mike has said it last show, but this is our last best studios.
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.400]   Hey, like that.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.720]   Nice.
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:29.760]   They had a lot of 8K TVs, especially the micro LEDs, although there were QLED and other kinds of
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.440]   LCD based 8K.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.960]   But the most impressive was Samsungs.
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.080]   They call it the wall.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.280]   It was 290 inches or something.
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.160]   Did you see that, Laurie?
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.040]   Yeah, it was really impressive.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.320]   When a tiger comes at you out of that wall, you run.
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.840]   It made me think about the early days of motion pictures.
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.960]   Remember the first movie had a train coming at you out of a tunnel?
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:53.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.240]   People were terrified and left the theater screaming.
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.280]   It was kind of like that.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.320]   Yeah.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.280]   Very realistic.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.240]   That's the experience I had.
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.200]   I have a question for you, Leo.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.440]   Yeah.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.440]   Just watching it from home, I was struck by two things.
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.080]   One, all of our tech friends were saying, oh, this is really the concept electronic show.
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.120]   It's not the consumer.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.040]   Yeah, all they covered was the concepts.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.240]   Well, that's all that's there, really.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.760]   There were a lot of concept cars, concept products.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.800]   But that's the phone.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.600]   I've cautioned.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.240]   Yeah, a lot of folding phones that will never come out.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.000]   I've been cautioned in people about that for 10 years ago.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.840]   I said, look, nothing you're going to see here will be available at best until the end of the year.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.960]   And in many cases will never be available.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.840]   Sony got a lot of attention for announcing a car that they will never make.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.160]   No, it's a concept car.
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:42.880]   It didn't look particularly.
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:43.360]   The drive man.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.480]   They didn't even call it the drive man.
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.960]   I was waiting.
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.440]   Yeah, Groover said it should be called the concept electronic show.
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.400]   But look, Lenovo, I actually had to like, I actually had a single out Lenovo saying,
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:57.440]   oh my God, they don't, not only did they show off this really interesting looking folding version
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.480]   of the ThinkPad, but they actually offered specs.
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.320]   They let the people, the reporters actually play with it and do things with it.
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.640]   And they announced like a ship date at a price.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.960]   This is what, what show am I at?
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.320]   It was the ThinkPad X1 Fold.
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.760]   But I have to say, somebody who looked at a lot of folding screens, I mean, they could do this now
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.920]   because particularly OLED technology is flexible.
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.920]   And I saw a lot of companies that are wrapped around cylinders and stuff.
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:24.720]   But I don't know about you.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.760]   It's like a plastic substrate, right?
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.080]   Yeah, every time I saw these screens, there were crinkles,
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.120]   and creases, and bumps.
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.640]   Nothing was as good as a real flat glass screen.
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.840]   Yeah, I think that's for now, that's the best we're going to get.
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:41.360]   Even with the best, most advanced technology, it's still, you're still going to have those
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.800]   kind of crinkles and lines in the middle.
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.840]   But I think what we'll see for the next few years, at least with these photable phones that
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.600]   actually make it to market, is that people are just going to get used to it.
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:56.240]   And then there's going to be the innovation where they're making the screens that don't
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.520]   have those creases in them.
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.600]   And that's where things will get big again.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:04.640]   So for now, just the fact that it's a folding screen is the thing, even with the kind of
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.200]   folding spot in the middle.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:12.160]   What about the idea of a folding screen like Microsoft showed also a concept that won't
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.520]   be available until later this year?
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.280]   The duo where it has two screens with a hinge in the middle.
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.640]   Is that not as good?
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.840]   I don't think it's not as good.
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.440]   It's not as innovative.
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:29.600]   I think two separate screens on one phone, that could be what happens in the future,
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.360]   but that's not as innovative as the folding glass or the folding display,
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.600]   which I think is the cool new future of technology.
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:43.760]   So if it turns out that phones just have two separate screens, that's fine.
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:44.160]   It's fine.
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.280]   It's like having your remote screen or whatever.
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:51.760]   The innovation is in the screen itself being able to fold,
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:57.520]   which I don't think we're going to see a good quality version of in the next couple of years.
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.240]   I think that's a really interesting concept though.
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.440]   Even if you have a hinge in the middle, which will make it more durable,
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.280]   which will make it cheaper to make and more practical,
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.920]   the fact that Microsoft and Intel are doubling up and saying,
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.640]   "Well, we're creating a brand new version of Windows to support it."
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:16.080]   The number of times where I'm sort of in two tasks at the same time,
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:20.320]   where I'm watching a video, but I also need to keep an eye on where my Uber is,
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.360]   I'm writing notes on something, well, I'm writing about something,
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:27.680]   or even just I am reading a book and I want something to flow across two pages,
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:33.920]   or just the idea of we'll have one screen in laptop mode that works as a screen,
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:37.200]   another screen that works as an input device.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.800]   All of these and being able to switch between these modes really, really easily,
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.560]   I have to say I'm really fascinated by this and I can't wait to see the new hardware coming out
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.280]   later this year.
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.520]   I always see the folding screens and I just remember the saying that if you're one step ahead,
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.440]   you're a leader, if you're two steps ahead, you're a martyr.
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:55.520]   I feel like so far they've been good martyrs.
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.920]   That was kind of a Gruber's point was Apple does concepts, but they keep them inside.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.400]   I've been keeping them themselves until they're ready to ship them.
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.000]   For like a decade sometimes, they produce, they take things all the way to the end and then go,
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:06.240]   "Nope."
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:06.880]   Nope.
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.400]   And I actually respect that.
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:14.000]   It almost feels like, and I think this is Gruber's point that you're trying too hard
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.760]   when you do these concepts to say, "See, we can create, we have courage, we can invent."
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:21.920]   Oh, I do think that there's sometimes there is an opportunity to get people thinking about
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.600]   something, you're swapping around.
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.480]   You're swapping around for something that you want to do two or three years down the road
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.600]   and you're getting people to think about it.
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:31.680]   That's traditionally what CES was about is going here and talking to stakeholders.
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:32.640]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.040]   You're going to CES to say, "Would you buy this?"
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.120]   Not to consumers.
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.720]   Or developers, would you support this?
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.680]   Not to consumers, and it's not particularly for developers.
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.920]   It's sort of for the press, but really it's first dealers.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:48.560]   And it's buyers and saying, "Well, if we made this in December, would you buy it?
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:49.280]   Would you stock it?"
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:49.920]   Hey, best buy.
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:50.880]   How many of these would you take?
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:51.600]   Exactly.
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:51.600]   Yeah.
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.800]   So I understand that.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:58.240]   And that's one of the things as press that we need to remind people is that this is necessarily
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.360]   products you can buy or...
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.040]   Look how much coverage we got from this, wouldn't you?
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:01.760]   A lot of the students in your cell next year.
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.240]   Well, then there's that, and I think we're going to see more of that.
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:08.000]   And they do it at the PEPCOMS Digital Experiences, one of the very first events.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.840]   It's before the show floor is even over.
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.120]   They're inviting people next year already.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:11.680]   Save the space.
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:12.160]   I know.
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.200]   And bother me.
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:18.160]   And companies spend at least $15,000 to be at these smaller events where there's lots of...
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.040]   So much nicer.
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.960]   Much nicer, much easier to cover.
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.000]   I love the VL.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.080]   And they know that CNN and the other mainstream media channel 8 will be there.
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:26.800]   And all the bloggers.
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.400]   And then say, "We were at CES.
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.760]   Here's what we saw and go home."
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:30.560]   Right.
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:35.040]   So, and I think they're even selling prime real estate near the front door because
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.880]   journalists, mainstream journalists are so lazy.
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.520]   They go in and say, "We got the shot."
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:40.560]   "We're near the food, Leo."
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.280]   "No, no, they're in such a hurry.
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:43.840]   They got the shot."
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.080]   They go home or go to a nice restaurant.
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:50.480]   So to the left of the door is a segue egg that you roll around in.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:51.280]   Right.
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:55.440]   And the right of the door is the Charmin Rollbot.
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:58.480]   Which is not even a concept.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.280]   They're not...
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.280]   I talked to the kid who made it.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.600]   I talked to the kid who made it and said, "Oh yeah, this isn't a product.
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.640]   We just thought it'd be fun."
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:08.160]   It's got the Charmin Bear on it and holds a toilet paper roll.
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:12.480]   And the concept is you're sitting on the can and you call toilet paper, you go, "Hey,
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:13.200]   they don't mention it.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.240]   How does it get in the door?
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.440]   How does it get the roll on it?"
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.320]   They don't none of that.
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.400]   Because it is in a product.
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.080]   The whole purpose of this.
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:24.800]   And I think you're to see more of this is when the cameraman comes in the front door,
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.240]   they shoot that, Charmin gets a free ad, and then they go home.
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:28.880]   Hey, we saw...
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.400]   Hey, we tried this thing and see, yes.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.800]   It was a toilet paper roll delivery box.
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.120]   More people discussed Charmin in the last week.
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.120]   My point exactly.
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.320]   Then it works.
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.880]   Whoever thought that that was a good idea, they're brilliant.
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:41.280]   Brilliant.
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.800]   No, no, that's always it.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.160]   And that's one of the things that worries me about modern coverage,
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:51.680]   especially now that you've got so many really, really good people with such entertaining YouTube
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:52.400]   channels.
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.640]   It's like, I feel as though sometimes...
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:59.440]   No, because I want to make sure that I'm not putting YouTube people down.
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.520]   No, I think the YouTubers are smarter than the local news.
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.520]   These guys, Charmin doesn't care about YouTubers, they're going after channel eight.
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:10.160]   They want channel eight to roaden that on tonight's news.
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.440]   You'll never believe what we saw at CES, because it's a Charmin ad.
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.400]   They don't care about YouTube.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.440]   But a lot of times...
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.280]   I think the YouTubers are smarter.
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:19.920]   Don't volunteer to do the devil's work.
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:20.800]   So when I see...
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:25.600]   I was tweeting about that, since we mentioned it, the rolling egg,
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.720]   it's like, I'm not going to mention what it is, because that's...
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.560]   The reason why they built this was just to say,
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:34.000]   "Hey, here's something that demos incredibly well on video.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.120]   So we're going to build this one off and we're definitely not going to build it."
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.840]   You feel like, I don't want to do the devil's work by promoting...
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:43.760]   Helping promote a brand that had no intention of actually making something cool.
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.920]   Yeah, let me be clear. I'm not criticizing Charmin.
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.520]   That's good marketing.
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:51.760]   I'll go to guys in this stupid gullible press that falls for that and says,
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:52.880]   "Oh, here's the big story."
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.120]   Because it was the first thing they saw when they came in the door.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.240]   But I think a lot of times...
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.760]   Can we get Kathy Leader right in this?
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:58.240]   Is that okay?
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:58.880]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.320]   Let Kathy Leader right in this.
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.840]   We'll bring you a lot of times.
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.560]   You can imagine something before it actually happens.
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.560]   For instance, when the iPhone video...
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.480]   The first iPhone GS or whatever...
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.960]   The first one with a video, right?
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.160]   It was like the second iPhone.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:12.800]   3GS.
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:13.920]   Yeah, 3GS.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.920]   When it came out, I literally bought it.
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:20.800]   I ran over to the office and I cobbled together a bunch of hardware around it
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.640]   and talked about how you could have it on a shoulder mount.
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.240]   You have a mic and a light and a thing.
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:29.840]   I just put it all together and I threw it up an hour after I bought the phone.
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:30.320]   Got it.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:31.440]   8 million hits probably.
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.000]   It did.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.320]   Well, this is before YouTube.
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.200]   Or not before YouTube.
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:35.920]   I didn't post it on YouTube.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.840]   I put it on the website and wired picked it up.
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:38.240]   Yeah.
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.920]   And so it was like an almost thumped our server.
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:46.960]   Devorico says the best most hits he ever got for any YouTube video was his bathroom video.
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:51.600]   Literally he shot in his bathroom of Barney singing a song.
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.760]   A little Barney doll singing a song.
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:54.640]   Well, the most...
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.480]   It's because that gets hits, right?
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.720]   And like the most viewed Mac break video that we...
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:02.320]   Was the road to 1080p where I...
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.280]   Yeah, people were interested in how you...
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.080]   I just tried to do that.
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.520]   Well, we hadn't gotten one out yet.
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:06.400]   We couldn't get it out.
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.800]   So he's recorded something on QuickTime and put it out.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:09.680]   You know, and so you...
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.680]   So in contrast, this is model.
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:12.080]   But...
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:13.920]   And I will say this, 8K is not here yet.
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.600]   Although the Olympics will be shot in 8K.
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.240]   There are a lot more.
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.920]   8K cameras are coming.
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:23.440]   And 8K TVs, at least the micro LEDs, are barely able to make micro LED.
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:24.960]   But the concept is great because they're...
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:25.760]   And they're so expensive.
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.200]   They're selling little sub panels, right?
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:27.760]   Yeah, you can't buy like TV.
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:28.560]   Well, that's how they make them.
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:29.520]   They're all sub-pilled.
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:30.000]   Yeah, the canvas.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:30.240]   Yeah.
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:34.560]   Even the giant 292 inch screen is a bunch of tiles put together.
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:35.200]   That's the point of it.
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.320]   It's arbitrary size.
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:37.440]   But...
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.440]   Well, also they can't manufacture them without defects.
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.760]   And we switch right into fixed defects that are larger.
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:42.240]   That's right.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.560]   And it takes a very special installation process.
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.240]   So we have to align it perfectly.
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:49.440]   And even on many of them, I could see the seams in light content.
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.480]   That's always the same.
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:54.000]   Because modular LED is something that all of us have seen in events.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.120]   I mean, all those big LED walls behind the ones.
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:00.000]   The Apple TV is always modular LED.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.600]   But this is a much more...
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:05.360]   My point is, this is not a Charmin robot.
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.120]   This, in this case, this is something that is going to happen.
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:09.520]   I think...
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:11.600]   I mean, there's still questions whether they'll ever get the
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:13.600]   manufacture process reliable.
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.960]   But I think they will.
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.320]   And I think it's a future TV.
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.000]   I told Lisa we're standing in front of this.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.320]   I think 145 inch micro LED 8K TV.
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.400]   I'm saying, you know, it won't be next year.
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.120]   But in 10 years or five years, that will be our TV.
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:27.520]   That's...
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:32.640]   You're going to be in a room that the one wall is a beautiful 8K television.
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.320]   We're going to bring it to the belt.
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.120]   That's the belt.
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.840]   It's funny that you said that because that's exactly what I said.
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:41.840]   This reminds me of Ray Bradbury's short story of the belt.
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:42.880]   It very much was that.
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:44.160]   And it was kind of cool.
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.800]   In fact, they had a lot of African footage on it.
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:47.520]   I think they knew too.
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:48.320]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.160]   But bring it back to Apple, though.
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:55.120]   I really wish the Apple would show off that when the concept builds,
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.920]   they're okay for PR.
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.120]   But it really is good to see...
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:02.160]   Here we have wonderful designers and we have wonderful ideas
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.160]   about what the future could be like.
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:04.880]   Here is...
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:05.520]   Here is...
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:09.280]   If we are unfettered by commercial limitations
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:12.160]   and even the limitations of what the technology can do right now,
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.160]   what would we do for an Apple Watch now?
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.440]   Or even the idea of the Knowledge Navigator,
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:22.240]   which was utterly just fantasy in the 80s when Apple made that video.
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:29.120]   But then it really makes you think about how ubiquitous and helpful a technology can be.
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.720]   And then when Apple actually starts to make something not dissimilar to that,
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:33.920]   boy, do they look good.
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:38.160]   I think that part of the power of technology is to get people to imagine
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:41.120]   and to sort of think about a future that's even better than what we like now.
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:43.200]   I can think of two concepts that Apple did.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:46.080]   This was one the Knowledge Navigator under John Scully.
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:49.840]   And the other was the Apple Airpower Mat.
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.200]   Both of them ended badly.
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:54.640]   Well, it was a good video.
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:58.000]   Also, John Lee Gaseg gag at a keynote later on.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   Yeah, I just feel like it didn't help Apple in any particular way,
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.360]   because they never could make it, right?
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.760]   Well, hinge screen.
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:09.760]   And the thing is they never promised to make it.
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:15.040]   This is just it's okay to be fanciful and say that here's what if imagine 20 years ago,
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:18.000]   they were they're imagining, well, what if we have robotic or excuse me,
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.120]   electronic brain driven cars, what would what would we design for the cabin to be?
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:24.640]   That's not just communicating to people.
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:28.160]   The designers are wonderfully creative and artistic people.
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:32.800]   So they all have sketchbooks that are full of ideas of things that they would love to do
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.120]   someday, but they probably won't live long enough to do it.
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:38.880]   Just like when you I love I love subscribing to like my favorite
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:42.320]   comic book artists Instagrams, because their sketchbooks are just like,
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:47.520]   I just have this idea in my hand of a copy what a capybara would look like as a as a navy admiral.
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:51.040]   And so you see eight pages of sketches of this character that they're probably
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:55.680]   never going to do anything with, but it just shows you it's so entertaining and it's thought
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:59.760]   provoking. And at least let's it's the part of the expression of an artist to
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:02.560]   let their mind go to places that the marketplace will never go.
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.800]   There is an advantage. We saw them in the Samsung lawsuit though.
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:09.360]   Remember Andy? They had all the different items. The advantage to doing this is it does inspire
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:15.600]   designers and engineers with the possibilities. It took them 30 years to make something even
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.960]   vaguely like this, but at least somebody has in their head an idea.
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:23.520]   This was based a lot of this was based on Alan Kay's early work and you know,
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:28.960]   so okay that's that's fine. I just I'm glad apple doesn't fall into the trap
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:33.280]   of doing a lot of these because they could show off all sorts of stuff and it just
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.280]   muddies the water. It's not clear what we have.
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:39.200]   We have got stuff was done early like they have tons and tons of concept stuff all for
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:42.720]   different phases of car projects. Apple could have had a whole group of people have ever seen
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:48.560]   like a lot of car companies did at CES with pod self-driving pod vehicles for the city of the
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:53.760]   future. What what I do like that Apple's doing more of is that they are when they release a
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:57.200]   product they're doing things that get you thinking about what it's what it's capable of.
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.640]   So these like these little short films that they're doing with iPhones that yeah they might take
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:06.480]   a crew of 40 people and they might have cost a lot of money. But but you get like oh that's the
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:09.280]   you know you could actually have something interesting to watch that you're shooting with
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:15.760]   your iPhone. So regardless of how how big they went with it, it starts to show you that that's
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:19.920]   what's possible. It's not just that it can do do these things. It is a point that Steve Jobs had
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:25.600]   left Apple before the knowledge navigator video was produced. He wasn't an apple during airpower.
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:31.040]   I think the the knowledge navigator also was being as I remember was made for the TED conference
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:35.520]   which back when it was in Monterey Bay. And so it was it was really more about
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:42.560]   for a conference right than for the general. Do you remember that that that quote from Jobs that
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:47.520]   Gruber surfaced there too where he's he said he hated. He loved the best cars were the ones that
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:52.160]   they showed off as a concept. Those are the perfect cars don't change a thing but then they take them
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.680]   to the engineers. Engineers go no we can't build that and they make it less. They think of the
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:59.600]   manufacturers and they say no we can't even do that and they make it less. And he hated that. He
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:03.840]   wanted what you came up with as a concept to ship. So when he made he and Johnny I have worked on
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:08.000]   the original iMac they brought us that oh yeah that's a cute concept but we can't make that.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.160]   It's like no this is exactly what you're making. Of course on the other end of that you end up
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.560]   with with the keyboards that we had for a couple years. Yeah.
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:21.200]   We should have said no. No because of the concept butterflies. This by the way I want to show one
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:25.040]   more video because Bud Coligan wrote about the knowledge navigator video and he said there was
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:30.720]   another video we made in 88 that didn't get as much play. This is what will we do with computers
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:35.200]   in the future and they interviewed Ray Bradbury. There's where ever heard of very young we all
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:41.280]   went into fourth and taught. They showed a lot of ideas about how computers might look in the future.
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:49.200]   That actually. That looks about right. Yeah they're a little bit closer still ahead of what what
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:54.160]   we have now. That's all I have my hair. Remember this is 88. I know. When we still have an 88.
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:21:00.400]   I mean there's the knowledge navigator being used much like an iPad would be used. There's an iMac.
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:06.400]   This is 88. Remember. They didn't even have the little fondé blue iMacs by then.
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:11.840]   So the trails now constitute. That's Alan Kay. I think really Alan gets a lot of credit for
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:18.800]   a lot of thinking around this. So there's much. Isn't this much better than all those pieces from
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:23.600]   the 70s saying one day we'll even have computers in the kitchen that organize all of all of mom's
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:29.760]   recipes. If you want to be visionary be visionary just absolutely go for it. Look at this one this is
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:39.520]   a little later on. So if we had a machine that we could play games with and take these.
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:44.000]   That has them off. Who is that? That's that's right. Oh it's Ray Bradbury. Yes. Look at this.
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:51.040]   You can say the machine. Except the cons. So much. Show me all the coverage of the science fiction
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:56.480]   magazines. My father my grandfather wrote. These guys were doing great things. Speculating in 1988.
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:00.880]   Scientists are taking a while. By the time the internet comes along with an iPad or a laptop.
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:07.280]   It's not so far fast is it. That sort of machine I think would be absolutely incredible for a child.
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:11.680]   Don't know I differ directly manipulation. I'm just sad. Ray Bradbury never got to see the
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:18.480]   film in action. He knew exactly what was called. See that's that's that was part of his business
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:24.000]   plan. He was he was so prolific. He wrote so many different things every day. He's like I'm going to
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.320]   write a story about every single version of a computer that could possibly exist even like once
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:33.600]   you spray in the air like aerosol. And let me take a little and at some point I'll be right.
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:38.160]   Let me take a little break and when we come back we will talk about Apple's presence at CES because
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:41.920]   for the first time in 18 years they had an official presence there and I don't know how well it went
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:46.400]   but we'll talk about that in just a second. Our show today brought to you by IT Pro
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:52.000]   TV. You're watching this show. You watch our shows. I know you're a geek. I know you're an
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   enthusiast. You love technology. Have you ever thought about working in technology?
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:03.440]   There are more jobs in IT today than almost any other field. And if you can get the skills
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:08.480]   and the certs you need to get that first job. The sky is the limit kick off the year by accelerating
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:14.400]   your career. If you're already in IT getting your IT team certified. Yes they have great team
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:19.120]   training. And the best teachers they call them edutators. I know I think that's kind of unfair.
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:24.720]   They're all professionals. They all work in IT but they're also really good at explaining
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:32.240]   concepts at teaching. That's what IT Pro TV is so good at. It's actually enjoyable. It's fun.
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:36.560]   Plus you get practice tests. So if you're studying for certification you can take the test before
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:42.560]   you take the real test. They've got hands-on learning with their virtual machine labs. You can have
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:47.520]   multiple instances running of Windows Server and desktop clients but you can run it on anything.
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:52.640]   As long as you have an HTML5 browser you can set up your own Windows Server. You don't have to own one.
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:59.920]   It is great depending no matter what kind of IT you're interested in. Whether it's entry level
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:04.640]   you need those certs to get that first job. You're trying to become a Sisidman. If you want to do
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:11.600]   desktop support, cloud technology security. There are two different plans. Premium members can take
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:16.560]   advantage of one-on-one learning coach services. So you're not even on your own. You can get a
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:20.960]   one-to-one coach. We'll give you a little extra guidance. If you're interested in getting the
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:26.800]   CompTIA certs the A+ network plus or security plus you'll be glad that no IT Pro TV is the
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:31.680]   official video training partner for CompTIA. They've got 12 CompTIA on-demand courses.
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:37.040]   Standard membership is the video. Only premium membership includes the labs, the practice tests,
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:42.000]   and all the video. Thousands of hours of on-demand video and more being made every single day.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   They shoot live Monday through Friday, 9 at 5. You can watch live as well. Grow your career at IT Pro
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:58.160]   TV. It's ITPro.TV/MacBreak. ITPro.TV/MacBreak. And if you will use the code MacBreak30 that'll save
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:07.040]   you 30% off as long as you stay active forever. That's a great deal. ITPro.TV/MacBreak the offer
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:15.040]   code MacBreak30 for 30% off as long as you stay active. Look IT is fun. IT is interesting and
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:19.360]   there are great jobs, high paying jobs all over the country, all over the world.
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:25.840]   ITPro.TV/MacBreak is the Africa MacBreak30. I talked to people
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:34.320]   watch our shows who have got jobs in the Middle East, in Africa, in Japan, in China, all because
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:42.400]   they know IT and they're as a huge demand for IT professionals. Do it. ITPro.TV/MacBreak. Do it.
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:50.240]   Do it. So Jane Horvath, who's Apple's chief privacy officer, led a panel. I did not make it to this.
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:58.320]   Looks like not many people did. It looks kind of a small room here. It was a panel on Tuesday
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:05.440]   to debate the state of consumer privacy. She talked a little bit about encryption. Now it turned
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:13.840]   out her timing was good because yesterday the US Department of Justice and William Barr and
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:20.640]   the FBI said, "Apple, you've got to help us unencrypt this phone used by a terrorist in the
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:28.800]   Pensacola Naval Base shootings." And Apple said, "We can't. We won't, but we also can't. The debate is
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:34.400]   once again, just like it was after San Bernardino raised about what the FBI should get access to."
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:39.760]   She said, "Our phones are relatively small. They get lost and stolen. If we're going to be able to
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:44.480]   rely on our health data and finance data on our devices, we need to make sure if you misplace that
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:53.920]   device, you're not losing your data. That's why we encrypt. Building back doors into encryption,
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:27:00.480]   she said, "Is not the way we're going to solve those issues." Apple does privacy by design,
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:05.120]   differential privacy user randomization on device facial recognition stays on the phone.
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:13.120]   Data retrieval for Siri is minimized. She did say that Apple scans for child sexual abuse content
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:19.040]   uploaded to iCloud. She wasn't very specific, but Apple later released, I found out this morning,
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:22.640]   a press release saying, "They're doing, I think essentially the same thing,
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:27.120]   Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon do. They're using hashes of known child pornography,
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:32.880]   seeing if those hashes match hashes of images on iCloud. That doesn't mean they're looking at
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:37.200]   your images. They're just making hashes and comparing them. Imagine if they match at that
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:45.520]   point they look at them." That is as minimal of an intrusion as possible. She wasn't clear about
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:49.920]   that. I think that's concerned people when they said, "Yeah, oh yeah, we're looking for child
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:54.640]   sexual abuse." It made me wonder, "What other illegal stuff are you looking for? Are you checking
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:58.720]   to see if I have pirated movies in there? Are you checking to see if I've got any pictures of me
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:03.920]   with a bong?" So it can sell you bong-related accessories and products.
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:08.560]   Yeah, that's right. But if they're just doing hashes, that's something a lot of people do.
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:14.320]   What about this debate? We talked a little bit about today on iOS today. I did with
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:18.880]   Mike. Steve Gibson has talked about it before. Steve believes it's possible for Apple to have
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:25.920]   keep an escrow, a backdoor key that it uses only when presented with a lawful warrant
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:31.280]   and by doing so they can keep it out of the hands of bad guys. I'm not sure I agree with that.
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:35.280]   What do you guys think? I think you get into a situation where the people who worked on it
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:41.680]   eventually aren't working at Apple. Well, it's a technological... I'll give you half the key.
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:47.280]   I'll keep half the key. We'll keep a third. Once you... What we found is that we can't keep things
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:51.440]   secure. We can't keep things secret. If you have people start to work on it,
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:55.040]   eventually it starts to unravel. So you should have a company...
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:59.120]   Well, if China comes to you and says, "Oh, I know you can decrypt the phone. I would like
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:03.600]   the contents of every weager's iPhone right now." Exactly. Well, once you open this,
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:09.520]   all the countries are going to want it. The United States may only use a warrant to get this,
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:13.680]   and it may only happen five times a year. But China will do it all the time. Egypt will do it
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:16.960]   all the time. Saudi Arabia will do it all the time. Because once it's opened up,
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:21.840]   we look at it, Apple follows the line of what it's... Why doesn't Bill Barr get this?
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:28.240]   Because he's an idiot. No, he's not an idiot. And it's not just him. It's also the
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:34.560]   GCH Q and Britain. It's also Australia. I mean, there are a lot of governments saying we want.
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:40.240]   It's Russia, Russia, it's illegal. It's New Zealand and Australia, which are both part of...
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:45.600]   The Five Eyes. Of the Five Eyes. They are... That's the soft point in the wall. So the reason...
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:50.240]   What's happening in Australia and New Zealand is coming out of the United States. Let's just be
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:55.840]   clear of that. We're manipulating that process. And those legislatures in Australia and New
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:30:01.440]   Zealand are being manipulated by our intelligence, because our intelligence wants in to those things.
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:04.480]   And the easiest place to go is somewhere where people aren't as worried about it. And
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:08.720]   aren't as... Don't have the same concerns that we have. And maybe trust government a little bit more.
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:14.080]   Government more, which they shouldn't. And so the thing is, is that they... So I think that the
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:21.040]   problem is, is that they... Again, they want to have absolute access to all of our information
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:24.880]   at any point in time. I mean, that's what every government agency wants, because their job is
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:31.760]   to keep us safe. And they just want to be safe. And the bottom line is, is a guy at Bill Barr's
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:35.280]   age isn't going to really understand what the issues are. He probably barely knows how to use
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:40.080]   email. So the thing is, I'm not kidding. I mean, I work with some of these guys. I mean, they don't
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:46.560]   really do that. And so, you know, the understanding all the nuances of what this looks like is outside
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:54.480]   of their historical capacity. And so should we worry though, that he will convince Congress and
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:58.080]   the Congress will act and that this will become a law? I think they're going to have a hard time
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:01.920]   in the current Supreme Court structure to doing that. It's one of the advantages of the direction
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:06.400]   the Supreme Court, regardless of what you feel like the rest of it, the one of the things is,
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:09.440]   this Supreme Court is probably not going to allow that to go. They're conservative enough
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:13.440]   to knock it all out. They're probably... It would be... It would all come down to Roberts,
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:17.280]   and I don't think Roberts would allow this to go through. So I think that they're... And I think
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:21.920]   that the reason that we haven't gotten to a point where the FBI is willing to take it to court is
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:26.720]   because I think they know what I just said, which is if they take it to court and they lose,
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:31.040]   they lose it forever. You know, like they lose it until the Supreme Court changes. And what they're
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:36.960]   trying to do is apply public pressure on Apple to do this because they have lots of cases that
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:40.800]   they're doing this with. And Renee's got a great video that he did yesterday. Yesterday.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:45.200]   Yeah. Yesterday, yeah. So that you should watch if you're interested in this. Is this Victor Renee?
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:51.280]   Yeah. Yeah. And it's great, great video. And the thing is, is that they have lots and lots of
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:55.760]   these cases. They're using the ones that pull at our heartstrings so that they can try to get
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:32:01.280]   public support for it because they can't get legal support for it. You know, after SOPA and all
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:05.680]   these other, you know, I don't think Congress really wants to deal with it. They don't want to
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:08.400]   deal with it in an election year. You know, like they're not going to, you know, they're not going
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:14.160]   to know it. No one in Congress wants to touch this issue in an election year. You know, and I think
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:17.760]   that they know that the courts aren't on their side. So the FBI is going to try to make Apple look
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:21.760]   bad. Renee, this is different from what they were asking though in the San Bernardino case.
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:28.320]   You covered that in a great case. It's different in language if not in in 10. Like so with the
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:33.200]   San Bernardino, so back up just a little bit, Apple's put out a statement. I put a copy of it up on
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:37.760]   Twitter. It's very long. It is incredibly precisely worded. And one of the things Apple does really
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:42.720]   well is they put it in very plain language. And they describe one of the things that Bill Barr said
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:48.480]   that made me doubt his credibility entirely was that Apple provided nothing substantial or substantive
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:53.760]   in terms of help for the FBI. And the problem is like you can get away with that in political
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:58.720]   discussions because people have a lot of feelings about politics. But technology isn't anywhere
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:03.440]   nearly as pliable. And Apple provided them with the iCloud backup, provided them with the metadata.
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:08.720]   All of the things that Apple typically does for every request. And there is a wealth of information.
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:13.360]   But what's interesting in Apple's disclosure was that the FBI, very similar to San Bernardino,
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:16.560]   waited a long time. I think they said they waited a month to ask them for one of the phones. Didn't
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:22.400]   even tell them there was a second phone at first. And they sort of botched the normal procedure
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:26.720]   along the way. One of the things that they seem to do, one of their recourses is when they
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:31.200]   botched the basic procedure of gathering evidence, they start to complain very publicly that Apple
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:34.960]   won't let them into the phone after like the San Bernardino, they actually changed the iCloud
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:39.280]   password and locked themselves out. And then complain bitterly about Apple not helping them
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:43.680]   for a month. So this. And they didn't find anything either in the San Bernardino one.
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:47.360]   Well, all right. So let me argue on the other side, just a little bit of devil's advocate.
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:51.920]   You can understand why the FBI would want to get what's on these phones. There might be
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:56.160]   information about how the guy was radicalized. There might be information about accomplices.
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.960]   There might be information. They said they want his WhatsApp and Telegram. I think they did.
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:03.520]   Whatever. There's information. It's completely conceivable on that phone that would help
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:10.800]   protect us from future attacks. So I mean, I think law enforcement, I'm not going to speak for
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:16.480]   William Barr, but I think law enforcement, the guys on the ground, have a very legitimate interest
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:22.320]   in protecting us and saying, look, there's information on this phone that would help make us safer.
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:31.840]   Why shouldn't we ask Apple for it? I think the problem is that the FBI and the government,
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:37.760]   they're asking the corporations or the companies that built these two to do the hacking,
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:43.280]   but they don't need them to do that to unlock one individual phone. There's lots of hackers
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:46.560]   out there that configure that kind of thing. That's what happens to San Bernardino, right?
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:54.320]   They went to sell it. So to ask a corporation to completely change what they do to protect
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:35:01.200]   all of our privacy in order to create one master key that unlocks all iPhones instead of just
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:07.440]   finding one person who can just hack it, I think that before there was such thing as
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:12.800]   smartphones, the FBI, they would go out and they would set up their little microphones and they
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:17.760]   would track people and they would track their pagers and things like that. There were ways that
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:23.920]   they were-- They still have that capability. So now, why are corporations like Apple having
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:27.440]   to shoulder the responsibility of hacking into these people's content instead of-- Well, what's
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:32.400]   changed? Well, what's changed? Apple has given us technologies that can be fully encrypted,
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:37.360]   and it's not just the iPhone, it's things like Signal or WhatsApp. And so law enforcement is saying,
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:41.760]   "But wait a minute, we used to be able to wiretap everything with a court order. Now,
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:46.560]   we're going--" They're using the phrase "going dark." We can't listen to everything and that makes us
[00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:51.520]   less safe. So they couldn't listen to everything before. They were getting-- Let's just say that
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:56.080]   they were getting about 2% of the communication before. Now they're getting about 90% of the
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:59.520]   conversation and what they want is that last 10. Yeah, that's what feels like when the creator
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:05.120]   PGP told me when I interviewed him on triangulation, he said, "They've got a wide screen 8K view of the
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:11.040]   world. There's just a few dark pixels." They don't want any dead pixels. It's stunning.
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:14.160]   Like, you know, what-- There's cameras everywhere. There's not much of the--
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:19.280]   There's not much of the-- The metadata. The metadata. So the metadata of knowing everybody that you
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:23.920]   talk to, everything-- What phones were near each other at the same time. You know, like, these are
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:28.480]   all things that they're able to grab onto right now, and they're able to get an enormous amount of
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:34.000]   data. And we as Americans make these choices all the time. We decided in New York that
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.640]   stop and frisk is not appropriate, even though it was very effective. If you want to drop crime
[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:45.200]   in New York, stop and frisk. But it stomped on people's personal rights. And it became a thing
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:50.240]   that we decided-- At least New Yorkers decided-- wasn't going to be appropriate. San Francisco decided
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:54.880]   that even though facial recognition will make us safer, we don't want to do it. And so people--
[00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:59.680]   You know, we're going to limit our safety based on our freedom. We make that calculation all the
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:06.000]   time. And what we do by opening this up in the United States is we put every dissident,
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:12.240]   every individual in every country at risk. Like, it's not just Americans. It puts the world at risk
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:16.320]   because as soon as they open this door, every country will require it. And Apple follows the
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:22.640]   laws of the local country. You know, so as soon as they break this down, it is-- The reason that I
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:27.840]   get upset about it is that it's one of the few things that I see as just an incredibly destructive.
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:31.200]   This is a-- You know, this is playing around with visual material.
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:38.160]   It also feels like it's futile because even if you could get Apple to do it, then a bad guy could
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:44.320]   use signal. There's well-known crypto out there, or they could roll their own that you just--
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:47.680]   You wouldn't be-- There will always be a way for bad guys to communicate privately.
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:51.120]   And the other issue that I think is really critical is that this is like the first step in
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:55.680]   what's happening in this huge digital transition. And we've talked about this before, but my phone
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:38:00.320]   has basically become my external cybernetics. It knows more about me than I can remember at this
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:05.760]   point. And I put everything in this little crypto brick because I assume a certain level of security.
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:10.640]   And this is just going to continue. It's-- People are going to have stuff stored in artificial limbs.
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:15.760]   They're going to have stuff stored in-- Like, even Elon Musk is making brain interactions.
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:19.840]   Stephen Hawking is what-- You're not getting-- Jeff Hawking. Working on demand, there's all these
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:25.760]   different interfaces. And once the cybernetics gets more and more internalized, the same laws and
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:30.160]   standards that we set now is going to govern that. And if the idea of a backdoor into your phone is
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:35.040]   scary, the idea of a backdoor into your brain interactions is going to be doubly scary.
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:39.600]   We don't just take every baby's DNA at birth for a reason. And we've got to just, as people,
[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:44.000]   decide what is inbound and what is out of bounds. And I don't think technology is going to get any
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.480]   less invasive. So we have to make sure that the legal rights we have for that technology become
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:51.920]   more and more protective. Here is Apple's, the last paragraph of Apple's statement.
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:56.800]   "We've always maintained there is no such thing as a backdoor just for the good guys.
[00:38:56.800 --> 00:39:01.360]   Backdoors can also be exploited by those who threaten our national security and the data
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:07.600]   security of our customers. Today, law enforcement has access to more data than ever before in history.
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:13.520]   So Americans do not have to choose between weakening encryption and solving investigations.
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:18.160]   We feel strongly that encryption is vital to protecting our country and our users' data.
[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:21.760]   You have to say right on. That's exactly the right. It's so well written.
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:26.400]   That's exactly the right statement. And I hope it resonates with members of Congress,
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:32.480]   other lawmakers. I think we've probably lost William Barr and the GCHQ, but I hope it resonates
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:38.800]   with others. And the other problem, of course, is the dissidents may not just be in China, Russia,
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:43.840]   and Turkey. They may also end up being in the United States. And we want to protect the right
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:49.520]   to political dissent everywhere. And the thing that's important is for us to be as citizens,
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:58.960]   this is a democracy still so far, that it's important for us to be ready that when we see
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:03.600]   someone actually getting close to the gate on this is that we all rise up and let them know it's
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:08.960]   not okay. I mean, this has killed other things. Most politicians are relatively on a short leash,
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:14.080]   and we can pull on that leash pretty hard as citizens. And this comes down to writing your
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:19.040]   congressman, marching, whatever. I mean, this is something that you need to pay attention to,
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:22.640]   because this is not something you know, it's not the issue is it's not that important to the
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:25.840]   most representatives. So if they get a lot of heat for it, they're just going to walk away.
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:31.440]   I'm also going to point out that government and law enforcement and the people lobbying for this
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:38.560]   will always use there's right now two things, two things, terrorism and child pornography. They
[00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:44.800]   will always use the most scary, the most, you know, strongest terms for illegality,
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:49.040]   because who would disagree? We've got to fight those things. But we would like waterboard people,
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:52.560]   we would do the most horrendous thing like they always say also, what if it was your family member
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:56.960]   and we were trying to say, I would do anything. I would do I would there would be no law. And
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:01.360]   that's why we need these protections in the law that says, well, this would only be used for child
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:07.440]   pornography and terrorism. It could be used for anything. And so while they're going to use that to
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:11.760]   kind of push these things through, it isn't really what it's about. We were promised we were promised
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:14.960]   when we gave our social security numbers when we when we created social security, we were
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:19.920]   promised edification. The one thing we're not going to do with it is is collect taxes. They don't even
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:23.840]   call it a social security number anymore. They call it your tax ID number. Like this is what happens,
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:27.680]   you know, like is it and we're all started off with it. We're not very consistent. We're not
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:32.480]   very consistent with what we label terrorism and it would be very and it can be very easily abused
[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:39.680]   in order to get into things that they want to get into. You guys are so good. I tried to argue
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:43.920]   the other side. I tried. You need to let's say that's your job. That's my job.
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:52.160]   Apple was also represented at CES by a thousand accessory manufacturers.
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:59.120]   You know, at one point, Mac world Expo just became the the iPhone accessory show.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.600]   CES is not that bad yet, but there were a lot tiny town. Yeah, tiny town. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:12.400]   CES has its equivalent, which is called the what is it, the Eureka Pavilion. It's like us.
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:16.160]   It's kind of fun. It's like, did you go down there in the sands basement, Laurie? It was kind of like
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:21.440]   a it's like a science fair. All sorts of just crazy. It was interesting. I talked to a,
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:26.560]   I talked to someone at Mophie years, a couple of years ago and asked why there's so much apple
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:30.240]   stuff. I mean, there's a lot of Android stuff as well, but there's so much apple devices.
[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:35.280]   And he said, well, number one is apple users buy more stuff. And number two, he said, it's one,
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:39.440]   it's one device. There's only a hand. It's easier to do because you guys, you have one thing that is
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:43.040]   half the market or a third of the market or whatever. And then everything else is all this just,
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:46.080]   you know, there's lots of little ones and it's just hard to develop products for them.
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:52.240]   Mophie, which is something I guess by zag now, did talk about making a air power device.
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:43:00.320]   Like, yeah, can I talk about this stuff a little bit? I actually got to review the maker, the
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:07.520]   the CEO of era, which is the company that's doing the free positional charging for no bad right now.
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:14.720]   This is really fascinating. This is just one company that's doing this. I think at the moment,
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:19.440]   they just happen to be the first company to have something available to market.
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:24.160]   Did he address why Apple didn't do air power and how they've solved those problems?
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:30.320]   Nope. We didn't, we didn't talk about air power because I think because they don't want to be
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:33.920]   compared to just, they don't want to throw that out there. Because for one thing, the particular
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:38.640]   one that they've got on the market, it doesn't charge an iPhone and that, you know, I mean,
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:41.680]   sorry, it doesn't charge an apple watch. And that's not.
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:44.400]   The watch is not straight. It has to its own little thing.
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:49.120]   Exactly. So they're trying to not throw out that sort of
[00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:55.200]   general, you know, it's not air power. And part of the reason is that from era's perspective,
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:44:01.360]   air power was this one pad that could charge three things. What they can do can charge
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:04.880]   five dozen things depending on on what you mean.
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:08.800]   I mean, I'm looking at a picture of this. This is by the way, it's a prototype.
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:10.160]   But how big is that?
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:14.560]   So that particular pad, this is based on what Nomad asked them to make,
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:18.000]   which charges three devices in a row. And that's only because of the size of it.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.600]   They can make it bigger.
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:21.440]   Yeah, they can make it as big as a table.
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:25.760]   So if you can kind of look at those different boards that are in there,
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:32.320]   what happens is like through this like matrix of, you know, charging coils that they've put
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:37.520]   together. And this isn't just cheat. This isn't cheat coils, one stacked on top of the other,
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:44.720]   like the Zen's Liberty. This is a system of charging coils that are all talking to each other
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:50.080]   using an algorithm so that when you place your phone down on anywhere on this tablet,
[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:54.000]   it's you don't have to find another hole for the cheat circle.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.520]   You put it anywhere and the matrix, like the algorithm, it will search for it and find it
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:00.320]   and connect to it.
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:02.880]   So it's almost like being forming cheap power.
[00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:05.040]   Sort of like that, right? Yeah.
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:09.120]   Yeah. So it'll like, it'll go to it and it'll charge on that.
[00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:13.120]   So it's a more like position-free version of charging.
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:16.960]   And after having that discussion with him and then hearing that Mophie is doing something similar,
[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:21.520]   which nobody was able to give me any solid information about who Mophie is working with.
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:26.640]   So I'm not sure who their company is that's helping them build their free positional charging.
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:32.480]   But it's fascinating. And this is, in my opinion, this is where we're going with charging right now.
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:39.680]   Wireless charging is, it's stagnating and it's trapped behind this sort of cheat certification.
[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:42.800]   And the cheat standard just needs to be, it needs to be updated.
[00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:46.400]   And these companies, it's not just one that thinks that they're going to rule the world.
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:49.520]   There are companies out there that are saying to the consortium, like,
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:51.920]   we've got some ideas. Let's update the standard.
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:56.720]   So that's going to change, I think probably within the year, maybe that there's going to be
[00:45:56.720 --> 00:46:03.280]   a new cheat standard that includes and incorporates multiple charging devices and not just single
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:08.480]   coils stacked on top of each other, but a way to sort of spread out that charging so that there's
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:11.200]   like multi positional charging in the world. So it's exciting.
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:14.400]   I did see a lot of furniture that, you know, IKEA has been selling this for a while,
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:18.240]   but I did see a lot of furniture that just said, oh, you just put your phone here and it'll charge.
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:22.400]   I would love that. That would be nice. Yeah. So is there something inherent to the
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:25.840]   cheat spec that makes this hard to do that they're going to have to modify the spec a little bit?
[00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:31.520]   Yeah, as the current standard allows for a single coil with a single processor chip
[00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:37.680]   attached to that single coil, which is why when you see those multi coil chargers like that,
[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:45.120]   not cheap. Well, they are cheap and they just use a single coil either stacked on top of each other
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:50.720]   or side by side. And so that's not really free positioning. It's just a bunch of them so that
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:57.600]   you're more likely to land on it. It's not free charging, which doesn't use a single coil method
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:01.520]   at all. It uses sort of like a matrix of coils that are all interacting with each other.
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:07.520]   We also saw a lot of car play head units from Alpine, a couple more from Pioneer
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:13.200]   for people who have older cars that don't support car play. I love car play. I want car play in every
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:18.560]   car I buy now. I want it embedded on the iPhones. You're not gonna have it. I can just use it anyway.
[00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:23.680]   Is there no like auto mode on a knife? There is no. No, it has do not disturb in car, but it
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:29.040]   turns off almost everything. I know they have an embedded car play way too many texts to people
[00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:34.080]   saying, "I'm driving. I am not accepting texts right now." I see that my thread.
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:37.280]   And Android Auto lets you use it off the phone. I wish Apple would just use car play.
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:40.160]   I know. I love that. It's pretty useful off the phone too.
[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:48.000]   I did get to drive in. I think what's going to be my next vehicle in the fall, the Mustang,
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:53.760]   Ford Mustang, Mach-E. I didn't drive it. I got to sit in it and talk to the actually
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:58.560]   Ford's head of global products, Darren Palmer, who is apparently a fan.
[00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:10.080]   Hi, Darren. And they have AirPlay and CarPlay, I'm saying Android Auto and CarPlay
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:16.720]   wireless, which is nice, and a Qi charger right below it. So you just take your phone,
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:22.400]   put it on the wireless charger, and it's automatically doing car play, which is to me the perfect solution.
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:27.360]   Yep. Yep, yep, yep. That's the only reason I'm buying that car, by the way.
[00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:34.320]   How much is it? How much is it? It's not that expensive. I'm getting the first edition,
[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:40.080]   which is 60,000 before the $7,500 federal tax rebate. There's a California tax rebate.
[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:43.280]   But they, I think they're going to start it. It's going away from us. Depends on the
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:46.320]   manufacturer. Tesla doesn't get it because they've sold, so you only get it for the first couple
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:53.680]   hundred thousand. So, and I think it goes down to 39,000. So nobody was allowed to get in this car,
[00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:58.080]   but Darren let us in. They had a big sign on it saying it's locked for your protection. And he
[00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:01.440]   said, when you get in, jump in really fast, and when you get out, jump out really fast, so nobody
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:06.000]   else thinks they can get in. But see where my phone is right there? You can kind of see it in
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.840]   this video right below. That's just the wireless charging thing, and the car play just connects
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:14.320]   up to it. I think that's exactly right. So great. He also did something interesting,
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:17.840]   or they also did something interesting, which is it watches the kinds of things.
[00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:21.680]   So instead of having, I guess it probably has a car play display, but instead of
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:30.160]   just that, it has this own Ford, you know, VIP futurist sync, and it will pick pieces of the
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:37.440]   puzzle out. So it depends like it has its own Spotify, but it also has Pandora. So depending on
[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:42.160]   what you use, like if you use ways, a lot ways will show up there. So depending on what you use,
[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:46.720]   you're going to get kind of a somewhat customized array of buttons for the things that you use the
[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:52.000]   most, which I think is smart. I'm sure you can, I sure Apple wouldn't let them not put the car
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.400]   play display up. So I'm sure that's all. So when does it go in single? This fall, he said he'd
[00:49:56.400 --> 00:50:03.040]   move me to the front of the line. I already put a deposit down like day one. So I'm sure I'm pretty
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:07.520]   close to the front anyway. You're already close enough. Yeah. He said, well, we'll look for your name.
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:12.640]   See if we can find you and move you up. You can be amongst the first people to wrap your
[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:15.920]   wrap a Mustang around a tree after like setting a card and coffee video.
[00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:21.200]   Something really dumb just occurred to me, but is charging universal like standardized away? Like
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:26.960]   I can take any card, any gas station. No, no, no, no, there's all the government is the standard wheel.
[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:30.400]   There's all sorts of stairs, but it's starting to change. That was one of the reasons I bought a
[00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:35.760]   Tesla's because Tesla had its own supercharger. Yeah, work, but those only work with Teslas.
[00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:43.600]   But there is a standard. Remember Audi's and Audi VW's diesel gate? Remember when they were cheating
[00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:49.600]   the emissions tests? They got caught. One part of their settlement was they had to spend more than
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:53.600]   a billion dollars to electrify. They fact the company's called Electrify America to build fast
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:58.000]   charger, a fast charger network all over the United States. And that's already being built.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:03.680]   That is what will end up being the standard. It's called CCS fast charging. That will end up.
[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:08.640]   There are others. There's Chatham. Oh, and there's a few others. In fact, the Nissan Leaf only does
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:13.120]   Chatham. The EU isn't mandating USB-C for cars. Yeah. Well, I think there is a, I think there's a,
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:16.240]   let's put this way. There's an emerging standard because everybody realizes, well, that's no good.
[00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:20.720]   You have to be like a gas station where you just pull up the energy. The Tesla comes with adapters
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:25.680]   and you can use adapters. But I think there will be a standard. I think Electrify America is going
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:29.920]   to power that Ford has a deal with Electrify America. So yes, that's something got to keep in
[00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:33.040]   mind, especially in the Great White Nolens. I hadn't even thought about it before.
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:38.160]   Yeah. Well, there's something called range anxiety, which is, you know, nobody, I mean,
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:41.840]   I guess when I was a kid, we always had gas anxiety because we couldn't afford to buy it.
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:51.120]   Full tank. I would always forget to fill it up. And so my gas anxiety was mostly that I was like,
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:54.960]   I had to coast down one hill to get enough speed to go up the next hill to get to the gas station.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:59.680]   But that's why I like my bug because it had that reserve tank. Remember, it didn't have a gas
[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:05.120]   gas gauge. So you just drove it to the right of the gas, then you flip that lever and you have
[00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:10.080]   another 10 miles or whatever you get to the gas station. Anyway, yeah, that's, that's, of course,
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:15.280]   one of many things that is making electrification challenging. But, and it's all still a small
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:21.760]   percentage of overall cars. But it's nice to see real car makers making not compliance cars,
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:25.280]   cars that just have to make to meet emission standards. But cars people really want to
[00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:29.920]   how to drive. And I think this was one of them. I was very pleased to see it. I'm, you know,
[00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:37.040]   what else? I think that's all about C. Yes. Was there anything else, Lori, that I didn't mention?
[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:47.200]   38 videos. Wow. You know, my goal was 40, but I thought we'll never get for robots. Robots.
[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:52.000]   That's one thing you didn't talk about. The weird robots. Did you see the Arnold Schwartz and
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:58.560]   Edgar? I didn't see it, but I read about it. I think we might have a video we can show you.
[00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:06.640]   Yeah. It was, I don't know how AI-y it was, but it was definitely a little, a little creepy. This is,
[00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:12.880]   this is our robot. We actually made a bunch of, put a bunch of robots into one segment.
[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:18.800]   There was the, there was the ping pong playing robot was back. The robotic dog was back, which
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:24.880]   was very scary. There were lots of these cute cuddly things. Yeah, so many.
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:28.960]   This was a, this was a robot that delivered dinner.
[00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:36.720]   I was excited about that. This was a fit, a pet fitness robot. Your cat chases it.
[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:42.000]   But let me get to the Arnold Schwartz and Edgar. He's in here, he's in here somewhere.
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:46.480]   Oh, that was a window, that was a window cleaning robot. There's the scary robot dogs.
[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:52.080]   Oh, yep. This is so weird looking. Oh, that rollover, sit up,
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:59.920]   come, come for me and bite my hand. Oh, our friend Michael Fisher keeps buying the social robots,
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:03.280]   and then they keep turning off the servers and he makes videos about them dying. It's all very
[00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:06.400]   sad. Oh, good. Turn on the sound. Oh, God.
[00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:14.960]   Let me go back a little bit here so you can hear him talk to you. It's, it was, I don't think they,
[00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:21.040]   I mean, it was a little Arnold Schwartz and Eggie. It looks like Arnold at 90 when he has a lot of
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:28.560]   plastic surgery to make himself a 50 again. Maybe self driving calls are about idea.
[00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:35.440]   Right. That's downright.
[00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:43.280]   I can perform customized tasks in hospitals, hotels, smart offices. There was a lot of this,
[00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:50.240]   and I don't know how intelligent or autonomous these things are, but there were a lot of them.
[00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:57.520]   This is, this is my hospitality robot. And of course, all I need is for my vacuum robot to bring
[00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:01.600]   the drinks and then my, I don't want anything else to go on. Last year, still very, very popular.
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:05.760]   Lots of people lined up to play pink ball. This is my new friend, Nico, right?
[00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:11.600]   This was creepy as hell. Russell said it was warm. He said he picked it up and it was warm and he
[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:18.080]   just couldn't get that out of his brain. It's 98.6 degrees. Probably just used this diaper.
[00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:21.280]   He's a change. You look over there or you just want to talk to me.
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:29.440]   It's actually doing face regulation. It's, it's reading all the information off of your
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:31.440]   cell phone. Just give him a minute. There we go.
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:37.280]   Said there's something available later this year. Yeah, later this year. We always say that.
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:42.080]   Do a dance, Nico. Watch your, it's going to dance in a robot. It doesn't stand up.
[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:44.480]   Outstanding youth. You're a better dancer than I am.
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:47.120]   This chair dancer. Thank you. Thank you.
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:47.920]   Thank you.
[00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:53.840]   I have robots, lots of them. Yeah, the art. Did you see anything other than those?
[00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:58.960]   Because it was mostly like hospitality robots. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't see. I think,
[00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:02.400]   I saw one that was, I think it was called Robo scene. It was very similar to the,
[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:07.680]   the one that does the Schwarzenegger one where it just, it creates like a mapping of your face
[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:14.240]   increases, grossly real looking body, like top, top part of the body. And then there's,
[00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:19.840]   there's like a big computer screen attached to it so that, you know, it can have that sort of AI
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:24.640]   interaction with you, but it uses like way too real of, you know, facial features and expressions.
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:32.880]   Apple has its own robots. There's Liam. And then there's Daisy.
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:35.040]   Yeah. Yep. And.
[00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:37.680]   They're terrifying. If you're an iPhone, you should be scared.
[00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:43.440]   You're feeling like if Daisy can get the job done, Apple wouldn't have to mine
[00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:47.280]   bauxite or any of these unpleasant materials, they could just,
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:52.480]   I think they should, they should have called a decade because it's, it's, it's jobs to retire
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:55.680]   other iPhones. Yes. Yes.
[00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:59.760]   He's kind of like, well, I phone mine will be recycled because they haven't done an
[00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:03.280]   iPhone out of recycled aluminum yet. So I wonder if the iPhone nine will be recycled.
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:05.840]   Finally, hashtag finally.
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:10.080]   A lot of it's aluminum, right? Recycle aluminum.
[00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:15.840]   Yeah. Yeah. Even the new, I think the 10.2 inch iPad, they said the Mac mini is 100% recycled,
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:19.520]   but none of the iPhones have been yet. So I'm wondering if they're going to use the, the,
[00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:23.760]   the, the, if there is a March event and if there is an iPhone nine there,
[00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:26.240]   I wonder if they're ready to announce a recycled iPhone yet.
[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:32.240]   Could be. Hey, speaking of new products from Apple, we've got a new version of the Mac Pro.
[00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:35.360]   We'll talk about that in just a second. Our sponsor.
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:37.440]   How many did you buy Leo? Tell me after it. Tell me after the,
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:42.800]   I can't afford that. Are you kidding me? And I don't know what I would do with it.
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:47.520]   I have a, I Mac Pro and I barely scratched the surface of what it's capable of.
[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:50.080]   The worst thing is that we were all talking about this and we're like, you know,
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:53.440]   for most people, you don't need it, but a bunch of our tech, no friends went and bought it.
[00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:55.600]   And now a month later, they're like, I'm not really using very good.
[00:57:55.600 --> 00:58:00.000]   Yeah. I mean, I fell for that with the I Mac Pro. It was what, what, $5,000 to start?
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:03.920]   I got a 10 core version. If I use one core, I feel happy.
[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:07.760]   Your last Mac Pro was a media server, right? Leo, so it's fine.
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:08.400]   Everything's fine.
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:14.160]   True. Yeah. I showed it. I brought to you by LastPass. You probably noticed the signage.
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:20.000]   We are in the new Twit LastPass studios. Thank you, LastPass. We actually have been fans of LastPass
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:25.520]   as long before they were sponsored since they started. I've been using LastPass for a decade now.
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:30.800]   I'm not alone. 17.8 million people use it. 61,000 businesses. LastPass,
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:35.840]   well, you know, I used to say it's a password vault, but it's so much more than that. It's really
[00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:42.320]   an award-winning security solution that helps you and businesses navigate online lives easily and
[00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:47.600]   securely. There's a free plan. You should just start with that just to see if, you know, how it works
[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:52.640]   and whether you like it. There's a premium plan for individuals, family plan. That's what we use at
[00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:59.760]   home. I can easily share passwords with Lisa. Also, my wife is my emergency access designee.
[00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:04.080]   That means if something should happen to me, she can get access to my vault. She doesn't have access
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:10.720]   until something happens to me, but that's kind of reassuring to know that, you know, your family
[00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:16.000]   can access your vault if something should go wrong. The business plan we use here at work is
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:23.440]   awesome too. There's Teams, Enterprise, MFA, or Identity. LastPass.com/twit has all the details,
[00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:27.760]   but let me give you in a nutshell what LastPass does. First of all, it generates strong passwords.
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:33.520]   The number one password problem, I think, is reusing passwords. Not merely weak passwords,
[00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:38.080]   but reused passwords. That's because there's so many breaches these days that, you know,
[00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:43.920]   your one of your logins and passwords is probably leaked out into the world. If you use that same
[00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:48.480]   password elsewhere, uh-oh, they're going to try every service to log in with that password. You
[00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:55.840]   should never reuse passwords. LastPass generates long, strong passwords that it keeps track of.
[00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:59.840]   So you never have to. In fact, they have a security challenge. You can run through. I do it every
[00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:03.840]   few months to see if there are any reused passwords or passwords that have been leaked in breaches
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:09.760]   so that you can ease it. It helps you do it easily. Change them. Sharing passwords is easy. We have
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:14.240]   folders for ops and for business office and different things. And they have access to the
[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:20.640]   information they need. LastPass, for business, also offers a very flexible password management,
[01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:25.680]   single sign-on and multi-factor authentication options, including things besides just, you know,
[01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:31.840]   that authenticator. I use a UBQ with my LastPass, which I love, but they'll also use IP address,
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:36.640]   geo location, a lot of other things to make sure you really are the person who should be able to
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:43.120]   access this resource. And it works everywhere you are on every device. Apple Watch, iPhone,
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:50.800]   iPad, Mac, Windows, Android. You could even, it's so secure, you can even store important
[01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:54.720]   documents. I keep my passport in it. When I travel, you know, it's nice to have a copy of your
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:58.240]   passport, but I'm not going to leave a Xerox in my luggage. I just have it on my LastPass.
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:04.160]   That's really handy. We also keep our corporate credit cards there, drivers license, anything,
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:09.200]   social security numbers that you need to store safely and securely. And it's never decrypted,
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:16.560]   except on device by you. No one can get access to my LastPass vault, except me. They now offer
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:22.800]   single sign-on passwordless login for employees at businesses. We love that feature. LastPass,
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:28.400]   I've never mentioned this before, but I want you to know, they use trusted world-class third-party
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:34.720]   security firms to conduct routine audits all the time to test the infrastructure, test the software,
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:41.600]   test the service so that you can be assured that it is absolutely secure. Their detailed
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:46.400]   review of controls and processes is the gold standard for confirming their security, their
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:53.040]   reliability. AES-256, they sync over TLS. I can do all the buzzwords. They really do some
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:02:00.720]   interesting things to prevent brute force like PBKDF2. I've learned all about this from Steve,
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:05.600]   who looked at the source code and said, "This is the right way to do it." We use LastPass Enterprise
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:10.960]   at Twit. I use LastPass at home. I highly recommend it. It is the most important thing you could do
[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:17.040]   to secure yourself. And it's easy. LastPass.com/twit. Find out how they can help you at home,
[01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:22.640]   the office. LastPass.com/twit. We're really pleased that we could partner with LastPass,
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:26.960]   because I feel like it's almost a public service to tell people about it and to get them using it.
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:30.000]   I'm on a mission I have been for years to get people to use LastPass.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:37.760]   So, Rackmount MacPro. Are you excited? Oh, yeah. The RackPro.
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:41.680]   Alex, I'm pretty sure you're the one that's going to be getting some of those, right?
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:47.120]   Eventually. 500 bucks more. I'm sorry for the summer. Yeah, but it just makes so much sense.
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:51.040]   There's so many places. You save the money on wheels. Yeah, exactly.
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:54.640]   Exactly. But you spend it on the wheels. The wheels are on the side now.
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:57.680]   I mean, the main thing is all of us wanted to be able to do this with, and some people actually
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:02.960]   did it with the old G's graders, where they'd cut the ears off and put them in. But they did
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:09.600]   have X-serve. They did have a Rackmount Macintosh for years. Yeah, but it wasn't nearly as
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:17.040]   accessible as this. And it wasn't like a real computer to this level. This is something that
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:23.520]   you can wire into a mainframe, but into a server room. You can put a bunch of these in a server
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:27.920]   room. And if you think about a lot of visual effects firms and a lot of graphics firms will
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:33.840]   have all the computers in a nice cool room somewhere else. And then they just pipe everything,
[01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:37.440]   and you just have a monitor and a keyboard and you're working. And so that's why these Rackmounts
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:41.520]   make a lot more sense. They have rails, so they slide right into that standard Rack.
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:46.880]   That's probably what you're paying extra. 3u5, 6u. I mean, I don't know for sure,
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:52.720]   but when I look at it from the, me just glancing at it, I would say either 6 or 8u.
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:56.640]   It's interesting that after killing the X-serve apples kind of acknowledging
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:04:02.400]   that there's a business here, that this is something I like at the switches on the side,
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:06.800]   I mean, it has handles, so you can pull it out. I think that I think Apple had this issue where
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:10.800]   there was going to be a big, there was already a large portion of the industry that left Apple
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:15.120]   because the old Mac Pro, the trash can. You can put the trash can in a rack. I guess people
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:21.120]   tried to rack it. They put three of them in a wine cellar. It was a little weird, and then
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:26.720]   it's hard to get to, and it wasn't really built for that configuration. And the issue is that Apple
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:30.720]   started losing a lot of people where people are going to premiere. They're going to other things.
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:37.440]   They're going to, because the Mac Pro, the trash can wasn't scalable, and it wasn't giving people
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:42.640]   what they needed to do really heavy work. And so the problem is that you start losing brain trust
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:46.560]   at that point. I don't know whether you make that much money on it, but you do start losing people
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:50.800]   who you don't want to necessarily lose as far as the ecosystem goes. So I think it's important that
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:59.040]   they built something that, and now it's almost infinitely scalable. So now you can put in as
[01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:03.120]   much as you want. If you're an R&D, I mean, there is definitely some number crunching that
[01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:07.360]   being able to put 1.5 terabytes of RAM into it is makes sense.
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:13.360]   And that'll be cheaper next year and the year after. A lot of people were upset with the initial
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:17.920]   starting price, but that's basically just the container unit you're buying. And then you can
[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:22.240]   upgrade and add new parts. Exactly. Like you said, modularly, for years and years to come. I saw a
[01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:26.800]   couple people who work with AKA, we're talking about it. And they bought about midline specs,
[01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:32.720]   but they imagine within two years what they have then will be now top line specs, but there'll be
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:37.040]   even more room to add more terabytes and more RAM and more stuff on top of it. So it's like a
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:43.680]   10 year investment for them just in the system. It's a five view unit. Oh, for example.
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:52.480]   So look at that, baby. Man, that's pretty. That's pretty, pretty, pretty. Up to one and a half
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:59.120]   terabyte of DDR4 ECC RAM. Of course, you could upgrade the RAM yourself because the user accessible
[01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:04.240]   dim slots. Yeah. Yeah. Graphics. Almost everything. Like people are putting the most remarkable,
[01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:07.760]   with at least testing the most remarkable things in there. For some way of interlac,
[01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:12.640]   if you had rack mounted interlanking, they rack mounted to make a render farm of some kind.
[01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:16.400]   Well, you'd have a control control unit that's sending those renders out. I mean, that's
[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:20.240]   typically what happens is you have a whole bunch of machines that are worried as a single unit.
[01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:23.840]   You could just say, Hey, it's, you know, yeah, it just machine one. You do that machine to you.
[01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:28.240]   Do that. Yeah, you break it up and it just depends on what calculation has to be done
[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:32.880]   to, you know, based on whether it can be done in parallel or in series.
[01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:38.880]   Well, if you're going to get a micro LED 8K TV, you're probably going to want to make sure
[01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:45.280]   your production company has a Mac Pro to feed it the 8K content. I have a feeling they're going
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:48.160]   to make about as many as they can. They're going to sell about as many as they can make for
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:51.280]   time. Well, they're timing is good because I think 8K is, I mean, people are looking at
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:56.480]   a take content production. Yeah. You need this. Isn't that the basketball players TV? That was
[01:06:56.480 --> 01:07:00.400]   the old joke. Yeah. Whatever the higher than TV is, it sells mostly to, yeah, it sells mostly to
[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:05.840]   sport to athletes. Yeah. I don't think it's athletes that are buying Mac Pros. Also, if you're
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:08.960]   thinking about VR, they could afford it, but they're not buying it. If you're thinking about VR,
[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:14.640]   VR is incredibly large files because we're oftentimes we're rendering everything you have to see all
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:19.520]   the way around. You were showing me that Angkor Wat, yeah, yeah, and that's temple and that took
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:25.360]   rent. That takes my little iMac. It took it, you know, half an hour to build the model, you know,
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:30.720]   and that's just one little piece. Right. Now, we saw what, what Justine's, she was building, she,
[01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:34.080]   she was talking about the back that I think on Twitter, I think when we were doing Twitter,
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:36.640]   she was having trouble figuring out what to like, what can you slam the
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:44.080]   how and I was like, I have something. How to peg it. Yeah. So, so we pegged it. And but even
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:49.200]   then she was still editing 8K on it while she was, you know, while it was doing all these calculations,
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:55.040]   but all 28 cores were fully utilized. A lot of head remains. I believe it's public knowledge now,
[01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:59.920]   but Dr. Wave is on the pro workflow team from Pixar, who's just the most amazing individual,
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:04.640]   really, really into AR and all these things. And he was showing Toy Story, I think it was
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:08.480]   Toy Story 4, whatever the latest one is. And he's like, this is, this is The Scene with Woody,
[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:11.680]   then you pull back and this is the room, and then you pull back and this is the fair,
[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:15.600]   and then you pull back and this is the world. And like, he's just throwing it around like,
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:19.600]   like in real time, like it's nobody's business. And he said, yep, it's all ported to AMD now and
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:23.760]   works great on the Mac Pro and just more polygons than I've ever seen on screen before.
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:30.720]   Yeah. I wonder if Apple's thought about, you know, AMD announced some really heavy-duty chips
[01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:37.600]   at CES, including a Threadripper with 64 cores for a mere $4,000. Nothing Intel could come even
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:42.640]   close to. I wonder if Apple has thought about putting a-- They're so customized for Intel.
[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:47.200]   Like one of those two things, one is that their stuff is very, like they work very closely with
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:51.360]   Intel. They do that with AMD for graphics chips, but like everything from PowerNAP to the way that
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:57.840]   they handle security, you know, from the T2 chip into the Intel structure. And also the single
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:02.080]   threaded stuff that Intel does for a lot of people is still a primary workload. They're not
[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:07.120]   not that many people are multi-core yet, so you'd have to divide. Oh no, but AMD's got better faster
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:11.840]   single-core processor as well. That's the point is that you're not giving up your single-core speed.
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:15.200]   I haven't heard that from the gamers. I've heard most people in multi-core people like the video
[01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:22.480]   workflows that AMD is way better than not for-- For the CP, maybe. The last few that I heard,
[01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:25.760]   it was mostly like for video professionals, like, you know, I would love it. Personally,
[01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:30.000]   I would be so into that so quickly. But I just heard from a lot of people who do it.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.840]   It was like, okay, okay, sit down creative. Here's what I do and why I'm just--
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:40.160]   So much of the calculations now are sitting on the GPU as well. So a lot of that-- or they can be
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:45.920]   interchangeable. So I think that in the grand scheme of things-- I wouldn't expect
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:51.520]   the difference between those two processors to-- I mean, I'm sure it's going to increase the speed,
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:55.120]   but I don't think it's going to be like double the speed of the machine because you put the faster
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:59.360]   processor. Because there's all the subsystems, there's the GPUs, and there's a lot of other things
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:04.800]   that can be added to-- So I'm thinking more of a 10 or 20%. I think for a long time,
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:11.600]   AMD single core was not as good. But I think that's part of the story of these new Ryzen
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:17.440]   chips is that their single core performance is also improving. And of course, certainly cost per
[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:24.720]   core is well below Intel's. And they're per watt because they're down to seven nanometers and Intel
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:30.000]   still hasn't gone down. And 10 nanometer for Intel is about the same as seven nanometer for
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.520]   Taiwan semiconductor. Those are marketing names now, not actual sizes anymore.
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:38.080]   So but they're still so far ahead that there's-- So how long do you have on so many levels?
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:42.480]   You couldn't use a 64-- wouldn't a 64 core processor be better for you? Oh yeah, I thought
[01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:48.240]   you know what I'm saying? But when I look at-- Oh, I thought you could. I could use all the
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:52.000]   process all the time. I mean, just because Apple has locked itself into Intel doesn't mean-- I mean,
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.240]   especially since they do work with AMD that they couldn't at some point. No, no, but I think that
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:59.840]   beyond the spec, I mean, it's easy to look at the spec, but it's also like, how does it handle heat?
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:03.120]   You know, how does it handle, you know, like, for instance-- I think it's like-- I don't know what
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:08.160]   the TPU is. I think it's like 750 watts or something. I mean, the thing is like--
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:12.160]   Well, but a little heat. But we don't know, like, what does it take to actually,
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:14.720]   you know, as far as that goes, do you have to liquid cool it to get the performance? You kind of
[01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:19.280]   think Apple's doing something in there. Well, I'm seeing a lot of enthusiast building thread
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:23.440]   ripper gaming machines and other kinds of stuff. Oh, I built-- I have a thread ripper in the PC
[01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:28.880]   that I have. Yeah. Do you like it? Oh yeah, it's great. It's fast. And it's-- but it's liquid
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:32.880]   cooled and it's got a lot of other things that are built to it so that it
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:38.480]   that I couldn't necessarily do in a Mac Pro to get the full performance out of that. And I think
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:43.280]   that the issue is that there's a lot of other things other than just specs that are going to
[01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:47.600]   make a difference. For instance, a good example of my little iMac, if I put that project that I
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:52.080]   gave Justine, if I put that project into it, it'll run for two days and then the iMac will restart.
[01:11:52.080 --> 01:12:00.880]   It doesn't-- I kept on when I was going on trips, I'd put the project into it and then I'd go on
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:04.720]   the trip and I'd come back and nothing would happen. And I don't understand. It was running when I left.
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:08.400]   And I realized that it was-- and I finally did this thing where it saves along the steps. And I
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:12.240]   finally figured out what was happening was, is it was just getting to one part and then just
[01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:17.600]   thumping the computer. Not even kind of like a little like it crashes the app. The computer just
[01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:22.800]   stopped working. And I finally believe that it's because I was getting into a outside the heat.
[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:27.760]   You know, so it turns out if you run the CPU for two days straight at its full maximum,
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:33.600]   it's more than it was. It'll gate, right? It'll gate. It could win the 24 hour of l'amons.
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:35.920]   If it wanted to. Yeah, yeah. It's--
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:40.640]   Leave some jiffy bump on the top. But if you see it's pop that you know that okay, if something
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:46.960]   must have happened. I stand corrected expert in our chair. It says the Threadripper 3990X is a
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:53.200]   240 watt-- A mirror. A mirror, 240 watt TDP. That's a lot of lot. That's a lot of lot.
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:55.040]   And of course, a lot of watts means a lot of heat.
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:13:00.080]   Right. And again, I think that there's a lot of calculations into what chip is getting used
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:03.840]   beyond how many cores and how many-- what the raw speed is. It's all kind of-- How does it
[01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:08.160]   affect the environment? How do you put it in? But there's also no meltdown, right? On AMD CPUs,
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:14.960]   what I can remember, which is nice. So many good aspects. Well, all right. So the question was,
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:21.440]   you think at any point Apple might go AMD. What about ARM on the mobile and AMD on the higher end?
[01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:25.360]   Yeah. I would-- I think-- I don't think-- No, I don't think Apple will go to it. I don't think
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:29.600]   that they care enough about that chipset to-- There's so much other stuff that's not--
[01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:35.440]   This is not a-- I don't think this is a hill they want to fight a battle on. And then I think that--
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:39.600]   So I think that A, it'll be Intel into the future because just because it's not something
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:44.480]   they want to shift. But I think that all our mobile platforms will end up in ARM. So I think
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:48.960]   that our-- or maybe our MacBook Pro, but everything below the MacBook Pro, I think is going to end
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:55.200]   up in ARM within the next five years. Well, that's when Pro, non-Pro, kind of makes it--
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:14:00.000]   a little more sense. We have a distinction with the Pro's or Intel's. The rest are ARM. It makes
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:05.600]   a little bit more sense. Apple put out a press release January 8th, a couple of days ago.
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:15.440]   It looked like an earnings announcement, but it wasn't. Apple rings in New Era of Services following
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:20.480]   landmark year. You guys want to explain to me what's going on? They do this every year, though. I mean,
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:24.160]   every year people spend more-- New Year's Day is a part that confuses me. Every year,
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:28.560]   Apple sets new records for App Store purchases on New Year's Day. Like, I could understand
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:32.400]   maybe Christmas, but the New Year's Day feels like Fourth of July to me. It's just that people
[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:36.240]   have had enough of the holidays and they don't want to talk to their families anymore. And it's a
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:40.720]   new year. They can start fresh by downloading all the apps and tuning. I don't get the New Year's
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:43.920]   part. Well, that's when the congratulations-- That's when the money-- That's when people go back to
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:47.600]   work is after New Year's. So Apple store customers, according to this press release,
[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:55.680]   spent $1.42 billion in the week between Christmas and New Year's Eve. That's a 16% increase over last
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:15:01.440]   year. For some reason on New Year's Day, they spent $386 million. Why you got some time? Are they
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:06.560]   hungover? And they need to get nothing else to do? That's a 20% increase. And that is a new single-day
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:12.480]   record. So apparently New Year's Day is when people spend the most money on the App Store. I could
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:16.640]   see the day after Christmas maybe, but why New Year's Day? You're all hanging out. Yeah, it's
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:23.200]   interesting. But it's a good story for Wall Street. If you look at their stock price lately,
[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:27.200]   which a lot of people have contributed to services, but I think Neil Seibart is correct when he says,
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:32.640]   it's a lot of people who suddenly felt under-possessed of Apple stock, rallying the price higher. But
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:37.680]   it is so much better and so much more an understandable story for Wall Street when Apple
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:42.080]   talks about services, or at least it's a story that Wall Street is comfortable hearing from Apple,
[01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:47.360]   as opposed to just hit products. What are those? 60 million songs on Apple Music. They didn't
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:52.800]   say anything about how many subscribers, but it's safe to say they're doing okay.
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:59.680]   Even Apple News was surprising me because Apple News to me is the worst of their services,
[01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:04.480]   because it's in so few countries and the interface for the app is just so much further behind
[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:08.720]   all the other services apps. It reminds me of Apple Music before that big
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:16.000]   possama reboot at WWDC. It's still there. They got 100 million
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:21.280]   monthly active users in the US, UK, Australia, and Canada. That is mind-boggling.
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:27.920]   It really does go to show you the marketing advantage of having a product or service
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:34.320]   that is owned and created by the same company that makes the phone. This is why, since time immemorial
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:39.680]   regulators have been worried about, "Well, I don't think you should be able to package the music
[01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:44.640]   service or the web browser or whatever it is that you create with the brand new phone that you also
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:48.800]   sell because if people already have a web browser or a music service, they're not going to go looking
[01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:54.880]   for other people's web browsers or news services." To put this in context, the magazine service Apple
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:17:03.680]   bought for nearly half a billion dollars. Texture never got more than 200,000 subscribers. From 200,000
[01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:09.120]   to 100 million. There's not a lot of competition for this specific slide.
[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:13.280]   Oh, okay. Thank you for clarifying. This is not people paying for the magazines.
[01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:18.240]   Total news product. Okay. Yeah. All right. That's a good thank you.
[01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:23.280]   Because I find, do you use news plus that much? No. I killed the subscription after I did the
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:27.920]   trial and Lisa yelled at me. So we now have it. I still have it, but I can't like search for a
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:32.160]   single article. Like, I know an article with this. I want to make it worse. They've made it worse.
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:37.360]   The one thing though is now I get access to Wall Street Journal because it's in
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:42.080]   Apple News Plus and I see the articles pop up and I can actually watch them.
[01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:44.320]   But the other thing is is that if I want to share Apple News--
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:45.360]   You can't share it.
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:47.200]   When you share it, it takes you back to Apple News.
[01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:48.560]   You're sharing a link to Apple News.
[01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:53.120]   And so now I have to go find the article on the web, copy it, put it in Twitter.
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:56.720]   You know, like it's like this little dance that I have to do because it doesn't make any
[01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:59.200]   sense to send them to people to Apple News. Yeah.
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:02.480]   So I have to share the actual link and then yeah.
[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:06.080]   Can you open in Safari? Can you at least do that?
[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:06.640]   No.
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:06.640]   Yes.
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:08.560]   You can open in Safari.
[01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:12.960]   It's too many extra steps though, which is I think Alex's complaint is that,
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:18.880]   if I just want to share an article that I read on Twitter or share the article on Twitter,
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:23.680]   I have to-- I'm reading the article. I have to hit the share sheet.
[01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:29.440]   Then I have to hit open in Safari. Then I go to Safari and then I click to copy that link.
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:31.520]   Then I go to Twitter to share it in Twitter.
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:34.080]   And that's just too many steps to sharing that article.
[01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:39.200]   You're less likely to share things that you've read through News Plus or the News app.
[01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:43.200]   And by contrast with Flipboard, you just hit share.
[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:43.760]   You get the link.
[01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:44.560]   That's how it should be.
[01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:45.200]   And you go.
[01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:47.600]   Here's a stat I liked.
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:50.000]   It was toward the end and I think not widely covered.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:53.920]   75% of iCloud users use two-factor authentication.
[01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:54.560]   Yeah.
[01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:56.000]   That is a huge number.
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:56.720]   Most people don't use it.
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:57.760]   I think it does it by default though.
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:18:58.080]   Yeah.
[01:18:58.080 --> 01:18:58.640]   I think that's why.
[01:18:58.640 --> 01:18:59.200]   I think that's why.
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:00.080]   Apple pushes you.
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:00.720]   But--
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:05.040]   There's also some things that you can't even access without it now.
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:13.040]   So even-- I think the 25% that are still using the other way to authenticate are just so behind.
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:16.000]   They just are-- they're still using phone that's really old or something.
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.160]   They're not even active.
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:21.840]   It's probably like-- it's probably like they use their iCloud once a month.
[01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:22.240]   Yeah.
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:22.640]   Right.
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:23.040]   Yeah.
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:25.360]   Did you guys phone Snoop in Vegas?
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:28.560]   Because one of the things I always love to do with CS was see what other people's phones
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:29.440]   were using.
[01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:31.920]   And not like some are the journalists, but just people in booths and things.
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:35.360]   And I would always see a surprising amount of really old iPhones when I did that.
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:35.760]   You know, I didn't--
[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:36.560]   That's true.
[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:37.120]   Did you--
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:40.800]   Actually, you know, I didn't really think much about it until you just said it.
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:48.960]   But people that are like in the sort of like in the industry that, you know, like PR people.
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:52.480]   That's what I noticed a lot of PR people are still using kind of old phones.
[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:54.000]   Like it was a kind of a surprise.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.120]   Like iPhone 6.
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:57.520]   They're like, oh, you're still on that phone, huh?
[01:19:57.520 --> 01:19:59.360]   That's because they're normal people.
[01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:00.080]   Yeah.
[01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:02.000]   And that's the thing.
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:06.480]   It's like we live in this like a world where we get every single brand new product.
[01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:10.160]   And so an iPhone 6, which isn't that old, seems really old to us.
[01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:13.520]   But you know, the average person doesn't need anything to write about.
[01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:15.120]   I think you could argue it's certainly true for me.
[01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:19.120]   The reason I got into this business is so that I would always have the latest device.
[01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:19.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:20.720]   devices.
[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:24.160]   I think I remember specifically about 40 years ago saying,
[01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:26.000]   I want to always have the latest technology.
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:26.880]   How can I do that?
[01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:27.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:29.040]   What could I pursue?
[01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:30.640]   And so you invented a whole industry, OK?
[01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:31.120]   Thank you.
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:32.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:33.120]   [SIGHS]
[01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:34.720]   Not that old.
[01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:35.840]   What about this rumor?
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:40.480]   Apple may add a promo to Catalina.
[01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:48.960]   This comes from the 10.15.3 beta that there is a little code promo on description.
[01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:51.280]   Apps may run faster, but battery life may decrease.
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:53.840]   And fan noise may increase.
[01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:58.640]   Fan speed limit overridden.
[01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:00.320]   Does that make sense of mode?
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:02.160]   It should just be normal for a laptop.
[01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:03.840]   That should just be normal when you're plugged in.
[01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:06.000]   And then I guess you make an option if you're not plugged in.
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:06.720]   I agree.
[01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:07.280]   Can't you--
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:08.640]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:10.560]   Otherwise known as ludicrous.
[01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:12.080]   Lutarchus speed.
[01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:13.600]   Lutarchus speed.
[01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:15.600]   Yeah.
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:20.960]   This is rumored to be coming only to the 16-inch MacBook Pro and the Mac Pro.
[01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:21.840]   Pro mode.
[01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:22.560]   I think a lot of us--
[01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:24.000]   The Mac Pro is plugged in.
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:24.640]   All of it.
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:26.080]   It should always be in Mac.
[01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:26.480]   Max.
[01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:27.680]   Like unless you really care about--
[01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:29.600]   like you have a silent fan mode instead of like a--
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:31.360]   just go on promo and if the fan--
[01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:31.840]   If you ate the fan--
[01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:32.640]   That's the other way.
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:33.280]   More than you ate your rent.
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:33.920]   It should always be.
[01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:34.160]   You're right.
[01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:36.160]   The default should be fans on high.
[01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:39.680]   But if you're in a sound studio or something, a recording studio,
[01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:42.320]   then you should have a mode that's whisper quiet.
[01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:42.800]   Yeah.
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:44.400]   Whisper mode.
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:46.640]   That would actually be more attractive, wouldn't it?
[01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:48.480]   Whisper mode.
[01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:49.520]   You're a P&L maker.
[01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:51.360]   We're going to talk about this on iOS today.
[01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:55.440]   Want to make all smartphones have the same charging port?
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:56.640]   Not lightning.
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:59.600]   Haven't we been talking about this for like 10 years?
[01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:01.120]   They've been working on the law for 10 years.
[01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:01.680]   Actually, yeah.
[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:02.480]   I'm going to just dongle at first.
[01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:03.280]   I want to-- yeah.
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:05.760]   I want to credit the European Union because originally it
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:08.400]   was micro USB, which admittedly is not the best standard.
[01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:09.760]   Well, yeah, that's the fear, right?
[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:11.440]   Is it they'll pick the worst port?
[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:12.880]   Well, the fact that they originally
[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:14.400]   want to do micro USB, imagine if they'd
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:16.320]   standardize a micro USB and then everybody come--
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:18.480]   you know, then there's USB-C and then--
[01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:19.200]   But everyone has--
[01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:20.960]   And you know, the minute they say USB-C,
[01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:23.120]   the consortium is going to announce micro USB-C.
[01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:24.400]   And we're just going to throw our arms up.
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:25.920]   Ah, at that point.
[01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:29.600]   Apple said this was a year ago, regulations
[01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:30.960]   that would force all smartphones
[01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:34.080]   that the same charging port would freeze innovation
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:35.760]   and be bad for the environment.
[01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:37.440]   I'm not sure what the logic is there.
[01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:40.240]   And unnecessarily disruptive for customers.
[01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:43.280]   But is it Apple actually moving to USB-C at some point?
[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:44.880]   I mean, they started doing it with the iPad.
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:45.440]   Or no ports.
[01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:46.880]   I mean, that's-- a lot of vendors are now
[01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:47.760]   going with no ports.
[01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:49.760]   I am not buying a no port phone.
[01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:51.360]   You see that now?
[01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:53.760]   Yeah, but here's what I mean by phone with that headphone jack.
[01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:53.760]   Yeah.
[01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:54.960]   So maybe--
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:57.760]   And the Galaxy S20 is going to have a headphone jack.
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:22:59.120]   I mean, welcome to the future.
[01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:01.200]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:03.360]   Well, welcome to capitulation.
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:04.240]   OK.
[01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:05.360]   Let's not say that--
[01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:06.800]   It's the Galaxy S20.
[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:09.200]   And it's from the future.
[01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:11.040]   I was resistant against this idea.
[01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:11.840]   But you know what?
[01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:15.360]   Now I realize that I'm so much happier now
[01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:17.200]   that I can't use most of my headphones.
[01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:19.200]   And I'm screwed today during my commute
[01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:21.440]   because I forgot to recharge my headphones.
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:23.920]   And unfortunately, it uses a different charge adapter
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:25.120]   than what the charge that I have.
[01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:26.880]   It's just for the environment.
[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:27.440]   Yeah.
[01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:29.040]   I'm sorry if I'm snippy.
[01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:31.120]   It doesn't-- every time I don't even complain,
[01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:32.880]   but just like, oh, isn't it funny?
[01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:35.200]   I happen to-- I happen to grab the wrong headphones.
[01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:37.360]   And now I have the lightning version,
[01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:39.760]   where I thought I was grabbing my USB-C version.
[01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:40.960]   It'll always be 100 people.
[01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:42.560]   I've done that with my MacBook.
[01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:44.000]   You've still used wired headphones.
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.080]   You wouldn't have this problem if you use Bluetooth.
[01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:47.360]   I'm like, yeah.
[01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:48.800]   Gosh, Bluetooth.
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:49.280]   What's it?
[01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:50.720]   Bluetooth, you say?
[01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:51.680]   Let me write that down.
[01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:52.400]   Wow.
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:53.360]   Thank you very much.
[01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:53.920]   I just--
[01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:55.840]   I think my big thing with European law
[01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:58.560]   is just that you don't have to fix everything with a law.
[01:23:58.560 --> 01:23:59.280]   That's a good point.
[01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:00.240]   Like, you just don't have to.
[01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:01.040]   Like, you just don't have to--
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:03.120]   But I want to give them credit because you don't--
[01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:04.560]   well, you probably remember it,
[01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:06.720]   but many people don't remember that for a long time,
[01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:08.560]   phones, each one had its own jack.
[01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:10.560]   I have a host of phones in my--
[01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:11.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:11.840]   -- Museum of America.
[01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:12.640]   I can't use your headphones.
[01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:13.280]   But that wasn't fixed for a long.
[01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:14.720]   I can't use any more.
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:15.840]   Well, I think it was.
[01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:17.760]   I think the EU's passed the law saying
[01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:19.280]   you have to have a standard phone jack.
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:22.000]   Remember, Apple used to have to ship the iPhone with a dongle
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.960]   to support USB, micro-USB.
[01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:26.720]   That changed the world.
[01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:28.560]   It used to be every phone had its own--
[01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:30.240]   like it was with computers.
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:32.160]   To some degree, it's technology that's changing
[01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:34.320]   because now the type C is so good.
[01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:36.080]   I think a lot of people are just choosing it.
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:37.520]   A lot of companies are choosing it.
[01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:38.800]   But so what about other devices?
[01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:40.720]   Because everything has a normal plug at the end.
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:42.480]   Like, because the wall outlets are the same.
[01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:43.760]   So you have to have that plug.
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:46.240]   But every computer I see has a different damn thing
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:47.520]   that you plug into the laptop
[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:48.000]   or something.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:48.880]   It's changing now.
[01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:50.400]   And I think it's going to USB-C.
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:53.440]   And I hope that happens because it's really--
[01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:57.840]   If it forces everybody to use USB-A on every phone,
[01:24:57.840 --> 01:24:59.360]   that would be bad.
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:03.280]   But if it does say that, OK, if you really are all
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:06.160]   that gung-ho and you think that it's so important,
[01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:10.080]   do not have a headphone jack or do not have some sort
[01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:12.000]   of a standardized port, that's fine.
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:15.080]   But now you're going to have to pack in an analog headphone
[01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:15.520]   adapter.
[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:17.360]   Or you can still have lightning, but you're
[01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:19.720]   going to have to pack in a USB-C.
[01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:24.000]   Because we basically have said this is the one type
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:25.120]   that you have to use everywhere.
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:26.120]   Yeah, they stand on the inside.
[01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:27.440]   It's not to give power plugs.
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:28.360]   I'm sure that's--
[01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:29.120]   No, we haven't.
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:29.920]   They're not the other end.
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:30.920]   They have it, have it.
[01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:32.960]   In Europe, it's a disaster.
[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:35.560]   I think Europe should tackle power plugs
[01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:37.960]   before they tackle phone plugs.
[01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:39.880]   Because every computer is different.
[01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:41.240]   Oh my gosh.
[01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:44.240]   I have a box full of all these adapters.
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:46.640]   This one is for Italy, and this one is for Germany.
[01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:48.360]   And the side of the road that you drive on,
[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:50.720]   can we just stick to a pick one?
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:52.520]   Those things have way more impact on our life
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:53.680]   than what phone would love.
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:55.520]   The width of train tracks.
[01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:59.720]   I mean, we're not going to invade each other by train anymore.
[01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:01.400]   Is that why they're different?
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:02.240]   So you can't invade.
[01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:03.040]   That was one of the things.
[01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:07.360]   Yeah, so we'd be harder to ship troops by train across them.
[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:08.680]   Yeah, humans are remarkable.
[01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:10.320]   I'll tell you who's unhappy right now.
[01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:14.200]   The location-based ad market.
[01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:16.760]   What happened to a nicer bunch of people?
[01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:18.760]   What they're pissed off about is iOS 13.
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:19.720]   Because you know, you get those.
[01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:20.880]   I think it's the best thing ever.
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:23.680]   They tell you, hey, you know, this Google app
[01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:25.080]   has been monitoring your location.
[01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:26.080]   Look at all the places it's just--
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:26.720]   It's by shaming.
[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:27.720]   Yeah.
[01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:33.000]   And apparently, seven in 10 iOS 13 location signals
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.560]   analyzed by location verification, business location,
[01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:40.120]   sciences downloaded iOS 13 and six weeks after first
[01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:40.920]   became available.
[01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:46.200]   80% of those users stopped all background tracking.
[01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:48.400]   Because when you get that pop-up, always allow--
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:49.280]   You're like 20,000.
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:50.600]   Remember the Bluetooth one too?
[01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:53.000]   Like all those apps were suddenly asking for Bluetooth access,
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.280]   and they had no business.
[01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:54.760]   Yeah.
[01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:57.080]   Because they wanted to get you at every single one of the beacons.
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:26:58.920]   People opting in to share data with apps
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:01.800]   when they're not used off of below 50%.
[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:06.600]   But three years ago, almost 100% said, yeah, go ahead.
[01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:11.360]   That it is incumbent on the folks that are tracking our data
[01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:13.960]   to give us back something that is worth more than our data
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:14.800]   to us.
[01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:15.760]   And they're not doing that.
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:17.560]   They're just like, I just want to quietly take the data.
[01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:20.000]   Well, if I get a coupon for 50% off the Domino's Pizza,
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.720]   I'm driving by right now.
[01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:24.080]   But that hasn't happened, really.
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:24.920]   I mean, you know, like--
[01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:26.800]   And the thing is, is that-- and 50%--
[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:27.920]   You know that it's 50%.
[01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:30.080]   What do they want the location for summaries?
[01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:31.040]   You'll see 50%.
[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:33.360]   You'll go, oh, that'd be great, except that it's 50%
[01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:35.040]   off the second Domino's Pizza.
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:36.760]   You have to buy the large one with it.
[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:39.000]   So you're way into it, and it's not going to be worth it.
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:40.000]   That's how these guys work.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.920]   And so the thing is, is that there are lots of things
[01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:45.080]   that I think people are going to get excited about around
[01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:49.720]   location, which is that there are--
[01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:51.560]   If you gave people great location data,
[01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:52.840]   they would give you the location back.
[01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:54.560]   So if you go into the Domino--
[01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:56.080]   Well, I leave locations on my maps,
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:59.440]   because I like that Google will give me a track of all
[01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:00.880]   the places I've visited.
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:01.640]   I don't mind that.
[01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:02.400]   These aren't Google.
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:05.160]   It's like the big argument against data harvesters
[01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:07.160]   and surveillance capitalists was that, oh, they're
[01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:07.960]   selling your data.
[01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:09.760]   And then we got this big pushback saying, no,
[01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:11.440]   data is way too valuable to sell.
[01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:13.440]   And that's still true as far as I know with Google.
[01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:15.280]   But Facebook proved with Cambridge Analytica
[01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:16.880]   that there are things that they will sell your data
[01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:18.280]   in a heartbeat to get.
[01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:19.800]   And I think all the smaller companies, too,
[01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:22.240]   we have just absolutely no transparency or insight
[01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:24.280]   into what they're doing and brokering and selling
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:25.680]   in terms of our data.
[01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:28.520]   And all of these things are just additional points
[01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:32.120]   that they can put together to make these vast social graphs of who
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:34.360]   we are and what we buy and where we go.
[01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:37.920]   And it's like we were talking about with the FBI stuff.
[01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:40.120]   The amount of data that they have on us now is just--
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:43.040]   it's stupefying if you could ever just sit back and see
[01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:43.920]   that map.
[01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:47.840]   The Norwegian Consumer Council is now
[01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:51.440]   filing former complaints against Grindr.
[01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:57.560]   Twitter's MoPUB AT&T's AppNexus OpenX Ad Coli and Smato.
[01:28:57.560 --> 01:29:00.040]   They're being filed with the Norwegian Data Protection
[01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:04.280]   Authority for breaches of GDPR because they've found
[01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:08.560]   that essentially the advertising industry is systematically
[01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:11.760]   breaking the GDPR privacy laws.
[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:14.360]   Every time we use apps, hundreds of shadowy entities
[01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:17.160]   are receiving personal data about our interest, habits,
[01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:20.320]   and behavior according to the Norwegian Consumer Council.
[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:22.640]   The carriers were selling it to bounty hunters.
[01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:25.280]   And they were ordered to stop and they still kept doing it.
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:28.720]   And with GDPR and now the new California Consumer Privacy
[01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:32.760]   Act, I have a feeling we're going to start
[01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:34.000]   to see some lawsuits.
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.920]   The advantage that Apple has over everyone else
[01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:38.480]   is that they don't depend on advertising.
[01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:41.160]   And so what they're doing is they can keep on closing these gaps
[01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:43.200]   down and it doesn't affect them.
[01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:45.240]   You know, like, I can just turn this down
[01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:47.000]   and they're not getting any rain.
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000]   So I think that if you don't like ads--
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:53.320]   and from people I've talked to in the ad agency, ad world,
[01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:55.200]   the walls are closing in.
[01:29:55.200 --> 01:29:56.640]   That's their problem is that they're
[01:29:56.640 --> 01:29:58.720]   desperate to find new ways of going to the gas.
[01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:01.080]   Good, because I feel like they're closing in the walls
[01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:02.520]   on podcasting in the house.
[01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:06.240]   Because we don't track and they would really like us to track.
[01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:07.280]   And then there's a lot of--
[01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:08.520]   I agree with you doing injection now, right?
[01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:11.240]   Spotify's going to track you on their exclusive--
[01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:14.520]   if you listen to podcasts exclusive from Spotify,
[01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:16.920]   they're going to send those advertisers all the information
[01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:18.760]   they want because you're using their app.
[01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:21.200]   And do like a garment tweet about it.
[01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:23.240]   And he said, that's why you need to support
[01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:27.720]   overcasts and other open podcast platforms who refuse to track you.
[01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:29.200]   And I agree 100%.
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:30.640]   On the other hand, it's getting harder and harder
[01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:33.840]   to sell advertising to companies who say, well, wait a minute.
[01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:36.160]   I want to make sure that that advertising is reaching
[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:37.560]   this demographic group.
[01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:38.160]   But different--
[01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:38.960]   like, we can't say that.
[01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:43.160]   It's so interesting because the more and more data
[01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:45.360]   they want, the less and less valuable the ads get.
[01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:48.200]   And it seems like they're missing the correlation there.
[01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:50.640]   Back in the days of broadcast television or magazines,
[01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:52.080]   they had no idea really how many people--
[01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:53.640]   how many people they can get in.
[01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:54.680]   They want it because Facebook--
[01:30:54.680 --> 01:30:55.180]   Exactly.
[01:30:55.180 --> 01:30:55.840]   --goo-oo gives it to them.
[01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:57.920]   And so they say, well, we get it from Facebook.
[01:30:57.920 --> 01:30:58.920]   Why don't we get it from you?
[01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:00.760]   Not that they really need it.
[01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:02.080]   But look at just Squarespace.
[01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:04.080]   I mean, the old brand awareness still works.
[01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:05.360]   Like, if you think of a website, you
[01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:06.880]   think of the last company that you heard
[01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:10.000]   or WordPress or all these companies that invest in brand advertising,
[01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.920]   it is still incredibly effective.
[01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:13.600]   And as far as I know, it converts really well.
[01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:15.600]   You're preaching to the choir, as you know.
[01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:17.200]   You agree?
[01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:20.360]   Yeah, but I don't do our ad sales.
[01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:21.760]   But Lisa does.
[01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:25.680]   And she's getting increasing pressure from agencies and advertisers
[01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:27.400]   to put--
[01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:28.040]   and we can't.
[01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:28.560]   We won't.
[01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:29.320]   We don't detract it.
[01:31:29.320 --> 01:31:30.320]   It's self-defeating.
[01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:31.840]   One of the things we're looking at--
[01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:33.200]   there are services.
[01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:34.840]   I don't know if we're going to do this or not.
[01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:36.400]   We're talking to people.
[01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:37.320]   There are services.
[01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:39.840]   For instance, I think it was a big insurance agency.
[01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:44.080]   You've seen many of their ads on TV that said, well, if you
[01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:49.520]   would use this service, basically every download--
[01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:52.240]   right now, every download goes through our servers
[01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:53.600]   so we can count downloads.
[01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:55.320]   Because we at least want to give them that.
[01:31:55.320 --> 01:31:56.120]   How many impressions?
[01:31:56.120 --> 01:31:57.200]   That's how we charge.
[01:31:57.200 --> 01:32:01.280]   But if we would add another redirect for this service,
[01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:03.240]   they would then get--
[01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:05.160]   apparently only collect IP addresses.
[01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:07.800]   But they'd collect IP addresses if everybody listens.
[01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:11.880]   And then if the advertising agency says, well, we got people
[01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:17.120]   at this IP address to buy insurance,
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:20.120]   we'll match these up, and then this company would match it up.
[01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:22.400]   So neither party would get that information,
[01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:25.640]   the so-called trusted third party.
[01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:29.160]   Then they could say to the insurer,
[01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:33.560]   yeah, 33% of your new business came from Twit.
[01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:34.960]   That would be valuable to us.
[01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:37.040]   Does it protect people's privacy sufficiently?
[01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:40.280]   I think if, as long as this third party never gives up
[01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:41.240]   this information--
[01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:46.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:48.160]   I don't want to have to tell people we're doing it.
[01:32:48.160 --> 01:32:49.640]   We would be transparent if we are.
[01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:52.080]   It will lower the ad revenue over time,
[01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:54.240]   because they'll get more and more fussy about those numbers.
[01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:56.000]   What do you think ad agencies want to do?
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.080]   They don't-- they want to pay less.
[01:32:58.080 --> 01:32:59.320]   That's their goal.
[01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:01.280]   And then they get-- it's like it's the opposite of the Apple
[01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:01.480]   store.
[01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:03.720]   The Apple store adds employees, and they become more
[01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:04.720]   and more successful.
[01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:07.320]   And the big boxes keep reducing employees,
[01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:09.160]   get worse and worse like success levels,
[01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:10.640]   and then further reducing employees
[01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:11.720]   if that's the way to fix it.
[01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:12.840]   Yeah.
[01:33:12.840 --> 01:33:15.680]   It's a crappy business advertising, I can tell you.
[01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:20.160]   But hey, the good-- the good thing about that
[01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:23.240]   is we don't have to charge you for our product.
[01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:26.120]   I mean, it's costly to make our product.
[01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:29.120]   We ate the entire cost of the CES adventure,
[01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:31.280]   because nobody would buy it.
[01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:33.440]   We couldn't sell the ads for it.
[01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:36.120]   And believe me, we can't do that very often.
[01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:40.320]   But that's why I only had one camera on my phone.
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:43.120]   Which is me and I going around like this.
[01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:45.760]   We had spent-- for the booth, we had the booth in the South
[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:46.920]   Hall member for several years.
[01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:48.440]   That was hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:50.240]   I couldn't do that without advertising.
[01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:53.600]   So I'm grateful that we could be an ad supported network.
[01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:55.520]   All my whole life has been ad supported.
[01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:59.040]   I've never had subscription-based products.
[01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:01.680]   And I think-- I would just ask our listeners.
[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:05.960]   I mean, people say they'd pay, but they won't.
[01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:07.080]   So don't you like it?
[01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:08.200]   That's not the answer that--
[01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:09.960]   That's the answer that it's the ad networks.
[01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:12.080]   Because all the intermediaries that have got in between it.
[01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:14.200]   And it seems like that whole classic Star Wars thing,
[01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:15.800]   where the more they tighten their fists,
[01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:20.160]   the more business just leaks out, all sides around it.
[01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:22.280]   I want to end on a happy note.
[01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:25.480]   So we'll stop talking about this.
[01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:28.720]   And I will talk about the fact that Apple is now making it
[01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:31.960]   easy for you to donate to our friends in Australia who
[01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:34.840]   are suffering horrific bushfires.
[01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:39.200]   Apple will accept donations to bushfire relief.
[01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:41.960]   The website in US and Australia has been updated.
[01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:43.040]   So you can click a button.
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:43.920]   They've done this before.
[01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:48.880]   It donates the Red Cross between $5 and $200 in the US.
[01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:50.920]   It goes to the American Red Cross.
[01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:53.800]   In Australia, it'll go to the Australian Red Cross Apple.
[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:57.000]   As always, it collects no processing or handling fees.
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:00.840]   So 100% of your donation goes to providing relief efforts
[01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:05.040]   for the Australian bushfires.
[01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:06.480]   I did it directly to the Fire Brigade,
[01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:08.520]   which is great, too, into the wildlife relief.
[01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:09.840]   Yeah.
[01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:11.600]   I think there are people who say, oh,
[01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:12.760]   I want to give money to the Red Cross.
[01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:15.080]   But there are plenty of place places you could donate.
[01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:18.320]   And it's certainly much needed at this point.
[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:20.760]   So we have so many listeners in Australia.
[01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:23.040]   And we, of course, every time we see the news,
[01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:24.200]   we think about you.
[01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:25.640]   Oh, can I mention something quickly, Leo?
[01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:26.680]   Yes.
[01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:29.640]   There is a replacement program for the battery cases,
[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:32.320]   for the iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR.
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:34.080]   If either the battery case doesn't charge,
[01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:36.240]   or the battery case does not charge your iPhone,
[01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:38.120]   you can contact Apple or go to an Apple store.
[01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:39.200]   And they will replace it for you.
[01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:42.200]   Is this a defect or is this where?
[01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:43.640]   I don't think it--
[01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:45.240]   I don't know how they termed it,
[01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:48.000]   but there is an issue with a very small percentage
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.840]   of our users who are having trouble with it.
[01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:52.360]   But it's just important, no, because I
[01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:54.160]   believe those cases sold relatively well.
[01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:57.760]   So if you have an iPhone XS, XS Max, or XR,
[01:35:57.760 --> 01:35:59.880]   and you're having trouble with your smart battery case,
[01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:03.760]   that's the one that looks like a Cobra the day at a mouse,
[01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:07.400]   then you can get it replaced, which is nice.
[01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:10.200]   As always, details at Apple's website.
[01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:13.440]   And I suspect that there's probably-- they usually
[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:14.760]   do this with the recalls.
[01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:17.520]   There's a serial number lookup function on the website,
[01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:19.360]   because they're-- I don't know.
[01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:21.360]   Or maybe you have to go to the--
[01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:22.480]   let's see here.
[01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:23.320]   Eligible models.
[01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:25.040]   Oh, they-- no, you don't have to look it up.
[01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:25.320]   Just--
[01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:26.760]   Yeah.
[01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:30.080]   If you have one, get it replaced at an Apple authorized service
[01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:32.000]   provider or at an Apple retail store.
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:35.880]   OK.
[01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:39.840]   They were manufactured between January 2019 and October 2019.
[01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:43.000]   It is not a safety issue.
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:44.280]   So they're not blowing up or anything.
[01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:45.640]   No, they just won't charge.
[01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:47.680]   I had that happen not because of this issue.
[01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:51.400]   But when I was at WWDC, I plugged it into a hotel outlet.
[01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:53.640]   And the hotel outlet was just terabad.
[01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:54.760]   And it fried the whole thing.
[01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:56.000]   And it never worked again.
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:57.160]   And it didn't charge my phone.
[01:36:57.160 --> 01:36:59.160]   It didn't charge the iPhone case.
[01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:01.000]   And we had the keynote the next morning.
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:02.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.560]   One of the worst situations ever.
[01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:05.160]   Yeah, I know.
[01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:08.400]   After that, I was very careful in testing all this stuff first.
[01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:10.680]   And Apple reassures you the affected battery cases
[01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:13.280]   will be disposed of in an environmentally friendly way.
[01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:13.960]   Yes.
[01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:14.600]   So there.
[01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:15.840]   And it's not-- yes, not dangerous.
[01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:17.240]   So people don't have to worry about that.
[01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:18.360]   Liam will eat them.
[01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:20.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:21.320]   Terrified of Liam.
[01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:22.000]   All right, get ready.
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.040]   You're picks of the way coming up, folks.
[01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:27.120]   But first a word from our fine sponsors.
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:27.720]   We love them.
[01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:29.200]   Capeterra.
[01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:31.840]   Capeterra, if you are in business and you use enterprise
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:35.120]   software is a solution I think a lot of you are looking for.
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:39.600]   There is, for almost any line of business, for any business use,
[01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:42.520]   there is great modern software out there.
[01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:45.200]   And I still see people say, oh, yeah, I'm using Windows XP
[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:51.240]   because the software that Joey wrote, the boss's nephew,
[01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:53.720]   10 years ago, he disappeared.
[01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:54.920]   And that's all we can use.
[01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:56.640]   But our whole business runs on it.
[01:37:56.640 --> 01:37:58.320]   There's a better way.
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:03.080]   Capeterra, a free directory of the best enterprise software,
[01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:06.440]   700 categories, thousands of programs.
[01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:08.480]   All you have to do is enter the category you want.
[01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:10.960]   It could be very specific, like yoga studio management
[01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:13.580]   or it could be very general, like video editing
[01:38:13.580 --> 01:38:16.120]   or digital workplace software, or video management.
[01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:18.480]   And you just look at all these categories.
[01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:21.520]   In almost every category, there's literally five, six,
[01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:24.480]   a dozen programs you can choose from.
[01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:25.840]   It'll give you all the information
[01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:27.120]   about each of the programs you need.
[01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:28.400]   You can narrow it down if you want.
[01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:31.000]   They have a smart search tool plus filters.
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:32.760]   So you can really narrow it down a lot.
[01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:36.320]   Very specifically to the job you want to do,
[01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:38.160]   but then the best part.
[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:41.480]   Because when you go to capeterra.com/macbreak,
[01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:44.360]   there are over a million reviews from real users.
[01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:46.160]   They vet every single one of them.
[01:38:46.160 --> 01:38:48.880]   So these are people that have actually used it.
[01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:50.680]   You can create a comparison chart,
[01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:53.240]   look at all the features, take a look at the reviews,
[01:38:53.240 --> 01:38:55.960]   pick one you like, and it's all free.

[01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:15.520]   They like to leave reviews.
[01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:17.680]   I guess that's why there are so many reviews.
[01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:20.240]   So join the crowd, leave a review,

[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:56.640]   because we're not tracking you.
[01:39:56.640 --> 01:39:58.720]   So go to capeterra.com/macbreak.
[01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:00.080]   That's how you tell them, oh yeah,
[01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:02.720]   I just heard it on Macbreak Weekly that helps us.
[01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:05.120]   And it makes us happy.
[01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:08.800]   Renee Ritchie, how about a pick of the week?
[01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:12.000]   - So I'm gonna play the role of Alex Lindsey on today's show
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:13.920]   before Alex Lindsey gets to play that role.
[01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:15.480]   I've been all about lighting lately,
[01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:17.480]   trying to find better and more useful lighting.
[01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:21.400]   And I had the digital Sputnik's behind me,
[01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:23.960]   but now I've gotten into Quasar's Science,
[01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:25.560]   which is very similar.
[01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:27.560]   It is an LED behind this,
[01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:30.240]   I don't know what the proper term is,
[01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:32.120]   it's just like a tube.
[01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:35.560]   There's two strips or three multiple strips of LEDs in here.
[01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:36.800]   What's really nice about this one
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:39.880]   is that you can plug it in directly on one end,
[01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:42.120]   rotating the right direction.
[01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:43.640]   There is a cable that you can use as well,
[01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:45.160]   but you can plug it in directly.
[01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:47.840]   And on the other end, there's this little menu
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:51.200]   and you can switch the color, the intensity,
[01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:52.320]   all these different things.
[01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:53.920]   And the reason I like them is that
[01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:56.320]   hue lights are phenomenal, they're fantastic.
[01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:57.880]   But when you start filming,
[01:40:57.880 --> 01:41:00.160]   you can get a lot of shutter roll with them,
[01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:01.360]   or you have to adjust your shutter speed,
[01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:04.240]   and then you lose some of the proper looking motion blur
[01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:05.800]   on what you're filming.
[01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:07.400]   So I've been looking for more stable lights,
[01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:09.960]   and these are both really, really bright
[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:11.120]   and really, really colorful.
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:13.320]   - And they support DMX.
[01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:14.400]   - Yes, awesome.
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:15.240]   - That's awesome.
[01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:16.480]   - Yeah, they absolutely do.
[01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:18.960]   They look expensive, I mean, the four inch ones,
[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:21.160]   there's also two, this is the two foot one,
[01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:23.600]   they have four foot ones as well.
[01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:24.960]   But what you're getting for that price
[01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:27.080]   is way beyond what you used to be able to get for that price.
[01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:29.120]   And you can just tape these up to a light stand,
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:30.840]   you can get a clamp if you wanna get fans here
[01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:33.160]   and put them into like a sea stamped,
[01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:34.400]   all of those things.
[01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:37.200]   So I'm busily swapping out some of my hue lights
[01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:40.200]   for these right now, and I'm quite enjoying them.
[01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:42.360]   - Maybe we should get some, huh?
[01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:43.200]   - We used them for--
[01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:44.640]   - They're using a lot of RRGB lights,
[01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:45.960]   they're like for discos.
[01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:47.280]   (laughing)
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:48.600]   - Jonathan Morrison recommends me,
[01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:50.600]   he's like, "Hey, I noticed that your lights were,
[01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:53.040]   your shutter speed was all wrong, and your lights,
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:54.360]   and you just get these."
[01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:56.520]   - One of the things also is when you turn them down,
[01:41:56.520 --> 01:41:57.720]   'cause a lot of times the--
[01:41:57.720 --> 01:41:58.640]   - That's how they turn it down,
[01:41:58.640 --> 01:41:59.960]   they change the flicker rate.
[01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:02.520]   - They're slowing down, so we have that all the time
[01:42:02.520 --> 01:42:06.000]   with lower quality LEDs where you just see this weird role
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.280]   because they're getting down into the frame rate
[01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:09.920]   of the camera.
[01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:12.280]   - And Alex has been really kind to send me tons of advice,
[01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:14.960]   and that's how I'm improving, so I really appreciate it, Alex.
[01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:15.800]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:16.640]   - Looking good.
[01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:18.400]   - Never sends us any advice.
[01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:19.240]   - He's right there to do it.
[01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:20.080]   - You never ask.
[01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:21.240]   (laughing)
[01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:22.840]   - I don't wanna know, I like it a lot more--
[01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:24.280]   - I look way worse than you, Leo,
[01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:25.720]   that's what we're finding out here.
[01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:27.640]   - No, you look great.
[01:42:27.640 --> 01:42:29.800]   And of course, imore.com/vector
[01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:32.040]   is the place to go to see all of Renee's great video.
[01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:34.760]   Andy, you're not going, what do you got for us?
[01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:38.560]   - I've been shopping around for a better CD Ripper
[01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:40.200]   and audio converter,
[01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:42.240]   it is turning out that this is the year
[01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:47.240]   in which I take my first decade of the 2000s status,
[01:42:47.240 --> 01:42:52.360]   audio library, and upgrade it into the second decade
[01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:54.080]   of the 2000s.
[01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:56.160]   It was not intentional, it's just,
[01:42:56.160 --> 01:42:58.000]   once you pull it one little thread,
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.640]   it's like, oh God, that's half the sweater gone, okay,
[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:02.480]   I may as well just make a new sweater at this point.
[01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:04.600]   So this is the year that I'm converting
[01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:08.960]   like all of my Apple lossless files to FLAC.
[01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:11.120]   I'm finding a better,
[01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:15.120]   now that I'm trying to get off my iTunes dependency
[01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:20.120]   now that it's no longer the modern Apple app.
[01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:24.400]   And so I found a really good open source Ripper
[01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:27.480]   and converter called XLD.
[01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:29.280]   There are a lot, if you do a Google search
[01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:31.200]   for Mac audio converter,
[01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:33.080]   you're gonna find like two dozen of them
[01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:35.520]   and some of them are kind of sketchy looking
[01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:36.640]   because it's like, oh wow,
[01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:39.440]   this is a really incredibly full featured app
[01:43:39.440 --> 01:43:40.960]   that you're not charging anything for
[01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:43.160]   and it's not open source, where are you making your,
[01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:46.280]   and it does as too professional looking to look like,
[01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:49.240]   it's just like a labor of love project.
[01:43:49.240 --> 01:43:51.160]   This is full open source and it does everything
[01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:53.480]   that I want it to do because number one,
[01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:54.640]   it is a CD Ripper.
[01:43:54.640 --> 01:43:56.680]   So it'll rip the CD,
[01:43:56.680 --> 01:44:00.160]   it'll also to me ripping a CD is just the first step.
[01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:04.880]   You also have to fix all of the stupid boneheaded decisions
[01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:08.080]   that whoever it was 10 or 20 years ago first ripped it
[01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:10.040]   and put into the CD did race made.
[01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:12.600]   So that yes, if you,
[01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:17.320]   Elton John did do a duet on one track of this 22 track album,
[01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:19.080]   that doesn't make it a compilation.
[01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:20.960]   But it's still an Elton John album.
[01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:23.480]   I'm still kind of upset about that sort of stuff.
[01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:25.520]   It'll get the album art, all that sort of stuff.
[01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:28.160]   Most important thing is though for me is that
[01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:30.400]   unlike iTunes, it'll support FLAC.
[01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:33.600]   So it's the open, the more compatible
[01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:36.120]   lossless CD rip format.
[01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:38.960]   But the other thing that I needed to do is to take
[01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:43.240]   like 120, 130, 140 gigabytes of music files
[01:44:43.240 --> 01:44:45.840]   and convert them all into FLAC
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:47.720]   or convert them all into something else.
[01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:49.840]   And it's not quite as simple as a drag and drop,
[01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:54.640]   but once you take 15 or 20 minutes to set it up properly
[01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:57.040]   for like the folders you have and where they need to go,
[01:44:57.040 --> 01:44:59.880]   you can just walk away for half a day or so
[01:44:59.880 --> 01:45:02.440]   and go get pancakes or whatever and come back
[01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:03.880]   and it'll actually work.
[01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:05.440]   So I'm very, very, very happy with it.
[01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:07.760]   It's it's, it doesn't try to be a slick interface.
[01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:09.880]   It just tries to be a very, very efficient tool.
[01:45:09.880 --> 01:45:14.560]   It's open source, it's free and also it's not really shady.
[01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:17.640]   So if you're, if you want to get rid of iTunes as much
[01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:19.760]   as pretty much everybody else who has ever used iTunes
[01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:22.480]   wants to get rid of iTunes, including Apple,
[01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:24.000]   but you're looking for something that replaces
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:27.280]   some core features, then yeah, I think that XLD
[01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:30.240]   is going to be on my, my tool bar for quite a while.
[01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:31.840]   - Funny that you should mention that
[01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:35.800]   because I've been faced myself with a recent conundrum.
[01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:40.560]   I've been getting screener disks to see all the movies.
[01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:43.280]   'Cause I'm in SAG, the screen actor skill.
[01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:45.320]   It somehow sneaks into that.
[01:45:45.320 --> 01:45:46.760]   And I love the screen of disks,
[01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:50.680]   but I don't have a DVD player attached to a TV
[01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:53.160]   that I can use in any way conveniently.
[01:45:53.160 --> 01:45:55.200]   I wanted to put it on a Plex.
[01:45:55.200 --> 01:45:58.400]   So I was searching around and I found a great
[01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:01.480]   Jason Snell article just updated a couple of days ago,
[01:46:01.480 --> 01:46:04.680]   how I ripped DVDs and Blu-rays.
[01:46:04.680 --> 01:46:08.200]   And he recommended, he did recommend
[01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:12.920]   and I'm not going to get a $200 4K UHD compatible DVD
[01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:16.880]   or Ripper that it can be flashed for region code,
[01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:17.880]   and so forth.
[01:46:17.880 --> 01:46:19.720]   But the other thing he recommended,
[01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:22.440]   which I have been using is make MKV,
[01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:25.280]   which is you know about it, ripping software.
[01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:28.760]   - I was just using it last night to get this
[01:46:28.760 --> 01:46:33.760]   Japanese only edition of Colombo and HD into my library.
[01:46:33.760 --> 01:46:37.760]   - Well, what do you use as a reader?
[01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:39.640]   Do you have a UHD reader?
[01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:44.640]   - I've not gotten into Ultra HD yet because I just haven't.
[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:48.280]   I just use a Pioneer Blu-ray.
[01:46:48.280 --> 01:46:49.120]   - Yeah.
[01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:50.680]   - It's actually attached.
[01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:54.360]   It's actually got a CD locked and loaded to go.
[01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:56.120]   But yeah, this one costs about 100 bucks.
[01:46:56.120 --> 01:47:01.120]   It's compatible with Blu-ray and DVD and CD.
[01:47:01.120 --> 01:47:04.480]   And I've been using it for the past like three or four years.
[01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:07.880]   - So the amazing thing about make MKV
[01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:09.280]   is you put your disk in there.
[01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:11.400]   And even though these are all copy protected,
[01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:16.400]   somehow it just magically rips it off into an MKV,
[01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:17.800]   which is great.
[01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:20.040]   And then I just drag it over to my Synology
[01:47:20.040 --> 01:47:22.720]   and Plex is really good at recognizing MKVs
[01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:25.120]   and matching them up and giving you all sorts of,
[01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:27.360]   you know, album art and trailers and all that stuff.
[01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:28.280]   - Yeah, fantastic.
[01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:30.320]   - Yeah, really nice feature.
[01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:32.000]   - I usually throw it into handbrake
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.280]   just to get them a little bit smaller.
[01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:38.080]   I can't, I can't get, maybe it's different with 4K.
[01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:41.600]   - I've just really, they are huge.
[01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:42.480]   And you can get them.
[01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:45.280]   And I don't notice any real loss of quality
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:49.240]   when I, when I to transcode them down to a level I want.
[01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:51.000]   The other cool thing is that handbrake
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.960]   lets you really easily adjust your expectations
[01:47:53.960 --> 01:47:55.200]   for a certain thing.
[01:47:55.200 --> 01:47:57.720]   Like if I am ripping something like I got, okay, yes.
[01:47:57.720 --> 01:48:01.640]   I was at the libraries like any DVD for a dollar bin.
[01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:03.280]   They had the Sex and the City movie.
[01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:05.560]   I decided, okay, that's worth the dollar to me.
[01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:07.760]   When I ripped that one, I got the quality level
[01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:10.400]   all the way down just like the quality of the movie itself
[01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:12.120]   because I don't really want to invest
[01:48:12.120 --> 01:48:13.360]   a lot of storage space in it.
[01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:15.560]   But last month I got,
[01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:19.440]   - Well these screens, I have to tell you are 480p.
[01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:23.000]   So I don't really, I don't need to compress them any further.
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:23.960]   - They're already crappy.
[01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:25.560]   - But when I got the box,
[01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:28.880]   the new box of the new final,
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:31.280]   we promised version of Apocalypse Now,
[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:32.960]   that one went, you know what?
[01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:36.080]   I'll just take as much data and as much quality
[01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:38.200]   as you possibly want, it's worth it.
[01:48:38.200 --> 01:48:43.200]   So yeah, it's, it's, Jason has advised you well.
[01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:46.200]   I think that when I first started ripping blue rays and DVDs,
[01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:50.440]   I used like the 2005 version of that guide.
[01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:52.280]   It was very, very easy to recommend.
[01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:55.240]   - It's $50, but you can use it for 30 days,
[01:48:55.240 --> 01:48:56.680]   which frankly is all for free,
[01:48:56.680 --> 01:48:58.600]   which is all I need to get the screen
[01:48:58.600 --> 01:49:00.320]   that's gonna be going on.
[01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:01.800]   - If you get into this, this comes into,
[01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:03.760]   I want you to have, I'm registering this
[01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:06.120]   'cause I want you to have money for this wonderful tool
[01:49:06.120 --> 01:49:06.960]   that you made.
[01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:08.440]   And it keeps, they keep updating it
[01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:10.280]   like every single month or two.
[01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:13.360]   And it really has worked with every disc I've ever tried on it.
[01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:15.240]   - Look what, if you're really a person,
[01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:19.800]   GitHub.com/donmelton was updated, I think yesterday as well.
[01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:21.520]   And he tries to, he makes tools for handbrake
[01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:24.080]   and for command line, FFmpeg.
[01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:27.400]   And he just tries to get everything as pristine as possible
[01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:28.680]   with the smallest size possible.
[01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:29.760]   - I'll have to look at that.
[01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:31.120]   - I'm not so worried about size
[01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:33.360]   'cause I just bought a new Synology
[01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:38.360]   and the new 16 terabyte Seagate Iron Wolf drives
[01:49:38.360 --> 01:49:41.920]   are down to under 500 bucks for 16 terabytes.
[01:49:41.920 --> 01:49:44.480]   So I have 30 terabytes of storage.
[01:49:44.480 --> 01:49:45.880]   - But he wants the right red.
[01:49:45.880 --> 01:49:46.720]   - It's not the private Ryan Leo.
[01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:49.360]   It's not just the size, it's the right red in private Ryan.
[01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:52.040]   - Oh, well, I'm not trying to compress him
[01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:52.880]   is what I'm saying.
[01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:55.720]   I'm just, I got enough room for several thousand movies on there.
[01:49:55.720 --> 01:49:56.800]   I'm not too worried about it.
[01:49:56.800 --> 01:49:59.880]   - But yeah, but you will run out at some point.
[01:49:59.880 --> 01:50:03.280]   - I finally, I finally maxed up my eight terabytes
[01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:04.760]   and that's just with media.
[01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:07.160]   And now I'm trying to figure out,
[01:50:07.160 --> 01:50:11.000]   do I want to upgrade to a four-bay NAS?
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:12.880]   Do I want to just put all my movies
[01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:16.080]   on a pair of standard USB drives outside?
[01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:20.120]   And I'm actually thinking about what if I were just,
[01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:23.960]   instead of spending $800 on all this other extra storage,
[01:50:23.960 --> 01:50:28.400]   what if I were to buy a couple of extra 12 terabyte drives,
[01:50:28.400 --> 01:50:31.480]   standard USB, use one for the actual storage
[01:50:31.480 --> 01:50:33.560]   and another one for backup of the first one.
[01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:38.400]   It's, it's, and this is defined as the fun italicized
[01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:40.200]   of like managing your own media library.
[01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:41.280]   Because it is fun.
[01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:43.600]   I have to, I have to realize that part of the part
[01:50:43.600 --> 01:50:46.600]   of what I enjoy is literally, excuse me,
[01:50:46.600 --> 01:50:49.040]   is explicitly when I have this hankering
[01:50:49.040 --> 01:50:51.000]   to suddenly watch like every Colombo again,
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:52.040]   'cause I love them so much.
[01:50:52.040 --> 01:50:53.960]   And it's right there waiting for me.
[01:50:53.960 --> 01:50:56.880]   But part of it is knowing that, okay, I've, I've,
[01:50:56.880 --> 01:50:58.360]   I'm going to rip this, but I'm going to make sure
[01:50:58.360 --> 01:50:59.480]   I tweak the settings properly.
[01:50:59.480 --> 01:51:00.840]   I'm going to edit the metadata
[01:51:00.840 --> 01:51:03.200]   and put this in the special collection so I can find it.
[01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:05.720]   Yeah, it's, it's, it's nice to curation
[01:51:05.720 --> 01:51:07.120]   is a hobby in and of itself.
[01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:08.960]   Here's the Don Melton GitHub page,
[01:51:08.960 --> 01:51:11.120]   github.com/donmelton.
[01:51:11.120 --> 01:51:13.120]   And what else are you going to do in this retirement?
[01:51:13.120 --> 01:51:14.480]   Scripts.
[01:51:14.480 --> 01:51:15.480]   That's awesome.
[01:51:15.480 --> 01:51:17.160]   Alex Lindsey, pick of the week.
[01:51:17.160 --> 01:51:22.840]   So last dub dub DC, Apple released reality composer.
[01:51:22.840 --> 01:51:26.200]   So what reality composer did was really make it much easier
[01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:30.920]   for you to take 3D objects and put them into AR.
[01:51:30.920 --> 01:51:31.760]   You know what I mean?
[01:51:31.760 --> 01:51:34.640]   And be able to integrate them with your Xcode projects
[01:51:34.640 --> 01:51:35.720]   and so on and so forth.
[01:51:35.720 --> 01:51:39.960]   And so reality composer was great and is great.
[01:51:39.960 --> 01:51:40.800]   It's great.
[01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:44.040]   You place it, you can very quickly send it to your phone
[01:51:44.040 --> 01:51:46.560]   and then immediately see how it's working.
[01:51:46.560 --> 01:51:48.080]   And I use it a lot to test.
[01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:51.520]   The one problem with it was that you couldn't get any objects
[01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:52.360]   into it.
[01:51:52.360 --> 01:51:55.120]   So, so that while there was a thing that you do it,
[01:51:55.120 --> 01:51:56.840]   it only works with USDZ.
[01:51:56.840 --> 01:51:59.480]   Now USDZ's Apple released two years ago.
[01:51:59.480 --> 01:52:01.480]   Remember we talked about it when they announced.
[01:52:01.480 --> 01:52:02.320]   Yeah.
[01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:04.760]   So USDZ, so what it was is USD,
[01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:06.480]   which is the universal scene description,
[01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:09.000]   which is the primary format that Pixar uses
[01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:10.520]   to move things around.
[01:52:10.520 --> 01:52:12.440]   Apple looked at it and said, you know if we zip this,
[01:52:12.440 --> 01:52:14.160]   it would be smaller and easier to manage.
[01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:16.720]   And so they zipped it and so it's USDZ.
[01:52:16.720 --> 01:52:21.920]   And so you have this format that Pixar developed.
[01:52:21.920 --> 01:52:25.280]   Apple's making more popular, but it's not that popular yet.
[01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:27.200]   And so the real issue that we had was every time
[01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:29.720]   you build something, and so I want to build almost,
[01:52:29.720 --> 01:52:32.920]   there's no software, very few pieces of software
[01:52:32.920 --> 01:52:35.720]   that build in USDZ, which is what you need to put it
[01:52:35.720 --> 01:52:37.280]   into reality composer, which is what you need to put it
[01:52:37.280 --> 01:52:38.600]   on your phone, which is what you need to put it
[01:52:38.600 --> 01:52:39.760]   into your project.
[01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:42.440]   And so there was this huge missing thing.
[01:52:42.440 --> 01:52:44.520]   You build something and then you had to,
[01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:48.680]   I found a piece of software, little piece of software
[01:52:48.680 --> 01:52:50.840]   out of Jordan that will do the conversion
[01:52:50.840 --> 01:52:53.960]   and everything else, but it was really hard
[01:52:53.960 --> 01:52:56.040]   and difficult to get it in.
[01:52:56.040 --> 01:52:59.000]   So what Apple has released as of yesterday
[01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.160]   is reality converter.
[01:53:01.160 --> 01:53:03.880]   So reality converter takes all the,
[01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:06.920]   most of the major software, you know,
[01:53:06.920 --> 01:53:09.160]   and most importantly, OBJ, which is the one
[01:53:09.160 --> 01:53:11.240]   we really need to make sure we support.
[01:53:11.240 --> 01:53:15.920]   It is, it takes the OBJ format and converts it to USDZ.
[01:53:15.920 --> 01:53:18.280]   Now I know this may seem like a minor thing for folks
[01:53:18.280 --> 01:53:20.440]   who don't do this,
[01:53:20.440 --> 01:53:24.680]   but it was a huge missing, you know, chunk in the right,
[01:53:24.680 --> 01:53:26.720]   you know, it was like, like the, the, the,
[01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:29.040]   the track went here and then the track started over there
[01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:30.640]   and there's like, there's like a hundred feet
[01:53:30.640 --> 01:53:33.200]   that were in between that was slowing everything down.
[01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:35.440]   And so having this ability to convert
[01:53:35.440 --> 01:53:37.640]   and I've tested it in the pipeline.
[01:53:37.640 --> 01:53:40.840]   So I, you know, I built a photogrammetry model,
[01:53:40.840 --> 01:53:44.600]   exported it with textures, ran it throughout reality converter,
[01:53:44.600 --> 01:53:47.080]   put it into compose rated this all this morning actually.
[01:53:47.080 --> 01:53:49.080]   So, because I had to run the,
[01:53:49.080 --> 01:53:51.600]   I had to update the Catalina finally on my iMac.
[01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:52.480]   I'd been putting it off.
[01:53:52.480 --> 01:53:54.440]   I was like, oh, I know I'm going to break a bunch of things.
[01:53:54.440 --> 01:53:55.800]   And I did.
[01:53:55.800 --> 01:53:58.320]   So this morning I kind of went through that whole pipeline
[01:53:58.320 --> 01:54:00.520]   of building the thing from scratch, putting it all in
[01:54:00.520 --> 01:54:03.640]   and it worked perfectly, you know, going into,
[01:54:03.640 --> 01:54:06.080]   these are just little USDZ models that.
[01:54:06.080 --> 01:54:08.040]   - But if you go to this with iOS 13,
[01:54:08.040 --> 01:54:12.360]   you can actually put a teacup on your desk or a fly.
[01:54:12.360 --> 01:54:13.320]   - Well, you can, you can down,
[01:54:13.320 --> 01:54:15.160]   these models are already in USDZ.
[01:54:15.160 --> 01:54:16.560]   So they're not, that's that,
[01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:18.280]   and they've been there for a while.
[01:54:18.280 --> 01:54:20.120]   And you know, Apple was putting those out.
[01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:22.200]   But the big thing now is that no matter what--
[01:54:22.200 --> 01:54:24.600]   - It can take a, not what you're using.
[01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:28.680]   - What you're using, you can easily get those source files
[01:54:28.680 --> 01:54:30.480]   into reality composer.
[01:54:30.480 --> 01:54:32.840]   Now, right now it's just reality composer,
[01:54:32.840 --> 01:54:37.840]   but obviously the operating system is supporting USDZ
[01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:39.760]   or kind of moving that direction.
[01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:41.840]   That's what Apple's talked about at WWDC.
[01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:46.040]   So imagine, you know, someday I, you know, I can dream
[01:54:46.040 --> 01:54:47.720]   that someday we're going to see it in pages
[01:54:47.720 --> 01:54:49.840]   and in keynote and you know.
[01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:53.240]   And so being able to get the models easily into those.
[01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:56.880]   And the cool thing about USDZ is that it's not just limited
[01:54:56.880 --> 01:54:58.240]   to, oh, it's a model.
[01:54:58.240 --> 01:55:00.400]   Those models can have animation.
[01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:01.920]   They can have behaviors.
[01:55:01.920 --> 01:55:04.120]   They can have other things embedded into them
[01:55:04.120 --> 01:55:05.280]   that would allow us to do it.
[01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:07.280]   You know, you can do a lot more with them
[01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:09.440]   and starting to add those to documents,
[01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:12.440]   add them to email, add them to lots of other things.
[01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:16.400]   And so it's, but again, a big piece of the missing part
[01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:20.840]   of this track was converting from what all the software
[01:55:20.840 --> 01:55:23.960]   that we use to build 3D into the format
[01:55:23.960 --> 01:55:25.480]   that is needed to work inside of this.
[01:55:25.480 --> 01:55:28.280]   And so I'm just excited that Apple has done it.
[01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:31.200]   If you do what I do, you should go get it
[01:55:31.200 --> 01:55:32.840]   'cause it's great.
[01:55:32.840 --> 01:55:34.280]   If you don't, then probably won't mean anything
[01:55:34.280 --> 01:55:35.120]   to you right now.
[01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:35.960]   - It's free, right?
[01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:36.800]   - But it's free.
[01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:38.320]   And I don't know what you'd know what to do with it
[01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:39.160]   if you didn't, if you don't do 3D.
[01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:40.680]   - If you don't know, you need it, you don't.
[01:55:40.680 --> 01:55:41.520]   - You don't need it.
[01:55:41.520 --> 01:55:44.640]   But the point is, is that what it's going to do though,
[01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:48.240]   is it's going to make it easier for people as USDZ
[01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:51.200]   becomes something that's embedded in more applications.
[01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:54.080]   Forward thinking applications are going to start adding that
[01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:56.200]   to their support.
[01:55:56.200 --> 01:55:58.640]   So just what Apple's making easy is,
[01:55:58.640 --> 01:56:01.240]   just like you would add a picture to your document
[01:56:01.240 --> 01:56:04.800]   or a movie to your document, you just drag and drop it in,
[01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:07.080]   soon you're going to be able to do 3D,
[01:56:07.080 --> 01:56:08.800]   or just take a 3D object and just throw it in there
[01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:10.360]   and rotate it around and so on and so forth.
[01:56:10.360 --> 01:56:13.720]   And I think it's going to revolutionize documentation.
[01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:16.320]   And so I think it's more than AR.
[01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:18.520]   It's something that is going to be a big deal.
[01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:20.240]   And we're just seeing these little drips,
[01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:21.840]   you know, going along the path.
[01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:25.120]   - Not to be confused with the United States Department of Zinga.
[01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:27.200]   It's not related.
[01:56:27.200 --> 01:56:30.800]   USDZ, Reality Converter, free from Apple.
[01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:33.520]   As of January 13th, so just came out.
[01:56:33.520 --> 01:56:34.360]   Great work.
[01:56:34.360 --> 01:56:36.760]   - Lori Gill, I think we needed to move
[01:56:36.760 --> 01:56:39.520]   to Shafter all those heavy duty programs.
[01:56:39.520 --> 01:56:40.560]   - Let's do something for us.
[01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:42.920]   - Let's do something that every single person
[01:56:42.920 --> 01:56:46.880]   can appreciate, which is a trackpad on your keyboard
[01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:48.760]   for your iPad.
[01:56:48.760 --> 01:56:53.760]   And BridgeBRY DG makes the first to market version of that.
[01:56:53.760 --> 01:57:00.120]   So this is a trackpad on a keyboard for your iPad Pro.
[01:57:00.120 --> 01:57:01.040]   Not this is the Mac thing.
[01:57:01.040 --> 01:57:03.400]   - Did you try this at CES 'cause you can't get it till March?
[01:57:03.400 --> 01:57:05.960]   - Right, so they actually sent me a prototype.
[01:57:05.960 --> 01:57:07.400]   So I've had it for a few weeks.
[01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:11.920]   I used it as my sole device when I was at CES.
[01:57:11.920 --> 01:57:13.920]   I just wanted to try it out just to see
[01:57:13.920 --> 01:57:16.680]   how hard it was to use an iPad instead of a Mac
[01:57:16.680 --> 01:57:20.560]   for traveling and covering things.
[01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:23.120]   And it turns out it's a lot easier to do
[01:57:23.120 --> 01:57:25.000]   than I ever thought it was.
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:29.000]   I've been kind of never wanting to use my iPad
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:32.000]   as my sole device just because what if something happens?
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.640]   But turns out it actually works a lot better
[01:57:34.640 --> 01:57:36.040]   than it used to with iPadOS.
[01:57:36.040 --> 01:57:38.040]   But the trackpad with this,
[01:57:38.040 --> 01:57:41.080]   so there's kind of two things to think about.
[01:57:41.080 --> 01:57:46.080]   Number one, it's still using the limited software
[01:57:46.080 --> 01:57:51.520]   that is the pointer device capabilities with iPadOS S13.
[01:57:51.520 --> 01:57:54.880]   So you're still gonna, it's not perfect.
[01:57:54.880 --> 01:57:59.880]   It's not a true mouse or click trackpad coverage.
[01:57:59.880 --> 01:58:02.640]   But then at the same time,
[01:58:02.640 --> 01:58:05.560]   it's the first to market that has a keyboard and a trackpad.
[01:58:05.560 --> 01:58:07.960]   So it's better than anything else
[01:58:07.960 --> 01:58:10.160]   because it's the only one out there right now.
[01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:14.640]   So it has some pain points to it.
[01:58:14.640 --> 01:58:17.080]   In the clicking, the clicking is a little bit heavy.
[01:58:17.080 --> 01:58:18.560]   It's a little hard to click.
[01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:20.760]   I have the 11 inch model
[01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:22.920]   and the trackpad is fairly small,
[01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:26.120]   which makes difficult things like dragging.
[01:58:26.120 --> 01:58:29.040]   So if you're trying to like swipe the screen, for example,
[01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:31.680]   you have to press down on the trackpad
[01:58:31.680 --> 01:58:33.960]   and then use your finger to swipe.
[01:58:33.960 --> 01:58:36.640]   And that's just an awkward experience on the trackpad
[01:58:36.640 --> 01:58:38.600]   that I have on the 11 inch one.
[01:58:38.600 --> 01:58:40.520]   I tried it at CES on the 12.9,
[01:58:40.520 --> 01:58:42.400]   which one is much more convenient.
[01:58:42.400 --> 01:58:47.520]   But a lot of the problems that the trackpad has itself,
[01:58:47.520 --> 01:58:50.920]   it's just due to the fact that the software isn't quite ready
[01:58:50.920 --> 01:58:51.920]   for that kind of mobility.
[01:58:51.920 --> 01:58:55.280]   - It's not, it's not, it's not, it's just,
[01:58:55.280 --> 01:58:57.800]   no trackpad is gonna be any better than this.
[01:58:57.800 --> 01:58:59.440]   They're all gonna be like this for now.
[01:58:59.440 --> 01:59:02.080]   - As you're using an accessibility feature
[01:59:02.080 --> 01:59:03.440]   as opposed to built in trackpad.
[01:59:03.440 --> 01:59:04.280]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:59:04.280 --> 01:59:07.000]   So just having a trackpad right there on your keyboard
[01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:08.200]   is pretty impressive.
[01:59:08.200 --> 01:59:09.040]   It's pretty cool.
[01:59:09.040 --> 01:59:10.880]   (laughing)
[01:59:10.880 --> 01:59:13.400]   - But yeah, I have the bridge keyboard only
[01:59:13.400 --> 01:59:15.960]   and I just stopped carrying it 'cause it's too damn heavy.
[01:59:15.960 --> 01:59:19.120]   - It is, it's just rather a laptop if I wanna do that.
[01:59:19.120 --> 01:59:20.840]   - Yeah, so I was thinking about that.
[01:59:20.840 --> 01:59:22.960]   I think somebody had actually mentioned that one
[01:59:22.960 --> 01:59:26.240]   when the keyboard was first announced and that's true.
[01:59:26.240 --> 01:59:29.240]   It's heavy, it's basically as heavy as a keyboard.
[01:59:29.240 --> 01:59:31.920]   But you have a lot more versatility with it.
[01:59:31.920 --> 01:59:35.440]   So if I'm taking my iPad Pro with me on the road,
[01:59:35.440 --> 01:59:37.080]   not my MacBook with me,
[01:59:37.080 --> 01:59:38.960]   I can pull that off the keyboard
[01:59:38.960 --> 01:59:40.880]   and just walk around with just my slate.
[01:59:40.880 --> 01:59:44.400]   So that gives me that freedom of having a lighter backpack.
[01:59:44.400 --> 01:59:46.440]   If I know I wanna use the internet,
[01:59:46.440 --> 01:59:48.280]   but I don't need all of the typing
[01:59:48.280 --> 01:59:50.920]   and tapping kind of stuff to do with it,
[01:59:50.920 --> 01:59:53.840]   I can use it to draw,
[01:59:53.840 --> 01:59:55.800]   if I wanna sketch something with my Apple Pencil
[01:59:55.800 --> 01:59:56.640]   or something.
[01:59:56.640 --> 01:59:58.400]   So it adds a lot more versatility
[01:59:58.400 --> 01:59:59.800]   than using your Mac computer.
[01:59:59.800 --> 02:00:04.160]   So if the only thing that you can imagine using
[02:00:04.160 --> 02:00:07.000]   a device with a screen that big,
[02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:10.160]   is a laptop, then yeah, this is too heavy.
[02:00:10.160 --> 02:00:13.080]   It's not, there's no good comparison there.
[02:00:13.080 --> 02:00:16.280]   But if you want the versatility of leaving the keyboard
[02:00:16.280 --> 02:00:17.800]   behind in your hotel,
[02:00:17.800 --> 02:00:19.400]   well, you run out on the show floor
[02:00:19.400 --> 02:00:21.280]   and then you're still using it for some things,
[02:00:21.280 --> 02:00:22.280]   but not everything's,
[02:00:22.280 --> 02:00:25.400]   then you go back to the hotel and you start typing,
[02:00:25.400 --> 02:00:28.880]   you pop that right down on the keyboard
[02:00:28.880 --> 02:00:32.760]   and then you've got like some really good usability for Bull.
[02:00:32.760 --> 02:00:33.600]   - Nice, yeah.
[02:00:33.600 --> 02:00:35.560]   I should absolutely back that up
[02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:38.800]   because I was using an iPad Pro as my daily driver,
[02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:40.000]   outside of the office driver,
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.240]   whether I was at a coffee shop for a couple hours
[02:00:42.240 --> 02:00:44.560]   or even like taking off for a weekend
[02:00:44.560 --> 02:00:47.480]   or a couple of overnights in New York for business stuff.
[02:00:47.480 --> 02:00:51.760]   And I would pack like an extra little keyboard,
[02:00:51.760 --> 02:00:54.240]   which I love, and also like an easel
[02:00:54.240 --> 02:00:57.120]   and the difference between getting to the coffee shop
[02:00:57.120 --> 02:00:58.680]   and taking out the iPad,
[02:00:58.680 --> 02:01:00.440]   taking out the easel, unfolding it,
[02:01:00.440 --> 02:01:01.640]   putting the iPad on the easel,
[02:01:01.640 --> 02:01:03.000]   taking out the keyboard,
[02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.360]   pressing the button to make sure that they're connected
[02:01:05.360 --> 02:01:07.960]   to the keyboard versus just taking something out,
[02:01:07.960 --> 02:01:10.160]   unfolding it and boom, you're done.
[02:01:10.160 --> 02:01:12.680]   That is such a huge, huge positive,
[02:01:12.680 --> 02:01:14.240]   especially when you consider all the stuff
[02:01:14.240 --> 02:01:15.680]   that you get that's extra
[02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:18.440]   and having something that is muscular as an iPad,
[02:01:18.440 --> 02:01:21.360]   as a touch device that can also be used so well,
[02:01:21.360 --> 02:01:22.200]   just as a regular,
[02:01:22.200 --> 02:01:24.400]   I just need to write two or 3,000 words
[02:01:24.400 --> 02:01:25.920]   and I only have two to three hours to do it.
[02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:28.440]   I don't wanna have to take my hands off
[02:01:28.440 --> 02:01:31.200]   to do a multi-fingers sort of thing.
[02:01:31.200 --> 02:01:33.080]   So yeah, I could definitely see that being,
[02:01:33.080 --> 02:01:34.840]   for a lot of people it's gonna be worth the extra,
[02:01:34.840 --> 02:01:36.080]   the extra bulk.
[02:01:36.080 --> 02:01:38.720]   - Lori Gill, managing editor, imore.com.
[02:01:38.720 --> 02:01:41.520]   Thank you, Lori, it was great seeing you in Vegas.
[02:01:41.520 --> 02:01:43.080]   - Yeah, it was great, definitely.
[02:01:43.080 --> 02:01:44.200]   - We'll see you soon.
[02:01:44.200 --> 02:01:46.520]   Well, next week at Apoholy,
[02:01:46.520 --> 02:01:50.720]   APP-A-H-O-L-I-K.
[02:01:50.720 --> 02:01:52.040]   - You got it.
[02:01:52.040 --> 02:01:55.280]   - Alex Lindsey is Lindsey with an A-L-I-N-D-S-A-Y
[02:01:55.280 --> 02:01:56.160]   on the Twitter.
[02:01:56.160 --> 02:01:58.480]   - I wrote a really long article.
[02:01:58.480 --> 02:01:59.320]   - Where was it?
[02:01:59.320 --> 02:02:00.160]   - I put it on Twitter.
[02:02:00.160 --> 02:02:01.200]   - If you find it, you go to Twitter,
[02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:02.160]   no, I didn't put it on Twitter
[02:02:02.160 --> 02:02:03.720]   'cause you can't write it on long articles on Twitter.
[02:02:03.720 --> 02:02:04.560]   - You'll get to try.
[02:02:04.560 --> 02:02:06.240]   - I'm gonna get 250 characters.
[02:02:06.240 --> 02:02:09.800]   I wrote three thousand words or something, 3500 words.
[02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:10.960]   - Nice, where is it posted?
[02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:12.120]   - It's like a decade of predictions.
[02:02:12.120 --> 02:02:12.960]   You know, everyone's doing their 10 years.
[02:02:12.960 --> 02:02:14.280]   - Oh, I like that.
[02:02:14.280 --> 02:02:18.960]   - So I wrote it, and then I literally cut half of it out
[02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:20.760]   because it was at like seven or eight thousand words.
[02:02:20.760 --> 02:02:21.680]   I was like, "I guess that's too much."
[02:02:21.680 --> 02:02:23.000]   I was like, "You know, you get a long break
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:24.360]   "and you have some time and you start writing
[02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:25.840]   "and before you know it, it's really long."
[02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:28.600]   And so now it's down to 3500 that I was like,
[02:02:28.600 --> 02:02:29.840]   "Okay, I'm just gonna do that."
[02:02:29.840 --> 02:02:32.040]   So it's up on Medium.
[02:02:32.040 --> 02:02:33.880]   You can find the link on Twitter
[02:02:33.880 --> 02:02:36.640]   and it's crazy ideas 'cause I'm crazy.
[02:02:36.640 --> 02:02:37.720]   - You ever wanna get cured of that?
[02:02:37.720 --> 02:02:40.400]   Just say I'll write a book, sign a contract to write a book.
[02:02:40.400 --> 02:02:42.040]   You'll never wanna write again.
[02:02:42.040 --> 02:02:42.880]   (laughing)
[02:02:42.880 --> 02:02:43.720]   Just fix you.
[02:02:43.720 --> 02:02:45.560]   - I've been to write a book.
[02:02:45.560 --> 02:02:46.400]   So I decided I'm just gonna,
[02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:49.080]   so what I have decided is I'm gonna try to write one art,
[02:02:49.080 --> 02:02:50.800]   release one article starting this week.
[02:02:50.800 --> 02:02:51.640]   It was supposed to last week.
[02:02:51.640 --> 02:02:52.480]   - Nice, that's a good couple.
[02:02:52.480 --> 02:02:53.320]   - One article a week.
[02:02:53.320 --> 02:02:54.160]   - I like that.
[02:02:54.160 --> 02:02:55.920]   - And it's mostly because I wanna write a book
[02:02:55.920 --> 02:02:57.480]   but I'm like, I gotta get--
[02:02:57.480 --> 02:02:58.320]   - Yeah, you gotta get a new groove.
[02:02:58.320 --> 02:02:59.360]   - You're gonna be a little bit of your belt first.
[02:02:59.360 --> 02:03:00.200]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[02:03:00.200 --> 02:03:02.240]   - And get into the groove.
[02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:04.240]   - Anyway, so there it is.
[02:03:04.240 --> 02:03:06.000]   I just released it before the show.
[02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:07.240]   - Nice, thank you Alex.
[02:03:07.240 --> 02:03:08.720]   I can't wait to read it.
[02:03:08.720 --> 02:03:12.520]   - And Inako is at WGBH Boston Public Radio.
[02:03:12.520 --> 02:03:15.120]   When is your next big appearance?
[02:03:15.120 --> 02:03:16.400]   - I was just on yesterday,
[02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:18.240]   mostly talking about Facebook,
[02:03:18.240 --> 02:03:20.040]   trying to recognize that it's radio
[02:03:20.040 --> 02:03:21.600]   so I can't use appropriate words
[02:03:21.600 --> 02:03:23.680]   for talking about the latest news in Facebook.
[02:03:23.680 --> 02:03:24.760]   But I'm gonna be on,
[02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:28.000]   so you can watch, you can stream that at WGBHNews.org.
[02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:29.560]   And I'll be on again on Monday,
[02:03:29.560 --> 02:03:32.920]   likely talking mostly about Apple and the FBI.
[02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:34.120]   - Nice.
[02:03:34.120 --> 02:03:38.440]   Mr. Renee Ritchie, of course we know where we'll find you.
[02:03:38.440 --> 02:03:42.280]   imore.com/vector, anything else you're working on?
[02:03:42.280 --> 02:03:44.320]   Everybody should read the article
[02:03:44.320 --> 02:03:46.000]   you just posted about the FBI.
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:49.040]   I think that's really important, that video.
[02:03:49.040 --> 02:03:51.960]   - Yeah, I just put up some iPhone 14,
[02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:53.840]   sorry, iOS 14 wish list stuff.
[02:03:53.840 --> 02:03:57.280]   And I'm working, a lot of people ask how I do my videos
[02:03:57.280 --> 02:03:59.720]   and while I'm no, by no means an expert on them,
[02:03:59.720 --> 02:04:02.160]   I have been doing a lot of raw and color grading
[02:04:02.160 --> 02:04:03.680]   and things in Final Cut Pro,
[02:04:03.680 --> 02:04:06.760]   which apparently is not the way most normal people do it.
[02:04:06.760 --> 02:04:09.240]   They, a lot of people use DaVinci Resolve
[02:04:09.240 --> 02:04:11.280]   or something like that, but I prefer the interface
[02:04:11.280 --> 02:04:12.120]   for Final Cut.
[02:04:12.120 --> 02:04:13.320]   So I figured out a way to do the,
[02:04:13.320 --> 02:04:15.280]   almost exactly the same thing all in Final Cut.
[02:04:15.280 --> 02:04:17.360]   So I'm gonna do a tutorial on that.
[02:04:17.360 --> 02:04:19.760]   - Nobody ever said you were normal, Renee.
[02:04:19.760 --> 02:04:21.880]   - No, I was boring.
[02:04:21.880 --> 02:04:22.720]   - All right.
[02:04:22.720 --> 02:04:23.640]   - All right. - Exactly.
[02:04:23.640 --> 02:04:25.160]   Welcome to the freak world.
[02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:27.440]   - Come on, we do this. - We have jackets.
[02:04:27.440 --> 02:04:29.640]   - We do this show every Tuesday,
[02:04:29.640 --> 02:04:30.880]   right after iOS today,
[02:04:30.880 --> 02:04:33.200]   making the all-apple day,
[02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:35.160]   iOS day starts about 9.30 in the morning.
[02:04:35.160 --> 02:04:38.520]   We get to this show around 11.11.30 in the morning.
[02:04:38.520 --> 02:04:39.840]   That's Pacific time, of course.
[02:04:39.840 --> 02:04:43.960]   That would be 2 p.m. Eastern time, it would be 1800 UTC.
[02:04:43.960 --> 02:04:46.280]   You can listen and watch live at our live stream,
[02:04:46.280 --> 02:04:50.720]   twit.tv/live or download on demand copies of the show
[02:04:50.720 --> 02:04:52.840]   of all of our shows from our website, twit.tv.

[02:04:56.680 --> 02:04:58.120]   where Mac Break Weekly lives,
[02:04:58.120 --> 02:04:59.960]   but playing other places as well.
[02:04:59.960 --> 02:05:01.360]   In fact, the best thing that I would suggest
[02:05:01.360 --> 02:05:05.200]   is just to get a podcast application and subscribe.
[02:05:05.200 --> 02:05:07.240]   That way you'll get it automatically, the instant.
[02:05:07.240 --> 02:05:08.080]   It's available.
[02:05:08.080 --> 02:05:11.360]   We're on every podcast application existent,
[02:05:11.360 --> 02:05:15.920]   including Spotify and overcast and shout cast
[02:05:15.920 --> 02:05:18.520]   and pocket cast and all other casts.
[02:05:18.520 --> 02:05:19.840]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[02:05:19.840 --> 02:05:21.640]   Time to get back to work 'cause you know what?
[02:05:21.640 --> 02:05:22.480]   Break time?
[02:05:23.320 --> 02:05:24.400]   It's over.
[02:05:24.400 --> 02:05:25.240]   See you next time.
[02:05:25.240 --> 02:05:26.080]   Good one.
[02:05:26.080 --> 02:05:28.660]   (upbeat music)
[02:05:28.660 --> 02:05:33.660]   (upbeat music)
[02:05:33.660 --> 02:05:36.240]   (upbeat music)
[02:05:36.240 --> 02:05:38.820]   (upbeat music)
