[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540]   (crowd chanting)
[00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.340]   Well, Merry Christmas!
[00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.140]   Happy New Year, happy Gwanza, happy Fesiveness,
[00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.040]   happy Winter Solstice, happy, happy, happy.
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.120]   You can tell I've been having a cup of cheer myself.
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.260]   It is time, all right, stop saying that, there you go.
[00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.980]   (laughs)
[00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.980]   It is time for an annual tradition,
[00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.140]   our Mac Break Weekly Best of from 2022.
[00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.540]   Actually, we don't do that one every year,
[00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:29.700]   but this is the first time we've done that,
[00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.880]   but we have been doing, I don't know,
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.620]   maybe 10 years, we've been doing best ofs.
[00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:34.900]   We gave the team a little time off,
[00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.580]   we put together some of the funnest, bestest stories
[00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.140]   from the year gone by.
[00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.140]   Thank you for joining me, it's great to have you,
[00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.380]   and stay tuned, coming up, Mac Break Weekly Best of.

[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.760]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.880]   Hello everybody, Ho Ho Ho, it's time
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.680]   for our annual Best of Show.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.240]   Mike is Sergeant with the help of all of you,
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.520]   our viewers, and some strange people
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.880]   we've never met before, have come up with a list
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.240]   of some of the best segments from 2022.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.120]   So we're all off just relaxing,
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.600]   and our post Christmas haze, our stupor.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.840]   Mm, we didn't want to leave you high and dry,
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.560]   so we prepared a wonderful melange of events.
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.760]   Now this is going to be basically in chronological order,
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.120]   and I guess nothing happened in January and February.
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.160]   We're going to jump right to March,
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.640]   but that was a very big day.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.640]   March 8th, Apple announced some very interesting products.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.240]   I can't believe it was this year
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.120]   that the Mac Studio came out watch.
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.960]   (rooster crowing)
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.880]   I think so far so good, 429, iPhone SE,
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.360]   Friday night baseball.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.040]   Then they get to the iPad Air.
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.800]   These are things we expected.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.920]   It's got 5G in it, it's got an M1 processor in it.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.320]   Now that's interesting, not an A15,
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.560]   but an M1, that's the same, and Renee would tell you,
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.960]   it's the same, but what I thought was intriguing,
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.040]   I'm curious what you think,
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.600]   is this is really starting to verge on the iPad Pro.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.600]   Same design, same processor, 8-core M1,
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.720]   it's got USB-C, they have a smart keyboard for it,
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.320]   starts at 599, so it's a great price.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.560]   How do we make the distinction,
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.960]   or maybe we're going to see a Pro leap forward?
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.640]   What's going to happen here?
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.800]   I don't know why you buy the Pro now.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.240]   - Yeah, I mean, I've been looking at the specs
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.040]   just to make sure that I'm clear on things.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.080]   The biggest difference is that you don't get Thunderbolt
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.080]   on the air that Thunderbolt's now only on the iPad Pro,
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.040]   and it's a very, very tight comparison
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.040]   between the 10.9 inch Pro and the 11 inch Air,
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.560]   because even if external displays are still not a problem,
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.800]   because you can still connect DisplayPort through USB-C
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.640]   on the iPad Air, you lose higher capacity storage,
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.920]   you lose one camera, I think,
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.000]   but in terms of someone who wants a cheap,
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.400]   excuse me, a mid-range iPad laptop
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.440]   that doesn't necessarily want a 12.9 inch display,
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.800]   it really is the difference between
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.840]   how do you define yourself as a Pro,
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.120]   and if you can, this is dissuade yourself
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.600]   of needing Thunderbolt or 512 gigs of storage,
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.480]   it seems to slow you want to save that money
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.320]   and get the magic keyboard instead.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.840]   - It's a similar display, but not exactly the same
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.520]   as on the Pro, it's P3, True Tone.
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.240]   - A little bit less price.
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.400]   - But it's not like micro LED, excuse me,
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.560]   but it's not mini LED.
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.440]   - It's not as though the Pro is mini LED,
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.920]   so you're not getting the other reason
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.080]   for going through the 12.9 when I bought mine was that
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.240]   I want that better display.
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.560]   So there's still, you're not necessarily kicking yourself
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.280]   that hard for getting a Pro 12.9 if you wanted the M1 chip.
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.000]   - It does have the front facing 12 megapixel camera now,
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.720]   everything has that centering, you know,
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.200]   center stage where it moves around with you,
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.520]   even the new monitor is that,
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.560]   which is, I thought was kind of interesting.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.520]   So yeah, I mean, you're going to have to really look
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.280]   if you want to get an iPad Pro at why you're spending
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.360]   the extra money.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.040]   - Yeah, yeah, I mean, there's a huge cost difference
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.120]   between 500 nits and I think it's 1600 nits
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.520]   on the other, you know, the display.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.240]   So they are definitely saving some money there
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.920]   as far as that goes, but I think that,
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.720]   I think that it's a very usable Mac.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.360]   I mean, if I was a school again,
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.160]   again, March tends to be a kind of a nod
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.640]   towards last purchases that schools might do.
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.400]   It's not a bad iPad to use.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.880]   If you're thinking about iPads, if you're thinking
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:54.720]   in that direction.
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.200]   - Actually, honestly, this could even be a college.
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.000]   I put laptop in quotes, but this is very capable system.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.840]   - Very solid.
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:03.680]   - Yeah.
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.040]   - And then it works fast.
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.920]   - Yeah, they were explicit in saying
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.320]   the faster than the fastest competitive Windows tablet
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.080]   up to two times faster than the fastest Windows laptop
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.720]   in its price range.
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.960]   So yeah, if that's what they're going for.
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.880]   - It also is a flex on Apple Silicon.
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.400]   Now M1 everywhere, right?
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.280]   It's, and so this is what's really gonna be interesting
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:28.280]   is just consistent improvement in processors.
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.400]   - Well, consistent and very leaps and bounds.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.400]   - Leaps and bounds.
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.240]   - Yeah.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.080]   - With everything, they're just,
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.560]   they're starting to really flex, you know?
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.080]   And again, we saw this when the M1 came out,
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.040]   like when they announced that they were gonna go,
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.080]   they were gonna have a new chip.
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.440]   A lot of us were like, we should buy a bunch of Intel machines
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.280]   right before they screwed this up for the next year or two.
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.400]   And the first M1 came out and nobody I know,
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.200]   everyone's like, no more Intel.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.360]   Like we're not gonna buy any more of this
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.800]   'cause you could just see what was gonna happen.
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.600]   It was like when the M1 came out, it was like,
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.920]   if that's version one, this is gonna get really interesting.
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.960]   And then as we keep on seeing the level of performance change
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.280]   between updates, and it's only been a year and a half, right?
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.640]   Since the first time we saw an M1,
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.160]   it's gonna be a really hard pace to keep up with
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.400]   because again, because it's all integrated,
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.920]   because they're not working with outside, you know, folks,
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:21.800]   you know, they don't have to figure out
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.200]   how to get this chip to talk to that chip,
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.280]   but they don't have to deal with buses,
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.000]   they can design whatever they want.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.080]   Really changes the playing field a lot.
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.120]   - It's just damn exciting.
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.560]   That's what I, it's all I can say.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.880]   We haven't even gotten to the display yet.
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:36.960]   We'll get to the display in a second,
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.080]   but I do wanna talk about GPU's 'cause,
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.720]   you know, they spent a lot of time talking about
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:46.720]   how great these GPUs are compared even to the radiance
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.000]   that they put in the top of the line Mac Pros.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.800]   Notice there was no Nvidia mention at all.
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:57.200]   And Alex, you know, I always go to you to ask you about this
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.640]   because you're the pro user, you're the high end user,
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:00.880]   you understand what pros want.
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.040]   And of course, you had 150 people in office hours
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.000]   watching this together.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:05.840]   What was the reaction?
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.440]   What is the feeling about the GPUs?
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.720]   - People are pretty excited.
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:10.960]   - Yeah. - To say at least.
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.280]   You know, I think that, so that not everything is the GPU.
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.960]   A lot of it is the processing, the number of processors
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.640]   and how they handle it and how they,
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.200]   whether they can do it in parallel and so on and so forth.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:25.800]   But on the other side of that, RAM is a big deal.
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.760]   And here's why RAM is a big deal.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.720]   It's because it means you can hold larger texture maps
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.600]   and you can hold larger models in the RAM
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.920]   while you're processing.
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:39.320]   So by having more memory available to the GPU,
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.200]   it means that you have much, much larger texture maps.
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.360]   That means that everything looks higher resolution
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.840]   than it did before.
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.880]   So it may not, again, it may not be able to process
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:49.960]   as fast sometimes.
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.440]   So that might affect handle effects and so on and so forth.
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.440]   But the amount of raw amount of resources.
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.760]   So I can have 4K texture maps instead of 2K texture maps
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.920]   or 8K texture maps instead of 4K.
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:03.920]   You know, those kinds of things,
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.600]   I can start throwing much, much larger imagery
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.880]   and much, much larger models.
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.160]   It also means I can do things like oversampling.
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.280]   So oversampling is I know you need a 4K image,
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.800]   but I'm gonna render a 16K image
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.640]   and then I'm gonna bring it back down to four.
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.120]   And what that does is it handles all the little aliasing,
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.720]   all the little jagged edges along the edge of the model.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.840]   And so those are the kind of things
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.080]   that you can do when you have a lot of RAM.
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.640]   - 128 gigs on the Ultra.
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:32.480]   - Boom.
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.440]   - I don't think this, I mean, that's only the very highest
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.960]   and GPUs would have anything near that kind of.
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.640]   - I've never seen a GPU with that much RAM.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:40.480]   - No, okay.
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.840]   - I think it's 48, I think 48 is the most I've ever seen.
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.480]   But it's different, again, this is a different architecture
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.720]   because you now have rarely do both the GPU
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.680]   and the CPU need all that RAM at one time.
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:53.280]   It's usually, it's oftentimes left kind of latent.
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.320]   So being able to share the shared memory architecture
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:00.120]   is incredibly important in this process.
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.880]   - 800 gigabytes per second memory bandwidth,
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.720]   is that a good number?
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.560]   - It's fast.
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.640]   (laughing)
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.120]   - I don't know, I actually,
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.440]   I don't have a reference point for that.
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.280]   It's really hard.
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.600]   - It's really hard.
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.680]   - I don't know what the,
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:13.880]   I don't know what my current one is.
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:14.720]   I don't know what those ones are.
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:15.960]   That's not a number I know.
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:16.800]   - Yeah.
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.400]   60 up to 64 core GPU.
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.220]   - That's a lot.
[00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:22.640]   - But no, they're not CUDA cores.
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.200]   You don't get ray hardware ray tracing.
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.960]   There are people who need that kind of stuff, right?
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.360]   And you don't get a real engine.
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.200]   (laughing)
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.160]   - Like not, not really many,
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.160]   like the ray tracing thing is cool,
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.600]   but it's not like, you know, I did,
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.920]   anyway, I did the whole idea of this.
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.160]   - I did a big shiny ship.
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.440]   I did a big shiny ship for a space film
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.280]   without ray tracing.
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.120]   - Without ray tracing.
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.120]   - So I got a look at like,
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.440]   (laughing)
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.280]   - But that was a long time ago.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.400]   - It looks great, but what's more interesting is when,
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.280]   when they start saying we can handle global illumination
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.120]   or physically based rendering in real time
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:53.960]   or something like that,
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.040]   now you have my attention.
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:58.720]   Ray tracing is hard and I'm glad that they're able to do it,
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.920]   but it's the global illumination stuff
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.760]   that is gonna require a lot of RAM.
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:04.600]   - Right.
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:05.440]   - To figure out.
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.280]   - Right.
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.440]   And you can do ray tracing in software.
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.920]   And in fact, somebody's saying,
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:12.280]   dwindle saying his blender cycle rendered
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.480]   as a pretty good job on the M1 Max,
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.080]   but it's still faster on my 2080 Ti maybe,
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.280]   but now let's see what the ultra.
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.120]   - And it'll be interesting.
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.320]   I'm less worried about real time and more,
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.400]   'cause you can get,
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.400]   there's not many games or even anything real time
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.760]   that really takes advantage of most of this hardware.
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.040]   What I'm really interested in is to see
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.680]   how the cinema 4D, you know,
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.400]   do this, how does motion handle this?
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.360]   How does, you know, those types of things,
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.960]   you know, handle the processors there.
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:37.800]   - Yeah.
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:42.200]   - Yeah, it's sad to say,
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:46.360]   but it's the case that Mac is not a gaming platform.
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:51.000]   And yeah, I mean, it's a nice footnote to talk about,
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.880]   but the thing is anybody who wants casual gamers
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.600]   have their needs well covered by other Apple products.
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.880]   People who are very, very serious gamers,
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.240]   who are gonna be bemoan the fact that,
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.880]   ooh, 60 Hertz, that's a terrible limit.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.480]   They're not gonna be interested in Macs to begin with
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.920]   for reasons that go beyond having an M1
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.720]   and Mo and Ultra processor in there.
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.560]   So I don't think that's a big deal.
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:14.840]   I think that what they're,
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.200]   I'm just saying,
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.920]   I think that the needs for the studio were
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:25.520]   that really huge, rich vein of customers
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:28.840]   between entry level, basic productivity, Macs,
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:33.840]   and super, super graphic chunking, number chunking Mac pros.
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.040]   We're talking about like the people who are creating
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.880]   videos on YouTube, make,
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.360]   who have their own studio,
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.680]   look producing digital videos who need that kind of power,
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.760]   but don't necessarily need to spend,
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.560]   need the kind of power they need to spend $6,000 for it.
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:48.960]   And I think that this is where they've,
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.280]   they've aimed these two processors
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.600]   and these versions of the studio.
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:54.440]   - And there's an,
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.840]   Apple could become a big player in real time games
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.840]   because I think there's a real blind spot
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:00.760]   in the gaming community,
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:04.680]   which is they don't really have a broadcastable solution.
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:07.800]   They have a solution that gamers like to watch
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.960]   and they can fill the stadium once every once in a while
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:10.800]   with the gamers,
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.440]   but they're not really hitting the mark
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:16.800]   on building a truly broadcastable game.
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.560]   And until someone does that, Apple could,
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.040]   step into that market pretty hard.
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:25.200]   And that's an integrated game that scales to
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.080]   all the way down to your iPhone and Apple TV
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.800]   and all the way up to a Mac Pro
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.280]   and broadcasts and is able to broadcast
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.080]   and then you throw a $10 million pot into it
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.240]   for the winner.
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.160]   Things get real interesting real quick.
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.440]   You know, like, you know, and that's the,
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.280]   so Apple could,
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.280]   - I'd love to see that. - I'd love to see that.
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.360]   If they got it. - Yeah.
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.600]   - But they have to backfill all the hardware first.
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.800]   So I think that this could be something they did
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:48.680]   in a year or two after they have all of the stuff rolled out.
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.160]   - I think that we're looking at,
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.520]   I think they gave us a very clear map today
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.760]   of where their interests are and that kind of content.
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:59.240]   - They, we did gloss over the Apple TV plus section
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.080]   'cause it was meant to be. - 'Cause we were yawning.
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:01.920]   - Over.
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.800]   - Well, also, we're, because, but also one thing
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.000]   that really, really struck me was that they didn't just.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.360]   - They missed it, but I was close to this.
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.200]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.520]   But the, well, if your eyes were open
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:15.160]   and you were taking notes like I was,
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.040]   like we were used to seeing,
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.000]   oh, look how popular Ted Lasso is,
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.600]   Ted Lasso, Ted Lasso, Ted Lasso,
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.200]   whatever the lowest, latest it is.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.480]   They really, really, I was, I was prepared to simply,
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.760]   oh great, that I, in this section,
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.640]   I've got this montage of what they're doing
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:31.040]   with Apple TV content.
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.920]   I get to spend the next, I didn't think that I'd have time
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:36.600]   to move this streaming window to this other display.
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.520]   Now I have time to, don't have to take notes,
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.440]   but man, they really did a good job
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:43.000]   of cutting together a montage of content that shows,
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.280]   this is not just, hey, look, we hired some people
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:48.600]   who used to be on Friends to do like an Andy's,
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.120]   to do a Sorkin style TV drama.
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.400]   It's like, no, they said, here's the children's program.
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.240]   Here are the people we hired away from Pixar.
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.640]   Here are super, super high named actors
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:14:59.960]   that we have in serious dramas.
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.120]   Here are comedies that we're doing.
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.680]   Here are, they really are flexing the idea
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.120]   that they're creating themselves as a real studio.
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:09.240]   And it demonstrates that if they wanted to be,
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.840]   I think that if they wanted to be a game studio like that,
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.120]   they certainly could be doing that,
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:16.520]   but they apparently, I don't think that they want to.
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.280]   They're putting their money exactly where they want to go.
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:22.080]   And as far as graphs performance,
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:25.080]   I think that they're also saying that we are,
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:27.480]   we feel that it's most important to,
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:30.080]   we want to make sure the content creators with our desktops
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.960]   have the tools they need to create the content
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:34.840]   that's going to be targeted at our devices.
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.480]   But I think that the future of the company
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:39.120]   is more leaning towards making sure
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.880]   that your handheld device has enough power
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.040]   to run this content, your wearable,
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:47.680]   future wearable device has enough CPU power
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:48.760]   to run this sort of stuff.
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:51.600]   I think that they made a lot of their intentions known
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.400]   just below the surface of most of the announcements
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.400]   they made today.
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:55.560]   (air whooshing)
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:57.520]   And the new iPad Air.
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:00.680]   We're still waiting for an updated
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:03.920]   M2 versions of some of these things,
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.400]   but I think we'll be getting them soon.
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:10.320]   We'll come back, we have more in a little bit.
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.160]   Stay here.
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:12.160]   (air whooshing)
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.640]   I hope you're enjoying our best of
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.360]   for this holiday season.
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.960]   Happy holidays, everybody.
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:20.960]   A little interruption for one of our favorite sponsors
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.120]   from the year 2022.
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.520]   They're going to be back again.
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:26.560]   In 2023, I'm talking about Melissa.
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.360]   Melissa is the leading provider
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:33.280]   of Global Data Quality Identity Verification,
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.200]   Address Management Solutions.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.360]   They've announced the availability
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:39.920]   of their brand new 2023 Melissa Solutions Catalog.
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:42.600]   Yeah, they've got so many wonderful things they can do.
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.400]   They've got a whole catalog of them for you.
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:49.120]   Melissa's Solutions Catalog features data quality,
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:52.360]   enrichment and identity verification solutions
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:55.080]   that power your business's compliance,
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:58.080]   your fraud protection, your sales, your customer engagement,
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.320]   your analytics.
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:03.160]   Quality data in your business is absolutely key.
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:06.320]   Melissa's created this catalog to help you
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:09.000]   as an industry resource for database administrators
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.040]   and developers alike, a catalog that highlights the tools
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.360]   that clean, verify, update, dedupe,

[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:18.840]   Of course, as always with Melissa,
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:21.120]   their capabilities can be implemented at any point
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:23.120]   in the data chain, they're designed to ensure
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.680]   all of your global people data,
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:29.200]   addresses, names, phones, emails are validated,
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.200]   updated and standardized.
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:34.000]   Deployments are flexible, available on-prem
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   or as a web service.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.400]   They've got a secure FTP set you can upload to
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.560]   and download from.
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:40.080]   They have SAS delivery options
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.640]   and of course the best API in the business.
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:45.480]   Melissa continues to impress.
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.600]   They have been recognized once again by Gartner
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:52.040]   in the 2022 Magic Quadrant for Data Quality Solutions.
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:54.800]   Ray Melissa was, yes, he's a real person.
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.120]   President and founder Melissa as a matter of fact,
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.800]   had this to say, we believe Melissa's recognition
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:02.440]   in the Magic Quadrant for Data Quality Solutions
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:04.960]   for the third year running highlights
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.880]   are razor sharp focus on helping our customers
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.680]   make the most of their customer data.
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.040]   We've made extensive advancements in the area
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:15.040]   of artificial intelligence, machine learning
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:18.360]   and metadata processing and added knowledge graphs,
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:21.280]   drag and drop, no code, low code functionality
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:24.120]   and data quality automation for our product stack.
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.880]   The result is a comprehensive tool set
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:29.680]   for data quality, address verification,
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.400]   identity verification.
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.720]   With Melissa's tools and services,
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:37.280]   businesses are empowered to meet complex regulations,
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:39.960]   streamline on boarding, combat fraud
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:44.240]   and really realize the true value of customer data
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:45.520]   as a business asset.
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:48.120]   Thank you, Ray.

[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.760]   in global intelligence solutions

[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.640]   for more compelling customer views.
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:00.800]   Melissa continually undergoes independent security audits.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:04.400]   They treat your data like the gold that it is.
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.480]   They've got to reinforce their commitment
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:09.560]   to data security, privacy and compliance requirements.
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:13.240]   Their SOC2, their HIPAA, their GDPR compliant,
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:16.880]   your data is in the absolute best possible hands.

[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.120]   They really are the best.
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.840]   We loved working with them in 2022.
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:34.760]   We look forward to a wonderful 2023 together.
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:36.960]   You need Melissa, if you've got customer data,
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:41.600]   you'd need Melissa, Melissa.com/twit.
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.240]   Now, back to the show.
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:48.200]   Now, I think we should move on to talk about the air tags.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.840]   Air tags did not come out in 2022,
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:55.840]   but a lot of concern about air tags in terms of privacy.
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.640]   Watch.
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.520]   Kashmir Hill writing in the New York Times,
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:03.560]   I used Apple's air tags, tiles and a GPS tracker
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.760]   to watch my husband's every move.
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:09.000]   I mean, at least to her credit,
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.720]   like she did, this wasn't like a hit job on air tags.
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.600]   She took a bunch of different trackers
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:15.760]   and then put her husband,
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.000]   her freedom loving husband through the ringer.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.240]   Yeah, I mean, the subhead really tells you
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.440]   what this is all about.
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:25.160]   A vast location tracking network is being built around us
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.120]   so we don't lose our keys.
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:31.280]   One couple's adventures in the consumer tech surveillance
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:35.640]   state and Apple has made some changes in response to,
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:39.680]   you know, the fears about stalking with the air tags.
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:42.560]   This came out February 10th from Apple,
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:45.440]   an update on air tag and unwanted tracking.
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:47.280]   They're taking this seriously.
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:49.920]   Apple, you know, blah, blah, blah.
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.160]   We become aware that individuals can receive unwanted
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.400]   tracking alerts from benign reasons,
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.880]   such as borrowing someone's keys than air tag attached.
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.520]   Or when traveling in a car with a family member's air pods
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:05.520]   in left inside, we've seen reports of bad actors
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:10.120]   attempting to misuse air tag for malicious or criminal reasons.
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.040]   We've been working closely with various safety groups
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.960]   and law enforcement through our own evaluations
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.120]   and these discussions.
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:17.680]   We've identified even more ways we can update air tags,
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:21.160]   safety warnings and help guard against further unwanted tracking.
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.600]   I got a guy get Apple credit because as we've pointed out
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.960]   in the show, there are inexpensive GPS devices
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.880]   that do a far better job.
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.760]   You know, in the article.
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.080]   Yeah, in the article, I mean, the article.
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.880]   Yeah, it was very clear by the end of the article
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:36.680]   that it was that Apple was not the best one to use
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:39.120]   for what you really want to snoop on your spouse.
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.760]   Well, we used the airline scene.
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:42.920]   We used those for our trucks.
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:44.960]   We used to use using for our trucks.
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.080]   And it was useful.
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:52.080]   So Apple is providing a paired account details
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:55.520]   in response to a subpoena or a valid request
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:56.840]   from law enforcement.
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:00.120]   So beware criminals.
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:05.120]   Apple knows who owns those air tags because each is unique.
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:08.000]   In fact, we have successfully partnered with them
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.240]   on cases where information we provided has been used
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:12.640]   to trace an air tag back to the perpetrator
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:15.160]   who was then apprehended and charged.
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:18.880]   Apple's going to protect your privately private.
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:23.200]   Yeah, well, enforcement has shared their appreciation.
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.200]   So just yeah.
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.040]   But here's some things.
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:28.200]   There'll be new privacy warnings during air tags set up
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.960]   just so you understand better.
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:31.960]   I think this is a good idea.
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:35.360]   Exactly how this works.
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.920]   Still doesn't help somebody who doesn't have an air tag
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:40.320]   or more importantly has an Android device.
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.320]   Addressing alert issues.
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:45.160]   I think that's supposed to warn the potential abuser
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.280]   that they're going to be tracked.
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:47.120]   I think that's the--
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:50.320]   The air tag is designed, it says, to be detected by victims
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.080]   and that law enforcement can request
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.240]   identifying information about you.
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.880]   So that's the point of that.
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.360]   Addressing alert issues for air pods.
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.480]   We've heard from users who've reported receiving
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.720]   an unknown accessory detected alert.
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.720]   We've confirmed this alert will not display
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:06.160]   if an air tag is detected near you.
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:10.040]   Only AirPods, third generation AirPods Pro AirPods Max
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:12.800]   or third party Find My Network accessory.
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:17.880]   So instead of saying unknown accessory,
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.720]   they're going to say we'll be updating the alert
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:23.760]   so that it indicates AirPods have been traveling with you.
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.400]   That's actually-- yes, thank you.
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:27.400]   Yeah.
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:31.400]   And it's also updating its unwanted tracking support article
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:35.000]   on apple.com to better communicate the safety features.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.240]   And then they're thinking about some additional updates
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.560]   they want to introduce later in the year,
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:46.560]   including precision finding that will help you,
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:50.200]   if you have an iPhone 11, 12 or 13,
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:53.000]   see the distance and direction to an unknown air tag
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   when it's in the range.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.080]   So you'll be able to track it down.
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:58.320]   But it makes it easier to find it as opposed
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.800]   just getting a warning that, hey, it's time for you
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:03.440]   to tear apart your entire car or tear apart everything
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.640]   within a 20 foot radius or to find you.
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:08.920]   And that's the-- I mean, the ultra wide band
[00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:12.040]   is capable of a pretty accurate position.
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:16.040]   So you should only have a box of about 10 centimeters
[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.360]   that you have to worry about.
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:19.920]   As an iPhone user moves, precision finding fuses input
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:23.440]   from the camera, AR kit, accelerometer and gyroscope
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:26.080]   to guide them to the air tag through a combination of sound,
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:27.800]   haptics and visual feedback.
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.160]   I want that just for finding my keys.
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:31.200]   People are really upset about this part because like,
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.240]   well, there's a whole group of people
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:33.760]   who just want to be Batman and Batman and Batman.
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.640]   And I'm discounting those because people get injured
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.840]   in secondary locations all the time.
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:39.080]   Don't ever hunt down.
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.520]   These are not meant for you to be superhero
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:41.760]   and hunt down your own stuff.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.320]   But also people are now worried because like,
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:46.000]   this is a very, very difficult needle to thread
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.400]   because Apple designed them to find lost items.
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.720]   They did not design them to stalk people
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:52.800]   and they did not design them for you to be Batman
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.240]   or Spider-Man or whatever.
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.240]   But there are people now who worry that if they leave it
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.960]   in their camera bag or leave it in their wallet,
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:00.160]   previously the person like the whole network
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.240]   wouldn't know where your wallet or your camera was,
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:03.680]   you would just know that it was there
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:04.760]   and you could go get it.
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.920]   And now it's like, oh, they're precision finding my wallet
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:09.040]   and oh, they're precision finding my camera bag.
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:10.600]   But Apple's making a conscious choice.
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.360]   Potential abuse is more harmful than the potential,
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:14.480]   something you already lost.
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:17.120]   And now you can at least have a chance of recovering it.
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:21.120]   Did you watch, did anybody watch Apple's first Friday night
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.160]   baseball last Friday?
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.000]   - Did we, did we?
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.560]   - Yeah, yeah, we did.
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:26.400]   - What'd you think?
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.960]   - The announcing was really bad.
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:29.800]   - Awful.
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:30.800]   - You know, it was just awful.
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.280]   And I thought we talked about this.
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.480]   Was that two weeks ago or was it,
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:34.320]   do we talk about this?
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.160]   - No, it was last, it was a real talk.
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.680]   - We talked about it on our show.
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:37.520]   - Maybe.
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:40.240]   - Yeah, so yeah, so the, I think that the announcing was,
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:42.000]   it was just like people weren't, it was like talk,
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.640]   listening to someone who didn't really care about the game.
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.040]   I think that was the issue.
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:45.960]   It was just lots of chatter.
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:47.240]   It was like going with your friends
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:48.240]   that aren't really into the game
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.960]   and having them talk amongst themselves
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.640]   and sometimes interact with the game and sometimes not.
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:55.080]   And so I think that I only watched about 20 minutes of it
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:55.920]   that's about all I could take.
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:59.040]   And so I think that it was, I mean, you know,
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.640]   you get started and you're experimenting.
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.160]   And you know, I think that they're trying to match
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.560]   certain targets and so on and so forth.
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:05.560]   And so they're trying to figure that out,
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:06.760]   but it was not a good thing.
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:07.840]   And I did like that.
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.880]   I thought, there's a lot of complaints about the graphics.
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:10.720]   I thought the graphics weren't,
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:11.560]   I liked the graphics.
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:12.400]   - I liked it.
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:13.240]   So they're doing a very simple,
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:15.880]   and by the way, if you have Apple TV plus,
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:17.560]   you can watch, you could still watch the games
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.520]   and they also have a lot of extra highlights
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.240]   and features during the week.
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:22.960]   But you could still watch, at least when I,
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.320]   'cause I missed the game live, but I watched it later.
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:29.480]   Apple's very much changing the style of presentation.
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:32.200]   They've got, I think, very simple clean graphics.
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:35.320]   What I didn't like, Alex, was they kept playing
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:38.520]   cheesy stock background music
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:40.760]   every time they pulled a graphic up.
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:42.120]   Like, that's not-
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:42.960]   - You mean that?
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:44.520]   - What the hell is that all about?
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:48.160]   - I see that a lot with millennials and younger,
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:51.840]   where I maybe, we used to call it the MTV generation,
[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:53.080]   obviously, it's not that anymore,
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:56.760]   but it's like, we don't trust your attention span.
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.920]   So if we're showing a graphic,
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:01.120]   we're just gonna play some music so you feel good,
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:03.200]   because we just don't trust that you're gonna be,
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.840]   you know, you're gonna change the channel,
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:06.000]   or I don't understand it.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.920]   And everything, it's YouTube, maybe it's a YouTube generation.
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:09.840]   Everything does it now.
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:12.200]   There's lots of background music behind stuff,
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:13.640]   and I'm not a big fan of that.
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:16.040]   And really, the baseball, the background music,
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:18.600]   is the roar of the crowd, the guy saying,
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:20.280]   "Bae, here!"
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:23.160]   You know, the crack of the bat, the smell of the pine tar,
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.000]   that's-
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.200]   - And I think that there's,
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.520]   I think there's such an opportunity
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:29.680]   for multiple streams of audio.
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.400]   We were talking about this on Office Hours.
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:32.560]   - We did talk about that.
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:34.440]   We were talking last week about what they were talking about.
[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:35.280]   - Yeah, they were talking about the possibility.
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:36.120]   - Yeah.
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:36.960]   - So I'd love to see them,
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:37.840]   but I'd love to see them get aggressive
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:40.720]   about making it customizable, at least through the audio.
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:45.520]   And I will tell you, I've had the opportunity to watch
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:48.120]   some games where I'm listening to the comms
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:50.040]   and watching the multi-view of the,
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:52.800]   you know, that the trucks using.
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:55.120]   And I could watch that all,
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:56.920]   like it's entirely different experience.
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:58.200]   - Yeah, really be, really transparent.
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.360]   - And I pay money for that,
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:00.640]   'cause you can just listen to it,
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:01.800]   you can just listen to them talk.
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.320]   - Apple's idea of a big experiment
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:05.200]   was having a woman do the play-by-play,
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.800]   which to my knowledge has not yet been done
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.480]   in Major League Baseball.
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:13.040]   It's definitely a sexist man's sport.
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:16.640]   So they had, a color was done by a former player
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:19.880]   who wasn't really, nobody was very confident yet.
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:21.280]   And that's okay, you kind of expect that.
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:24.640]   Although you also expect them to do a lot of rehearsals.
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:27.840]   They should have been doing all summer doing play-by-play.
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:32.200]   - I mean, when a pro goes for most like major networks,
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.760]   my understanding is when a pro goes from being a football
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:36.440]   player to being an announcer,
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:39.160]   there's six to 18 months of them getting trained.
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:40.000]   - Right.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.760]   - It's a hard, it's not like they just come out of it
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:43.600]   and start talking about it.
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:47.000]   - And it's even harder for the play-by-play folk,
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.360]   I'm gonna say folk, even though they're guys.
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:51.840]   I know, I have good friends who do play-by-play,
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.680]   and I have good friends who are coming up and play-by-play.
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:57.200]   Most of them end up going to Syracuse,
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.240]   'cause they have a very good school
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:00.800]   where you can learn play-by-play.
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:03.880]   And then you do the same thing the ball players do.
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:07.200]   You go to single-A ball, you go to double-A ball.
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.360]   My friend who's the son of Hank Greenwall,
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:12.840]   Hank Greenwall was a Giants announcer for decades.
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:14.440]   His son wanted to get into this,
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:17.200]   went to Syracuse just like Hank did,
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.360]   and has been working his way up.
[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:20.080]   And at the same time, he's doing play-by-play
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:22.760]   in the single-A ball, he's selling the ads,
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:27.120]   he's sweeping out the, I mean, it is a grueling years process,
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:28.640]   and he still hasn't made it to the majors,
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:29.960]   it's been more than 10 years.
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:31.840]   So it takes time.
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:33.680]   - We see this all the time when we're doing live streams
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:36.200]   with corporations and they want their seat level people
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:39.320]   to do the show or a marketing person to the show,
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:41.600]   and I'm like, why don't we get an announcer?
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:44.520]   I think that we could, let's call Solidado Brian.
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:45.360]   - Yeah.
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:47.880]   - Let's call legal, let's call somebody that we can have
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.160]   that has done a thousand of these,
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:51.960]   because it takes a thousand of these to get good at it.
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:55.440]   And it's just a, 'cause you have to move the understanding
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.240]   of what you're doing from your frontal lobe
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:59.840]   to your lower brain, and that just takes time
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:01.520]   so that things are just coming out of your mouth
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:04.080]   while you're watching, and it just is the proper thing.
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:05.920]   And it's really hard.
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.720]   - I think they underestimated it.
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:09.720]   - I think the big disappointment here is that,
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:11.920]   why, gosh, if you're doing this through an app
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:15.640]   where you can do anything you want as a content creator,
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.360]   why are you just simply trying to replicate the TV experience?
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:21.200]   Are you saying that the way that sports is being broadcast
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:24.720]   on television is the opinion it can possibly be improved upon?
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:27.200]   And I think we talked about this before a couple of weeks ago
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.200]   where I would love it if they simply said,
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:32.520]   we're gonna have four different commentary tracks,
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:33.600]   depending on what you want.
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:38.600]   We will get a long time, whoever has the radio experience
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:44.040]   in that local market will get the home team,
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:46.400]   whoever has radio experience in the opposing team's market
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:47.760]   will get another feed.
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:52.400]   We will have a minimal talk sort of thing
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.720]   where someone just says, and that says two balls,
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.120]   two balls, two strikes.
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:31:00.600]   And now it's Ferguson coming in to replace the left-hander
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:05.600]   because it's like the number of times where I have,
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:09.680]   I'm watching a lot of women's college softball on YouTube
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:11.840]   because I came, give the algorithm recommended
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:14.360]   like a random like a broadcast.
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:17.360]   And I just love it, not only because the level of athleticism
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:18.680]   and the level of play is so high,
[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:20.600]   but also because it's not these,
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:22.000]   they're not trying to razzle dazzle.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.880]   This is like a college, like a TV station.
[00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:28.320]   And they just like give you the information you need.
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:30.080]   They give it to you in a way that's pleasant,
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:32.000]   but it's not like there's no like,
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.880]   and now let's have some wagging guitars wagging,
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:37.760]   get it, angle again, get it, as the pictures change.
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:40.440]   It's like no, you can hear people shouting the background.
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.080]   That's fine, give me silence.
[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:43.680]   Let me have my experience.
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:46.080]   - We did a test with golf where it was for VR
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:49.160]   and you could just watch the clean aperture,
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:50.920]   nothing on the screen.
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:53.120]   And you could turn the announcer on and off
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:55.280]   where you just listen to the crowd and everything else.
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:57.160]   And then it put the scoreboard on the other side.
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.720]   So you look over and see the scoreboard,
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:00.800]   you know, see what the leaderboard looked like.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:03.160]   - That's apparently what they did at the Masters.
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.320]   - It wasn't so great.
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:06.440]   - In our chat room, user 8827 said,
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:08.880]   the Masters live stream was great this year.
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:10.600]   You could turn off the commentary.
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:12.400]   It was just the sounds of the golf course,
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:14.480]   the birds, the winds, the crowds,
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:16.080]   and the sound of the swing.
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:17.640]   - Their app was actually pretty interesting.
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:20.080]   So the Masters had an app out that was running
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:23.080]   during it yesterday, two days ago.
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:26.080]   And they let you look at groups of holes as well.
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:27.200]   So you didn't, you could just go,
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.080]   I just wanna watch where this is.
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:30.240]   Now I didn't see any place where,
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:34.240]   you know, you could also go back and look at the last time
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:37.400]   a Tiger Woods or whatever was swinging.
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.480]   You could just follow along and look at all of their,
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:40.880]   all of their hits.
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:42.360]   So it was really interesting, you know,
[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:43.200]   to put that together.
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.600]   They had a little bit of a, you know,
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:45.440]   they were playing it safe.
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:48.600]   So they did this thing where they had 10 second segments,
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:51.760]   which means that you can pick delay every time
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:54.400]   you change feeds, but outside of that,
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.920]   it was a pretty interesting approach to a sport.
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:59.200]   And I think golf in general has been doing,
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:02.360]   because there's so much time to do other things.
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:05.320]   It is, I think it's innovated a lot RNA
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:09.920]   that does the open in the UK has been doing like live streams
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:13.120]   to everyone at the location for over a decade.
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:17.880]   - Now I will say the video is great to watch it in 4K.
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:19.960]   And I mean, that was really nice.
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:23.280]   So maybe the, you know, the announcers are new.
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:24.920]   I don't know where they came from.
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:28.000]   Maybe it's going to just take a little time
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.280]   for them to settle in.
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:33.240]   I also have to say I'm often just very dissatisfied
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:36.120]   with play by play announcers and major league baseball
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:37.200]   and NFL.
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:39.240]   Some of these people are terrible.
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:41.360]   I guess it's like getting a good quarterback
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:42.760]   or a great pitcher.
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:44.040]   There are few and four between.
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:46.000]   And when you're the VIN skullies of the word,
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.280]   world does don't come along all the time.
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:50.400]   - Yeah, I mean, you really have silence.
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:54.280]   - Yes, there's a rhythm to pay play by play.
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:57.240]   - Well, I think that there's a lot of, I mean,
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:00.560]   I know that for me when I watch a football game,
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:02.440]   there are certain people that I'll watch
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:04.000]   just because they're calling the show.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.960]   Like I watch a steal a game, obviously.
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:08.800]   And I'll put up with whatever shows up as an announcer.
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:12.080]   But if I see, on a Sunday, if I feel like watching a game,
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:13.640]   I just look where Tony wrote "Romo's".
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:16.040]   - "Romo's Great" or Chris Collins was.
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:18.720]   - I'm not a fan of Collins' words.
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:19.720]   - Oh, I like him.
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:20.560]   It took me a while.
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:21.400]   - Yeah.
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:22.240]   - I didn't like him at birth.
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:23.080]   - No, I'm on Michaels.
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:25.360]   - The problem is that they're these greats.
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:27.360]   And maybe we're just used to him.
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:29.360]   You know, so maybe that's all it is, is what works.
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:30.200]   - One of them gets his role.
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:31.080]   I think those are two different roles
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:32.400]   'cause now Michael is really calling it.
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:34.000]   - He's played by Chris Collins' worth his color.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.680]   So he's, so he, you know, it's a different approach to it.
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:40.560]   But I love the Tony "Romo" gets so excited.
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:41.720]   And then he calls him.
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:43.240]   - Well, he knows what he's talking about too,
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:45.040]   which he really helps.
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.480]   - Yeah, you're fresh out of the system.
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:49.440]   And I mean, that's what John Madden kind of,
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:50.280]   - That's right.
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:51.880]   - Pioneer, he was great too.
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:55.440]   Although I know people, my wife, who hated him.
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:58.920]   So again, it's a very personal thing.
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:01.880]   The reaction as one would expect from fans
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:04.520]   and from sports talk was pretty negative.
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:07.160]   But you know, some of it's 'cause they,
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:09.600]   because one of the games had a female play-by-play announcer
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:10.920]   and that's very uncommon.
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:14.560]   You know, I think that, I think I was watching,
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:17.280]   I don't know if you've seen the new Adam McKay
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:20.640]   show on HBO winning time about the LA Lakers of the,
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.840]   '80s, but Chick Hearns in there,
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:25.800]   of course, the great LA Laker play-by-play guy.
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:28.120]   And he's kind of a jerk.
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:34.200]   And when, you know, he gets a partner who's gonna,
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:37.480]   well, I won't, it's no spoilers.
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:39.200]   I won't tell you what happens to the partner eventually.
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.800]   But he says, okay, see this hand?
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:43.520]   When it's a fist, you stop talking.
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:45.120]   The partner's doing the color.
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:48.280]   You stop talking and he goes all the time
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:50.600]   right in the middle of the, you stop talking.
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:52.840]   But Chick Hearn was a legend.
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:54.760]   There's a legend, but he doesn't come off
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:55.880]   very well on that show.
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:58.840]   I think, I liked Madden a lot.
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:00.240]   I really liked Madden a lot.
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:02.440]   Anyway, Apple, you know, I don't know
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:04.240]   where they would go to get somebody better.
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:06.800]   I mean, everybody, you know, is taken.
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:09.400]   I don't know if there aren't any free agents.
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:11.120]   Again, I think that they just have to work out, you know,
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:13.320]   and look at what their value proposition is.
[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:15.240]   We did some parallel streams.
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:16.960]   We've done the second year experiences
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:18.760]   where we bring people in.
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:19.600]   It's just different format.
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:20.800]   Like we don't even try to call the show.
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.320]   We just let you, it's like sitting around
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:23.600]   with a bunch of pros that are,
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:24.960]   people who used to play the game,
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:26.720]   all sitting around talking to each other about the game
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:27.720]   is really fun.
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:29.440]   And that's just one of the audio tracks.
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:31.880]   You know, it can just be, like you could literally take
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:35.480]   the two teams and just put the players from both sides,
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:37.720]   sitting in there and just talking about the game.
[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:40.600]   And there's a lot of people, I would listen to that
[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:43.600]   because these are people who actually were on the ground
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:46.720]   at that level talking about like what they're noticing
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:48.160]   or oh, that guy is always this way
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:49.920]   or look at what he's doing with his leg.
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:50.840]   You know, I would never do that.
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:52.840]   You know, he can't pick up your leg when you're swinging.
[00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:54.960]   You know, like, you know, and they're just, you know,
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:57.080]   going back and forth and you get true like real,
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:59.200]   no, I don't know true, but you get the feeling
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:00.040]   of inside baseball.
[00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:00.960]   - Yeah. - You can get a really.
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:01.800]   - Yeah.
[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:04.520]   - Yeah.
[00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:05.600]   - It's a hard thing to do.
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:08.000]   I'm not, you know, I would never attempt it.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:08.840]   - Yeah.
[00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:10.880]   I was just gonna say just the commentators
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:12.680]   who know the relationship between the catcher
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:14.360]   and the umpire who says,
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:18.360]   "Well, who know what the catcher is doing
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:20.920]   to that specific umpire to make the strike zone
[00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:22.000]   a little bit bigger?"
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.520]   That's the sort of stuff that gets,
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.760]   makes you a huge fan of a commentator
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:26.960]   as opposed to just the game.
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:28.360]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:30.120]   - I felt like these guys were reading.
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:32.720]   You always, one of the things, you know,
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:35.520]   I've watched, I've spent a lot of time in play by play booths.
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:37.640]   You have statisticians, you have helpers,
[00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:39.240]   especially in broadcast television.
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:42.120]   You have lots of people who are giving you cards
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:44.040]   and with stats on them.
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:45.280]   - And you could tell the announcers
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:47.040]   that they were just getting fed the lines.
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:49.120]   They were just reading the lines the whole time.
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:50.640]   That's fine, but yeah.
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:52.880]   - I think again, this is the first time
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.040]   they're gonna do it every week for one hour.
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:54.880]   - I'll get better.
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:57.000]   - So they're, you know, I'll judge them more.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.240]   Like I might come back in 12 weeks and see like,
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:00.920]   okay, now where are they, they do anything.
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:01.760]   - Yeah.
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:02.840]   - And even the first season may be hard.
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:04.360]   I mean, the whole first season,
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:06.640]   it's really hard to change gears in the middle.
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:07.800]   So it may be one of those things
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:08.800]   like they're gonna learn a lot
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:10.280]   and then next year will look a lot different.
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:11.120]   - Yeah.
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:14.480]   - And is it 4K?
[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:15.320]   I think it is.
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:16.160]   It sure looks like--
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:19.040]   - I think that it's actually sourced in 1080
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:19.880]   and it's getting scaled up.
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:20.720]   - Oh, the scale.
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:24.160]   - I don't think that it's actual 4K.
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:25.440]   I would be excited if it was.
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:27.360]   And I think that that's where Apple,
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:31.480]   you know, what this provides is a weekly platform
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:32.800]   for Apple to go to 4K,
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:34.560]   for Apple to go to high frame rate,
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:37.680]   for Apple to go to a 8K high frame rate, you know,
[00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:38.480]   like so you could, you know,
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:39.880]   Apple can play with all these things
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:42.360]   because all the TVs are all 120, right?
[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:44.280]   And so it's, you know,
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:46.320]   it's just a matter of releasing a new Apple TV
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:47.560]   that can do it. - Do it, yeah.
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:48.480]   - And then Apple could put out,
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.120]   so that we may be seeing them just experiment
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:51.480]   and then oh, by the way, here's a,
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:54.840]   'cause that would be really hard for,
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:55.680]   I mean, I can just,
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:57.640]   I've seen a lot of sports at 8K 120
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:59.480]   and I've seen baseball at 8K 120
[00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:02.120]   and I can tell you that once you see it,
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:03.560]   it's really hard to go back.
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:06.040]   Like it is like, 'cause it just looks like a window,
[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:07.560]   you know, like right in front of you
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:09.880]   and it is, it's amazing.
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:13.320]   And so like, I'm not proposing that films should be 20,
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:15.000]   they should be state 24.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.520]   But the, but live, live events at 8K 120s
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:20.200]   and now they have a platform to do it with
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:22.240]   and all they gotta do is put the cameras out there.
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:24.680]   - Yeah, it did crash too, by the way.
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:25.920]   In the middle of the day. - I didn't see that.
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:27.360]   I saw it on some people talk about it,
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:28.360]   I didn't see it either. - I didn't see it either.
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:29.200]   Yeah.
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:31.320]   'Cause I was watching the replay where it did not crash.
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:33.320]   So maybe a lot of people were watching.
[00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:35.200]   - I jumped on it live and I,
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:36.480]   as a person who does live,
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:38.440]   anytime someone does something for the first time,
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.760]   I kind of expected to crash.
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:41.440]   I expected like a long wait.
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:43.200]   And so when it popped right up and it was playing well,
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:44.640]   I was like, "You're a pretty good job.
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:45.800]   Those guys must know what they're doing."
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:46.640]   - Yeah.
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:47.920]   (laughs)
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:49.960]   Yeah, what a surprise.
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:53.560]   You know, I think on balance, you're exactly right.
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:55.520]   This is a great opportunity for Apple
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:57.400]   and to do something interesting.
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:58.880]   So it's worth it.
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:00.880]   And I'll be, I'll be watching it again every week.
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:02.600]   'Cause I think the picture quality,
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:04.160]   the graphics do make it fun.
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:06.080]   And you can always turn this out if you want.
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:07.720]   Or pull up the radio.
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:11.120]   If you want to play web play from the homers.
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:12.720]   - Promise, I think that with streaming,
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:14.520]   you would put so much buffer into it.
[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:17.520]   You would be hearing what happened like 30 seconds before.
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:18.360]   - Oh yeah.
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:19.200]   Oh yeah.
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:20.480]   In fact, I had that question on the radio show.
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:22.240]   How do I synchronize?
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:24.960]   And what I would used to do is I would pause my T-vote
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:28.680]   on the back crack and then wait till Toonan caught up.
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:30.000]   And then Chris played.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:30.840]   (laughs)
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:31.680]   - Right.
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:32.520]   And then you got them all sitting.
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:34.720]   - Because Toonan was really delayed as well.
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:35.640]   So it was actually,
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:38.880]   the video was actually behind the video on Toonan.
[00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:39.760]   That probably would,
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:41.200]   I don't know, I'll have to try it.
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:42.680]   - I'll let you know.
[00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:43.520]   - Funny.
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:44.360]   (laughs)
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:45.840]   I'll let you know.
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:47.600]   - Apple's Friday night baseball,
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:48.640]   I still can't watch it,
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:52.080]   has gotten no better through the year.
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:53.640]   Maybe next year, maybe next year.
[00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:55.840]   That's why they say in baseball too, ironically.
[00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:57.360]   Maybe next year.
[00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:02.360]   Now we go to a farewell to one of Apple's most successful
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:03.560]   products of all time.
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:05.400]   It's nice to see Renee Ritchie, isn't it?
[00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:08.000]   He had some good stories about the iPod.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:08.960]   (screams)
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:11.680]   On the other hand, if you were to invest your money
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:16.680]   into some mint in the box iPod touches right now,
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:20.520]   you might be pretty loaded.
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:22.200]   You might don't touch those Renee,
[00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:24.520]   don't even open them, don't unseal them.
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:26.600]   How many do you have?
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:29.160]   - I got two mint in the box iPod touches here.
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:30.840]   For some reason, I don't know why I never opened them.
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:32.440]   And then I've got like the opened versions.
[00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:34.920]   I have the open gold version too, but it's out of reach.
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:36.440]   - Wow, the man is flush.
[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:37.640]   - Very duplicative.
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:39.920]   - But this is the last iPod.
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:42.960]   And it is now official that after 21 years,
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:45.680]   it's the end of the line for iPod Apple.
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:47.320]   And I'll announce today that the iPod touch
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:50.720]   will be available while supplies last.
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:53.480]   - The music lives on Leo, the music lives on.
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:57.720]   - I guess they must have a few in the warehouse.
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:59.920]   - Yeah, that's such good marketing.
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:01.520]   It's like, no, no, we're not, we're not,
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:03.720]   we're not end of lifeing and discontinuing a product
[00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:07.120]   we're having, most people wondered why it was a surprise
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:09.320]   we're still on the price list anyway.
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:12.240]   We're, oh no, no, this is a limited edition opportunity
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:16.120]   to be in on the end of a term of legend.
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:17.040]   - They should have made it.
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:18.040]   - They should have made it at least.
[00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:19.280]   - People are fighting for home,
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:20.600]   like for the original HomePods now.
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:22.400]   Like they're harder and harder to get.
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:23.640]   And people are like, just give them to us.
[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:24.480]   Give them to us.
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:25.720]   They're fighting over them like they're tickling me elmo dolls
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:26.560]   or something.
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:28.920]   - So music is always, this is great.
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:31.880]   Jaws, we act Jaws now, a senior vice president
[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:33.920]   of World Wide Marketing, he took Schiller's role.
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:35.600]   Music has always been part of our core at Apple,
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:37.320]   bringing it to hundreds of millions of users
[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:40.680]   in the way iPod did impact more than just the music industry.
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:43.000]   This is actually, sounds like hyperbole,
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.080]   but I think it's fair.
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:46.840]   It also redefined how music is discovered,
[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:48.720]   listened to and shared today.
[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:51.440]   The spirit of iPod lives on.
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:52.280]   I don't know if that's true.
[00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:55.160]   We've integrated an incredible music experience
[00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:57.160]   across all of our products.
[00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:58.960]   My phone to the Apple Watch to HomePod many
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:01.080]   and across Mac, iPad, Apple TV.
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:04.320]   So, bye bye.
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:07.360]   It was introduced October 23rd, 2001.
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:10.020]   I vividly remember that day.
[00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:15.320]   Went through a lot of iterations, the shuffle,
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:16.760]   remember the shuffle?
[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:18.400]   Remember the chewing gum.
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:19.240]   - Buttonless shuffle.
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:20.640]   - The buttonless shuffle.
[00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:23.600]   The iPod Touch was the last version.
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:24.920]   - Wide nano.
[00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:26.680]   (laughs)
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:27.640]   Remember this one?
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:30.560]   The little clip on for sports?
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:31.400]   Those were very cool design.
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:32.800]   - Yeah.
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:34.360]   What killed the iPod Touch?
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:36.360]   Was it just a...
[00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:37.960]   - It became a feature.
[00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:38.880]   - It's a feature.
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:41.400]   - iPod Touch.
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:42.440]   - I like the feature.
[00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:44.280]   - Was $279.
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:45.120]   $279.
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:49.560]   - What was it?
[00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:50.640]   - I don't remember what it got down to.
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:52.440]   It got down really low at a certain time.
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:53.280]   - Okay.
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:54.120]   - 'Cause it's basically an iPhone 5.
[00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:55.880]   Like that thing is ancient.
[00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:56.720]   - Yeah.
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:59.280]   - But it was a good choice for kids.
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:00.800]   - You didn't want to buy them an iPhone,
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:03.040]   but you wanted to give them something.
[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:06.680]   - Yeah, but it just became, like Renee said,
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:08.640]   just a real technological relic.
[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:11.080]   And even the standalone iPods,
[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:15.280]   they, for a long time, they had a really important niche,
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:17.360]   meaning that there are people who are outrunning,
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:18.400]   there are people who are exercising,
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:20.480]   who don't want like a $1,000 phone
[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:23.000]   or $500 phone filing out falling in their pocket
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.360]   to say nothing of all that weight,
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:26.320]   but this beautiful little clip design
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:29.560]   that would have either a really cheap iPod
[00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:33.360]   that could play all that digital rights managed iTunes content
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:34.320]   that they'd purchased,
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:37.520]   or even this poster stamp thing with a screen
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:40.520]   and a user interface that could have like Nike fitness apps on it,
[00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:42.560]   that was a hell of an object.
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:45.560]   It was a real moment for Apple design,
[00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:49.040]   because this is, I'm really intrigued
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:51.640]   by what Apple's design people can do
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:54.480]   when they're not constrained by form factors
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:57.560]   that are kind of dictated by conventions,
[00:44:57.560 --> 00:44:59.680]   where you can say, "Nope, all we really need
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:03.320]   "is a play and a pause button above that go nuts."
[00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:06.160]   But then of course, the solution to the,
[00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:08.520]   "Hey, I'm exercising and I want to be able to listen
[00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:12.520]   "to music," became Apple Watch plus AirPods.
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:14.320]   And so even that was a style of the market.
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:16.640]   They couldn't compete with all the super, super cheap stuff
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:18.920]   that was out there for people who actually wanted something
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:23.320]   that if it fell off their T-shirt while they're running,
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:25.640]   if I get a $20 thing from all the Express
[00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:27.840]   or from no name Amazon,
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:29.360]   because you won't care about it.
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:32.400]   Otherwise, yeah, you don't want to lose your Apple Watch.
[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:36.680]   - Yeah, right now they're selling the 32 gig iPod touch
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:38.160]   for 200 bucks.
[00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:39.000]   - Yeah.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.720]   - Yeah, 300 bucks for 128 gigs, $400.
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:46.760]   No wonder they're killing this product for 256 gigs.
[00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:48.800]   And you probably, you know, you have an iPhone
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:52.080]   that's got at least 32 gigs free floating around.
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:55.920]   I can't see even buying the 32 gig version of this for a kid.
[00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:56.920]   The kid would be insulted.
[00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:58.520]   - The developer camp was probably the last thing
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:45:59.880]   they used them for, it was to buy 30
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:01.360]   for a developer camp or something.
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:03.120]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:04.600]   - And also also the camera.
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:07.040]   - You want to talk about living in shame,
[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:12.040]   posting to Instagram with a iPhone 5 level camera on it.
[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:13.520]   - Yeah.
[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:14.360]   - Yeah.
[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:15.840]   - You gotta wonder why, the thing is,
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:18.080]   I always try to measure my complaints about things
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:20.280]   'cause you never know, it'd be easy to say,
[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:22.840]   oh gosh, I can't believe they still sell that,
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:26.120]   but there's probably a really, really esoteric reason
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:27.000]   why they were selling it,
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.640]   that there was some market somewhere that insisted that,
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:33.000]   hey, we need something to run iOS apps,
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.120]   but it can't be a phone, it can't have a cellular radio in it.
[00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:38.480]   And they kept it on the marks because--
[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:39.640]   - Because it had a gun.
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:40.640]   (laughing)
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:44.560]   - Well, you know what, Apple, Apple has a camera app.
[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:48.160]   Apple actually will sell a government, an actual iPhone,
[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:49.760]   with actual iPhone branding on it,
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:54.560]   that simply has a flat plane on the back of it
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:56.400]   instead of a cover with the iPhones on it.
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:47:00.160]   So again, given how much cost to just to do tooling
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:01.560]   on any new product,
[00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:04.960]   it's, so I wonder who it was who was buying just enough
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:07.840]   of these or what contract they had that required that,
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:09.200]   hey, if you're gonna operate in this market,
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:11.440]   you must also offer, amongst your product line,
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:13.360]   a product that does this, that said,
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:16.320]   you know what, it is just paying the fines would cost more
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:18.760]   than just keeping this one little tiny product
[00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:20.320]   on the assumption-- - Or they over ordered.
[00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:22.560]   They over ordered and took them too fast to clean them up.
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:23.560]   (laughing)
[00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:27.480]   - Apple announced and probably to little applause
[00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:31.520]   some life-changing things.
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:33.560]   This iPadOS is one of them.
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:35.000]   The other one is Passkey.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.520]   So Steve gets us talked about Passkey.
[00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:42.040]   This is something, an initiative from Google Microsoft,
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:45.720]   and now very much Apple to eliminate passwords.
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:47.800]   And I think that in a few years,
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:50.040]   you're gonna look back on passwords and say,
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:51.040]   (laughing)
[00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:53.000]   that was a, I think a lot of us have been trying to get past it
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.440]   and past the Passkey and I think, or past the password.
[00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:59.640]   And I think that was probably the most important announcement.
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:01.120]   - Huge. - Yesterday.
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:02.720]   - Huge. - Was the fact that we're gonna get
[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:04.520]   to a point where we're building into the infrastructure
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:08.680]   that, and I think it's gonna be transform transformational
[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:11.840]   to the whole world because as people start to get out of that
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:13.560]   and start, and because it's being supported
[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:15.160]   by a lot of other people,
[00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:16.960]   it could potentially be a really big deal.
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:20.160]   - Well, and it doubles down on the biometrics that Apple
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:21.800]   is now basically putting everywhere.
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:23.440]   And I expect to see biometric keyboards
[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:25.200]   for the desktops as well,
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:29.760]   because now using biometrics, Face ID or Touch ID,
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:33.000]   you can have an absolutely fishing proof log in
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.120]   to apps and websites.
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:36.400]   And you don't need a password.
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:38.280]   You don't need a password manager.
[00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:39.920]   That's gonna be very, very big.
[00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:41.640]   - The thing that is really important though
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:43.400]   is that Apple is pairing that up
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:45.520]   with other privacy initiatives,
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:48.840]   because the real thing now is that we will know who you are
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:50.840]   and we have to protect what that means.
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:51.680]   - That's right.
[00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:52.520]   - In a bigger, in a bigger,
[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:55.680]   because we will absolutely know that you're on that computer
[00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:57.200]   and it's you interacting,
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:58.560]   and that's gonna be a,
[00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:00.560]   that's a tricky problem,
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:02.400]   is that people have been able to say,
[00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:04.040]   "Well, I don't know if that was me or not.
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:05.600]   You won't be able to say that anymore."
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:08.360]   - That may be good.
[00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:10.080]   - No, no, I think it's great.
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:11.760]   - That might be a big improvement.
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:13.000]   You've been the one arguing.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.240]   - I need to eliminate anonymity online.
[00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:17.280]   - Yeah, I think that it's great.
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:19.120]   It's gonna change the way we interact with people,
[00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:21.080]   but there are people that are put in danger
[00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:22.600]   that need to be able to be.
[00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:24.960]   So we just have to kind of weigh that out.
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:28.280]   And I think that the company that is probably the most ahead
[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:30.000]   of that is Apple thinking about
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:34.080]   how are we gonna keep us private, even but authenticated?
[00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:36.120]   - Well, I think that's also why they announced,
[00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:39.200]   what was it, Safe Kid or what are they?
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:40.680]   - Oh, personal safety.
[00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:41.800]   - Safety check.
[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:43.000]   - Safety check.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.440]   And I saw a number of women,
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:45.800]   quite a few women on Twitter saying,
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:49.160]   "This is, you don't even understand how important this is.
[00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:52.520]   This is huge for domestic violence victims,
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:54.880]   for partners of crazy people,
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:58.440]   for people who want to separate their identity.
[00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:00.760]   And I think it maybe goes hand in hand with Paskey.
[00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:02.440]   In other words, if you're gonna have Paskey,
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:04.200]   you need safety check.
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:06.720]   Apple pays attention to this stuff, God bless them.
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:09.160]   And of course they learned their lesson with their tags.
[00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:11.800]   And I think that also heightened their awareness.
[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:13.120]   You know?
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:16.520]   But I have to say, this is a sad moment on the show
[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:18.480]   because we are gonna take a little blow
[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:21.200]   to the quality of the show
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:23.880]   because our dear friend Renee Ritchie,
[00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:25.480]   this is his last pick of the week
[00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:29.080]   and his last visit on a regular basis.
[00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:31.160]   And I do, I think we wanna keep the door open
[00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:34.560]   that you might come back from time to time on break weekly.
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:36.600]   - Yes, I would love that.
[00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:40.920]   - And details on what's going on for Renee to follow.
[00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:42.720]   - To follow, yes, I can't say anything yet.
[00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:46.160]   - Yeah, but Renee, you have been,
[00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:48.520]   when did you start on Mac break weekly?
[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:51.960]   - Oh gosh, 2011, 2012, I'm not sure.
[00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:54.680]   - It feels like you've always been here.
[00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:56.640]   - 'Cause I've been always watching.
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:57.840]   That's why I feel like I have no follow.
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:50:59.560]   - I mean, no, I mean, and without,
[00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:01.800]   you are our debunker in chief.
[00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:06.480]   You are the guy who has the inside knowledge,
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:08.200]   your honesty, your integrity,
[00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:10.600]   the quality of your content.
[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:14.640]   And just the wonderful genial nature of your delivery
[00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:18.080]   makes you irreplaceable, totally irreplaceable.
[00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:19.080]   - You do.
[00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:19.920]   - I don't-- - Now I'm not crying,
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:20.760]   I have allergies.
[00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:21.760]   (laughing)
[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:24.920]   - It is a great loss to the show
[00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:27.680]   and I'm sorry to lose you.
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:30.160]   Let me just wanna go, I think I can do a search.
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:31.000]   - Oh, Mr. Terribly.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.200]   - Search for your name here, Renee Richie,
[00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:35.720]   and find out when you first--
[00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:37.080]   - Does the internet go back that long?
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:38.720]   (laughing)
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:42.200]   - I think though that what we do is when we say appearances--
[00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:43.480]   - You're the player to pay those--
[00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:47.440]   - Few appearances, I think we can sort them chronologically.
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:50.160]   I'm thinking, so that's the most recent.
[00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:53.560]   Let's go to 35 pages of appearances.
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:54.400]   - Oh, wow.
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:55.520]   (laughing)
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:58.040]   - And there's quite a few shows for appearance.
[00:51:58.040 --> 00:51:59.320]   Say again?
[00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:04.320]   2013, although I see you on the show here June 6th, 2012,
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:07.720]   June 26th, 2012.
[00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:11.160]   So interestingly, it's been almost exactly 10 years
[00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:14.640]   since your first appearance on the show.
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:16.760]   - I see it feels like a minute, Leo.
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:18.120]   Like, time really does fly.
[00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:22.520]   - It's a fast decade and I am just so sad to be losing you,
[00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:24.640]   but I'm sure it will be a happy occasion
[00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:27.120]   when we find out where you're going
[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:30.280]   unless it's like you're moving to Ecuador to raise llamas.
[00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:32.920]   - No, no, Ecuadorian, you can't even know.
[00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:35.160]   No, I can't think of climate.
[00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:36.720]   - Okay, I hope that's not the case.
[00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:39.720]   - He's gonna be vacationing in Patagonia,
[00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:41.560]   like the Dread Pirate Robics.
[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:43.240]   - We are gonna--
[00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:46.080]   - You see, he's new Minchi Quo.
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:46.920]   (laughing)
[00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:48.680]   - They're considering getting into,
[00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:49.680]   going into Mac and Mac.
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:51.560]   - All his shows will be in Chinese from now on.
[00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:54.520]   - Suddenly we're gonna see pictures of birds nest.
[00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:56.120]   (laughing)
[00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:57.880]   - We don't know, it's a mystery.
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:52:59.640]   We do know who we're replacing him with,
[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:02.720]   but I'm gonna keep that mystery for next Tuesday
[00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:07.720]   when that person will join our panel.
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:08.760]   It is not an easy thing.
[00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:09.760]   - And the big old ones out, kids.
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:12.880]   - It is not an easy thing to do to replace Renee.
[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:15.000]   In fact, we're not attempting to replace Renee,
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.800]   but there is an empty seat,
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:18.680]   so we'll find somebody there.
[00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:19.720]   - Alex can see G.I.
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:21.200]   I mean, only even know that I'm gone.
[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:23.080]   I mean, he's got the technology for years already.
[00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:24.400]   - You're gonna see the two years deep.
[00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:26.080]   - I'm not even sure he shows up anymore.
[00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:27.160]   (laughing)
[00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:28.960]   - I haven't been here for five years.
[00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:31.000]   - Yeah, Alex hasn't been here in three years.
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.600]   - This is just an AI rendering.
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:34.600]   - I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:35.840]   - Things like when there's a new Doctor Who.
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:37.320]   - Yeah. (laughing)
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:38.480]   - I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:39.840]   - Not the same, you can't replace it.
[00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:42.680]   Someone will reinvent the character of person
[00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:45.640]   in the left-most seat and make it their own.
[00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:48.440]   - So, junior, can I ask you what's gonna happen
[00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:50.760]   to youtube.com/ReneeRitchie, is that?
[00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:52.800]   - It's continuing.
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:54.360]   I'm gonna keep the YouTube channel going.
[00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:58.320]   I was previously thinking of changing it a little bit.
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:00.080]   As you've heard me say before,
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:02.000]   I'm kind of burned out on the leaked culture
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:03.720]   and I've gotten burned out on the benchmark.
[00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:06.000]   Gotcha product release schedule.
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:07.600]   So, I was already thinking about changing it.
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:09.280]   I'm probably not gonna have the time to do
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:11.120]   four videos a week anymore.
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:13.280]   I'm definitely gonna try to at least do one video,
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:14.640]   maybe a live stream every week.
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:17.120]   And I wanna cover just bigger tech issues.
[00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:20.520]   I think that's gonna be my next big YouTube attempt.
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:21.360]   Same channel. - Which channel.
[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:22.600]   - Which channel. - Bigger stories.
[00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:25.320]   - And yeah, and you did say that we can
[00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:26.520]   from time to time bring you back.
[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:27.600]   And I hope that's the case.
[00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:28.720]   - Yes, I very much hope so.
[00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:29.680]   - Yes.
[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:32.160]   - 'Cause it's really gonna leave a hole in the show
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:33.440]   and in my heart. - Oh, thank you.
[00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:34.960]   - We're gonna miss you. - Same.
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:37.040]   - Thank you, Renee, for 10 years of--
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:39.480]   - Thank you so much. - Just excellent contributions
[00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:40.320]   to the channel.
[00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:43.720]   Now, we have a problem, Houston.
[00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:48.560]   There is this empty seat on the panel
[00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:50.400]   because Renee Ritchie, who is, by the way,
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:52.720]   in the Discord, if you wanna wish him luck,
[00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:56.280]   club to it members, has passed on.
[00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:59.800]   - No, no, he's moved to a higher plane.
[00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:01.360]   No, no, wait a minute, that's not right.
[00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:03.440]   - We're choking, he's only dead to us.
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:05.680]   (laughing)
[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:09.480]   We still don't know.
[00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:10.960]   And he says, what did he say?
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:12.840]   The release hasn't gone out yet.
[00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:15.640]   But as soon as release goes out,
[00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:17.560]   we'll tell you where he is now.
[00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:19.600]   Of course, he's still at youtube.com/Renee Ritchie,
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:21.680]   but we thought, well, who could we get
[00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:24.280]   with Renee's stature in the Apple community?
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:27.280]   He's inside knowledge of what's going on.
[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:31.600]   Funny, talented, gray-haired.
[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:32.440]   Who could we get?
[00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:36.440]   And I'm so thrilled to welcome Jason Snell as a regular.
[00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:37.280]   - Hello.
[00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:38.720]   - I've been trying to get you in this show
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:41.120]   for years, decades.
[00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:42.520]   Hello, Jason, welcome.
[00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:43.480]   - It's good to be here.
[00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:45.760]   It's an honor to succeed Renee.
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:50.280]   I mean, 10 years on a podcast is a pretty big thing to do.
[00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:52.920]   And we all, I know Renee going way back,
[00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:53.760]   we all love Renee.
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:57.320]   It was an honor to be asked to do this.
[00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:59.400]   - You have a lot of other things that you're doing.
[00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:01.120]   So I'm honored that you could make,
[00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:03.160]   frankly could make some time to be here
[00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:04.000]   a couple hours a week.
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:04.840]   So thank you.
[00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:05.680]   I really appreciate it.
[00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:06.520]   - Sure.
[00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:07.360]   And today I just happened to be in the neighborhood.
[00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:09.800]   I actually live not that far away from--
[00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:11.360]   - 15 minutes, 20.
[00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:12.440]   - That was about half an hour.
[00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:14.600]   - Half an hour away, wow.
[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:15.720]   - Yeah, quite a commute.
[00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:17.200]   I work out of my garage.
[00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:19.280]   So this was, it's like, oh, this is what a commute
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:20.120]   is like a little bit.
[00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:20.960]   - So nice to see you.
[00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:21.800]   - It's great to be here.
[00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:23.880]   Jason's been on our shows since, you know,
[00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:25.920]   practically the beginning of Twit.
[00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:27.880]   You have six colors.com.
[00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:30.560]   In fact, I think when you started with us on Twit,
[00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:31.480]   you were still at Mac World.
[00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:32.320]   - Oh yeah, for sure.
[00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:34.400]   In fact, I remember distinctly being
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:36.800]   on the first iteration of Mac break.
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:38.000]   - Yeah, the video version.
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:38.840]   - The day the video version.
[00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:39.680]   - Yeah, with Alex.
[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:40.720]   - In the old.
[00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:41.880]   - Well, and even before that,
[00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:44.320]   it was a regular call for help on tech TV.
[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:45.680]   That's where we met.
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:46.520]   - That's right.
[00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:47.560]   - So I've known you for 20 years.
[00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:50.720]   - Wow, that is, yeah, because I was an editor at Mac World
[00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:53.520]   and we were down, that was a long time ago
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:55.560]   'cause that we were down on Howard Street back then
[00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:57.200]   before we even moved to Second Street.
[00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:59.960]   So that was a long time ago, yeah.
[00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:02.000]   And of course we shared a Jerry Day
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:03.040]   who I went to kindergarten with
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:05.640]   was one of your producers back in the day.
[00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:08.320]   - Jerry now runs the film production
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:09.960]   for some small town in the--
[00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:11.880]   - Up in Twami County, I think.
[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:13.240]   - For Twami County.
[00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:15.880]   - Yeah, kind of a slow job.
[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:18.040]   But you know, when movies need to be made,
[00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:19.560]   somebody has to be there to make them.
[00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:21.360]   - Twami County is where we both grew up.
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:22.320]   It's a great way, I didn't know
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:23.320]   we were gonna be talking about this,
[00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:25.320]   but it doubles for the old West a lot.
[00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:28.920]   So a lot of film production up there.
[00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:31.800]   If you need to pretend that you're in the old West.
[00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:33.920]   - Well, I'm glad I have a Jerry Day expert on the panel.
[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:34.760]   - Yeah, it's good.
[00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:36.960]   I know that was the need to be just a shout out to Jerry.
[00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:37.960]   He's out there somewhere.
[00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:42.480]   - It is so, seriously, replacing Renee is tough
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:44.840]   because he has such great connections and such knowledge,
[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:47.160]   but we couldn't do any better.
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:48.960]   I don't think ever, I think getting Jason.
[00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:50.600]   - So of course you were good friends with Andy
[00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:51.840]   and Alex as well.
[00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:53.680]   - Yeah, I mean, I was like,
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:56.480]   I often usually take my afternoon walk
[00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:57.600]   like right after the show.
[00:57:57.600 --> 00:57:59.760]   And so I just found out about Renee leaving right after the show.
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:01.360]   So I'm taking my hour long walk.
[00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:02.560]   And unfortunately, as usual,
[00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:04.400]   your thoughts are inside your head,
[00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:05.760]   which is a bad, bad thing.
[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:07.200]   And I'm thinking, oh, geez, what a surprise.
[00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:08.040]   I was stupid at it.
[00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:09.640]   Thinking about how much I was gonna miss
[00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:12.360]   for having my nice two hour conversation
[00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:14.640]   with my really good friend, like Renee,
[00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:15.720]   'cause it's at least me,
[00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:16.840]   just like with all of you guys.
[00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:19.720]   I'm energized, it's like, it's very, very pleasant.
[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:21.320]   Like, geez, I'm gonna really miss that.
[00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:24.120]   Then when I find out that Jason is gonna be filling that slot,
[00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:26.600]   I mean, Jason and I have been friends for so long.
[00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:27.760]   He's probably sticking me saying it,
[00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:30.040]   but so long that he's the person who told me
[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:33.080]   how to both face things in HTML.
[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:34.840]   That's how long we've known each other.
[00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:37.760]   - As racket B, bracket.
[00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:40.600]   - I was a, my first job out of grad school
[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:43.160]   was at Mac user magazine where Andy was a columnist.
[00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:46.480]   And so I've known Andy since the mid 90s,
[00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:48.720]   basically, it's a long time now, long time.
[00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:49.560]   - Wow.
[00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:53.320]   - He survived, our friendship has survived him
[00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:55.320]   being my editor for a very long time.
[00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:59.120]   So that's, that is being like,
[00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:02.040]   that's like the sort of friendships you make in foxholes.
[00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:05.240]   - So the camera crew has come in to take the official
[00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:06.080]   still shots.
[00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:08.880]   So if you would put your right hand inside your,
[00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:09.800]   oh, you're wearing a T-shirt.
[00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:12.200]   - Yeah, I didn't know about the dresser.
[00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:13.040]   (laughing)
[00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:14.040]   - Just teasing, just teasing.
[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:15.400]   (screaming)
[00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:18.760]   Oh, daddy got into the triple sec.
[00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:20.400]   Sorry about that.
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:21.240]   Back to the,
[00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:24.640]   back to the show.
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:27.000]   Here, I'm not gonna need any more of this.
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:28.960]   You can have it.
[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:31.040]   Just keep it right there.
[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:33.760]   We are looking back at the year 2022.
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:38.200]   Lots of fun things happened during Mac break weekly.
[00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:41.880]   Of course, 2022 was the year the M2s emerged.
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:45.480]   And Jason Snell, it was the first, I think,
[00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:48.640]   to say how much he loved the M2 MacBook Air.
[00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:50.680]   Now we all have them.
[00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:52.040]   Here's his review.
[00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:53.040]   - Let's kick things off.
[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:55.200]   I have to say, I was very excited this morning.
[00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:59.280]   I woke up and I looked at my phone
[00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:02.320]   and there were two things I was looking for.
[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:05.880]   One was a notification from my doctor
[01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:08.000]   for the results of my COVID test
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.720]   to make sure that I didn't have it.
[01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:12.960]   And I was negative for COVID
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:14.880]   and the two variants of flu that they're testing for now.
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:16.280]   So yay, that was exciting.
[01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:17.720]   But what I wasn't expecting,
[01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:18.960]   but that I did get,
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:21.440]   was a notification from FedEx
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:24.760]   saying that a package from Apple was on its way.
[01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:28.800]   A package I wasn't expecting to get until mid August
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:31.080]   is now coming this coming Tuesday,
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:33.160]   not today, but this next Tuesday.
[01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:36.400]   And that is an M2 MacBook Air
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:39.280]   that I thought I was gonna have to wait a lot longer for.
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:42.240]   But some folks, Jason's no included,
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:44.400]   have an early look at the MacBook Air
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:45.280]   and have done a review.
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:50.160]   So tell us, Jason, what's your thoughts on the new M2 MacBook Air?
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:52.080]   - Micah, is this your card?
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:55.400]   - Oh my God, how did you guess?
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:57.560]   - I guess it was a M2 MacBook Air.
[01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:00.160]   It's here for some people, mostly based configurations,
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:02.200]   but yeah, it sounds like they're starting to ship
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:03.520]   to everybody else.
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:06.280]   I got mine a couple of weeks ago,
[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:07.720]   couldn't talk about it last week.
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:08.560]   Was not allowed.
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:11.400]   I didn't have it, but it's here now.
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:12.760]   I've been a big fan of the MacBook Air
[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:13.600]   since the early days.
[01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:15.560]   I actually had that first MacBook Air that was terrible,
[01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:18.120]   but I loved it because it was so small.
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:19.680]   And then fortunately they got rid of that
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:22.480]   and replaced it with the one that we all know and love in 2010.
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:24.840]   And it's been Apple's most popular laptop
[01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:26.240]   for basically the last decade.
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:29.840]   And this is a big redesign in the sense
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:31.480]   that it's really based on that design language
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:34.440]   from the 14 and 16 inch MacBook Pros
[01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:35.800]   that were introduced last year.
[01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:37.280]   So they've got the wedge shape is out,
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:38.960]   the little kind of curvy edges are out.
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:42.800]   And instead you've got this sort of flat,
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:44.320]   kind of like the curves right on the edges,
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:45.600]   but otherwise perfectly flat.
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:48.600]   It's got MagSafe, it's got two USB-C ports.
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:52.160]   And an M2 processor that we already know
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:54.320]   'cause it's the same one that was in that MacBook Pro
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:55.480]   that was released last month.
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:02:00.480]   And yeah, it's a new era for the MacBook Air.
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:01.960]   And I just wanna point out something
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:04.560]   which is that I gave the headline a new era
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:05.880]   and spelled it out.
[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:08.040]   I noticed that the Virgis story about it
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:09.920]   was also headlined a new era,
[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:13.880]   but they decided to say A-I-R-A
[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:17.440]   because they didn't trust their readers to get it.
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:18.280]   No.
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:19.600]   I trust my readers to get it.
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:22.400]   Thank you for not having contempt for your readers.
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:25.400]   So I have to say I was kind of surprised.
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:27.880]   So I got the midnight version
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:30.840]   and I got the one with eight core CPU, 10 core GPU,
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:34.560]   16 gigs of RAM and a terabyte of storage.
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:37.400]   So I thought, I'm gonna have to wait and that's fine.
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:39.480]   So I was just, I was shook and shocked
[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:43.320]   when I saw that it's supposed to be coming this next week.
[01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:46.800]   I know that lots of base configuration models
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:48.960]   were shipping on time or arriving on time,
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:52.440]   but have any of you seen any other folks talking about
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:54.880]   how theirs that was originally pushed further out
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:55.720]   or coming sooner?
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:58.400]   Or is this just kind of a fluke for me?
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:02.880]   I've heard that the 16 with a terabyte
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:04.720]   is actually like a secret.
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:06.200]   They seem to have built a bunch of those
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:08.440]   because I've heard a bunch of those
[01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:10.160]   getting in stock in Apple stores too.
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:11.960]   And that's the attempt for those of you
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:14.040]   who really are desperate to get your hand on this laptop
[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:16.660]   or maybe some other Apple product when it comes out.
[01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:20.760]   They reserve an amount of them and put them in stores
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:22.160]   that are not available.
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:24.760]   So you might think, well, it's back ordered for a month.
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:26.360]   So I'm not gonna be able to get my hands on it.
[01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:28.800]   I place that online order and now I wait.
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:31.520]   Well, you can cancel that online order if you need to
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:33.720]   because you should check with your local store
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:35.720]   or maybe go to your local store.
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:37.360]   They often have stock.
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:39.680]   And one of the things I've heard is that
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:44.040]   that one terabyte storage model with the 16 gigs of RAM
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:48.160]   is also something that has been cropping up in Apple stores.
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:49.080]   - Mm.
[01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:50.040]   - That is a good tip.
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:51.000]   That's a really good tip.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.400]   So tell us about. - Yeah, I've definitely picked up
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:56.200]   a couple things first thing in the morning.
[01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:59.200]   And also like you just get there right as it opens.
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:02.640]   And oftentimes they have three, four of them of many things
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:04.320]   that are oftentimes sold out.
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:05.720]   They kind of seed those out.
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:08.760]   It's also useful to be a, I've learned over time
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:11.360]   that back when I had a, we were buying lots and lots
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:13.760]   of computers that being a business user is useful.
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:17.680]   You should do it if you have a business sign up.
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:19.440]   Build a relationship.
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:21.400]   - Yeah, 'cause they have a business rep at the Apple store
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:23.800]   and they will talk to you and they will reserve things
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:24.800]   for you and help you.
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:25.640]   - Exactly.
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:28.160]   They'll be like, hey, tomorrow would be great
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:30.840]   if you came in and be great to visit here.
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:33.600]   - I've got a bag with my, from when I got the,
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:38.760]   my last MacBook Pro, well, when Twit got the last MacBook Pro,
[01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:41.240]   there's still a bag that I have that has my name
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:43.680]   on like a label on the side whenever I walked in
[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:47.520]   and they were like, oh, not only did they help me out
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:50.280]   but they were also like, we had your shows on today
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:51.760]   which was just a really kind of fun thing.
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:55.520]   But I'm curious, how did you approach Jason
[01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:57.960]   or how did you approach the review
[01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:00.360]   for this specific MacBook Air?
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:04.640]   And was it for you a comparison to that MacBook Pro
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:06.360]   that people seem to be kind of confused about
[01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:09.040]   that just came out or were you really looking at it
[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:11.640]   as an iteration on the MacBook Air itself
[01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:13.240]   or did you answer some of those questions like,
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:15.920]   should I get this or should I get the MacBook Pro?
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:18.480]   - I think the most important context is to compare it
[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:22.080]   to the MacBook Airs of old, not only the M1
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:25.960]   which is sort of the last of that other era
[01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:28.680]   but also of Intel MacBook Airs
[01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:31.480]   because the truth is most people updating to this computer
[01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:32.840]   are not coming from an M1 Air,
[01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:35.920]   they're coming from an Intel MacBook Air probably.
[01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:38.560]   And so I tried to think about that, I got this,
[01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:41.040]   I was actually on vacation when this came in which was weird
[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:43.760]   'cause Apple is very secretive about sending you review units
[01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:45.840]   and I had to be like, you need to send this to a condo
[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:49.320]   that is a Verbo in San Diego
[01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:51.840]   and I've never been there before but here's the address
[01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:53.760]   and it should work and it all worked fine
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:55.360]   but I ended up with two MacBook Airs,
[01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:58.280]   I ended up with my MacBook Air and this MacBook Air
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:01.240]   and it was kind of great 'cause I was on vacation
[01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:03.520]   and so I had a laptop in the condo
[01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:05.600]   and I was checking email and writing stuff
[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:08.560]   and I was doing whatever, not working
[01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:11.400]   because I was on vacation but I got to travel with it
[01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:13.480]   which I thought was actually, that's good, right?
[01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:15.640]   Like that's a part of the point of doing a laptop
[01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:19.040]   and then in my approach, yeah, I mean,
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:21.640]   the truth is what we learned about the M1 is true of the M2
[01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:24.200]   which is these chips are what they are
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:25.800]   and you can put them in different wrappers
[01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:27.680]   and the performance if you do benchmark testing
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:30.920]   is largely identical because, you know, an M1 Air
[01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:34.040]   and an M1 Mini and an M1 13-inch MacBook Pro
[01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:35.920]   and an M1 iMac, they're all the same,
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:38.120]   they all get the same scores more or less.
[01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:41.200]   So I tried to focus on the MacBook Air experience
[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:43.600]   and also think a little bit about coming from Intel,
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:46.480]   my wife has a 2018 Intel MacBook Air
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:49.120]   that is true probably won't have very much longer
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:53.400]   and it is startling how much, you forget
[01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:56.200]   if you've been living on an M1 MacBook Air for a while,
[01:06:56.200 --> 01:07:00.760]   how slow in comparison those Intel MacBook Airs were
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:03.520]   and that's just a function of the Apple Silicon transition
[01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:06.960]   more than anything else and yeah, the M2 is faster than M1,
[01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:09.440]   there's no doubt about it and the design is really nice
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:11.440]   and having MagSafe come back
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:13.880]   and not just because it's MagSafe and all the benefits
[01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:16.400]   of that but having that extra port now,
[01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:21.120]   my M1 Air has that little dealy that you stick
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:24.080]   into the USB-C port that gives it fake MagSafe
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:26.520]   and that's great but that means I have one port.
[01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:29.920]   So having two usable ports is also a big part of this
[01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:32.880]   but yeah, in the end for me it was mostly about
[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:35.280]   what's the MacBook Air experience like
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:38.240]   'cause I think that not only is it the most popular laptop
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:40.960]   but that's the context most people are considering
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:43.840]   when they're buying this thing or thinking about buying it.
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:44.680]   - Absolutely.
[01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:48.280]   - And I mean, that's kind of been one of the ongoing questions.
[01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:53.680]   I know Leo has talked a lot about how the sort of
[01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:57.200]   single core performance of all of the M1 series devices
[01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:01.840]   is very similar, the single core performance of these ones
[01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:03.520]   are likely to be very similar
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:05.400]   and it's only in multi-core performance things
[01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:07.880]   and so when you look at like the MacBook Air,
[01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:12.440]   which is this device that in theory is meant for
[01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:15.800]   browsing the web and doing some writing tasks
[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:19.320]   and that kind of thing, then we don't necessarily
[01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:22.440]   look at that performance boost as part of it
[01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:24.000]   which I think is part of the reason why
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.920]   it doesn't have that active cooling system, right?
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:29.560]   But at the same time I've seen folks talk about how
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:32.840]   they threw a bunch of tasks at it, opened up a bunch of tabs,
[01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:33.800]   tried to do these little things,
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:35.720]   they couldn't get it to slow down.
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:38.680]   And it's fascinating to me what Apple Silicon has done
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:43.560]   in terms of changing the way that folks are kind of looking
[01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:48.560]   at these devices and trying to turn them into these
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:52.160]   productivity machines to an extra extent.
[01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:54.800]   I'm so confused, or not confused, but rather,
[01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:58.960]   I'm so fascinated by how now they get a MacBook Air
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:00.880]   and they're trying to push it as hard as they can
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:03.600]   even though this device maybe in years before
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:04.880]   was not meant that way.
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:08.520]   I mean, do we feel like that is because of the
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:12.600]   performance gains we've got from Apple Silicon itself?
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:15.440]   Or is it just something that maybe I hadn't noticed before?
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:18.400]   - I think we want it. - I think we want it.
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:21.000]   It's the bar being raised over time, right?
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.400]   Like it used to be like, oh, well, we're processing.
[01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:25.720]   But as computers have advanced and in the power
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:28.200]   of Apple Silicon, that bar keeps getting raised.
[01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:30.920]   So now as a reviewer, I look at it and I say,
[01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:34.680]   oh, you know, you might not want to do 8K renders on this
[01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:36.720]   for an hour 'cause it'll slow down.
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:38.480]   It'll still do it, it'll just be a little bit slower.
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:40.800]   And it's like 8K renders, right?
[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:43.800]   Like the bar has been raised a lot over time.
[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:47.240]   And the truth is 99.9% of people who buy the MacBook Air
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:49.280]   will never get it to throttle even.
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:53.800]   It will maybe get a little warm maybe and that's about it.
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:58.320]   - I think that our expectations grow, it's like a bag.
[01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:00.360]   You know, our expectations will grow with,
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:02.040]   no matter how fast you make the process
[01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:04.480]   and we're gonna go, well, it's pretty good.
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:07.280]   You know, like it was, it could have done this better.
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:10.440]   It could have rendered 8K or I could have been able to render,
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:12.480]   you know, whatever those things are.
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:15.200]   But I will say that it's just incredible.
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:18.360]   Like these, all the M1s, I mean, I have,
[01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:22.320]   I'm not traveling as much so I have a lot of the M1 minis
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:25.520]   and I'm just, oh, I'm still taken aback by how fast they are,
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:29.320]   you know, and that they just jumped so much forward.
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:32.760]   And then obviously the studio has been great as well.
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:34.480]   You know, we've done some pretty extensive tests
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:36.160]   with the studio with video and it's just,
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:37.880]   you just keep on adding more outputs in here.
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:40.280]   Like it's gonna slow down eventually.
[01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:41.120]   - Maybe.
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:43.080]   - That just points out what the,
[01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:44.760]   I agree absolutely with Jason saying.
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:46.280]   I mean, when you're reviewing these things,
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:48.480]   it's hard to come up with a real, real scenario
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:51.560]   in which you can say, oh, geez, that's too bad.
[01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:55.200]   Because even stacked up next to like mid-range, big,
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:11:00.040]   like eight fan helicopter cooling style windows laptops.
[01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:03.640]   This thing is just thrashing, thrashing in the benchmarks
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:05.840]   and another hands-on actual test.
[01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:07.400]   But the thing is like when you're,
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:12.400]   Apple's only, Apple's problem is that they don't charge,
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:14.400]   they don't, they don't, they're not really good
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:17.680]   at giving you a really, really great deal.
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:21.000]   You know, like if this were an $800 laptop,
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.320]   we could possibly be reviewing things and saying,
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:25.240]   well, but you know what, what are you gonna get?
[01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:27.440]   What are you, let's not expect too much
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:29.480]   because this is an $800 laptop.
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:31.200]   These are great benchmarks.
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:32.520]   It is appropriate to see, well,
[01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:34.800]   let's see what it takes to really make these things
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:37.200]   suffer and scream because look for two,
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:40.680]   a lot of these people are spending $1,500, $2,000,
[01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:42.640]   $3,000 on a MacBook Air.
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:45.760]   And for that amount of money, even at the lower end,
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:49.440]   they have a right to expect like the best possible upgrade
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:53.560]   they could possibly get over whatever they were using before.
[01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:54.800]   - I think that's a great point too,
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:59.640]   the idea that the, we could be cynical about the fact
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:02.960]   that this is $11.99 and that the last year's model,
[01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:06.320]   essentially the M1 Air is still in the price list at $9.99.
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:07.840]   But I think the other way to view it,
[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:09.920]   and Andy, you were kind of getting at it there too,
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:13.520]   is that that M1 MacBook Air is great, right?
[01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:17.200]   And like, although I wish that this M2 Air was $9.99,
[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:18.480]   it's not for various reasons.
[01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:20.840]   I think they are gonna need to get it there eventually.
[01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:23.800]   But I'm so glad that that $9.99 price point is still there.
[01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:26.520]   And the fact is Apple Silicon was such a leap
[01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:30.120]   that even if you end up, I think that it's a legitimate buy,
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:34.040]   a goodbye to buy the M1 MacBook Air even today,
[01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:35.800]   if you are looking at the prices and going,
[01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:37.840]   "Oh, it's a little too rich for my blood,"
[01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:42.800]   because at $9.99, that M1 Air is still gonna do 99.9%
[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:44.800]   of the jobs that you ever wanted as fast
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:46.720]   as you could possibly want them.
[01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:50.160]   - Yeah, another response with a lot of nines in it,
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:51.920]   I think that it's really, really important
[01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:55.160]   that Apple hold that line and make sure there's always
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:57.960]   a MacBook available for less than $1,000,
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:12:59.440]   even if it's $1 less,
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:01.520]   'cause that also means that education prices
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:03.280]   is probably gonna be $100 less.
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:06.520]   And there's so many people for whom that $100
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:09.720]   or that $200 difference between the M1 and the M2
[01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:11.640]   is gonna be the difference between having a Mac
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:12.960]   and having a Windows machine.
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:15.200]   And most of those people would probably rather have
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:16.760]   a Mac, wouldn't they?
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:18.800]   - What is it outside of the processor,
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:20.520]   sorry, what is it outside of the processor
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:25.520]   that brings this over that $9.99 price bump?
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:30.240]   What else did they do with the M2 over the M1
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:32.720]   to really raise that price, do we think?
[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:35.960]   - I think it's not the processor so much as it is the,
[01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:40.520]   I mean, the display is new, the webcam is upgraded,
[01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:42.920]   it's that notch display, which is,
[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:44.840]   it's not as good a display as this MacBook Pro
[01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:48.680]   is that cost $2,000, but it's brighter and it's taller
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:51.160]   and it's got, yes, it's got the notch, but you know,
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:53.120]   Apple's been very clever about hiding the menu bar
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:55.120]   in the notch and I think that for most people,
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:58.440]   the menu bar being up there, it isn't that disruptive
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:00.240]   and you get used to it and it's fine,
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:02.560]   but it's a better display, it's a better webcam,
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:06.320]   it's a 1080 webcam, you've got MagSafe.
[01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:08.400]   This new design probably is a little more expensive
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:10.640]   than the old design too in terms of the physical enclosure
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:14.520]   of it, I'm sure it's one of those things where they looked
[01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:17.240]   at the cost of making this right now
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:20.760]   and weren't comfortable taking it to $9.99 and thought,
[01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:23.480]   like I just said, that the M1 Air is actually pretty great,
[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:25.840]   so why don't we keep selling it?
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:28.160]   But I do think that over time they need to push it down
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:31.600]   because like Andy said, it's the truth of it,
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:32.600]   it's the reality of it.
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:35.600]   There's a reason Apple tried to get rid of the MacBook Air
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:37.760]   a few years ago and replace it with the MacBook
[01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:41.040]   and the 13 inch MacBook Pro, both of which were $11.99
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:44.680]   or $12.99 and they were retina and the MacBook Air wasn't
[01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:48.040]   and people didn't care, they just kept buying the $9.99
[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:50.000]   laptop and I think Apple's learned that lesson
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.320]   that for a lot of people, the $9.99 laptop is what
[01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:55.400]   they're gonna buy and that's it.
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:58.120]   Like you can try to sell me an $11.99 laptop
[01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:01.400]   but there's a certain portion of the consumer base
[01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:02.680]   that's just gonna say no.
[01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:07.080]   So that's why I think in the long run, the M2 Air
[01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:08.520]   will need to get down there.
[01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:10.400]   And I know there's inflation and stuff like that
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:14.960]   but like having that $99 price point, a lot of nines
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:16.960]   like Andy said, I think is important
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:20.760]   and I really wonder what they'll never say
[01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:22.040]   but what the sales proportion will be
[01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:24.240]   between the M1 and the M2 over the next year
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:26.360]   'cause I think they're still gonna sell a lot of M1 Airs
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:28.520]   and they should, it's great computer.
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:30.520]   - I will say the Apple is starting to,
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:32.360]   starting to, it feels like there's a trajectory
[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:34.480]   that looks a lot like the early 90s
[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:35.760]   where there are so many different chips
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:37.920]   and so many different computers that are being released
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:39.720]   and they're all in different cadences
[01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:41.680]   that even for someone like me, I start going,
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:43.280]   I don't know what I wanna buy.
[01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:45.480]   You know, like I think it was clear for a while
[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:46.920]   and I think it's starting to get murky
[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:49.400]   and I think that it's not murky yet
[01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:51.440]   but I think that Apple has to start thinking about,
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:53.720]   you know, the streamlining that a little bit.
[01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:55.480]   It's probably has to do with supply chains
[01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:58.080]   and lots of other things of putting out what you can
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:01.040]   when you can but with lots of different chipsets
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:06.040]   that are not as far apart with lots of different outlays
[01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:08.080]   it just gets, it starts to get confusing
[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:10.160]   and it was like, it was not that there was,
[01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:11.920]   didn't need to be, I don't know,
[01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:14.800]   six versions of the Mac when, you know,
[01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:17.400]   there was, they're almost identical in the early 90s
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:18.960]   but I start feeling a little deja vu
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:20.440]   that we're starting to get a lot of product,
[01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:22.800]   different pieces of hardware
[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:24.560]   at different levels of development
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:25.920]   and it's starting to lead to,
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:28.960]   I think people I've talked to are starting to get,
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:29.920]   like they're just hanging on
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:31.480]   and not buying anything right now
[01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:34.360]   because they're not sure what the next thing is for them
[01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:35.880]   because it's just so many different options
[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:38.160]   and they're so fine and detailed between them
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:39.440]   that it really takes a lot of thought
[01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:42.560]   and something that Apple's been good at not forcing us to do
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:45.760]   for a long time but it seems to be getting harder.
[01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:46.880]   - Because you were there, Jason,
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:49.240]   I'll give you a little pride of place
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:54.240]   was there anything you saw that knocked your socks off
[01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:56.640]   or more than one thing is fine?
[01:16:56.640 --> 01:17:00.960]   - I think the big thing that was the surprise
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:04.160]   it says a lot about, a lot of things.
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:05.680]   There's a lot about Apple's ambitions,
[01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:07.720]   there's a lot about what the rumors are
[01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:09.360]   and where they come from,
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:11.600]   is this idea of the dynamic island.
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:13.720]   I wanna start with the name
[01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:18.360]   because nothing says we wish we had named the notch
[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:21.920]   so people call it something that isn't the notch
[01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:24.160]   like calling this the dynamic island.
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:26.480]   Like they lost control of the narrative there
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:28.520]   and they're like, no, no, no, it's an island
[01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:30.800]   people, a dynamic island.
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:34.560]   - You really have to admire their ability to take a negative
[01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:37.840]   and turn it into, I think at least it looks like a positive.
[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:39.680]   - Yeah, it's called lemonade.
[01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:42.560]   - Lemonade, exactly like they call it the lemonade drop.
[01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:45.480]   It's beyond lemonade and those of me who listened to
[01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:47.640]   the listen to Leo and I last week
[01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:50.200]   show 'em this could see like how excited I was about it.
[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:53.000]   It's one thing about saying, okay, well, we messed this enough
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.040]   that you don't notice that this was a design problem
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:55.880]   that we solved.
[01:17:55.880 --> 01:18:00.880]   It's truly like you could, Apple could make the claim
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:03.400]   that no, no, no, we were working up to this
[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:04.880]   for the past three, four years
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:07.640]   and this is, it just took us a while before we get the sensors
[01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:09.760]   into that one little pill that we always wanted
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:11.920]   for the iPhone X.
[01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:13.440]   And I mean, I'm not sure that's not--
[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:15.000]   - It wouldn't put it on the notch.
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.520]   - In fact, they don't put it on the notch.
[01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:19.400]   I notice on the iPhone 14 and 14 plus.
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:21.600]   So I think it wouldn't work as well with the notch.
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:23.440]   - I also really felt like--
[01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:25.840]   - Another quick thing about the notch though,
[01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:27.520]   someone overlaid screenshots,
[01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:29.600]   the notch actually intrudes vertically
[01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:32.000]   into this rain less than the pill.
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.720]   So that's an interesting choice.
[01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:34.880]   - Yeah, they just wanna tell it.
[01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:37.520]   - They just wanna make it drift down in that island there.
[01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:38.840]   That's what they chose to do this time.
[01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:39.840]   - When I saw it, when I saw it,
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:40.960]   I could think of for some reason,
[01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:42.920]   I was picturing Larry David just going,
[01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:46.440]   "Hey, it's not you, it's not you."
[01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:48.880]   Like, I don't kinda know, it's not you.
[01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:50.400]   - I kinda like the notch, you know?
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:54.800]   It's like this black spot where I put on my video,
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:57.120]   a pill, who wants a pill?
[01:18:57.120 --> 01:18:58.680]   I'm trying to spend $12,000 worth of--
[01:18:58.680 --> 01:18:59.920]   I got pills in my life.
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:00.760]   - Yeah.
[01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:02.760]   - So if we talk about the rumors here, right?
[01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:04.120]   Like it's these two cutouts and everybody's like,
[01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:05.240]   "Oh, it's gonna be a whole punch
[01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:07.720]   "and a little oval whole punch and that's gonna be it."
[01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:09.280]   And it shows you, first off,
[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:11.280]   that so many rumors come out of the supply chain
[01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:13.800]   where all they know, it's the three blind men
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:15.800]   and the elephant, there's Larry David.
[01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:16.880]   (laughing)
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:17.720]   - It's not you, I'm in the elephant.
[01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:20.640]   They're like, "No, it's two things, no."
[01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:21.640]   - It's two things, you're not gonna change the name.
[01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:23.120]   - Exactly.
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:25.360]   But what's actually happening is software.
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:27.560]   And yeah, I really think they've had the last five years
[01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:28.920]   since they did the notch to think like,
[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:31.880]   "Well, if we can get it smaller, could we embrace it?
[01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:35.120]   "Could we build UI around it and turn it into a feature?"
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:38.240]   And that's not something that we all got as a rumor
[01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:40.120]   because that was deep inside Cupertino.
[01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:41.800]   - Yeah, that wasn't being supply chain.
[01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:42.800]   - It's just a knee assembly line.
[01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:44.760]   And I love their ambition there, right?
[01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:47.120]   Because it is turning a negative into a positive.
[01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:50.480]   It's like, well, if we dance around the UI,
[01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:52.320]   if we dance around those little holes,
[01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:54.720]   and it's almost as if they disappear,
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:56.440]   whereas the notch is like, "Just don't look at it."
[01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:58.080]   Okay, just don't look at it.
[01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:00.680]   - It's not a pill, it's a permanent widget kind of a thing.
[01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:01.520]   Here's the--
[01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:02.360]   - It turns into a status note.
[01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:03.200]   - It turns into a status note.
[01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:04.000]   - You're talking about Andy from Reddit,
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:07.320]   by a Reddit's iPhone Reddit.
[01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:10.800]   So the 14 and the 14 Pro split and superimposed.
[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:14.720]   So you see the pill is actually--
[01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:17.400]   - Further down.
[01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:18.480]   - Yeah. - Smaller.
[01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:19.800]   - Very good, I think that's right.
[01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:20.640]   Further down.
[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:21.480]   - It's not even further down.
[01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:26.400]   - It's narrower, but I think it's a slightly bigger
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:28.520]   up taller than the notch.
[01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:30.240]   - But I also think that the fact that you do get
[01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:33.360]   some active pixels up on top of the pill,
[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:35.400]   that's what makes dynamic island possible.
[01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:38.560]   Otherwise, it does a dynamic peninsula.
[01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:39.960]   - But also visually, visually.
[01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:43.400]   - Nobody wants a dynamic peninsula.
[01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:44.240]   - Here you go.
[01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:46.000]   - You know they're thinking we could have called
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.600]   the notch the static peninsula people would have
[01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:50.760]   eaten that up, kicking themselves.
[01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:52.640]   - It's not a notch, it's a peninsula.
[01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:59.800]   Okay, I can't ask you this, Jason.
[01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:03.320]   So just wink.
[01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:07.560]   - No, besides, so have you had any experience of it
[01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:09.360]   other than in the hands-on?
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:12.160]   - No, I can give you the official canary,
[01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:13.520]   which is I was not one of those people
[01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:15.360]   who's getting fine and got a briefing.
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:16.440]   - Tomorrow you might get it.
[01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:17.720]   - Yeah. - Yeah, maybe.
[01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:19.800]   Maybe that's usually how it works, right?
[01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:21.760]   Is that the second wave people get it
[01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:23.440]   after the embargo drops.
[01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:26.400]   So I'm-- - So we can't really judge
[01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:28.880]   how the utility or the, I mean,
[01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:30.920]   there may be a high annoyance factor with that thing
[01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:32.400]   or a bit of the b-b-b-b-b-b-b.
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:34.840]   - I would say we won't be able to judge it
[01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:36.600]   even when it ships, and this is why.
[01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:41.200]   It's because this is part of this action widget framework
[01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:43.880]   that they announced in June, the idea that you have live
[01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:47.040]   actions as widgets and show things like a baseball game
[01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:49.560]   or now playing in the music app.
[01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:51.920]   This is the other shoe of that dropping,
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:54.360]   which is that this is the same API does the stuff
[01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:55.640]   around the dynamic island.
[01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:58.480]   Well, the thing is, that's a coming later feature
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:00.200]   for everybody but Apple.
[01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:04.280]   So third party stuff is gonna be really,
[01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:06.560]   it's gonna take a few months for the third parties
[01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:07.640]   to support this.
[01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:09.840]   And I feel, so I feel like out of the gate,
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:11.280]   it's gonna be a little thin
[01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:13.680]   because it's just gonna be Apple stuff.
[01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:15.960]   And then there's gonna be like a software update
[01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:17.320]   and we're gonna get third party apps
[01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:19.600]   that embrace the dynamic island,
[01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:20.760]   they move out to the island.
[01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:21.960]   And then we'll see how it is.
[01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:23.440]   But I think it's gonna take a while
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:26.320]   for the uptake from the developers to come in.
[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:28.760]   - And thank you, Apple, for making an API
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:31.360]   or whatever they call it, a kit for this.
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:34.720]   'Cause it is nice that other apps can use it,
[01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:38.200]   especially because apps are gonna take over the whole screen.
[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:41.600]   So it's very nice that an app can somehow integrate
[01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:44.280]   that thing, that whole into something bad.
[01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:46.720]   - And that's something that Apple can do that Google can't.
[01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:48.560]   Google's a couple of iterations of Google's company.
[01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:50.600]   - Google's trying to get away from the pill, right?
[01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:51.440]   - Well, no, not just--
[01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:52.960]   - They make it a smaller and smaller.
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:54.720]   - Yeah, I'm not talking about the pill,
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:58.520]   I'm talking about how a few iterations of Android ago,
[01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:00.480]   they came up with this really interesting idea
[01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:02.960]   of having apps have access to picture-in-picture,
[01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:04.000]   just like YouTube.
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.920]   So that if you're in Google Maps, for instance,
[01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:09.320]   and you're on a bus or you're on a train or whatever,
[01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:11.720]   you can actually keep an active Google Maps view
[01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:13.560]   of where you are so that you don't miss your stop
[01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:14.400]   and stuff like that.
[01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:16.400]   And they opened that up to third parties,
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:19.640]   but Google doesn't have the ability to either by making it
[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:22.440]   so attractive as Apple makes their stuff attractive,
[01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:24.840]   or by strong arming their developers,
[01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:27.080]   the way that Apple's strong arms their developers,
[01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:29.640]   to actually convince so many third parties
[01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:30.800]   to actually take advantage of it.
[01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:35.800]   This is a beauty, and the thing that I miss a lot
[01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:37.720]   that's so obvious about phones is,
[01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:40.520]   there are times where there is an ongoing thing
[01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:42.200]   that an app is doing in the background
[01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:43.800]   that you want to be able to keep an eye on,
[01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:46.160]   even if it's just that I want to actually
[01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:47.800]   have a persistent thing that says,
[01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:49.480]   here's how long this call has been running,
[01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:54.480]   or here's where this source of this audio is coming from,
[01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:56.760]   and I wanna be able to mute and control
[01:23:56.760 --> 01:24:00.600]   if there are the gold standard which they demonstrated,
[01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:02.480]   which is when is, how long is it gonna take
[01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:03.360]   for my lift to get here?
[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:04.640]   Do I have time to brush my teeth,
[01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:06.440]   or am I gonna have to hot dog it?
[01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:08.960]   When I get to the office, when I get to the office later
[01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:12.360]   that day, Apple's gonna be able to actually
[01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:13.160]   take advantage of it.
[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:15.680]   Now maybe they'll, maybe for all we know
[01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:16.840]   when we're being really optimistic,
[01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:18.040]   I'm being really excited about it,
[01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:21.160]   but it could be just as bad a situation as the,
[01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:23.040]   I still can't remember what Apple's official name
[01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:26.280]   for that stupid little OLED strip above the keyboard was,
[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:28.120]   but nobody really, thank you very much,
[01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:30.520]   the touch bar, nobody really supported it,
[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:34.360]   there was some fun to play doom on the touch bar,
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:36.040]   but it didn't become the sort of thing
[01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:38.760]   where all of the apps used find a creative
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:40.000]   and productive way to use it.
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.600]   So maybe we're just being optimistic here,
[01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:43.440]   but I don't think so,
[01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:45.240]   I think this is something that every app
[01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:47.120]   is gonna want to be able to say,
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:48.680]   look how modern we are,
[01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:51.480]   look how much you're getting for your $5 a month
[01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:53.600]   or whatever we're charging for subscription,
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:54.640]   we're making this better,
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:55.680]   we're making this more modern,
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:57.120]   we're making this the equivalent
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:25:00.440]   of every single Apple app that's out there.
[01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:01.840]   I'm feeling pretty good about it.
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:06.840]   - How long before Android phones start copying it, right?
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:09.000]   - Oh my God, it already happened?
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:12.600]   - It already happened on a theme.
[01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:14.240]   - Oh God, not a theme of the launcher.
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:19.240]   - No, show me, this is the dynamic island on a show me phone.
[01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:22.280]   - Sure.
[01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:23.320]   - Why not?
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:26.480]   - I think it's general, the general press reaction
[01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:28.520]   to dynamic island has been extremely positive
[01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:30.320]   like Andy and I.
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:32.000]   The real question will be,
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.960]   once we get it in our hot little hands.
[01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:36.040]   - Yeah, how does it work in practice?
[01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:37.880]   Because I mean, it is, like Andy said,
[01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:40.400]   really a great idea to say,
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:42.040]   phone screens are too small for multitasking,
[01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:45.800]   but what about an active background information area?
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:47.040]   And you can tap and hold
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:49.640]   and it brings up a more dynamic kind of control.
[01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:51.400]   Although again, my understanding is that
[01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:52.520]   those aren't really interactive,
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:55.280]   if you're not Apple, third party apps are less interactive.
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:56.120]   - Oh, is that true?
[01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:58.760]   - I think so, but you can see a direction
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:00.400]   that they're headed here, which is,
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:03.080]   this is almost like something like the Mac menu bar
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:04.000]   for the iPhone, right?
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.600]   It's a place that you can put little menu bar items,
[01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:09.400]   essentially, and say, here's what else is going on.
[01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:11.440]   And I think that that is a, again,
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:13.840]   you know, there's that saying about how,
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:15.440]   if you put constraints on creative people,
[01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:16.880]   sometimes they do their best work,
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:17.880]   this feels like that.
[01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:20.680]   This feels like Apple looking at those holes
[01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:21.680]   in their display and being like,
[01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:23.000]   we gotta do something.
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:26.600]   And in doing that, they came up with a rethinking,
[01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:29.720]   like a major rethinking of how iOS works on phones.
[01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:31.600]   And that's, yeah, it's got a lot of potential,
[01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:33.880]   even though, I mean, I'm with Andy,
[01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:35.320]   we're gonna get it and there's gonna be like,
[01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:36.660]   oh, it doesn't do this.
[01:26:36.660 --> 01:26:38.200]   And it's gonna be one of those things we have to wait,
[01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:40.880]   maybe a year for, but I think it's got huge potential.
[01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:46.880]   - So, yeah, everybody got their ultras,
[01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:48.160]   the reviews have been out for a while.
[01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:50.560]   Steven, have you had one for a while?
[01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:52.600]   - I do, I got one on launch day.
[01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:55.280]   There's the ultra with the white ocean band right there.
[01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:56.640]   - Nice. Oh, you have the ocean band,
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:26:58.520]   I have the gray ocean band.
[01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:00.240]   And at some point I'll bring in the,
[01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:01.640]   did it take you a while to figure out
[01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:04.080]   how the ocean, how the ocean band worked?
[01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:05.280]   - I read the instructions.
[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:08.720]   I copiously read about the second loop and putting it through.
[01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:11.680]   - Yeah, I think I threw the instructions out or something.
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:12.520]   (laughing)
[01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:14.360]   So it comes with a removable,
[01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:16.360]   in fact, it's not even attached when you get it,
[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:18.760]   second loop for the tab end.
[01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:20.680]   And that I didn't pay attention
[01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:22.200]   and I just put it around the back
[01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:25.040]   and which means I couldn't get the tab in at all.
[01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:26.320]   Like it wouldn't fit and I thought,
[01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:29.840]   well, this is, I don't, then I figured it out.
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:32.600]   Oh, there's holes there, I could just thread it through a hole
[01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:34.160]   and now I quite like it. - I like it.
[01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:36.560]   - And it's adjustable, so that's because this is
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:39.200]   the one size fits all band, even your wets.
[01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:41.600]   - I do like it, I have been using a lot of my previous
[01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:44.240]   solo loops with the ultra 'cause they are fit
[01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:45.920]   and they fit great. - Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:49.080]   - In fact, I was concerned about my pad and quill,
[01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:53.480]   Mike, what are you young people call those?
[01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:55.360]   - A cuff, a cuff. - A cuff, a cuff.
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:56.200]   (laughing)
[01:27:56.200 --> 01:27:57.040]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:58.040]   - I was concerned about that
[01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:01.440]   'cause they had a hole cut out for the back of the watch
[01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:02.600]   and it actually works.
[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:04.240]   So everything's fine. - Okay.
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:06.480]   - So that's good, we're here to report that your ultra,
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:09.960]   as huge as it might be, and I put this on Lisa's,
[01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:12.360]   my wife's wrist and it really is too big for her.
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:14.600]   I said, come on, you would love this watch.
[01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:16.800]   - So what do you think, Mr. Robles?
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:18.760]   - I really like it.
[01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:20.760]   I mean, the battery life, I've been testing it,
[01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:22.440]   it went 48 hours, - Yeah.
[01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:26.560]   - Straight off charger, and it was still at 28% battery,
[01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:28.160]   which is pretty amazing.
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:31.400]   And even did some deep-sea diving in my pool
[01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:33.600]   and tested the depth app.
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:35.200]   - Oh, if only I had a pool.
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:36.360]   (laughing)
[01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:38.000]   - It did go down to five feet.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.680]   And so, as soon as the Apple Watch Ultra submerged,
[01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:42.840]   depth app comes up, went down to five feet
[01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:45.280]   and it saw, I've read the water temperature depth,
[01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:46.360]   and it was pretty accurate.
[01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:48.480]   - I turn, you know, when you're setting it up, it says,
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:51.680]   well, if you go in water, you wanna know how deep you are
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:52.880]   and how cold it is. (laughing)
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:54.560]   And I said, well, of course I do,
[01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:56.440]   'cause if I fall off the Titanic,
[01:28:56.440 --> 01:29:00.600]   it would be nice as I sink to know how far I've sunk.
[01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:02.400]   But I maybe I'll scuba sometime,
[01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:04.560]   I have scuba in the past, I like scuba diving.
[01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:08.200]   This is really though silly for a person like me to have.
[01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:09.520]   - Oh, I mean, it's seen for me,
[01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:10.800]   I have no practical use for it.
[01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:13.360]   - The most action I've had is grocery shopping
[01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:15.160]   with Apple Watch Ultra.
[01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:17.760]   But that larger display showing my grocery list,
[01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:21.160]   that was key feature right there, it's a great experience.
[01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:22.960]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a good point,
[01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:24.080]   it's great for grocery shopping,
[01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:26.080]   I'm sure Apple will put that in their next ad.
[01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:29.320]   I was shopping in the aisle at Safeway
[01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:30.880]   when all of a sudden I couldn't remember,
[01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:35.880]   Iceberg or Romaine, then my watch came to the rescue.
[01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:39.600]   - I reached in to buy a bundle of Romaine
[01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:42.440]   and then that's when the automatic spritters came on.
[01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:46.040]   Thank God I had the rugged version of Apple Watch
[01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:47.200]   and all things could have gotten pretty south pretty fast.
[01:29:47.200 --> 01:29:48.040]   Let me tell you that.
[01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:52.120]   - In this shot, it does look kind of hunky, junky.
[01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:55.360]   - That's why I'm looking forward to designers
[01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:58.320]   coming forward with more substantial bands,
[01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:02.080]   like the 70s to have those gauntless sort of things
[01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:05.360]   that maybe will look like real beefy and real hunky.
[01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:08.520]   Like the day that it was showing off,
[01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:09.640]   I thought that, oh my God,
[01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:13.440]   there's gonna be such a market on Etsy for like women's watch,
[01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:15.440]   women's Apple Watch Ultra bands
[01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:19.120]   that make you look like either Wonder Woman or Zina.
[01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:19.960]   - Oh cool.
[01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:22.760]   - Because if you're going for one of those
[01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:26.120]   like ultra marathon, like Mucker sort of things,
[01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:28.640]   you're gonna wanna have like the Wonder Woman Bracer
[01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:29.480]   or the Zina.
[01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:31.520]   - Oh this would be good, yeah, for a mutter, yeah.
[01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:34.600]   How deep and how cold is the mud?
[01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:35.440]   - Yeah, I mean.
[01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:40.440]   - I watched a DC Rainmaker actually as a YouTube channel,
[01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:41.520]   I just found it this morning
[01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:43.880]   and he tested the depth in one of those like
[01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:45.840]   cylindrical water cases.
[01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:46.680]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:49.760]   - And yeah, he brought it down all the way to 130 feet
[01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:51.560]   and that's when it stops measuring depth.
[01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:54.520]   That's like the maximum, at least to the feet, 130 feet.
[01:30:54.520 --> 01:30:57.120]   And it stayed accurate with the gauge.
[01:30:57.120 --> 01:30:58.640]   - I thought it's supposed to be something really,
[01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:02.400]   it's supposed to go to a thousand, I mean 100 meters,
[01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:04.720]   but that doesn't mean that continue to measure.
[01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:08.800]   - Yeah, it does this cool thing that's very safe
[01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:10.920]   that says like it could probably measure beyond that,
[01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:12.000]   but the screen just simply says,
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:15.000]   okay, you're below 140 now, I'm out.
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.600]   - I'm not, I'm not, you're on your own.
[01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:19.960]   - You have to be a specialized diver right
[01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:21.760]   to go deeper than that or no.
[01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:23.840]   - Yeah, I think that's when you need mix.
[01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:24.680]   - Yeah.
[01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:28.760]   - But this is cool, so this is a hyperbaric chamber
[01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:29.760]   for watches or something.
[01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:34.200]   He's got a pump on it and it can increase the water pressure.
[01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:35.800]   - Yeah, it's kind of cool.
[01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:39.040]   - It's good video, he said that he had it commissioned,
[01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:40.920]   he had it made, so he had made so long ago
[01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:43.520]   that like the tablet that he's using with
[01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:44.720]   is using like a,
[01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:45.560]   - Look at the bezel on it.
[01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:46.920]   - Generation outdated.
[01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:51.400]   But he was hoping that he would like be able to like
[01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:53.400]   a depth test like all these waterproof
[01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:56.000]   and like water resistant watches to failure.
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.360]   And then he found out that even when he bought
[01:31:57.360 --> 01:31:59.240]   like these really, really crappy watches
[01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:01.600]   like off a valley express, like they don't just like
[01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:04.280]   catastrophically fail in a cool way, they just usually
[01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:06.000]   just kind of keep working until they stop.
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.980]   - Yeah, so Apple says is water resistant.
[01:32:08.980 --> 01:32:11.720]   And yet they show people swimming in it
[01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:12.720]   and they say you can dive.
[01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:15.680]   Is it really, can you, is it waterproof?
[01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:17.560]   Why don't they say water proof?
[01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:20.600]   - I think that's a different kind of certification
[01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:22.400]   for proofing. - It is, yeah, the IPF.
[01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:24.160]   - I mean, deep sea diving to 100 meters.
[01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:27.080]   I mean, that's pretty resistant, I would say.
[01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:28.880]   - Unless you can only do it for 10 seconds
[01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:30.880]   and then you have to come back.
[01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:32.080]   - I mean, I don't know.
[01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:36.280]   - My understanding, the last time I looked into it,
[01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:39.520]   but like a year or two ago is that the difference
[01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:41.800]   is usually that if it's waterproof,
[01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:43.560]   that means that it has active measure,
[01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:45.560]   active countermeasures against ingress,
[01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:47.720]   meaning that you have gaskets that are being held together
[01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:49.560]   by positive mechanical seals,
[01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:52.480]   whereas water resistant means that there's glue,
[01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:54.560]   there's, at some point this glue,
[01:32:54.560 --> 01:32:56.720]   this system could fail at which point,
[01:32:56.720 --> 01:32:58.880]   it doesn't, at which point this age is out of the
[01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:00.080]   water resistant system.
[01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:03.480]   - IP stands for ingress protection.
[01:33:03.480 --> 01:33:07.200]   And I don't, what is the IP rating on this?
[01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:08.760]   Is it IP 68? - 68, 68?
[01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:13.000]   Okay, so IP 6X can resist high pressure,
[01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.560]   heavy sprays of water.
[01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:17.320]   It's not about a water.
[01:33:17.320 --> 01:33:20.360]   So is this a way that Apple can get out of
[01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:23.000]   warranting it if it fails under water?
[01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.360]   It seems odd. - They get out of warranting it
[01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:28.200]   by simply expressing that it's not warranting against this.
[01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:29.120]   So that's what they're good for.
[01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:30.920]   - Yeah. - It has a bunch of military
[01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:34.080]   spec certifications which are absolutely intense.
[01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:36.200]   If you look at the entire library of certifications
[01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:40.200]   that come under this category that they're qualifying under,
[01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:43.360]   a lot of it really is, does it resist against chemical attack?
[01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:44.720]   Does it resist against acid?
[01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:48.040]   Does it resist against, again, fighting aliens
[01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:50.520]   on the USS Salaco or something like that?
[01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:52.880]   But however, I was excited when I saw that certification
[01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:54.120]   that I learned about the certification
[01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:57.520]   where it's passed against certain elements of that,
[01:33:57.520 --> 01:33:59.040]   but not the really, really exciting one.
[01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:03.320]   So if you're procurement requirements,
[01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:07.640]   meaning your boss will, your company will authorize
[01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:09.680]   the procurement of this device,
[01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:11.760]   so long as it has this kind of certification,
[01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:14.200]   it will pass some kinds of these super, super intense
[01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:15.960]   field certifications, but not others.
[01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:18.640]   But it does indicate, it does point out that
[01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:21.920]   people like me are thinking, oh, well,
[01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:24.320]   either I'm an adventurer or I'm just want
[01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:26.040]   a really cool, big, fancy watch.
[01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:27.600]   But there are a lot of people who like working
[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:30.160]   in the energy industry, like we're working on oil derricks,
[01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:32.000]   people who are working in construction,
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.560]   that they really do need something that they can use all day
[01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:38.480]   just as a regular fitness watch
[01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:40.000]   or just as a regular smartwatch.
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:41.720]   They just need it to be super, super durable,
[01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:45.360]   even though they're not skydiving off of Everest
[01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:46.200]   or something like that.
[01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:48.240]   They're operating heavy equipment,
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:50.400]   they need something that's gonna hold up to that.
[01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:53.240]   - Apple says, rather Wikipedia says,
[01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:56.440]   "mil standard 810," which is the Apple standard
[01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:59.480]   they're saying we have mil spec 810H3,
[01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:02.080]   is a flexible standard that allows users
[01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:05.440]   to tailor test methods to fit the application
[01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:07.680]   as a result of vendors claim of compliance
[01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:10.240]   to US mil standard 810 can be misleading
[01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:12.360]   because no commercial organization
[01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:14.440]   or agency certifies compliance.
[01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:17.880]   So, okay, fine, it's kind of meaningless.
[01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:23.240]   I know, you know, you could take it out into battle,
[01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:24.320]   I guess, I don't know.
[01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:28.880]   - Yeah, so, but the point is made,
[01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:31.640]   in fact, didn't somebody try to hammer it
[01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:34.240]   and ended up hammering, destroying the table,
[01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:36.240]   some YouTuber, that's a typical YouTube.
[01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:38.240]   - Supposedly that an Apple watch stopped working
[01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:40.560]   before the screen was actually shattered
[01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:43.600]   and so the shock to the internal is messing up
[01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:44.760]   before the screen would break,
[01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:47.560]   but I mean, enough hits the screen shatter too, so.
[01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:49.720]   - Yeah, I'm not gonna hit it with a hammer.
[01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:53.200]   You know, I might take it swimming.
[01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:55.040]   I might do that.
[01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:55.880]   - I'm concerned about my wrist
[01:35:55.880 --> 01:35:57.400]   if it gets hit with a hammer than anything else.
[01:35:57.400 --> 01:35:59.040]   - Yeah, that's a good point.
[01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:00.200]   But I have to say, I love it.
[01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:03.440]   I'm not curious, Stephen, what you think,
[01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:04.680]   unless Andy, did you get one too?
[01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:06.280]   No, I think it's just me and Stephen at this point.
[01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:08.120]   - Nope, just you guys.
[01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:10.840]   - I like the bigger screen because I can actually
[01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:14.360]   type the passcode in the first time every time.
[01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:20.800]   Are you using the Wayfarer, the new Wayfarer watch face?
[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:22.720]   - I typically use the modular watch face
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:24.920]   and that's one of the weird things with the display
[01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:28.520]   because it's larger, it's scaled up all the watch faces
[01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:30.280]   and it feels a little sparse.
[01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:33.000]   Like it's not feeling like the normal modular would feel.
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:34.440]   So that's a little weird and.
[01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:35.520]   - That's why I'm using Wayfarer
[01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:38.200]   'cause I have eight complications, which I like.
[01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:39.440]   I love, I have, love my.
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:41.680]   And if I double tap the bezel,
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:44.760]   I can see what longitude and latitude I'm at,
[01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:46.360]   which is not all that useful,
[01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:50.200]   but and it has a compass on it.
[01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:52.400]   It also does some really interesting things.
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:53.840]   You can set waypoints.
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:56.720]   So like breadcrumbs, if your hands are ungrateful,
[01:36:56.720 --> 01:36:59.840]   it'll, you can drop waypoints as you're hiking,
[01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:01.200]   which means if you go on off trail,
[01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:03.880]   at least you'll be able to maybe get back.
[01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:05.920]   One of the waypoints can be where your car is parked.
[01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:08.280]   So for me, that's more useful.
[01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:12.520]   - Importantly, that is a watch OS feature.
[01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:14.080]   And so, and in your-- - And you're just doing two?
[01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:15.640]   - Yeah, any modern Apple watch
[01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:17.320]   is able to do the wayfinding thing.
[01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:21.160]   - Oh, well never mind then iOS today, post.
[01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:22.480]   (laughing)
[01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:23.960]   - I just think-- - You can't do longitude
[01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:25.000]   and latitude, can you?
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.560]   - I cannot, but that's just easily one of the coolest features
[01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:29.400]   in my opinion, the wayfinding thing.
[01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:30.800]   I do like the eyes. - It is, it's true.
[01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:31.800]   - And so I was excited to see
[01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:34.120]   that it was available on multiple watches.
[01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:36.760]   - And just as you say, Stephen, my battery life,
[01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:40.240]   so they want you to sleep with it on five nights in a row
[01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:42.120]   so that you can predict your ovulation,
[01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:43.480]   which I'm excited about.
[01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:46.920]   So I have been sleeping with it on only hit least
[01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:50.200]   a once last night, which was good,
[01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:52.400]   'cause this can leave quite a mark.
[01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:56.920]   And battery life overnight is like 6% loss,
[01:37:56.920 --> 01:38:00.240]   actually it was like more even like 4% loss, it was very low.
[01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:02.080]   I wore it overnight last night,
[01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:04.280]   all day yesterday with a workout,
[01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:08.440]   it was down to 53% after a full 24 hours.
[01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:11.040]   So that bodes well for 48 hour battery life.
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:12.960]   Charge it up in less than an hour
[01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:14.960]   while I was having breakfast.
[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:16.800]   This is a watch you can, if you might not want to,
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:19.520]   but it is certainly when you can wear all the time.
[01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:21.320]   - And then that's what I did, I sleep with mine,
[01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:23.680]   I slept with my Series 7 in earlier watches anyway
[01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:26.280]   for sleep tracking and with like the two day battery life,
[01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:28.400]   it's pretty nice, just wear it overnight.
[01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:31.080]   And the charger, it did charge up very quickly,
[01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:33.800]   quicker than I would have thought being a larger battery.
[01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:36.160]   But if you have that faster charging capability
[01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:38.240]   like the Series 7 did and you have a charger
[01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:41.240]   that supports it, it charged up very quickly, I was surprised.
[01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:43.480]   - As well as disappointed for 700 or 800 bucks,
[01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:45.520]   it should come with a better puck,
[01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:48.000]   comes with the same puck that the other lesser.
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:49.320]   - You get a braided cable though.
[01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:50.920]   - Oh, it's true, it is braided.
[01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:51.960]   - It's a braided watch cable, yeah.
[01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:55.480]   - So the old edition watches would come with that fancy
[01:38:55.480 --> 01:38:57.960]   ultra suede table stand.
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:38:59.560]   - I still have my original with this.
[01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:02.800]   I got a stainless steel original watch, I still have the box.
[01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:05.360]   I also will be testing this Apple Watch Ultra
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:08.160]   in the hurricane that's actually headed my way.
[01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:09.680]   - Oh, where are you right now?
[01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:11.000]   - On my word?
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:12.680]   - I am near Tampa, Florida.
[01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:15.240]   - Oh, Tampa, it's gonna be the first time in 100 years.
[01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:17.240]   Tampa's had a hurricane.
[01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:20.160]   - I jokingly tweeted, tweeted last week,
[01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:22.480]   when I got it jokingly, yeah, I get to test it in a hurricane
[01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:24.080]   and now I'm regretting that tweet
[01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:26.120]   because I think it will be on it.
[01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:27.680]   - You did it. - Did it test.
[01:39:27.680 --> 01:39:31.000]   Yes, and unfortunately, I do have to say,
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.480]   I'm about to lose power, I did not plan for this.
[01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:36.880]   - That's okay, if you lose power, we'll wish you well
[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:39.120]   and we'll think about you as Ian.
[01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:42.400]   So it's made landfall, is it stormy out?
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:43.400]   - Well, I'm about to lose power
[01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:45.920]   because there's a generator being hooked up currently
[01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:48.800]   and I was told it wouldn't need to have the power off
[01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:49.640]   but it's going to.
[01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:52.480]   And so when that kicks off, I'm not sure how long I'll be out
[01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:56.680]   but I'll be reporting live from the hurricane floor tomorrow.
[01:39:56.680 --> 01:39:57.720]   And that will let you know
[01:39:57.720 --> 01:40:00.320]   how Tampa Watch Ultra does and that kind of environment.
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:02.200]   - Wow, this is exciting.
[01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:05.280]   Steven, can I make one request just for,
[01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:07.400]   I mean, this would be a generous gift for us
[01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:10.320]   but if the crew says, oh, by the way,
[01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:12.880]   we're gonna be shutting off power in about 30 seconds,
[01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:14.480]   could you just say, oh my God,
[01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:15.880]   the winds are starting to pick up now,
[01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:18.320]   I don't know how, so that you get caught up in mid-sentence
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:20.040]   because that would make a really great thumbnail
[01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:20.880]   for the video.
[01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:22.200]   I mean, it'd be great for the channel.
[01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:25.000]   I know it's not your channel but I mean,
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:25.840]   just in the back of your mind.
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:28.800]   - I'll take it off now and I'll try to time it right.
[01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:29.640]   - Wow.
[01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:31.320]   - And just reach just like give the camera
[01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:33.080]   a little bit shaken like, say, wow.
[01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:33.920]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:36.280]   - I gotta head to the shelter.
[01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:37.920]   - Wow.
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:39.200]   Sorry about that, that should be fun.
[01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:40.400]   I hope everything works out okay.
[01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:41.400]   That was rude to me.
[01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:43.720]   - Thank you, we'll be all right, we'll be all right.
[01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:45.120]   - Yeah, so if the power goes out,
[01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:46.960]   we'll understand it when you disappear.
[01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:47.960]   - Appreciate it, sorry about that.
[01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:48.960]   - Oh, that's better.
[01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:50.960]   Do you have family in Puerto Rico as well?
[01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:53.760]   - Not anymore, we all moved to New York.
[01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:55.160]   - Oh, okay, you all got out.
[01:40:55.160 --> 01:40:57.360]   - Yeah, so no one's there now.
[01:40:57.360 --> 01:40:59.280]   - Yeah, 'cause it got hit very hard
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:02.640]   and our thoughts and prayers as they say out
[01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:04.120]   to our friends in Puerto Rico.
[01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:08.320]   - I was gonna try and fly my DJI Mini 2 drone,
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:09.680]   but I don't think it's gonna withstand
[01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:10.840]   those hurricane force work.
[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:11.920]   (laughing)
[01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:13.600]   I think that's gonna work.
[01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:16.600]   - Yeah, mine doesn't even like a light breeze to be honest with you.
[01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:18.440]   (laughing)
[01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:19.640]   - I know, you can't take it to the beach.
[01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:20.480]   - No.
[01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:22.080]   - Yeah, I know.
[01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:24.800]   - Here's a tear down of the Ultra,
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:30.120]   in which you could see the very giant battery in it.
[01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:33.560]   This isn't the I-Fixit folks who do such a great job
[01:41:33.560 --> 01:41:34.640]   with their tear downs.
[01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:37.800]   One thing I did learn though though,
[01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:38.800]   as tempting as it might be,
[01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:42.360]   'cause there's panel of screws in the back, very visible.
[01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:45.280]   Do not take your watch apart.
[01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:48.040]   Apparently it's not easy to put back together
[01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:52.040]   unless you're a trained professional.
[01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:52.880]   Do not.
[01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:56.240]   Anyway, the kind of the bottom line reviews,
[01:41:56.240 --> 01:41:58.480]   Steven on the Ultra, worth it.
[01:41:58.480 --> 01:42:02.320]   - Well, you know, I do like the bigger screen
[01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:04.360]   and I was always a titanium watch guy.
[01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:06.320]   I liked the six and seven and titanium.
[01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:08.080]   I thought it showed less scratches,
[01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:09.880]   plus I like the Sapphire display,
[01:42:09.880 --> 01:42:12.080]   and you don't get that option on the series eight anymore.
[01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:13.560]   So if you want, well,
[01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:14.600]   (laughing)
[01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:15.760]   there it goes.
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:17.280]   - Oh, bye bye Steven.
[01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:18.120]   - Bye Steven. - Bye Steven.
[01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:19.320]   - I'm gonna pleasure talking to you.
[01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:21.600]   Good luck in the hurricane.
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:22.920]   Holy come on.
[01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:23.760]   - That's scary.
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:25.040]   That's terrifying.
[01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:26.960]   - I heard his, yeah, I heard his UPS.
[01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:27.960]   - Yeah, beep, beep.
[01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:29.080]   There goes the power.
[01:42:29.080 --> 01:42:31.760]   Okay, we're,
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:34.000]   watch, show this, show the Y-Shot.
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:35.440]   - The hurricane. - 'Cause what happens now
[01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:38.960]   is, comes in and removes you from the presence.
[01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:40.880]   - Wait, he's still there.
[01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:42.680]   Wait, he's back, put him back.
[01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:43.520]   He's in the dark.
[01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:45.400]   - The last, the last is,
[01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:47.720]   as long as my APC runs on my max student.
[01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:48.880]   - I hear the beepin.
[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:50.560]   I hear the beepin.
[01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:52.640]   Wow, it's amazing. - Wow, amazing.
[01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:54.760]   It's America. - It's Central Florida.
[01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:56.120]   - Oh, God.
[01:42:56.120 --> 01:42:59.320]   We're gonna call him Lazarus Robles from now on.
[01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:00.640]   That's awesome.
[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:02.440]   I have the same UPS when I heard that people like,
[01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:03.280]   "Hey, how's that?"
[01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:04.280]   What's happening in my office, Joe?
[01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:05.120]   - I know that beep.
[01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:07.320]   So if you're hearing it, folks, it's not you.
[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:08.240]   It's him.
[01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:11.920]   - Anyway, yeah, final Apple Watch Ultra review.
[01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:13.360]   I really like it, you know,
[01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:15.320]   whether it's worth it, if you're not an adventurer,
[01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:17.560]   it's hard to say liking the material,
[01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:19.840]   liking the bigger screen for accessibility.
[01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:21.760]   You like making super large text.
[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:23.160]   Sorry about the beeping.
[01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:25.000]   That might be a worthwhile feature,
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:26.680]   but I don't know, I remains to be seen.
[01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:28.440]   I'm gonna use it for the next few weeks
[01:43:28.440 --> 01:43:30.480]   without my Series 7, just strictly Ultra,
[01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:32.120]   and we'll see how it goes.
[01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:33.520]   - Turn on the flashlight on the watch,
[01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:35.280]   and then that way you can just use the light.
[01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:36.120]   - Oh, that's great.
[01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:36.960]   - That's a great idea.
[01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:37.800]   - The beard will stay lit.
[01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:39.000]   - It's really on beyond, right?
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:39.840]   - Yeah.
[01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:41.440]   - No, no, it's not that bright.
[01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:43.200]   - Yeah, it's lovely.
[01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:44.040]   - It's lovely.
[01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:45.960]   - You have to keep twisting your wrist to do it.
[01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:48.120]   (laughing)
[01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:48.960]   - Good speed, picky.
[01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:50.280]   - That's tough.
[01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:51.680]   - I haven't got a bunch for that.
[01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:52.520]   - There, there, there, there.
[01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:53.360]   - That's part of the Apple Watch.
[01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:54.680]   - Let's buy his Apple Watch
[01:43:54.680 --> 01:43:58.040]   in the midst of Hurricane Ian, direct from Tampa.
[01:43:58.040 --> 01:44:00.040]   It's beard.fm.
[01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:00.960]   (rooster crowing)
[01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:05.960]   Back to 2022 now, and Apple's release of,
[01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:10.080]   could it be too many iPads?
[01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:12.080]   So let's talk about these iPads here.
[01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:17.120]   And by the way, all of this is exactly as rumored, right?
[01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:18.440]   Were there any, were there any,
[01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:20.680]   maybe that hover thing is a surprise.
[01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:21.520]   - We didn't know about that.
[01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:22.360]   - Hover was new.
[01:44:22.360 --> 01:44:23.200]   - Yeah, I haven't heard about that.
[01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:25.560]   And that seems like, I can't wait to get my hands on that.
[01:44:25.560 --> 01:44:28.160]   The idea that if you, now if it's,
[01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:29.400]   if the sensors are good enough
[01:44:29.400 --> 01:44:31.760]   that if you just hover the pencil over the screen,
[01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:34.800]   it will show you the target below it.
[01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:36.160]   So it's kind of, it's kind of,
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:38.600]   it's like 3D touch, but in the opposite direction
[01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:40.840]   from the screen and for ART apps,
[01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:43.560]   they just know where you're about to plunk down your,
[01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:45.840]   your pointer is just a big, big deal.
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:47.240]   - I think that scribble-
[01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:49.440]   - Scribble sensing it is a huge one to me.
[01:44:49.440 --> 01:44:50.280]   - Yeah.
[01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:52.560]   - I think that the other thing that potentially could happen
[01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:53.640]   there is spray painting.
[01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:56.160]   So now you're not touching the surface,
[01:44:56.160 --> 01:44:59.960]   you can go over it and lay layers of spray paint,
[01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:03.480]   which has been something that you can do with wackum,
[01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:05.440]   the high end wackum tablets and so on and so forth.
[01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:06.640]   There's not actually touching the surface.
[01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:08.400]   So it'll be really interesting.
[01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:09.720]   For photo retouching and swelling,
[01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:10.560]   you have a good point.
[01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:12.120]   You can see what you're doing to the lights
[01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:14.400]   and the shadows while you're doing it, yeah.
[01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:18.100]   - So for vibrant colors,
[01:45:18.100 --> 01:45:23.120]   and they are vibrant, frankly, except for this silver,
[01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:26.880]   it's very, they're very, they look like the iPhone C,
[01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:28.480]   remember, they really are very colorful.
[01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:30.560]   - Yeah, they're very personal.
[01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:32.920]   I'm glad to see the gray one look more color.
[01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:34.920]   (laughs)
[01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:37.200]   They keep breaking new ground on new ways
[01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:39.600]   of having words for describe the word gray.
[01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:41.120]   - And this is a redesign, right?
[01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:46.120]   The squared off case is kind of more like the iPad pros
[01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:47.960]   from last year.
[01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:48.800]   So that's--
[01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:52.640]   - All pixel screen too, which is good, or, you know,
[01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:55.000]   all glass, so the buttons on the top,
[01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:56.560]   instead of being in the bottom.
[01:45:56.560 --> 01:45:58.680]   - More than that, the camera's on the top
[01:45:58.680 --> 01:46:00.160]   instead of being on the side.
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:01.160]   (laughs)
[01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:02.400]   What a big difference.
[01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:03.760]   You know, I might have to get my mom this
[01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:06.240]   'cause she's always looking in the wrong place,
[01:46:06.240 --> 01:46:08.520]   putting her thumb on the side,
[01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:10.920]   putting it on the top now makes it more like a laptop,
[01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:13.080]   which is very smart.
[01:46:13.080 --> 01:46:16.600]   Ultra Y 12 megapixel front camera,
[01:46:16.600 --> 01:46:20.080]   12 megapixel back camera, they say updated.
[01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:25.080]   A USB-C support, this is on the new iPad,
[01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:28.360]   so it is USB-C, it's not lightning.
[01:46:28.360 --> 01:46:32.000]   It supports a wide range of accessories, Wi-Fi 6.
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.440]   I thought it was 6E.
[01:46:34.440 --> 01:46:35.440]   - The Pro is 6E.
[01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:37.200]   - The Pro is 6E, okay.
[01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:38.040]   - Yes.
[01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:39.680]   - Not that that matters for most people,
[01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:44.120]   but, you know, it's the first iPad with 6E, I believe.
[01:46:44.120 --> 01:46:49.840]   New Magic Keyboard Folio, it doesn't have that weird
[01:46:49.840 --> 01:46:54.120]   lift up thing anymore, it's just a regular flat kickstand.
[01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:56.160]   It's got a kickstand, which actually I think
[01:46:56.160 --> 01:46:58.640]   is probably better because now you're lying
[01:46:58.640 --> 01:47:01.160]   the keyboard flat on the surface, right?
[01:47:01.160 --> 01:47:04.200]   So it's gonna have less give, I would think, I don't know.
[01:47:04.200 --> 01:47:05.880]   - Maybe, maybe. - But also,
[01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:08.040]   also, a row of function keys on the thing.
[01:47:08.040 --> 01:47:11.840]   That is, they did so much to make this inexpensive,
[01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:15.400]   like $450 tablet into, why on earth
[01:47:15.400 --> 01:47:17.560]   would you even consider buying a Windows tablet?
[01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:20.160]   Because this is, we're making so many accommodations
[01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:21.920]   towards the real world of people who are,
[01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:23.960]   people who are like, man, I would love this,
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:25.280]   but it's kind of a close race,
[01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:26.600]   and oh, I just can't deal with lighting,
[01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:28.280]   or oh man, I love this, it's a close race,
[01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:30.440]   but I really need actual function keys
[01:47:30.440 --> 01:47:33.640]   for a lot of the virtualization that I do.
[01:47:33.640 --> 01:47:36.560]   This is such a compelling product in so many ways.
[01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:38.880]   - It's very exciting.
[01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:43.520]   Greg Josswiek said, "We're so excited
[01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:45.520]   to bring the completely redesigned iPad
[01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:48.000]   to our most advanced iPad lineup ever."
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:49.760]   Why even bother, Greg?
[01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:51.480]   (laughing)
[01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:53.440]   - I still think I still, I'm just waiting for, like,
[01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:55.080]   you know, this one isn't as good as the last one,
[01:47:55.080 --> 01:47:58.200]   but you know, we've had some supply issues, and you know.
[01:47:58.200 --> 01:48:00.620]   (grunting)
[01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:05.040]   It's funny, they always get the crap taken out of them
[01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:07.160]   for saying that the next one is the best one ever,
[01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:11.000]   'cause of course it is, but I'm trying to find out
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:12.840]   why did they do it, like, what makes it a thing,
[01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:14.680]   especially when you know everyone's teasing you,
[01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:16.840]   because there are always new people being brought to the--
[01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:18.800]   - I'm going to do. - to ecosystem.
[01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:19.720]   - Oh, no, 'cause it's funny.
[01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:21.480]   - You're too mean until they stop.
[01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:23.280]   - Well, here's the thing that's hilarious,
[01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:24.800]   it's starting to come up in, like,
[01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:27.400]   the regular comedy stuff, right?
[01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:30.320]   So SNL did something, and they had a joke recently,
[01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:31.240]   and they're talking about the iPhone.
[01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:33.360]   Oh yeah, this one, the best one ever.
[01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:36.000]   So, like, now it's getting down to regular people.
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:36.840]   - Everybody knows.
[01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:38.160]   - Not just the nerds are doing it,
[01:48:38.160 --> 01:48:41.120]   but I think the only thing that I can process this in my head
[01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:43.040]   is they realize there's new people coming
[01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:44.800]   to the ecosystem all the time,
[01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:46.560]   so for them, this language is new,
[01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:49.680]   and it makes them feel like they're getting in on something dope.
[01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:51.840]   But it's funny to us.
[01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:54.160]   - Is the display slightly bigger, right?
[01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:58.000]   It's now 10.9 inch instead of 10.2,
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:48:59.440]   so they have reduced the bezels.
[01:48:59.440 --> 01:49:00.720]   It's probably as much as they ever are gonna,
[01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:03.720]   because you still need to hold it somewhere.
[01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:05.040]   - Yeah.
[01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:08.360]   - Liquid retina display, A14 bionic.
[01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:12.880]   First ever landscape front camera, USB-C.
[01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:14.280]   I think the USB-C is telling.
[01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:17.360]   I mean, there's no lighting in any of this.
[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:18.840]   - This is the, I think the difference,
[01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:22.360]   I think the difference between Apple Silicon and Intel
[01:49:22.360 --> 01:49:24.640]   is to the Mac, the difference between USB-C
[01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:26.120]   and Lightning is to the iPads,
[01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:28.120]   or really every other product.
[01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:29.760]   If you don't have a USB-C port,
[01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:31.640]   yeah, maybe you should hold off another year.
[01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:33.000]   - Yeah.
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.760]   I, by the way, iPadOS 16,
[01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:39.200]   which they said will be coming out for all of us with iPads,
[01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:42.680]   well, all of us with iPad Pros and some of us
[01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:45.360]   with regular iPads on Monday.
[01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:49.840]   Your order, which can be made today
[01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:52.440]   for both the new Apple TV and the new iPadOS
[01:49:52.440 --> 01:49:54.280]   is delivered Wednesday.
[01:49:54.280 --> 01:49:58.760]   Not tomorrow, October 26th.
[01:49:58.760 --> 01:49:59.600]   - Not tomorrow.
[01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:00.920]   - I was like, don't get your hands up.
[01:50:00.920 --> 01:50:02.880]   - I can give you an, don't get your arms up.
[01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:05.160]   - Are you gonna order this, Doc Rock?
[01:50:05.160 --> 01:50:09.320]   - No, I have my, my M1 iPad Pro, which I absolutely love.
[01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:10.160]   - I don't feel it.
[01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:12.760]   - And yeah, I'm the same way, I don't feel any need.
[01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:14.960]   - You know, I'm definitely not gonna switch the M2 yet
[01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:17.960]   because like a ding dong, again, this is normal for me.
[01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:20.160]   When I got the M1 iPad Pro, I filled it,
[01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:21.880]   so it was 2,500 bones.
[01:50:21.880 --> 01:50:27.080]   But I, you know, I, one thing I just realized,
[01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:30.240]   I forgot that iPad 16 wasn't out already
[01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:32.720]   because I've been on the beta for so long,
[01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:34.920]   but I literally forgot it didn't exist
[01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:36.480]   because we have it on the phone, right?
[01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:39.280]   So yeah, that's kind of funny to see that announcement.
[01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:40.600]   I'm like, what do you mean coming up?
[01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:44.680]   It's been iPadOS, we don't have that yet.
[01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:46.200]   - Yeah, yeah, totally forgot.
[01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:47.040]   - Yeah.
[01:50:47.040 --> 01:50:49.800]   - Yeah, so it is so good that I literally forgot
[01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:51.080]   that I've been using beta.
[01:50:51.080 --> 01:50:54.600]   And that's a good thing for the people who will be upgrading,
[01:50:54.600 --> 01:50:57.040]   you know, come this week or next week.
[01:50:57.040 --> 01:50:59.800]   Is that it is really, really stable.
[01:50:59.800 --> 01:51:02.440]   And yes, I don't use that stage thing on it though
[01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:03.960]   'cause that just makes me out.
[01:51:03.960 --> 01:51:06.240]   - I will be interested, freeform is coming out
[01:51:06.240 --> 01:51:08.200]   with iPadOS.
[01:51:08.200 --> 01:51:09.720]   I, we thought maybe it was gonna be delayed,
[01:51:09.720 --> 01:51:12.000]   so I will be interested to see what you think of that.
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:15.040]   I feel like that's, there's some stealth thing
[01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:16.280]   they're doing there with freeform,
[01:51:16.280 --> 01:51:18.080]   or maybe it's just another one of those apps
[01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:20.000]   that somebody wrote and they threw it in,
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:23.120]   and then now ignore it for the rest of the, it's life.
[01:51:23.120 --> 01:51:25.520]   - It was a nice free sharing piece of news.
[01:51:25.520 --> 01:51:26.600]   I have to correct myself.
[01:51:26.600 --> 01:51:29.920]   I said that the release of DataVentura is indeterminate,
[01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:31.320]   but I forgot that was one of those.
[01:51:31.320 --> 01:51:32.160]   - Oh, no, it's one of those.
[01:51:32.160 --> 01:51:33.000]   - That was exactly.
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.800]   So, yeah, so knowing that they're not,
[01:51:35.800 --> 01:51:38.280]   they're also, I think the announcement also said
[01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:41.760]   that yes, stage manager will be part of a venture.
[01:51:41.760 --> 01:51:42.600]   It's not like they're gonna say,
[01:51:42.600 --> 01:51:45.760]   oh, that's gonna be, there's a technology preview
[01:51:45.760 --> 01:51:49.480]   in place for early betas, but then you will get,
[01:51:49.480 --> 01:51:52.640]   we will deliver the actual product in about a month after that.
[01:51:52.640 --> 01:51:56.040]   The fact that they're shipping stage manager
[01:51:56.040 --> 01:51:58.240]   next Monday is good.
[01:51:58.240 --> 01:51:59.840]   At least they feel as though it's stable enough
[01:51:59.840 --> 01:52:01.720]   that it's not gonna break people's heads.
[01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:03.840]   The, it might break people's heads
[01:52:03.840 --> 01:52:05.520]   of the new user interface, but again,
[01:52:05.520 --> 01:52:06.600]   it's like we talked about last week,
[01:52:06.600 --> 01:52:08.560]   if they don't wanna use it, people don't have to use it.
[01:52:08.560 --> 01:52:09.960]   But you have to put it out there
[01:52:09.960 --> 01:52:11.480]   and get people start to hammer on it
[01:52:11.480 --> 01:52:13.760]   before they can figure out how to make it even better.
[01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:15.160]   - Pricing is a little higher.
[01:52:15.160 --> 01:52:17.720]   They're still gonna offer the ninth generation
[01:52:17.720 --> 01:52:19.880]   base model for 329.
[01:52:19.880 --> 01:52:24.160]   This one, it's not, they didn't label it an air,
[01:52:24.160 --> 01:52:27.400]   but it's kind of more air priced, 449.
[01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:31.120]   If you want cellular 599, that's a bigger bump.
[01:52:31.120 --> 01:52:33.080]   Used to be $129 bump, right?
[01:52:33.080 --> 01:52:36.560]   And now it's $150 bump to get a cellular in there.
[01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:39.040]   Maybe that's the 5G tax.
[01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:42.680]   It'll come in 64 gig and 256 gig configurations,
[01:52:42.680 --> 01:52:44.040]   nothing in between.
[01:52:44.040 --> 01:52:45.540]   Either get it all or nothing.
[01:52:45.540 --> 01:52:52.560]   By the way, Apple Pencil first generation only, right?
[01:52:52.560 --> 01:52:54.080]   So is that a disappointment?
[01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:56.280]   Do we wanna use the second generation on this thing?
[01:52:56.280 --> 01:52:58.360]   I guess that's for the pros.
[01:52:58.360 --> 01:53:02.080]   - How do you, if it's USB-C, how do you choose it?
[01:53:02.080 --> 01:53:04.200]   - Oh, you get it.
[01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:05.280]   - I guess you're gonna have a cable.
[01:53:05.280 --> 01:53:07.640]   - Oh, it had that adapter came with it.
[01:53:07.640 --> 01:53:09.400]   - Oh, we had that time to plug it in.
[01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:10.240]   - You can't plug it in.
[01:53:10.240 --> 01:53:14.120]   - You have to get some adapter now to like plug it in.
[01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:18.200]   - A dongle of shame, as Dave Shob calls it in our chat room.
[01:53:18.200 --> 01:53:20.520]   A dongle of shame.
[01:53:20.520 --> 01:53:22.800]   - Wow. - And most of us lost that little nubbin
[01:53:22.800 --> 01:53:23.960]   that came with it. - I know.
[01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:25.480]   - Like, you know what I'm saying?
[01:53:25.480 --> 01:53:29.680]   And even the Apple TV a while back came with a little nubbin.
[01:53:29.680 --> 01:53:30.600]   - Oh. - That was,
[01:53:30.600 --> 01:53:32.240]   so somewhere around here I have it,
[01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:34.520]   but I use the second-gen pencil.
[01:53:34.520 --> 01:53:36.000]   So here's the thing that's amazing to me,
[01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.160]   and Alex mentioned this earlier.
[01:53:38.160 --> 01:53:41.480]   Now in iPad game, we got a lot of skis.
[01:53:41.480 --> 01:53:42.720]   Like, that's on Apple.
[01:53:42.720 --> 01:53:44.960]   Like, there are a metric Apple pen.
[01:53:44.960 --> 01:53:47.720]   - There's three, basically three levels,
[01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:49.320]   but then there's sizes.
[01:53:50.200 --> 01:53:51.800]   - For the pro. - Because now we have pro
[01:53:51.800 --> 01:53:56.000]   in two sizes, we have iPad, we have iPad 4-gen, iPad 9.
[01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:57.920]   I mean, 10-gen, I mean 9-gen.
[01:53:57.920 --> 01:54:00.360]   - Do we have higher anymore as the ear gone?
[01:54:00.360 --> 01:54:01.720]   - Yes, no one's still there.
[01:54:01.720 --> 01:54:02.560]   That's what I'm saying. - That's confusing.
[01:54:02.560 --> 01:54:04.760]   - We have a lot of skis right now.
[01:54:04.760 --> 01:54:06.280]   - Wonder why that's interesting.
[01:54:06.280 --> 01:54:07.120]   - It's so they didn't kill me here.
[01:54:07.120 --> 01:54:09.040]   - I feel like Apple's been doing a lot of skis
[01:54:09.040 --> 01:54:12.920]   for a lot of things, and I will say I agreed that with Doc
[01:54:12.920 --> 01:54:15.120]   that it's getting away from the--
[01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:17.680]   - It's getting Steve Jobs thing.
[01:54:17.680 --> 01:54:19.800]   - Yeah, and it's a some degree I see it
[01:54:19.800 --> 01:54:22.840]   in the sense that there are, we use it for different things.
[01:54:22.840 --> 01:54:24.960]   We definitely, I have a bunch of minis that I use
[01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:27.640]   for one thing, and mine, personal ones are the pros,
[01:54:27.640 --> 01:54:30.520]   and we've used a bunch of things, so it's,
[01:54:30.520 --> 01:54:32.560]   I kind of get it, but it's still kind of--
[01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:34.280]   - The mini was not updated, was it?
[01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:37.440]   - Last year sometime.
[01:54:37.440 --> 01:54:39.280]   - Yeah, but there was a rumor that they were gonna
[01:54:39.280 --> 01:54:40.920]   update the mini, I guess not.
[01:54:40.920 --> 01:54:42.360]   - Oh, you know, not this time.
[01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:45.720]   And Andy's right, like the mini is definitely one of the
[01:54:45.720 --> 01:54:48.520]   iPads that is to use an Andy word, ecumenical.
[01:54:48.520 --> 01:54:49.360]   It is religious.
[01:54:49.360 --> 01:54:51.880]   Everybody that has a mini, don't give me nothing to try.
[01:54:51.880 --> 01:54:53.280]   - I love my mini. - I want my mini.
[01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:54.840]   - I love my mini. - I love my mini.
[01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:57.320]   And I don't need an upgrade on my mini.
[01:54:57.320 --> 01:54:58.480]   To be honest, I'm not going.
[01:54:58.480 --> 01:55:00.600]   - Mini is like the Converse Chuck Taylor's
[01:55:00.600 --> 01:55:01.440]   back in the day.
[01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:04.320]   Chuck Taylor's for certain people were a religion like,
[01:55:04.320 --> 01:55:06.680]   I don't need all of these fancy shoes with these
[01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:09.720]   pumpings and straps, I just needed chucks.
[01:55:09.720 --> 01:55:11.880]   And so to me, the mini is much like chucks,
[01:55:11.880 --> 01:55:13.800]   and it comes in all those colors.
[01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:16.600]   - And I use my pencil too, and I charge it on the side
[01:55:16.600 --> 01:55:17.680]   of my pad mini.
[01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:19.240]   - Yeah.
[01:55:19.240 --> 01:55:22.040]   - So you're right, there's a lot of skus.
[01:55:22.040 --> 01:55:24.800]   There's the iPad mini from 4.99,
[01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:29.800]   the iPad from 3.29, the new iPad from 4.49,
[01:55:29.800 --> 01:55:34.960]   the iPad Air from 5.99, and the iPad Pro from 7.99.
[01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:37.520]   Too many skus. - I do think they have--
[01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:40.040]   - What's the difference is iPad and iPad Air, you know?
[01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:41.880]   That's going to confuse people in the stores.
[01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:44.560]   - I think the iPad Air needs to go.
[01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:48.720]   I see so many situations which I would say,
[01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:50.800]   no, no, just get the regular iPad and max it out.
[01:55:50.800 --> 01:55:52.080]   Don't spend the extra money on that.
[01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:54.200]   Or I would say, oh, you know what, for you,
[01:55:54.200 --> 01:55:56.160]   spend the extra money and get the iPad Pro,
[01:55:56.160 --> 01:55:58.280]   even if you have to get one that doesn't have
[01:55:58.280 --> 01:55:59.760]   that much storage on it, because you are
[01:55:59.760 --> 01:56:01.840]   absolutely going to adore that thing.
[01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:04.400]   It's hard to know where the iPad Air exists.
[01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:07.440]   - Yeah, why pay 150 bucks more for an iPad Air?
[01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:08.880]   I don't understand.
[01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:11.000]   - Yeah, I think we said that when the regular came out,
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.520]   when the name came out, we said that the new one
[01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:16.320]   passed the Air, and that was almost a year ago.
[01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:18.600]   - Well, of course the Air has the M1 chip,
[01:56:18.600 --> 01:56:19.960]   but dirty little secret.
[01:56:19.960 --> 01:56:26.040]   So the A14 is the M1 chip, so I don't know why.
[01:56:26.040 --> 01:56:28.480]   That's an interesting game Apple's playing with that.
[01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:31.320]   I guess maybe the M1 has more cores or something
[01:56:31.320 --> 01:56:33.400]   or it's an interesting game.
[01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:37.800]   I would say, yeah, you don't need the Air.
[01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:39.200]   It's got more muted colors.
[01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:40.520]   It's not as candy colored.
[01:56:41.560 --> 01:56:43.800]   Everybody's trying to figure out how to survive,
[01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:46.720]   and Apple's decided that putting more gambling ads
[01:56:46.720 --> 01:56:49.440]   in the app store is really the way to make--
[01:56:49.440 --> 01:56:52.640]   - Oh, that one really bad, really bad.
[01:56:52.640 --> 01:56:54.080]   (laughing)
[01:56:54.080 --> 01:56:57.560]   Like it was like, wow, that when you don't see Apple
[01:56:57.560 --> 01:57:00.640]   wipe out very often, but a lot of us have been,
[01:57:00.640 --> 01:57:03.080]   you know, like that was just a complete wipe out.
[01:57:03.080 --> 01:57:06.360]   And it's, yeah, 'cause I watched it.
[01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:07.720]   I watched, everyone getting really upset.
[01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:09.800]   I don't, I guess I didn't seem very many of them,
[01:57:09.800 --> 01:57:13.560]   but I was like, people are really upset about this.
[01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:16.800]   And I think overall, Apple's just be out of ads.
[01:57:16.800 --> 01:57:18.560]   Like, I know that it's a growing market for them.
[01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:20.320]   They should not do it. - Yes.
[01:57:20.320 --> 01:57:21.600]   - Apple was-- - Yeah, it's just, yeah.
[01:57:21.600 --> 01:57:24.840]   - Yeah, I think, I don't know why Apple changed their tune.
[01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:25.920]   By the way, they've now said,
[01:57:25.920 --> 01:57:28.120]   we're gonna put a pause on gambling ads.
[01:57:28.120 --> 01:57:28.960]   But I think-- - They should have a pause
[01:57:28.960 --> 01:57:29.800]   on ads.
[01:57:29.800 --> 01:57:32.840]   - Yeah, well, they should, but they're not.
[01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:35.120]   Mark Armin's tweet, I think I'm guessing
[01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:37.520]   Marco has some pull over there.
[01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:40.240]   Now my app's product page shows gambling ads,
[01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:41.400]   which I'm really not okay with.
[01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:43.520]   Apple shouldn't be okay with it either.
[01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:47.080]   The App Store has corrupted such a great company,
[01:57:47.080 --> 01:57:50.040]   so deeply, they make so much from gambling
[01:57:50.040 --> 01:57:52.680]   and the manipulative in-app purchases.
[01:57:52.680 --> 01:57:54.260]   They don't even see the problem anymore.
[01:57:54.260 --> 01:57:57.080]   So here's his screenshot of being featured
[01:57:57.080 --> 01:57:58.760]   as the app of the day overcast.
[01:57:58.760 --> 01:58:01.880]   You might also like William Hill's sports betting,
[01:58:01.880 --> 01:58:02.720]   bet on football.
[01:58:02.720 --> 01:58:04.440]   Of course, everybody listens to overcast
[01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:06.520]   wants to bet on football and horse racing.
[01:58:07.520 --> 01:58:10.920]   Apple realizing this was a black mark on their escutcheon.
[01:58:10.920 --> 01:58:15.160]   - Yeah, but you would think that they would say,
[01:58:15.160 --> 01:58:19.280]   this was not, it wasn't that they had this file
[01:58:19.280 --> 01:58:21.800]   of a thousand categories that they just dumped
[01:58:21.800 --> 01:58:23.520]   that dumped into the ad system.
[01:58:23.520 --> 01:58:26.680]   It's like this was a considered act.
[01:58:26.680 --> 01:58:29.080]   And maybe at some point someone might have thought,
[01:58:29.080 --> 01:58:31.320]   perhaps we should make sure that people can't,
[01:58:31.320 --> 01:58:34.800]   that people who are looking for mental health apps
[01:58:34.800 --> 01:58:36.880]   and apps that help you to quit addiction to gambling
[01:58:36.880 --> 01:58:38.600]   do not see ads for gambling apps.
[01:58:38.600 --> 01:58:40.080]   No, comparatively not.
[01:58:40.080 --> 01:58:41.240]   It's, this was a good point.
[01:58:41.240 --> 01:58:42.800]   - Well, that's a good point too, yeah.
[01:58:42.800 --> 01:58:45.320]   - It's rare that, I mean, Alex has spot on,
[01:58:45.320 --> 01:58:47.680]   this is a rare that you see a cell phone like this
[01:58:47.680 --> 01:58:49.960]   from Apple, a story that begins with,
[01:58:49.960 --> 01:58:52.360]   in retrospect, this was an obvious mistake.
[01:58:52.360 --> 01:58:53.360]   - Yeah.
[01:58:53.360 --> 01:58:54.880]   - I mean, the question is like,
[01:58:54.880 --> 01:58:56.560]   what is their, they're trying to,
[01:58:56.560 --> 01:58:57.760]   they're a product company, right?
[01:58:57.760 --> 01:58:58.760]   They're a product company.
[01:58:58.760 --> 01:59:00.760]   And so the idea here is that they want people
[01:59:00.760 --> 01:59:02.600]   to be loyal customers.
[01:59:02.600 --> 01:59:05.600]   And yet these ads are not only cynical
[01:59:05.600 --> 01:59:07.280]   because you have to go to the app store,
[01:59:07.280 --> 01:59:08.600]   there's no alternative.
[01:59:08.600 --> 01:59:10.960]   And they've already had, you know,
[01:59:10.960 --> 01:59:11.800]   they're taking money,
[01:59:11.800 --> 01:59:14.080]   they're extracting more money out of app developers
[01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:15.840]   by having them say, you know,
[01:59:15.840 --> 01:59:18.640]   they take their 30 or 15 in some cases percent.
[01:59:18.640 --> 01:59:19.760]   And then they say, but you know,
[01:59:19.760 --> 01:59:20.960]   if anyone wants to find your app,
[01:59:20.960 --> 01:59:23.920]   you gotta take some of that 70 or 85% we gave you
[01:59:23.920 --> 01:59:25.200]   and you gotta give it back to us
[01:59:25.200 --> 01:59:27.120]   so that we can make your thing visible, right?
[01:59:27.120 --> 01:59:28.960]   Like it's already kind of a racket.
[01:59:28.960 --> 01:59:31.120]   And it wouldn't be so bad if they were alternatives,
[01:59:31.120 --> 01:59:32.600]   but because it's exclusive,
[01:59:32.600 --> 01:59:34.000]   it's the only place you can go.
[01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:35.920]   And with app tracking transparency,
[01:59:35.920 --> 01:59:38.560]   a lot of other app marketing has disappeared now.
[01:59:38.560 --> 01:59:40.760]   And so it's really the only place you can go.
[01:59:40.760 --> 01:59:42.160]   So it's already kind of gross.
[01:59:42.160 --> 01:59:43.720]   This is just like a layer,
[01:59:43.720 --> 01:59:45.040]   the fact that it's so lazy,
[01:59:45.040 --> 01:59:46.640]   that it's not really categorized.
[01:59:46.640 --> 01:59:48.920]   And it's just like selling to everywhere you're budding in
[01:59:48.920 --> 01:59:52.200]   to some place that you're not even relevant there,
[01:59:52.200 --> 01:59:53.760]   but we're gonna put you there anyway,
[01:59:53.760 --> 01:59:56.720]   just, you know, just to get your nose in the door here.
[01:59:56.720 --> 01:59:57.600]   And there's nobody,
[01:59:57.600 --> 01:59:59.800]   and I admit to having strong feelings about this
[01:59:59.800 --> 02:00:01.520]   because I spent the last like five years
[02:00:01.520 --> 02:00:04.960]   of my old corporate job as arguing with salespeople
[02:00:04.960 --> 02:00:08.320]   who kept going to incrementally increase revenue
[02:00:08.320 --> 02:00:10.040]   by making the product worse.
[02:00:10.040 --> 02:00:13.120]   And depending on who my boss was at the time,
[02:00:13.120 --> 02:00:16.080]   I was sometimes the only voice in the room saying,
[02:00:16.080 --> 02:00:19.560]   you're gonna drive away our customers and our audience
[02:00:19.560 --> 02:00:21.160]   and our customers are our audience,
[02:00:21.160 --> 02:00:23.200]   our customers are not our advertisers.
[02:00:23.200 --> 02:00:25.560]   They are our audience and without them we're nothing.
[02:00:25.560 --> 02:00:28.240]   And I wonder sometimes looking at Apple
[02:00:28.240 --> 02:00:30.400]   and the App Store in the modern day,
[02:00:30.400 --> 02:00:33.800]   if there's anybody there with a voice who can be heard
[02:00:33.800 --> 02:00:36.800]   to say no to incremental revenue
[02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:38.240]   because it hurts the product.
[02:00:38.240 --> 02:00:41.760]   And this action is a sign that there isn't.
[02:00:41.760 --> 02:00:44.360]   - Yeah, I've always thought the worst thing
[02:00:44.360 --> 02:00:47.520]   about the App Store and approaching being disgusted by this
[02:00:47.520 --> 02:00:50.240]   is that as a consumer, I don't get to simply say,
[02:00:50.240 --> 02:00:52.400]   well, show me every text editor that you have.
[02:00:52.400 --> 02:00:55.480]   Well, no, we'll show you the top X of them.
[02:00:55.480 --> 02:00:56.760]   We'll show you once they're being promoted.
[02:00:56.760 --> 02:00:58.480]   We'll show you once they're being advertised.
[02:00:58.480 --> 02:00:59.880]   We don't care if you're willing to sit there
[02:00:59.880 --> 02:01:02.040]   and just scroll, scroll, scroll for two hours.
[02:01:02.040 --> 02:01:05.160]   It's if it's not something that Apple has in some way
[02:01:05.160 --> 02:01:07.200]   selected to be presented in front of you,
[02:01:07.200 --> 02:01:08.320]   you're just not gonna find it.
[02:01:08.320 --> 02:01:11.200]   Unless you hit upon the magic keyword that will serve us,
[02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:14.120]   this thing that you didn't know you were looking for,
[02:01:14.120 --> 02:01:16.200]   but you're glad that you found, you're kind of out of it.
[02:01:16.200 --> 02:01:18.600]   It's a terrible way to treat app developers
[02:01:18.600 --> 02:01:20.760]   as it's a terrible way to treat customers.
[02:01:20.760 --> 02:01:24.760]   - And it's so corrosive because it gives Apple no,
[02:01:24.760 --> 02:01:27.920]   Apple doesn't have any reason to make App Store search
[02:01:27.920 --> 02:01:30.560]   or other App Store algorithms better, right?
[02:01:30.560 --> 02:01:32.800]   'Cause Apple could theoretically make it so good
[02:01:32.800 --> 02:01:34.680]   that it's like, oh, we know about you
[02:01:34.680 --> 02:01:37.000]   because of course they can track you
[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:38.080]   because it's all first party
[02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:40.360]   and therefore it's not gross or creepy.
[02:01:40.360 --> 02:01:42.600]   And we know about you and we built an algorithm
[02:01:42.600 --> 02:01:44.120]   so we know what apps you're gonna like.
[02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:45.640]   But if they do that, they kind of undercut
[02:01:45.640 --> 02:01:47.640]   their search business so they just don't.
[02:01:47.640 --> 02:01:50.200]   And the search and the algorithms in the App Store
[02:01:50.200 --> 02:01:51.360]   aren't very good.
[02:01:51.360 --> 02:01:53.000]   So it's corrosive on that way.
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.960]   And then John Gruber made a good point
[02:01:55.960 --> 02:01:57.440]   on Daring Fireball this week
[02:01:57.440 --> 02:02:01.000]   where he pointed out how the perception among members
[02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.560]   of the public is that all of those App Store editorial
[02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:06.480]   stories where there's actually an editorial team at Apple
[02:02:06.480 --> 02:02:09.000]   who writes stories about apps that they think are cool
[02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:12.000]   and has nothing to do with paid placement.
[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.560]   It's entirely editorial, I mean, it's marketing, right?
[02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:16.240]   'Cause it's the App Store and it's Apple,
[02:02:16.240 --> 02:02:18.920]   but it's entirely the decision of the people
[02:02:18.920 --> 02:02:21.320]   in App Store editorial about what they wanna feature.
[02:02:21.320 --> 02:02:23.080]   And everybody thinks those are ads.
[02:02:23.080 --> 02:02:24.720]   And that is another one of these side effects.
[02:02:24.720 --> 02:02:27.520]   But once you open the door to content in the App Store
[02:02:27.520 --> 02:02:31.760]   being for pay, even when you create not for pay content,
[02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:34.480]   people just assume that somebody paid somebody
[02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:36.120]   to write this nice feature about them
[02:02:36.120 --> 02:02:37.120]   even though that's not true.
[02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:40.120]   So there's so many knock on effects of Apple getting
[02:02:40.120 --> 02:02:42.240]   into the ad business, especially in the App Store.
[02:02:42.240 --> 02:02:44.000]   I think they're all bad.
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.640]   And I think the question is, is it worth it?
[02:02:46.640 --> 02:02:48.920]   Is the extra incremental worth it?
[02:02:48.920 --> 02:02:50.200]   I just don't see how it is.
[02:02:50.200 --> 02:02:52.080]   But there's nobody to tell them no.
[02:02:52.080 --> 02:02:53.760]   - It's just such a small amount of revenue
[02:02:53.760 --> 02:02:55.080]   and maybe they'll grow it into something.
[02:02:55.080 --> 02:02:58.200]   But the more it grows, the worse it will feel.
[02:02:58.200 --> 02:03:00.080]   So the more successful they are,
[02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:01.920]   the more weird it's going to be.
[02:03:01.920 --> 02:03:04.600]   And especially when they're blocking other tracking
[02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:06.480]   and everything else, I completely agree
[02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:09.640]   that that is just like, it's so easy right now
[02:03:09.640 --> 02:03:10.920]   because they are a product company,
[02:03:10.920 --> 02:03:12.960]   they are not dependent on advertising
[02:03:12.960 --> 02:03:14.480]   for them to be above it.
[02:03:14.480 --> 02:03:17.360]   To just say, hey, our environments are not that.
[02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:19.120]   Our environments don't do that.
[02:03:19.120 --> 02:03:22.120]   And it's a nice, clean, quiet place.
[02:03:22.120 --> 02:03:23.400]   When we recommend something to you,
[02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:24.480]   it has nothing to do with money.
[02:03:24.480 --> 02:03:26.320]   It has to do with this is the most likely thing
[02:03:26.320 --> 02:03:27.160]   that you'd like.
[02:03:27.160 --> 02:03:31.640]   This is, I just feel like that's the Apple,
[02:03:31.640 --> 02:03:33.520]   that should be the Apple approach to this,
[02:03:33.520 --> 02:03:36.680]   not money grubbing, which is what it feels like.
[02:03:36.680 --> 02:03:39.440]   - The Apple approach to it is just to keep it covert.
[02:03:39.440 --> 02:03:45.040]   As the out of sync says in our IRC,
[02:03:45.040 --> 02:03:47.320]   loot boxes are basically gambling.
[02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:51.240]   And that's how most apps make money.
[02:03:51.240 --> 02:03:54.480]   And Apple makes 30% on those loot boxes.
[02:03:54.480 --> 02:03:55.760]   It's just more covert, right?
[02:03:55.760 --> 02:03:59.280]   It's not as obvious as an actual ad for gambling.
[02:03:59.280 --> 02:04:04.280]   At the NFL advertises and now is a shares in gambling revenue
[02:04:04.280 --> 02:04:07.320]   from FanDuel and DraftKings.
[02:04:07.320 --> 02:04:10.560]   And I think that's really tarnished their reputation,
[02:04:10.560 --> 02:04:12.160]   but get ready.
[02:04:12.160 --> 02:04:14.360]   The radio station I worked at in San Francisco
[02:04:14.360 --> 02:04:17.120]   just closed down its news talk
[02:04:17.120 --> 02:04:19.640]   in favor of a sports gambling format.
[02:04:19.640 --> 02:04:22.440]   This is the way the world is going.
[02:04:22.440 --> 02:04:24.080]   It's kind of the-- - I think the crappification
[02:04:24.080 --> 02:04:25.080]   of everything.
[02:04:25.080 --> 02:04:26.680]   - I think the reason the app developers got so mad
[02:04:26.680 --> 02:04:28.600]   about this is that because the app store
[02:04:28.600 --> 02:04:32.200]   is their only home that they're allowed on the platform.
[02:04:32.200 --> 02:04:33.920]   And that means that basically,
[02:04:33.920 --> 02:04:36.600]   like if your Marco Arment, your entire overcast business
[02:04:36.600 --> 02:04:39.600]   is really built around the overcast product page.
[02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:42.120]   And it's not as if Apple comes to Marco and says,
[02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:44.000]   "Hey Marco, can we put some ads on your page
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:45.920]   and we'll cut you in for a rev share?"
[02:04:45.920 --> 02:04:49.440]   No, no, Apple says, "We're gonna just put anything we want,
[02:04:49.440 --> 02:04:52.320]   including stuff that you hate on your page
[02:04:52.320 --> 02:04:53.880]   and there's nothing you can do about it
[02:04:53.880 --> 02:04:56.760]   and we get all the money and you have no recourse
[02:04:56.760 --> 02:04:58.240]   because you're trapped in our platform
[02:04:58.240 --> 02:05:00.560]   and there's no alternative to the app store."
[02:05:00.560 --> 02:05:04.720]   And it's like, again, each one of those is in itself
[02:05:04.720 --> 02:05:06.560]   like a little micro-offence,
[02:05:06.560 --> 02:05:09.160]   but you put it all together and it's super offensive.
[02:05:09.160 --> 02:05:10.760]   - Back in August, Mark German said,
[02:05:10.760 --> 02:05:14.120]   "This is because Apple advertising VP Todd Tiresi
[02:05:14.120 --> 02:05:17.320]   began reporting directly to Eddie Q
[02:05:17.320 --> 02:05:19.120]   and that Tiresi told Q,
[02:05:19.120 --> 02:05:21.720]   I'm gonna increase our advertising revenue
[02:05:21.720 --> 02:05:25.920]   from four billion annually to billions in the double digits.
[02:05:25.920 --> 02:05:27.560]   I'm gonna more than double it."
[02:05:27.560 --> 02:05:32.520]   And apparently, Tiresi has had free reign ever since.
[02:05:32.520 --> 02:05:34.360]   - Yeah, somebody--
[02:05:34.360 --> 02:05:37.000]   - This was in the German newsletter that said,
[02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:38.760]   and I don't know if it's happened yet,
[02:05:38.760 --> 02:05:42.400]   they were gonna look at ads in the Maps app as well.
[02:05:42.400 --> 02:05:44.480]   - First Google already does that.
[02:05:44.480 --> 02:05:47.440]   - So who's able to say no to that guy?
[02:05:47.440 --> 02:05:49.920]   And right now, I feel like nobody's saying no to that guy.
[02:05:49.920 --> 02:05:51.880]   Although this week or last week,
[02:05:51.880 --> 02:05:55.840]   maybe somebody realized you cannot give that guy free reign
[02:05:55.840 --> 02:05:58.520]   because I hate to make a villain of any person
[02:05:58.520 --> 02:06:01.160]   'cause I don't know what's going on on the inside,
[02:06:01.160 --> 02:06:02.480]   but I'm just gonna come out and say it.
[02:06:02.480 --> 02:06:03.800]   I think this guy's a villain.
[02:06:03.800 --> 02:06:05.480]   I think this guy has been,
[02:06:05.480 --> 02:06:08.280]   his job is to do things that I think
[02:06:08.280 --> 02:06:11.080]   are fundamentally corrosive to Apple's products.
[02:06:11.080 --> 02:06:13.160]   And the question is not this guy.
[02:06:13.160 --> 02:06:15.320]   I mean, I can say he's a villain, he's doing his job.
[02:06:15.320 --> 02:06:16.720]   The problem is, who's his boss?
[02:06:16.720 --> 02:06:18.440]   Is it Eddy Q?
[02:06:18.440 --> 02:06:20.800]   Is Eddy Q okay with the junkifying
[02:06:20.800 --> 02:06:22.000]   of all of Apple's services?
[02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:22.840]   Is Tim Cook?
[02:06:22.840 --> 02:06:26.040]   Who is there to weigh what this guy wants to do
[02:06:26.040 --> 02:06:28.360]   in terms of bringing in incremental,
[02:06:28.360 --> 02:06:31.320]   small amounts in most cases of revenue
[02:06:31.320 --> 02:06:34.440]   and weigh it against how much worse the product is.
[02:06:34.440 --> 02:06:36.080]   - Yeah, but if it gets to 10 billion a year,
[02:06:36.080 --> 02:06:37.240]   it's not that incremental.
[02:06:37.240 --> 02:06:40.200]   - It's not, well, I mean, all right, let's see it though,
[02:06:40.200 --> 02:06:42.400]   but it's incremental compared to the iPhone, right?
[02:06:42.400 --> 02:06:43.840]   Like this is the--
[02:06:43.840 --> 02:06:45.840]   - Apple doesn't need to do it as your point.
[02:06:45.840 --> 02:06:46.920]   - Does not know to do it. - But there's incremental
[02:06:46.920 --> 02:06:48.840]   or not, they don't need to do it.
[02:06:48.840 --> 02:06:50.800]   - But also what I find a little bit suspicious
[02:06:50.800 --> 02:06:53.440]   is that obviously Apple didn't talk about
[02:06:53.440 --> 02:06:56.720]   the ad revenue, part of their business during the,
[02:06:56.720 --> 02:06:58.280]   when the majority of the call,
[02:06:58.280 --> 02:07:01.360]   Tim was asked specifically about it during the Q and A
[02:07:01.360 --> 02:07:04.000]   by an analyst and he parried the hell out of it.
[02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:07.120]   He said, well, privacy is a fundamental right,
[02:07:07.120 --> 02:07:10.160]   we're not doing anything that steps away from the blah, blah,
[02:07:10.160 --> 02:07:13.240]   and our specific advertising business is not large
[02:07:13.240 --> 02:07:15.880]   in relative to others and so forth.
[02:07:15.880 --> 02:07:18.520]   I'm not, that's not me, that is actually,
[02:07:18.520 --> 02:07:20.360]   is not large relative. - Yeah.
[02:07:20.360 --> 02:07:22.000]   - We're not Facebook, we're not Google.
[02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.360]   - But we don't release the exact numbers on it,
[02:07:24.360 --> 02:07:25.480]   but it's clearly not large.
[02:07:25.480 --> 02:07:28.920]   Well, if it's a multi-billion dollar part of your business,
[02:07:28.920 --> 02:07:31.880]   maybe you should, and someone asks you specifically,
[02:07:31.880 --> 02:07:33.520]   like asking are there any metrics,
[02:07:33.520 --> 02:07:35.040]   any metrics you can talk about to give us a sense
[02:07:35.040 --> 02:07:37.560]   of how big those businesses are.
[02:07:37.560 --> 02:07:40.000]   Yeah, it's suspicious that he parried the hell out of that one.
[02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.200]   The only other one that he parried off,
[02:07:42.200 --> 02:07:44.440]   interestingly enough, were questions about
[02:07:44.440 --> 02:07:46.920]   Apple's labor relation, so to make of that one.
[02:07:46.920 --> 02:07:50.720]   - Also not the best record in the world.
[02:07:50.720 --> 02:07:52.040]   - Yeah, interesting.
[02:07:52.040 --> 02:07:54.560]   Well, you know, Apple's a, look at,
[02:07:54.560 --> 02:07:56.800]   I've said this for a long time, Apple's a corporation,
[02:07:56.800 --> 02:07:58.400]   and they're not your buddies.
[02:07:58.400 --> 02:08:00.640]   - Of course, and they're not your friends.
[02:08:00.640 --> 02:08:03.040]   - They have a fiduciary responsibility to stakeholders
[02:08:03.040 --> 02:08:04.760]   to profit, to make profit.
[02:08:04.760 --> 02:08:07.040]   And I think to some degree, we've really set it up
[02:08:07.040 --> 02:08:12.040]   in this country that there is actually a bit of discord
[02:08:12.040 --> 02:08:16.760]   between companies whose incentives are to make money
[02:08:16.760 --> 02:08:19.520]   and customers who say, well, what about us?
[02:08:19.520 --> 02:08:21.960]   And a lot of times the companies do to make money
[02:08:21.960 --> 02:08:23.560]   does not serve the customer.
[02:08:23.560 --> 02:08:26.160]   But that's not their incentive.
[02:08:26.160 --> 02:08:28.240]   - I think the argument is that they could,
[02:08:28.240 --> 02:08:30.680]   whatever they make with the advertising,
[02:08:30.680 --> 02:08:32.440]   it may cost them more money in the long run.
[02:08:32.440 --> 02:08:34.200]   So even from a stockholder position.
[02:08:34.200 --> 02:08:35.760]   - I would hope they would think that.
[02:08:35.760 --> 02:08:37.920]   But they don't think long term. - Losing some of the shininess
[02:08:37.920 --> 02:08:39.320]   of the platform.
[02:08:39.320 --> 02:08:40.160]   - Yes, it really. - You know,
[02:08:40.160 --> 02:08:41.400]   just by having a shinier platform
[02:08:41.400 --> 02:08:44.680]   and a quieter platform, we'll probably make them more
[02:08:44.680 --> 02:08:45.920]   than the advertising will.
[02:08:45.920 --> 02:08:47.520]   It's just an unforced error.
[02:08:47.520 --> 02:08:51.160]   - They need somebody like Jason Snell did at his magazine
[02:08:51.160 --> 02:08:53.200]   to step forward and say, no, no.
[02:08:53.200 --> 02:08:55.840]   - That's, look, it's so hard to turn down extra money.
[02:08:55.840 --> 02:08:59.360]   And I get it, and so, especially, I will say,
[02:08:59.360 --> 02:09:04.360]   when you're at a tech magazine company in the 2010s,
[02:09:04.640 --> 02:09:08.080]   you're in a way more dire financial rate than Apple is.
[02:09:08.080 --> 02:09:10.840]   But even there, like, even there,
[02:09:10.840 --> 02:09:14.680]   it's so hard to turn down more money, right?
[02:09:14.680 --> 02:09:17.840]   Because the answer is, what they'll say to you
[02:09:17.840 --> 02:09:20.760]   is the ad salespeople, like this guy, will say,
[02:09:20.760 --> 02:09:21.720]   but it's just more money.
[02:09:21.720 --> 02:09:22.720]   There's no downside.
[02:09:22.720 --> 02:09:23.560]   There's more money.
[02:09:23.560 --> 02:09:26.360]   And the answer is, there is no such thing as a free lunch.
[02:09:26.360 --> 02:09:28.200]   There is always a downside.
[02:09:28.200 --> 02:09:31.200]   But the downside is the bigger picture.
[02:09:31.200 --> 02:09:33.880]   And you need someone who sees the bigger picture.
[02:09:33.880 --> 02:09:37.280]   And that's why, again, I can't really demonize this guy
[02:09:37.280 --> 02:09:38.760]   who I already called a villain,
[02:09:38.760 --> 02:09:40.120]   because he's doing his job.
[02:09:40.120 --> 02:09:42.040]   The problem is, who gave him his job?
[02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:45.320]   Who gave him his incentives to do his job?
[02:09:45.320 --> 02:09:48.360]   And who is looking at what he does
[02:09:48.360 --> 02:09:50.200]   and evaluating whether it makes sense
[02:09:50.200 --> 02:09:52.280]   for Apple's business as a whole?
[02:09:52.280 --> 02:09:55.200]   And I get the feeling that up to now,
[02:09:55.200 --> 02:09:57.400]   they basically let him do whatever he wants.
[02:09:57.400 --> 02:10:02.080]   And somebody needs to say, Todd, that's off limits.
[02:10:02.080 --> 02:10:04.160]   And I don't think anybody has yet.
[02:10:04.160 --> 02:10:05.320]   - That's leadership.
[02:10:05.320 --> 02:10:08.440]   Where you're taking the whole list view of the company,
[02:10:08.440 --> 02:10:11.160]   not just this bottom line revenue.
[02:10:11.160 --> 02:10:12.720]   We deal with the same thing.
[02:10:12.720 --> 02:10:16.040]   Most, every time I've worked in radio,
[02:10:16.040 --> 02:10:18.200]   you take every advertiser walks in the door.
[02:10:18.200 --> 02:10:21.640]   It doesn't matter how horrible they are.
[02:10:21.640 --> 02:10:23.960]   And when I started to it, I said, no,
[02:10:23.960 --> 02:10:25.360]   I really would like to make sure that,
[02:10:25.360 --> 02:10:27.040]   I would like to say no to advertisers.
[02:10:27.040 --> 02:10:28.640]   I wanna make sure that we only have ads
[02:10:28.640 --> 02:10:30.560]   that I can legitimately endorse.
[02:10:30.560 --> 02:10:34.360]   And that's a hard, especially when companies are troubled,
[02:10:34.360 --> 02:10:36.560]   that's a hard line to hold.
[02:10:36.560 --> 02:10:39.240]   - It is brutal to be the person who says,
[02:10:39.240 --> 02:10:42.400]   let's not take this check that this guy is handing us.
[02:10:42.400 --> 02:10:44.600]   But that's why you have to be adult enough
[02:10:44.600 --> 02:10:45.720]   to have the big picture thing,
[02:10:45.720 --> 02:10:48.240]   which is like, what does this do to my business
[02:10:48.240 --> 02:10:49.400]   if I take this check?
[02:10:49.400 --> 02:10:51.720]   Does it make my product worse
[02:10:51.720 --> 02:10:54.960]   and my customers who are my listeners or readers
[02:10:54.960 --> 02:10:59.120]   or viewers or whatever or iPhone users less happy?
[02:10:59.120 --> 02:11:01.200]   And does that have a knock on effect
[02:11:01.200 --> 02:11:02.520]   that I need to worry about big pictures?
[02:11:02.520 --> 02:11:04.240]   'Cause the salesperson is in,
[02:11:04.240 --> 02:11:05.640]   their incentive is to sell
[02:11:05.640 --> 02:11:07.680]   because they get a, probably a commission, right?
[02:11:07.680 --> 02:11:09.440]   They're probably even a percentage attached to it.
[02:11:09.440 --> 02:11:10.520]   Their job is not to think.
[02:11:10.520 --> 02:11:11.440]   It's like, they're like a shark.
[02:11:11.440 --> 02:11:13.400]   - Well, not only that, somebody's cracking a whip,
[02:11:13.400 --> 02:11:15.640]   saying sell more, sell more, sell more.
[02:11:15.640 --> 02:11:17.040]   So they're not incentivized.
[02:11:17.040 --> 02:11:17.880]   - They're not incentivized.
[02:11:17.880 --> 02:11:19.720]   - No, no, and it's the job of management to say,
[02:11:19.720 --> 02:11:20.840]   okay, not that one. - Yes.
[02:11:20.840 --> 02:11:23.560]   - And thank God I have Lisa who understands,
[02:11:23.560 --> 02:11:25.600]   and I have approval on every advertiser,
[02:11:25.600 --> 02:11:26.800]   she understands, you know,
[02:11:26.800 --> 02:11:28.480]   sometimes we're gonna say no to advertisers.
[02:11:28.480 --> 02:11:31.880]   Sometimes we go, there was a company about
[02:11:31.880 --> 02:11:33.680]   eight, nine, 10 months ago,
[02:11:33.680 --> 02:11:38.680]   they wanted to sell Bitcoin in your 401K.
[02:11:38.680 --> 02:11:40.960]   (laughing)
[02:11:40.960 --> 02:11:43.240]   And I said, I don't think we wanna do that one.
[02:11:43.240 --> 02:11:44.240]   Thank God.
[02:11:44.240 --> 02:11:48.160]   - Alex is getting tea, so, you know, we're all--
[02:11:48.160 --> 02:11:51.080]   - They're getting the email, but then Jason's got the email
[02:11:51.080 --> 02:11:53.520]   but then open the email.
[02:11:53.520 --> 02:11:55.800]   And Andy was there, Andy was trying.
[02:11:57.040 --> 02:11:58.880]   We can switch if you wanna try it.
[02:11:58.880 --> 02:12:03.040]   - Andy gets the gold medal for today.
[02:12:03.040 --> 02:12:03.880]   - Andy does get the gold medal for--
[02:12:03.880 --> 02:12:04.920]   - Thank you very much.
[02:12:04.920 --> 02:12:07.960]   - Alex is back here now.
[02:12:07.960 --> 02:12:10.120]   - I try to be a healthy person who doesn't check his email
[02:12:10.120 --> 02:12:11.040]   all the time.
[02:12:11.040 --> 02:12:15.320]   - Alex, we're trying Zoom ISO, so if you've got the email
[02:12:15.320 --> 02:12:17.160]   you got from a John.
[02:12:17.160 --> 02:12:19.320]   - Okay, so let me-- - You want us to go over there?
[02:12:19.320 --> 02:12:20.640]   - I didn't see that.
[02:12:20.640 --> 02:12:23.160]   - I'm happy to go over there if we wanna--
[02:12:23.160 --> 02:12:24.160]   - Yeah, me too.
[02:12:24.160 --> 02:12:27.320]   - What we're gonna do is have you log off this link.
[02:12:27.320 --> 02:12:28.160]   - Yeah.
[02:12:28.160 --> 02:12:30.960]   - And you'll all be logging into the same link this time.
[02:12:30.960 --> 02:12:31.800]   Yes?
[02:12:31.800 --> 02:12:33.680]   - Ooh, it's a good combination.
[02:12:33.680 --> 02:12:35.200]   - Yeah, so we should see each other all there.
[02:12:35.200 --> 02:12:36.800]   So I'll log out on this one.
[02:12:36.800 --> 02:12:38.160]   - Okay, here we go.
[02:12:38.160 --> 02:12:39.320]   - Okay, we're gonna do it.
[02:12:39.320 --> 02:12:41.200]   - That was a great place for that sticker,
[02:12:41.200 --> 02:12:42.040]   you should leave it on.
[02:12:42.040 --> 02:12:42.880]   - We're doing it live.
[02:12:42.880 --> 02:12:43.800]   We're doing it live.
[02:12:43.800 --> 02:12:45.200]   - That was pretty funny.
[02:12:45.200 --> 02:12:47.720]   - I'm gonna let John work the magic.
[02:12:47.720 --> 02:12:48.560]   He knows what he's doing.
[02:12:48.560 --> 02:12:49.400]   I don't.
[02:12:49.400 --> 02:12:52.240]   - I'm just here.
[02:12:52.240 --> 02:12:53.560]   Hang out with Leo, we're gonna--
[02:12:53.560 --> 02:12:55.800]   - So we're gonna move over to Zoom ISO.
[02:12:55.800 --> 02:12:59.080]   - Yes, and I have to do some stuff on my end too.
[02:12:59.080 --> 02:13:00.320]   - I realize so.
[02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:06.320]   So the video goes from an M1 Mac Mini to Zoom ISO,
[02:13:06.320 --> 02:13:07.760]   which is that software or hardware?
[02:13:07.760 --> 02:13:08.760]   - Software.
[02:13:08.760 --> 02:13:13.720]   - Into a Razer Core X external GPU enclosure,
[02:13:13.720 --> 02:13:17.720]   which contains a black magic deck link Duo 2,
[02:13:17.720 --> 02:13:22.880]   which then converts it into a form that our video hub can use.
[02:13:22.880 --> 02:13:27.040]   Now, audio is more complicated because we use AES
[02:13:27.040 --> 02:13:29.000]   in a live wire with the Axia system.
[02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.640]   So we go Mac Mini and Zoom ISO
[02:13:31.640 --> 02:13:35.480]   into emerging technology virtual audio device
[02:13:35.480 --> 02:13:39.040]   for Mac that does the AES
[02:13:39.040 --> 02:13:43.040]   and that sends that into our Axia AESX node
[02:13:43.040 --> 02:13:45.520]   and from there into live wire.
[02:13:45.520 --> 02:13:47.920]   So the audio change.
[02:13:47.920 --> 02:13:49.040]   - So many technical terms.
[02:13:49.040 --> 02:13:50.040]   - Totally, very sense.
[02:13:50.040 --> 02:13:50.880]   It's very complicated. - It's very complicated.
[02:13:50.880 --> 02:13:53.120]   - So that-- - The audio eyes are coming through.
[02:13:53.120 --> 02:13:55.400]   I'm gonna wait for John to come and take a video up.
[02:13:55.400 --> 02:13:58.120]   - I'm gonna walk back and forth between buildings.
[02:13:58.120 --> 02:13:58.960]   - Okay.
[02:13:58.960 --> 02:14:00.760]   - You had to walk back and forth between buildings.
[02:14:00.760 --> 02:14:03.560]   He's over in building two is where all the stuff is.
[02:14:03.560 --> 02:14:05.840]   - Oh, building two.
[02:14:05.840 --> 02:14:08.200]   I didn't know there was a building two.
[02:14:08.200 --> 02:14:10.320]   - Carrying, carrying packets.
[02:14:10.320 --> 02:14:11.920]   Carrying packets on a flash drive.
[02:14:11.920 --> 02:14:14.320]   That's a contingency problem.
[02:14:14.320 --> 02:14:17.480]   - I'm gonna check some of the--
[02:14:17.480 --> 02:14:19.040]   - I like that though, building two.
[02:14:20.040 --> 02:14:21.880]   - I'm gonna muck around.
[02:14:21.880 --> 02:14:24.440]   I'm here observing at the third party.
[02:14:24.440 --> 02:14:27.320]   - Oh, and I have hidden non-video participants.
[02:14:27.320 --> 02:14:28.320]   That's nice.
[02:14:28.320 --> 02:14:29.560]   - Yeah, just to ignore that.
[02:14:29.560 --> 02:14:30.680]   - Who cares about those guys?
[02:14:30.680 --> 02:14:32.400]   - Forget that. - Recording in progress.
[02:14:32.400 --> 02:14:34.160]   - Oh my God, you have to say that.
[02:14:34.160 --> 02:14:35.320]   - Recording in progress.
[02:14:35.320 --> 02:14:37.760]   - You can actually hit turn the voice off
[02:14:37.760 --> 02:14:39.840]   in your medium settings in your accounts.
[02:14:39.840 --> 02:14:41.600]   - Alex knows all about this.
[02:14:41.600 --> 02:14:43.000]   He's the one who's--
[02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:44.560]   - Pull up, pull up, pull up.
[02:14:44.560 --> 02:14:46.800]   (laughing)
[02:14:46.800 --> 02:14:47.640]   - That makes sense. - Stahl.
[02:14:47.640 --> 02:14:48.640]   - Stahl.
[02:14:48.640 --> 02:14:50.000]   - Now we can all see each other.
[02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:51.720]   - Yeah, now when somebody else is talking
[02:14:51.720 --> 02:14:53.400]   and I'm picking my nose, you're gonna see it.
[02:14:53.400 --> 02:14:54.240]   - Oh, you get it.
[02:14:54.240 --> 02:14:55.080]   - Enjoy that.
[02:14:55.080 --> 02:14:56.000]   - I'm looking around.
[02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:56.840]   - Yeah, exactly.
[02:14:56.840 --> 02:14:57.680]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[02:14:57.680 --> 02:14:59.680]   So now our guest, our panelists,
[02:14:59.680 --> 02:15:01.120]   we'll see a four box.
[02:15:01.120 --> 02:15:01.960]   What will they see?
[02:15:01.960 --> 02:15:03.120]   - Yeah. - Yeah, we see a four box.
[02:15:03.120 --> 02:15:04.040]   - We're seeing a four box.
[02:15:04.040 --> 02:15:04.880]   - Okay.
[02:15:04.880 --> 02:15:06.920]   So basically, note to self-andy.
[02:15:06.920 --> 02:15:09.000]   The next time, you wanna go
[02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.800]   at someone's, do you realize that people
[02:15:11.800 --> 02:15:12.640]   can actually see you?
[02:15:12.640 --> 02:15:14.040]   So don't know. - Andy's frozen for me.
[02:15:14.040 --> 02:15:15.040]   - He's frozen for me too.
[02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:16.320]   - Yeah. - He's frozen on my end.
[02:15:16.320 --> 02:15:17.800]   I'm seeing Alex and Jason.
[02:15:17.800 --> 02:15:20.400]   - So, okay, hang on, you're frozen at my end too.
[02:15:20.400 --> 02:15:22.200]   - So there.
[02:15:22.200 --> 02:15:24.240]   - Just hang up and do it again, it probably is.
[02:15:24.240 --> 02:15:25.880]   - Andy's frozen.
[02:15:25.880 --> 02:15:27.600]   - Okay, hang on, leaving it coming back.
[02:15:27.600 --> 02:15:29.000]   - But you should also notice--
[02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:29.840]   - Are you gonna have to build the stone?
[02:15:29.840 --> 02:15:31.160]   - And you're doing STI out?
[02:15:31.160 --> 02:15:32.280]   - No. - Yes, yes.
[02:15:32.280 --> 02:15:33.360]   - Yes. - Yeah.
[02:15:33.360 --> 02:15:36.320]   - So you'll hopefully notice that the color
[02:15:36.320 --> 02:15:38.400]   and the frame rate is better.
[02:15:38.400 --> 02:15:39.840]   Then doing a screen scrape.
[02:15:39.840 --> 02:15:41.280]   - Yes. - Okay.
[02:15:41.280 --> 02:15:43.160]   - Sweet. - We got two or three.
[02:15:43.160 --> 02:15:44.160]   - We're living the dream here.
[02:15:44.160 --> 02:15:45.640]   - And now, the main thing,
[02:15:45.640 --> 02:15:47.160]   the main reason I wanted to do this
[02:15:47.160 --> 02:15:49.440]   is to eliminate that audio latency issue.
[02:15:49.440 --> 02:15:50.840]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[02:15:50.840 --> 02:15:53.000]   - And now they can all talk at the same time
[02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:54.080]   and everything right like that.
[02:15:54.080 --> 02:15:54.920]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[02:15:54.920 --> 02:15:57.320]   - Not that we would.
[02:15:57.320 --> 02:15:58.680]   - No, of course not. - Like you.
[02:15:58.680 --> 02:15:59.920]   - Heaven's for Venn.
[02:15:59.920 --> 02:16:01.240]   - Oh, come on, man.
[02:16:01.240 --> 02:16:02.800]   - There we go, I hear you. - There we go.
[02:16:02.800 --> 02:16:04.000]   - And he's there, he's moving.
[02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:05.600]   - Okay. - You're very close.
[02:16:05.600 --> 02:16:06.600]   He's moving. - Yeah.
[02:16:06.600 --> 02:16:07.640]   - Yeah. - Okay, good.
[02:16:07.640 --> 02:16:10.960]   - You can see me, but I can't see me for some reason.
[02:16:10.960 --> 02:16:13.400]   - I don't know if we can see you, all I see is cool.
[02:16:13.400 --> 02:16:15.800]   - Yeah, right now, it's coming in.
[02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:18.800]   - John is doing something real quick though.
[02:16:18.800 --> 02:16:21.520]   - Does it take a while to a sync up or something?
[02:16:21.520 --> 02:16:25.840]   - You can't see me.
[02:16:25.840 --> 02:16:28.480]   - You can't see me. - Oh, this is interesting.
[02:16:28.480 --> 02:16:30.760]   So we're not seeing the Leo one shot,
[02:16:30.760 --> 02:16:35.080]   we're seeing the Leo's feed is the live show feed, I see.
[02:16:35.080 --> 02:16:36.960]   - Yes, that's right.
[02:16:36.960 --> 02:16:37.960]   - So we'll know why we're on. - So we'll know why we're on.
[02:16:37.960 --> 02:16:40.040]   - You need to have a live show feed.
[02:16:40.040 --> 02:16:41.320]   - Yeah, that's right. - So make a note of that
[02:16:41.320 --> 02:16:43.560]   in your mind that that's what the audience is seeing
[02:16:43.560 --> 02:16:45.960]   so that you know, and you know you can pick your nose
[02:16:45.960 --> 02:16:47.480]   'cause only Andy and Alex will see it.
[02:16:47.480 --> 02:16:49.400]   - Yeah, that's right, they don't care.
[02:16:49.400 --> 02:16:50.480]   They're with me. - They don't, they've been there.
[02:16:50.480 --> 02:16:52.120]   - We know what we do. - We know what we do.
[02:16:52.120 --> 02:16:53.800]   - Bugs in your nose. - Do you know what you do?
[02:16:53.800 --> 02:16:54.840]   - You gotta get them out.
[02:16:54.840 --> 02:16:57.720]   - Yeah, in office hours, we have another participant
[02:16:57.720 --> 02:17:00.960]   that's programmed, you know, that's in, we use.
[02:17:00.960 --> 02:17:02.240]   - I guess that's what we're doing.
[02:17:02.240 --> 02:17:04.000]   We have a program participant.
[02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:05.400]   - Let's do my so, yeah.
[02:17:05.400 --> 02:17:08.160]   - So can you still can't see me?
[02:17:08.160 --> 02:17:09.000]   - No, we do. - Okay, near.
[02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:10.720]   - Okay, and you're just gonna send it back to us
[02:17:10.720 --> 02:17:12.240]   as the show. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:17:12.240 --> 02:17:13.800]   That's fine. - We don't have a sales participant.
[02:17:13.800 --> 02:17:15.480]   The participant is the show.
[02:17:15.480 --> 02:17:16.440]   - In other words, I don't get a sale.
[02:17:16.440 --> 02:17:18.080]   - Got it, okay. - Yep.
[02:17:18.080 --> 02:17:20.920]   - I was saying, I was saying a blank square
[02:17:20.920 --> 02:17:22.920]   that says Zoom ISO and I assume that it was like
[02:17:22.920 --> 02:17:25.760]   my lack of video, but okay, that's fine.
[02:17:25.760 --> 02:17:27.120]   - It feels snappier already.
[02:17:27.120 --> 02:17:27.960]   - What do you...

[02:17:59.320 --> 02:18:01.520]   - Hey, we're having a Zoom rave.
[02:18:01.520 --> 02:18:04.760]   What is that coming from? - Zoom boxing.
[02:18:04.760 --> 02:18:06.280]   - I'm not talking into the mic.
[02:18:06.280 --> 02:18:09.040]   - It's like a Leo audio lute. - It's so cool.
[02:18:09.040 --> 02:18:11.040]   - It's happening right now.
[02:18:11.040 --> 02:18:14.240]   It's all in my mind, I'm still at home.
[02:18:14.240 --> 02:18:16.280]   - With her. - With mastodon running
[02:18:16.280 --> 02:18:17.360]   all over my body.
[02:18:17.360 --> 02:18:20.400]   - Social media from your brain.
[02:18:20.400 --> 02:18:24.840]   Dynasty.
[02:18:24.840 --> 02:18:31.000]   Out here in the perimeter, there are no stars.
[02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:32.040]   - This is going out here.
[02:18:32.040 --> 02:18:34.400]   We are stones. - I just gotta.
[02:18:34.400 --> 02:18:35.640]   - Can't immaculate.
[02:18:35.640 --> 02:18:38.840]   - I just gotta like this.
[02:18:38.840 --> 02:18:40.360]   This is the end.
