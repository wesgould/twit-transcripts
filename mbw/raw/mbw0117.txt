[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Thanks so much for your contribution.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   We couldn't do to it without it.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   We're going to do this the way that our forefathers did.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   It is.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   It's a forefather's.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   Exactly.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   >> It's like the pilgrims for the first Thanksgiving where, you know,
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   wired headsets and, you know, mobility processors and that.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   >> Wow.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   It is kind of like that.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   >> It's pretty clear though.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   I think everybody's got a big perspective.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   >> Can I just say it's good to have the four of us back together again?
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   >> Yay.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   >> Yay.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   >> So, and by the way, cast to the fourth wins because Alex,
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   you're in Japan, right?
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   >> Yes.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   >> So, we got New Mexico, Boston, California, and New Mexico and Japan.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   It's awesome.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   This is this week in all over the world.

[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   >> Oh, dear.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Oh, dear.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Oh, dear, oh, dear.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   What are you doing in Japan for those who are tuning in and haven't been paying attention
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   over the past few weeks?
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   >> I am coordinating visual effects for a movie called Memoirs of Teenage Amnesiac.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   >> Is that true?
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   >> Are you joking?
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   >> Based on a book called Memoirs of Teenage Amnesiac, and it's -- but it's been Hans Kedosa
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   who did Conversations with the Women in Quacy Collison, who's the visual effects supervisor,
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   asked me to come on out.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   So, we're actually -- the Pixel 4 will be doing visual effects for the film.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   There's probably about 160 shots to do for the film.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   And, I mean, some stuff real simple and some stuff more complicated.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   And so, we're -- so, I'm out here to make sure that we don't bite off more on the set
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   than we can chew in post.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   So, it's fun.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   You know, the crew -- the Japanese crew is so fast.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   I mean, I've just never seen anything like it.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   So, we're having a great time.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   And I'm just in Rapungee Tokyo.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   And I'm going to be here for the next month.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   >> Rapungee is a neighborhood?
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   >> Yes.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Yes, it's a neighborhood inside of Tokyo.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   And it is -- it is probably, you know, the embassies are all here.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   And it is also -- ironically, it's also a big club scene.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   I evidently write up my hit right up the street.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   And so -- and there's just a lot -- it's not, you know, I guess --
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   I guess it's where I was there yesterday.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   And it was -- it's what you think of when you think of Tokyo with just like lights and
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   signs and everything everywhere.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   But this is still pretty out there, but it's not -- it's a little more subdued.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   And I'm having a great time.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   >> And of course, you have so much bandwidth that we can Skype you.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   And it actually sounds better than when you're in San Francisco.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   So, that's -- it does.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   It's amazing.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   At least my little T1 way behind.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   >> It's kind of amazing.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   >> First thing I do, almost -- any time I get a connection, the first thing I do is I go
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   to speedtest.net and I just see what -- what I'm writing.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   >> Yeah, me too.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   >> And it is 24 megabits up and down.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   >> Up and down.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   >> Up and down.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   >> Up and down.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   >> 24 megabits.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   >> On your phone.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   >> You just hit the button.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   You know, you -- when you go to iTunes to buy like heroes or something like that, you
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   know, it's 1.5 gigabytes or whatever.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   And it takes like 10 minutes.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   >> Wow.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   >> You know, it's -- it just -- it just sits right down.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   And it's pretty solid.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   It's never -- in fact, I've been watching the -- through I stat menu, I've been watching
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   the stats and I -- even though it sustained at 24, I think I'm getting at times peaks
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   at 50 to 60 megabits a second.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   >> And this is in a hotel?
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   >> Yeah, it's an apartment company.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   It's like a -- you know, it's like a resident apartment thing because I'm here for a month.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   >> Well, as if this were enough of a challenge, we're going to try to add one more name to
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   the mix.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   >> You know, Will Shipley, William John Shipley from Delicious Monster that created the incredible
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Delicious Library.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   And in fact, his programming style has created a whole new way of talking about Mac software.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   They call it the Delicious Generation.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Will, are you there?
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   >> It's amazing.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   We finally got him on.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Hi, Will.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   >> Patty.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.600]   >> Welcome to Mac Break Weekly on the line with us also.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:12.000]   As I mentioned, Scott Born from the Twip Photo folks this week in photography, TwipPhoto.com.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   And he's in New Mexico, Scott.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   I mean, there's a core old New Mexico leading a bird photography workshop.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   And to that end, I do want to let you know that Leo, I got it hard out in about 60 minutes.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   >> Good.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   So does everybody.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Also, Andy Inako from the Chicago sometimes, and they celestial waste Japan with.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Hi, Andy.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   >> Hello.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   >> And we were just talking to Alex Lindsey, who is in Japan.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   He's in Tokyo working on a movie.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   >> Konnichiwa.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   >> Konnichiwa.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   >> So if you direct your browsers to your hymnals to mbwi.com, you'll see quite a few stories.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   The biggest, I think, Apple recommends Mac users install antivirus software.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   >> I saw that.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   That's kind of -- >> Well, they're being slight about it.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   They put out a tech note, a knowledge-based article.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   >> They didn't exactly call the major media networks and say, "Hey, you should do this."
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   >> But they must have known.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   I mean, well, maybe not.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Because they put it out November 21st, and we're just kind of -- everybody's just kind of figured
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   it out now.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   I guess it took somebody to notice it and then put it out to the Mac media.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   Apple says, "Don't all use the same antivirus, either."
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   >> I have more than one.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   How many antivirus?
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   >> There's two.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   >> There's several.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Apple recommends Intigo virus barrier excess, semantics Norton antivirus 11, McAfee virus scan
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   for Mac.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   And there also is another one that they didn't recommend, Clamix AV, which is free.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   >> This is the CYA to make sure that -- >> I think someone doesn't say, "Well, you
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   know, I can see a class-accident suit if something came out."
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   And Apple has been kind of arrogant about there's no viruses, and people will say, "Well,
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   you missed me."
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Blah, blah, blah.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   >> Well, wait, it really is long overdue, don't you think?
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   >> I don't know.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Are you going to run out and put an antivirus in your Mac?
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   >> I'm not sure, but I really think that Apple has been just daring everybody to start
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   creating exploits for Mac OS.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   We all know that there have been vulnerabilities.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   We all know that so far it appears that there haven't been any pieces of malware in the
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   mail, but that's not for lack of opportunities.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   I really think that they are trying -- it's wise to start thinking about this now rather
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   than wait three, four months, even a year, even two, whenever that first piece of Apple
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   remote access security whole software comes in, and people realize, "Oh, so my machine
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   has, according to this software, my machine has been vulnerable for the past three months,
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   well done Apple."
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   >> And it is becoming more of an issue as you see the stats of Apple's percentage becoming
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   larger and larger of the overall market.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   Bigger target.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   >> I think part of the problem has got to be that, I mean, how do you write virus software
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   for viruses that don't exist yet?
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Is it really effective?
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   What are they scanning for?
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   I mean, that's a very good point.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   >> Well, they're really easy or really hard.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   There are already like markers.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   In Mac hacking boards, there are exploits that have been written sort of as proof of concept.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   Like there is a way to get root access via Apple script, via Apple remote access.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   I think that whole -- I have to double check to find out.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   I'm trying to remember whether this is one of those holes that got closed in 10.4, but
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   then reopened again in 10.5.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   And so there have been bits of code that have been seen as sort of samples of, "Here's
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   how you would get this working."
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   Maybe such a tool would simply say, "Oh, well, we know that there are 18 really important
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   security holes that a Trojan horse would exploit.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   You currently have 18 of those open.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Would you like to figure out how to close them?"
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   >> I just got any questions.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   >> Go ahead.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   >> I was just going to close by saying, "I'm just glad to see that we are putting this kind
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   of security at least within the cultural consciousness of Mac users."
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Because I think it should be there.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   >> I always worry about this from the simplest standpoint.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   And I know that it's probably crazy, but I always think to myself, "What actual motive
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   and incentive that the antivirus companies have to stop all viruses?"
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   >> Brian Krebs, who discovered this in his -- he writes the really excellent security fix
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   column in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   He's the guy first to notice this.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   He said he's been running semantics antivirus for nearly two years, and it's never said
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   that he's been running semantics.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   >> Which makes you wonder, is it doing anything?
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   He also mentions --
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   >> Yes, he's selecting his money.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   >> Really?
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   He mentions a secure Mac, which offers a free Trojan detection tool.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   I guess, Will, if you were going to write a virus for the Mac, it would have to be elegant,
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   you know, have a certain look and feel to keep up with it.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   >> And everybody would want to have it.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   >> The delicious --
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   >> Yeah, exactly.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   The delicious generation virus.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   >> We heard this, we heard this is going to be a new virus on Wednesday, so we camped out
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   on Monday to the Apple.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   >> The line.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   It's got the brush metal look on it.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   >> Well, I mean, it probably wouldn't spread unless, you know, it had some sort of, you know,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   leakiness to it, otherwise, you know, why would anybody get it?
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   I mean, who would want it?
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   >> I think that might be one of the reasons you don't see a lot of viruses on the Mac platform.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   Do you think Mac users are less likely to do the kinds of things that cause problems?
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   >> I think that's a good point.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   One of the observations that I have at Macworld, I was at a Windows conference years ago, and
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   the one thing that I noticed was there was a lot more administrators, and I realized that,
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   you know, in many ways, you know, we think of Macs being easy to use, but partially because
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   you can dig into them, you go to a Macworld and you really see more geeks.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   You know, you're more people who are really into their personal computer, not managing
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   lots of computers, and I do think that, oftentimes, I think, is an over --
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   I think it's an big generalization, but a lot of PC users are people who aren't, you know,
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   they bought a cheaper computer there, you know, that they turned it on, and it's working,
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   and they don't do it with it as much, and I think that actually leads to more behavior
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   that would lead to viruses.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   >> I agree.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   I think that Mac users are more likely to be running the tools that would fix these problems
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   than Windows users would be.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   I mean, I'm sure that everybody in this chat is the unofficial tech support for the entire
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   family or the extended family, and how many times have you said, "Yeah, you know that,
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   you know, every time of the past three years that Windows XP has said, "Hey, there's a
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   new service pack available," and you said, "No, that's not worth my time," you really
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   should have done that.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   >> Yeah, I think Mac people in general stay more up-to-date with software, and to be fair
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   to Windows, I don't think, you know, if Windows users had stayed current with Microsoft's
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   patches, I think they really aren't at a as huge a risk, but the problem is that in general,
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   they don't stay current, and so they don't get the patches.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   I mean, if you stay current with Apple's patches, you're generally pretty well off.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   I mean, I've never gotten any problems on my Mac, so.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   >> I'll be honest, don't tell anybody, especially not my antivirus advertiser on the radio show,
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   but I haven't run a antivirus on Windows or Mac in ages, and it's really because my behavior,
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   I know what to do, right?
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   >> Right.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   >> And I think if you are paying attention, and I do think more Mac users pay attention,
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   you're less likely to get one.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   Maybe it's a prejudice, but I just have this image of Windows users as being just kind of,
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   "Ooh, let's download the latest pictures of Enochorna Kova, hehe."
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   >> Well, I think that there's definitely a section of probably the same size section
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   of Windows users, you know, the 8 to 10 percent, that are as dee-key and as into their computers
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   as there are on the Mac side, but I think that there's 90 percent of them that aren't.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   And I think that's what it allows this creates an environment for this to really move around.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   >> Well, in any event, I don't feel the sudden need to do it.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   I imagine Apple will stop ribbing Vista for its virus-frown nature.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   Now, they've got to take those ads out.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   In fact, that was the very first switch ad was the one where a PC gets a sniffle and falls over.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   >> Yeah, I think we're going to see a twist on Clinton's response to drug allegations
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   saying, "Okay, there might have been some exploits in my OS's past, but we were never infected."
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   [laughter]
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   >> I'm still trying to find the Enochorna Kova pictures.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   >> Yes, yes, you'd be the one when you...
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   >> I'll tell you, Chattling, good, right?
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   >> Okay, thank you, thank you.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   >> I always do.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   >> I date myself when I say that, because that's an old Windows virus,
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   and I don't think anybody's looking for Enochorna Kova pictures anymore.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   [laughter]
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   I don't know, the newer pictures are of somebody else, but it's the same idea, same thing.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   Anyway, I guess the word has gone forth from Cupertino using antivirus.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   I mean, this is a windfall for Norton and McAfee.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   >> I still think it's a lawyer, it's really...
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   >> This is more from the lawyers than from the tech section.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   >> I feel no need to tell all our listeners, "Run out and get one."
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   >> Right.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   >> But I'd ask Chattling about a big press release.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   They just quietly put it in there, because that's the way you would do it if you're just covering your butt.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   >> If you were to tell them to get one, of these that are listed on the Apple news site, or the tech site, which one would you prefer?
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   >> No, I like Intigo.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   I think they make good stuff.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   Their firewall is very good, and I think they're a good company.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   I have historic animus towards Symantec and McAfee.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   They just made such bloated products for Windows that I hesitated.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   I always made me nervous the idea of putting those on a Mac.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   But I think ultimately, ClamXAV, which is absolutely free and open source,
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   it's not like there's a whole lot to keeping your signatures up to date for the Mac,
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   so anyone will work as long as it has a decent engine.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   I'd say go get ClamXAV.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   >> Apple does not make any single recommendation.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   >> In the year 2754 they'll have version two, because that'll have all the new updates.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   >> Exactly.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   It's not, you know, it's Apple support document HT2550 if you want to read it yourself.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   Summary, learn about antivirus utilities available for the Mac OS.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   It was put out on the 21st of November, last modified, actually December 2nd.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   Apple encourages the widespread use of multiple antivirus utilities so that
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   virus programmers have more than one application to circumvent, thus making the whole virus writing process more difficult.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   Here are some available antivirus utilities, American and Tego, Symantec and McAfee.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   And that's it.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   I mean, it's not a lot to it.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   In fact, it doesn't, it really, if you read it carefully, the recommendation is not that you get an antivirus,
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   but that nobody just, you know, nobody all buy the same one.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   >> Widespread use, I guess no, that's true, they say the widespread use of multiple antivirus utilities.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   >> Okay, well, let's just have everybody with the names beginning from A to L, you get some.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   >> Yeah, we should do that.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   >> You know, I'm surprised Steve didn't do that.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   The map, the King of Maple, did you see that?
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   I love that.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   >> That's funny.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   >> Since, since, since take on the Apple, that's all.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   >> Yeah, yeah, Apple.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   >> Apple, please spot on.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   >> If, if we, if the mixer weren't down and I had full capabilities, I'd play it for you right now.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   Thereby violating every possible known trademark, but it's, so it's not out of fear.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   It's not out of lack of courage.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   It's merely out of lack of capability to play it for you.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   >> I'd like to see it, but of course I can't, in Japan.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   >> You can't?
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   >> Oh, I can't get to YouTube.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   >> You can get to, oh, is it on YouTube?
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   >> No, I didn't see it there.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   >> Until, until Fox, the Fox takes it down.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   >> I went to Hulu.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   Yeah, we ruined everything now.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   >> You can't do it on Hulu, yeah.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   >> Hulu, Fox, you know, it, it's not on YouTube.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   It's actually a great little application that, that fixes that, that I just didn't have on
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   at the moment.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   It's called, it's called Hot Spot Shield, and by Anker-Free Software.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   It's not my recommendation for the, for the week, but it's basically Bloxer.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   I, VPN's your IP to the US.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   >> You know what?
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   You can do it on YouTube.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   Hulu has put it on YouTube on the Hulu channel.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   >> Okay, there you go.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   >> So, unless YouTube is also blocking.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   >> Well, what's going down?
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   >> Yeah, and there's two different, it's really very funny.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   Lisa walks in and, the map will store, I wish I could play this for you.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   It's very fun.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   Go see it.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   It's on the hulu.com channel on, on YouTube.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   In fact, it's in high quality.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   So you can, you can actually see it.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   >> Yeah, I wonder how that works with Hulu with international where they can't put it on their
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   own website, but if they put it on YouTube, well, there it goes.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   >> Yeah, yeah, well don't, I was going to say don't do it now, but if you've got 26 megabytes,
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   you could probably do it now.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   We wouldn't even notice that you were watching video.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   >> Exactly.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   >> So, I want to talk to you a little bit, Will, about what's up with Delicious.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   I know the latest version of Delicious Library came out a few months ago and you're probably
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   relaxing on the beach and enjoying the fruits of your labor.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   >> God, I wish.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   That was nice.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   >> We're going to do that in a second.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   Also, there's much more Mac news where that came from.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   This is a big week for Mac news, including Juiced, a special deal on Fusion, which is still good
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   today, Cyber Monday, so you might want to run out.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   And a new landmark for the Apple store, for the iPhone.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   Before we do that, though, I want to mention our good friends at audible.com, a-u-d-i-b-l-e.com/macbreak.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   That's the place to go to get a special deal, a credit toward any book in the Audible Library,
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   51,000 titles.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   I've just finished a wonderful, I'm, you know, I go back and forth between fiction and non-fiction
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   and serious and light, and I just finished a really great classic Larry Niven sci-fi novel
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   called Protector that is just, was just a gripping story.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   I just couldn't put it down.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   It feels a little dated, you know?
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   I mean, it's, when you read sci-fi where people are smoking cigarettes, you know, it comes
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   from a different era.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.400]   But at the same time, this comes from the era when sci-fi was really more about the ideas
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.000]   than it was about plot or characterization.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   It was about, you know, interesting ideas and liven's always been full of really interesting,
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   hard science ideas.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   So I really enjoyed the protector.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   Now, we let, Andy, we didn't let you give your recommendation last week, so I'm going
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   to do two recommendations this week and let you do yours because I put you off last week.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   That's okay.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   But it's good that this recommendation goes out sooner rather than later because it is a holiday
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   tradition in the Enocho households, or at least the, well, not my parents, I don't think
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   they were a big fan of books on tape, but myself.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   But sometimes shortly after Thanksgiving, I get out and load up onto my iPod, Patrick Stewart's
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   audiobook of A Christmas Carrot.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   It is an absolute magnificent performance.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   Now, the thing is that the only trouble with this story is that you have heard it so many
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   times diluted through so many like cartoon filters and the married with children version
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.440]   and the happy days version that you kind of forget how cool the original story actually
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:28.440]   is.
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:32.560]   And Patrick Stewart fell in love with this book early on in his career and he has been performing
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:37.000]   this as a one man, as a live one man show for years and years and years.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.360]   So by the time he sat down or stood up to record the audiobook, you're seeing him making every
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:44.760]   single choice that he thinks needs to be made.
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:47.200]   He has worked through every piece of material.
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.560]   He does all the voices.
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:55.560]   It's cut down a little bit, but it includes the most important part of any good version
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:21:01.240]   of a Christmas carol in that it understands that Scrooge is not the villain of the piece.
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:03.160]   He is the hero of the piece.
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:04.160]   That's right.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.160]   And it's just magnificent.
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:09.480]   Now, it's all on the only drawback is that it's only it's less than two hours long and
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:12.680]   especially when you get the freebies from Audible, you want to basically stick them for
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:16.320]   the nine hour on a bridge to version of anything.
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:23.400]   But honest to God, I originally bought this on cassette and then I bought it on Audible.
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:29.880]   And if it were possible to wear down electrons stored on a flash drive, I would have worn
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:30.880]   out this copy.
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:34.120]   I bet he does such a good job.
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:35.680]   Again, I would play it for you if I could.
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:42.440]   I don't have the capability today, but this is a good reason to go to audible.com/macbreak.
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:47.760]   You can actually browse and listen to any excerpts from any story just to see if it sounds like
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.280]   something you're interested in.
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.760]   Some wonderful, wonderful holiday stuff on there.
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:53.920]   In fact, there's quite a few Christmas carols.
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:57.080]   You could listen to all the different ones, but I think Patrick Stewart's going to have
[00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:58.080]   the best reading.
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.080]   There you go.
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.720]   Audible.com/macbreak.

[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:05.760]   You're going to love it.
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:06.760]   We do.
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:10.480]   I just, I couldn't sleep last night and I didn't want to turn on the light.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:14.380]   I put on the earphone, wake up my wife's, I put on the earphones and I finished that
[00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:17.240]   Larry Niven novel and it was just, it's just great.
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:20.360]   By the way, a great way to go to sleep is to listen to somebody read.
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:24.680]   It's very easy if it's on an iPod or a Sansa or anyone of the players to rewind back to
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:25.680]   where you fell asleep.
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:29.120]   You're still put your ears when you wake up in the morning?
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:33.000]   Yeah, usually I kind of like get sleepy.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.560]   When I know I've missed several pages, I just go, "Oh, and I turn it off and I take out
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:37.560]   the earplugs."
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:39.360]   Yeah, I could go to sleep with my earplugs.
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:41.760]   I probably have a few times.
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:42.760]   I love it.
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:43.760]   I love it.
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:44.760]   I'm an audible fanatic.
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:45.760]   Audible.com/Macbreak.
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:49.760]   We thank them so much for their support of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:52.400]   Will Shipley, what is going on?
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:55.120]   Delicious two came out.
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:57.680]   Am I right just a few months ago?
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:02.640]   Yeah, I've actually forgotten the actual launch date now, which is kind of scary.
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:05.120]   I think it was like May or June or something.
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:06.680]   Oh, that one ago.
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.240]   Yeah, I think.
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.960]   People don't know it.
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.160]   Go to delicious-monster.com.
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:18.920]   It is a really fantastic way to catalog your books and your music and your DVDs to know
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:19.920]   where you've lent them.
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:20.920]   It just looks so beautiful.
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:24.080]   It uses the eyesight to read the barcode.
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:26.640]   It populates quickly.
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:29.640]   Really nice packaging.
[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:34.160]   It really did kind of, I think, set the tone for Mac's software going forward.
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:38.200]   They really do call this generation of Mac's software, the delicious generation.
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.200]   Thanks to you, Will.
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:42.240]   You know, it's still programming in a coffee shop, do you?
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.400]   Yeah, I do, actually.
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:47.320]   I really have to thank Mike Mattis, my old business partner.
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:50.440]   He who is now works at Apple.
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:54.520]   He's one of nine interface people at Apple and did a bunch of work on the iPhone and
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:57.200]   a bunch of work on the laptop.
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:05.240]   But he really, he did sort of a lot of the nice, lickable look of the app is really his
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:07.440]   work.
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:12.040]   And so, you know, he did the version one and he sort of roughed out some ideas to version
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:14.920]   two and then he left the company to go work for Apple.
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:19.440]   So, I sort of, you know, in a sense, been writing on his coattails for two years.
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:21.240]   Well, you wrote some code.
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.240]   I wrote all the code.
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:23.240]   He's not a coder.
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.240]   Yeah.
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:26.240]   Yeah, I mean, you could take credit for the code.
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:28.040]   I'm pretty, I'm pretty happy about it.
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:31.600]   There's got to be beauty under the hood as well as to the eye.
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:32.960]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:37.360]   But, but no, unfortunately, I haven't been able to relax since releasing it.
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:38.720]   Because what are you working on?
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:41.160]   Well, there were so many.
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:44.960]   I basically, I had way too many features to version two and I knew I was doing it, but
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.360]   I just couldn't think of what to cut.
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:50.000]   And so, some of them, honestly, just didn't quite work right.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.640]   And you know, I thought they did and they didn't.
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:55.720]   And so, I was just like, I felt super guilty because, you know, you feel like crap when
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:25:01.040]   you sell somebody something and then it doesn't really work for them the way you said.
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:04.880]   So I've been slaving away trying to get patches out.
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:07.680]   I think I'm at a pretty happy spot right now.
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:12.160]   I mean, obviously every program has some bugs, but I don't, I don't feel like I've, you know,
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.360]   lied to people or anything.
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:17.360]   So, so the current patch level, I'm pretty proud of actually.
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.360]   Good.
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:21.160]   I think that's normal, especially for a smaller shop.
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:26.120]   But, you know, when you look at Vista, which is the opposite of a small shop, I mean, it's
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:27.040]   just the way it is.
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.600]   It's just the way software is these days.
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:35.520]   Well, how hard is the recognition for the barcodes?
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:38.520]   You know, that's really, it's really interesting.
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:44.160]   People have started trying to do this now and, and it's one of the parts of the program that,
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.800]   you know, people just sort of take for granted.
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:46.960]   It's actually really hard.
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:50.000]   It's the hardest thing I've ever worked on in my life.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   It's, it's really hard math combined with hard code.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.640]   And it's funny because, you know, it's, it seems like one of the things where you just go,
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:02.040]   oh, that's really clever, but, you know, you don't think, oh, it's probably also nigh
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:04.200]   impossible to do.
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:09.160]   But now everybody wants to do it because with, like, especially with the Android phone coming
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:14.800]   out, the one of the apps that won the big contest that, that Google sponsored saying,
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:19.360]   you know, come up with clever ideas, fact two of them, two of the apps were these apps
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:22.840]   where you, you know, scan in a barcode and then look up the item, which is, of course,
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:24.720]   a great idea on a phone.
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:27.800]   I mean, it's a pretty obvious and awesome idea.
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:33.560]   But, but the problem is it's almost impossible to read a barcode unless you have a camera
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:38.480]   that focuses and, and most phone cameras just don't focus.
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.200]   They don't, they can't focus that close.
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:45.040]   They can't focus, you know, something that's like six inches from the lens.
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.680]   And you really have to get that close.
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:49.400]   You can't just take me because I was, I was going to say, I take pictures of books all
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:50.400]   the time.
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.440]   I mean, you know, I, I always think of, I think it'd be delicious the library every
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:56.440]   time I'm in a bookstore because I, I don't do that.
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:00.320]   I, I, I, I, this has been a dream app of yours for years.
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:01.680]   I, I see one talking about it.
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.360]   I'm like, you know, well, they got to make it.
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:06.040]   They got to make it to this library because, you know, for me, you know, I don't want
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:10.680]   to, I know this is horrible because the boarder's bookstore is like a block away from my office.
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:13.160]   But we sit there and I don't want to carry them around.
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.960]   And so I just take pictures of them and then I go home.
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:16.880]   I just go home and get them later.
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:18.880]   You know, I first, I check if they're unaudible.
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:22.440]   Like if it's a, if it's a lot of text, like if it doesn't have pictures, there's no reason
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.960]   to buy a thing with text.
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:28.520]   You know, you know, so if there's no pictures, there's no work, not work, not work fine.
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:32.320]   And so, but otherwise I just don't want to carry these big, usually I get big picture
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:33.320]   books.
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:36.120]   And so I don't really want to carry them around for the rest of the, however time, whatever
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:37.120]   I'm doing.
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.880]   And so I, I'm just dying to be able to take them.
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:42.360]   So I take pictures of the covers all the time to remind myself, oh, I should get that
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:43.360]   later.
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:47.240]   And, and I just keep on thinking, man, if I could just, you know, it would destroy, it
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:50.400]   would destroy a bookstore, but I, you know, if I could just take a picture of that, of
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:54.000]   the barcode and order it from Amazon while I'm standing there.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.240]   You know, I had an interesting experience in a brick and mortar bookstore a few days
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:59.240]   ago.
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:01.800]   And, and, and I really celebrate the independent bookstore.
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:02.800]   I really do.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:06.960]   I think I don't celebrate Barnes and Noble particularly, but I think bookstores like
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:12.360]   Powell's, which is gone alas, Stacey's, we have Copperfields up here.
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:14.360]   There's a wonderful one on the peninsula.
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.320]   And there was the chatter cover.
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:21.360]   Yeah, they're just these great bookstores, independent bookstores, which are, I think,
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:24.160]   are very important for the health of books.
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:28.640]   However, I went into my local independent bookstore the other day.
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:33.800]   And I guess I'm spoiled now with typing a search term into Amazon because it was hard
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:34.800]   to find the book.
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:35.800]   I couldn't find it.
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:36.800]   So I went to the desk.
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:38.080]   I said, do you have this book?
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:43.040]   It took her literally four or five minutes to determine it wasn't in stock.
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:47.000]   She said, I can order it for you and I can have it for you in a couple of days.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.800]   And what it really made me feel like is, and by the way, the experience wasn't very pleasant.
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:53.800]   The service wasn't very good.
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:54.800]   They were a little surly.
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:55.800]   They took their time.
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:59.760]   It felt, you know, it just didn't feel welcoming.
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:02.720]   And I thought the only thing that keeps a bookstore open is that service, that sense
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:05.160]   of this is a great place to hang out.
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:09.520]   Because otherwise, I could have had this book, you know, overnighted to me from Amazon in
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:10.840]   a 30 seconds.
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:13.840]   This is going to be bad for bookstores.
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:15.760]   And they've got to find a way to--
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:16.760]   One night.
[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:22.800]   And I think they've made a huge mistake with Google doing its scanning process.
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:28.240]   Because I bought more books from the handful of books that are up there.
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:29.640]   We'll search and we'll see these.
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.280]   There was this one on mechanical structures.
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:36.280]   And the whole book is on Google.
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:37.840]   It's been scanned or whatever.
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:38.840]   But I bought it.
[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:39.840]   I looked through it.
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:40.840]   I think that's a problem.
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:42.880]   I think that you want to read it online.
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:43.880]   Look through it.
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:45.840]   That's the last advantage of going to the bookstores.
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:46.840]   I can put through the book.
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.040]   I don't need to feel the pictures.
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:49.040]   I just want to see what's in it.
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:52.120]   And so I can flip through the entire book, just look around.
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:54.560]   And I'm not going to view it on my computer.
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:57.520]   I mean, I am going to buy the book.
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:01.600]   And I think that that was a big mistake for them to kind of push people back.
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:06.760]   I just think that bookstores will always have a really good role in that they present books
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:11.080]   in the context that the humans like to locate new books with.
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:13.400]   It's great when people recommend books to you.
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:17.880]   It's great for Amazon to say that people who bought this title and also tend to like this
[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:18.880]   book too.
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:21.600]   And based on the other stuff you bought, you might like this title.
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:27.120]   But there's something about going into a real bookstore and just having no clue whatsoever
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:28.400]   what you want to read.
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:33.120]   But you just know that you want to get a book and read something and then just browsing.
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:37.240]   I don't think there's an online solution that can really bring that experience.
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:38.920]   I think there's a generation.
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:39.920]   Yeah.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:42.560]   We may be the last generation that says that.
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:45.160]   I mean, like I agree with you and I think we all agree.
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:50.240]   But I also feel like our kids are going to all be like, you know, just why would I want
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:53.600]   to have this physical thing that I'm dragging around with me when I could just have the
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:54.600]   bits and.
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.120]   Well, I agree with that.
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:31:02.400]   But I just don't think that online bookstores are delivering that great experience of not
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.640]   knowing what you want but wanting something.
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:08.640]   I think it's still too way too digital.
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.560]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:11.560]   I find the exact opposite.
[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:14.680]   My biggest problem with Amazon is that it tells me other books that are like the book
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:16.040]   I'm looking at.
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:18.040]   And that's very expensive for me.
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:19.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:21.680]   I go into a thing like I want to research something and I'll end up with 10 books when
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:23.600]   I when I I just get them all.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.560]   And then they come into my they come into the office and I find out the three or four
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:27.560]   from my.
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:30.080]   I bring this up as I was an eye opening experience for me.
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:33.920]   It was really the it was really the first time I felt like because I'm a big supporter
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:35.480]   of these bookstores again.
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:39.120]   But I felt like this was kind of not a satisfying experience.
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:41.360]   And I'm going to think twice before I go through it again.
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:46.320]   I wanted to buy four copies of this book for my friends that night at a dinner party and
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.800]   you know.
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:48.800]   The only independent bookstore.
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:53.400]   I mean the only bookstore that I really go into with any with any real excitement I
[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:57.800]   guess is there's an architectural bookstores called Bibliograph I think in Berkeley on 4th
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:03.920]   Street and it's you know it is just this incredible collection of architectural and design books.
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:07.760]   And but it's a very picture based and and they find books that I mean I don't even know
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:11.560]   if they're on Amazon you know they're they're you know obscure publishers and everything
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:12.560]   else.
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:16.080]   And that's a that's what the niche is you know that's what and they're busy all the
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:20.400]   time and they you know very good service and you know everything else and but I think
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:25.080]   that's what you have to be looking at is is finding that niche of not even being a general
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:29.680]   bookstore I think it's being a specific you know really covering a certain area that
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:30.920]   makes sense.
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:36.760]   Well you know you're going to help kill it will with a portable barcode scanning.
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:42.560]   I do love that feature the G1 by the way and I you know it's a it's a really neat ability
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:45.920]   to scan your stuff at least see the price check the price.
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:49.240]   Well that's huge that's the real equalizer.
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:54.760]   Yeah yeah I'm really I mean that's what I'm kind of excited about is you know it because
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:33:01.040]   it goes way beyond books like Amazon sells you know breakfast cereal and so you know like
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:04.960]   what excited me was the idea that I could go into a stereo shop and the guy could be like
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:11.720]   well this has got dual THX out with triple overpass and it's a deal at 400 right and
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:17.160]   I could just go yeah let me just uh bleep huh you know I can get this overnighted yeah
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:24.120]   with free shipping for 200 and so you're like that I there's this there's this camera
[00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:28.520]   store right around to right around the corner from our office and it's it's the worst the
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:32.520]   it's called discount camera and it's like not that place.
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:37.760]   So these guys are the shisters I mean they're shisters you know and they walk in and I want
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:40.560]   to get it Alex three because I couldn't find it anywhere else and I couldn't get it delivered
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:44.080]   and I was leaving that day for Japan and and I just I knew they had it and I knew I was
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:48.040]   gonna have to deal with them and I walk in and I go you know I went to like three they
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:52.960]   said it'll be five hundred forty nine dollars and I was like really you guys because the
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:54.680]   list price is four ninety nine.
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:59.480]   That's what list price are you talking about and I'm like the list price that Panasonic
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:04.520]   you're supposed to and then I go in B&H has it for four nineteen and it's it's on Amazon
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:09.560]   for four forty nine and that's what you know that's what I'm getting.
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:13.600]   I think I paid four seventy four and I knew there was gonna be a tax of the fact that
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:17.600]   I'm I need to leave either so right but what I did is I immediately just said these are
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:20.680]   the prices and I just walked away after I'll get that lens filter.
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:25.240]   I don't want to and then they but before I left of course they're like well okay right
[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:29.600]   right it's a whole dance yeah but you can really hold especially you know that kind
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:33.680]   of thing you can really hold people's feet to the fire when you can when you have that
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:35.680]   that information right in front of you on the iPhone.
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:36.680]   Yeah okay.
[00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:41.720]   You know that the thing is like places like Best Buy Now will throw you out if they see
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:43.720]   you even taking notes on prices.
[00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:44.720]   You're kidding.
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:47.800]   Nope they've been they've been doing it across the country for five years.
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:50.880]   Buy Buy Best Buy I think that that's they can't do that.
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:53.960]   Well actually that's that's more like store culture.
[00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:58.640]   I mean it has I don't think it has I was actually in a furniture store like five six
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:02.600]   seven years ago and there's a sofa that kind of wanted but I didn't know if it was just
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:07.160]   like this sort of bachelor ugly or if it was really ugly.
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:11.200]   So I took a picture of it and instantly got like set up on by the manager saying what
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:12.200]   are you doing?
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:13.200]   Oh I'm just chomping for it.
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.200]   Did you take a picture of that sofa?
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.920]   We really don't let people take pictures of our furniture dies.
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:18.920]   Why?
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:23.800]   Exactly and like we just we don't we they explained it another person explained it to
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:28.440]   me that people who are there taking notes about store merchandise.
[00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:33.440]   Now before this this is before like the days of G1 Google phone.
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:37.680]   The phone scanning could be from a competitor who's tried to figure out where you're getting
[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:40.800]   your merchandise from and try to get you know try basically.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:44.440]   You kind of look like you could work in a furniture store.
[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:45.440]   Exactly.
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:51.200]   It was the Larry Fine T-shirt that cut off shorts with the note socks that basically said
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.560]   you know what upscale trip brogles.
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:36:01.760]   Well I think you have to be surreptitious about this because figured out from the retail
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:05.400]   stores point of view they're not going to want to be shopped that way and you know they
[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:07.960]   can throw anybody out if they want.
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:08.960]   Yeah.
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:12.280]   One thing I'd say is that they have they have a web most of these companies stores have
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:13.280]   a web presence.
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:14.280]   All they need to do is link it in.
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:17.600]   I mean if I was at the gap and I could be sitting there and I didn't have to like there's you
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:22.720]   know in San Francisco the gap line is like you know 20 people deep half the time and
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:26.080]   if I could just sit there and scan you know try it on and go yeah that's what I wanted
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:30.720]   and scan the thing and order it and then just you know and know it's going to show up the
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:32.320]   next day or two.
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:35.520]   You know I do that all the time.
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:39.320]   Well there was a Cyber Monday deal on VMware Fusion.
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:41.720]   Unfortunately it's too late to get that deal.
[00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:43.720]   I think unless they kept it alive.
[00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:45.200]   They keep keeping it alive.
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:47.920]   It was just going to be Black Friday and then they made it Cyber Monday.
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:53.160]   50% off plus they had a $30 rebate for people switching from parallels which means you could
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:57.600]   get it for 10 bucks if you were a parallels user and know the deal is over.
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:59.560]   So sorry I mentioned anything.
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:04.160]   Don't you make any great deals on the on Black Friday Cyber Monday?
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:08.920]   No there wasn't that many like apples so-called deals were a joke.
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:09.920]   It kind of sucked didn't they?
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:13.440]   I percent and percent I was like it doesn't really count until it's 20.
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:15.800]   No I did buy some stuff.
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:21.640]   I mean mostly they're DVDs because Amazon always has that just stupid ridiculous sale.
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:26.960]   I got every season in a house that was missing at 75% off and a bunch of other DVDs that
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:29.000]   would have an eye and 40% off.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:34.480]   The only tech related thing I got was Office Max had a very good deal on the Samsung 23
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:39.400]   inch HDTV Fold 1080p for the coupon it was $279.
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:40.400]   Whoa.
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:46.720]   And that's I still think it's too early to buy a to spend a lot of money on an HD set.
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:50.120]   But that's exactly the sort of thing that you should be buying right now.
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:53.720]   It's something you can put in the kitchen, put in the you know put in the bedroom and
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:59.400]   you can still use it as a very good you know 1920 by 1080 you know monitor monitor.
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:00.400]   Yeah yeah.
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:01.400]   Your iMac.
[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:06.000]   Well here's a DVD you might want to get for the Mac fanatic in your life.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:11.840]   For pre-order they say it's going to come out on the 15th Rob Baca and Joe Josh Rizzo did
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:17.920]   a movie a documentary called Welcome to Macintosh about the community and history behind the
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:19.880]   Mac phenomenon you can see it.
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:24.080]   The ultimate I'm sorry the unofficial Apple Weblog is called the ultimate the unofficial
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:31.080]   Apple Weblog has a clip from YouTube that you can see it trailer of it and the DVD has
[00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:35.440]   it's an a three minute movie but there's an additional three hours of footage I mean interviews
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:43.200]   with you know the Kawasaki and he hurts felt Ron Wayne John Moltz, Leander Kehaney I mean
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:47.920]   it sounds like it's so just a really great DVD so I wanted to give him a little bit of
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:48.920]   a plug.
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:54.800]   They're selling it at film baby pre-order is 1984 you got to love that price 1984.
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:56.600]   It was backheads is it?
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:57.600]   Pardon me?
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:59.200]   That's not the same as Macheads is it?
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:00.200]   That was the document.
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:01.720]   No there's a new one.
[00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:03.440]   Oh competition awesome.
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:05.160]   Yeah.
[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:11.840]   It sounds like it you know it sounds a lot of people are in it not Steve but it does sound
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:16.440]   very it sounds cool and if you got it yeah so tell me about Macheads is that out now?
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:20.000]   I don't know I haven't checked actually if only I had a computer in front of me I could
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   actually check it out.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:27.080]   If you go to Macheadsthemovie.com you can see the trailer now it's still coming soon.
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:32.040]   So now there'll be two Macheads the movie also same idea.
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:37.320]   I think that's you know there even the history of the PC is interesting but the history of
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:42.680]   the Mac is just very engaging with a lot of really unusual personalities and I just think
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:44.400]   well worth.
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:47.080]   I think we should do the history of Twit.
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:52.320]   Some day someone will and this will be the day the mixer died and I think we should hire
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.480]   Anna Cornicova to play you.
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:56.560]   Okay I'm down with that.
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:40:03.640]   There's a Eastern European track star who's there's a video on YouTube of on a recent
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:07.440]   meet that I will I think will change your life she's she really is quite quite a star.
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:11.640]   Can you just send me the attachment and I'll open it on my Mac.
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:14.640]   Just read just double click on it.
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:19.760]   You're going to need a special codec to make it work but you know just look on okay
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:21.640]   a lot of times and then you start.
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:23.760]   I have no problem with that.
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:26.960]   App Store is well depending on how you count it.
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:31.760]   Ten thousand applications in the app store actually there we would have crossed that
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:34.480]   number except for several hundred that have been withdrawn.
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:35.480]   And so.
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:37.480]   Five thousand are flashlights.
[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:38.480]   Yeah right.
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:40.320]   The rest are calculators.
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:42.680]   Thank goodness they're here.
[00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:46.720]   So you don't have a delicious for the iPhone do you.
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:50.320]   Now I'm actually working on this is the first time I've ever said this.
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:53.120]   I'm actually working on three different apps for the iPhone.
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:54.120]   Cool.
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:59.640]   There's there's there's sort of different theories of iPhone apps and I think the way
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:05.480]   to go is is what Daniel Jelkut said he called it sharp applications.
[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:07.080]   It's rather than being broad be sharp.
[00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:08.080]   I agree.
[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:12.120]   In fact I was looking at pocket express which hand mark makes on every other platform and
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:16.440]   I was it and it's really an omnibus application here with movies and news and sports score
[00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:19.600]   stuff and this isn't this isn't the right this isn't right.
[00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:21.240]   This isn't what you want on your iPhone.
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:22.880]   It's okay to have a hundred apps.
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:24.720]   Each one does one specific thing.
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:25.720]   Yeah.
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:27.560]   I mean each ninety nine cents or whatever.
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:30.080]   I buy I buy an app a day I think.
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:31.800]   And she had the ninety nine cents sale.
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:35.640]   I bought quite a few pinch games.
[00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:42.080]   Everything was ninety nine cents and they're the ones who do the you know the bugdom and
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:46.360]   and Billy Frontier they do some of the best kind of ports of their mac games.
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:50.040]   Is it is it very much different writing for the iPhone?
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:56.600]   No it's not and that's what's really amazingly cool is that I just kind of jumped in it and
[00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:00.840]   after two and a half weeks I'm almost done with my first app and you want to tell us
[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:02.760]   anything about it is it.
[00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:07.920]   Yeah actually I'll tell you all about it because it's coming out soon and it's going
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:11.080]   to be free.
[00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:12.480]   It's going to be quote free.
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:16.320]   It's free but it only works with delicious library so it's going to be a delicious library
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:24.680]   viewer so it'll be just a pretty fast way to look at all your stuff on your iPhone that
[00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:26.280]   you scanned in with delicious library.
[00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:32.720]   And how will you see it via how will you see the data?
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:37.400]   It's not going to I'm not going to try to do this sort of full graphical shelves that
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:44.480]   I did on the Mac side because you don't really have the screen space to get a lot of info.
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:48.800]   So it's going to be sort of look more like a contact list you know the more like the
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:51.440]   contact list on the phone.
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:54.360]   Will it sink through Mobile Me or how is it?
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:43:00.440]   No we haven't they haven't opened up any APIs to Mobile Me sinking or to sinking in
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:07.440]   a dock so the only solution I've been able to figure out is sinking over Bonjour so you
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:11.840]   have to like I'm trying to make it as painful as possible it looks like you just have to
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:16.400]   run the app on the Mac and then run it on the iPhone.
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:19.320]   That's what one password is doing.
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:24.720]   Yeah pretty much the only way you can do it right now sensibly.
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:26.920]   So you can take your catalog with you basically.
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:31.280]   Yeah because I mean like everyone wants to do this like a hundred percent of my customers
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:34.760]   like they write me all the time it's really funny and I it's really sweet you know you
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:38.760]   don't want to make fun of your customers but it also kind of gets to be funny when like
[00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:43.680]   every single day we get an email saying hey I have this great idea I mean this awesome
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:47.680]   idea okay listen to this idea listen to this is a great idea.
[00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:53.480]   What if you could look at your collection on the iPhone and I'm like no no oh my god
[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:58.200]   you know I'm going to think of that and I'm going to credit you I'm going to say you know
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:01.200]   when I come out with that you can say that was my idea.
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:05.720]   It's like it's literally is every single day that we get a PC on.
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:07.720]   Isn't that funny.
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:12.960]   Well I'm good that's that look and the approval process does it put you off do you worry about
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:14.280]   it or is it you feel like it'll be pretty.
[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:17.480]   I mean you're very well known in the Apple community I can't imagine.
[00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:23.280]   Yeah the thing is I think that could work for me and against me because you know if I
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:27.480]   do anything at all like there are a lot of apps out there and I've been sort of keeping
[00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:33.040]   track that are you know going outside of the APIs and you're not supposed to do that.
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:35.640]   Even Google now admits that they do in fact do that.
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:41.320]   Yeah and they're the first to just you know come out in a minute.
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:45.400]   But the problem is I think you know because I'm a little higher profile I think it also
[00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:49.840]   means that you know I have to keep my nose very very clean because you know Apple is
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:52.720]   going to be looking real closely at it and passing it around and you know one of the
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:57.080]   iPhone guys could just be like you know hey he couldn't have done that there's no way
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:45:00.040]   he could do that he must be using private API.
[00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:04.280]   Is there a lot of pressure to not to go beyond the API.
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:10.600]   Well there's just certain things you just simply can't do unless you go beyond the public
[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:11.600]   API.
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:21.360]   There's sort of no really well there's certain just hardware things you just can't get at
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:27.040]   and so if you want to get at them you have to go beyond it and it's kind of mending.
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:31.320]   And I've been trying to find sort of very I've been trying to there's sort of in API
[00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:37.960]   tricks you can do to go beyond the API like you know like you're you're making a custom
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:41.680]   table and you don't want to make a completely custom table you want to start with you know
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:45.720]   Apple's table that's built in the one they used to the contacts.
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:50.400]   But you want to change the background color and it turns out they won't let you and so
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:53.480]   you know so you're like well what am I going to do and so you try to find some like sort
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:58.120]   of trick where you say look I don't know what this object is that I'm talking to but if
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:05.160]   I did but if you if you respond to the word background color then I would like to be blue
[00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:09.640]   but if not that's cool I mean I don't know who you are I'm just saying it's a feeling
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:13.280]   you can't get in too much trouble with that because if the if they change the API or whatever
[00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:15.240]   you'll fail gracefully.
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:19.080]   Yeah and actually this this first ad that comes out I don't even do that this one is
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:23.920]   just this is so incredibly clean I'm I'm gonna like sort of you know release one that's
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:27.800]   totally clean and then and then sneak in the patches.
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:30.840]   Well the good news is nobody at Apple listens to this show so you're okay.
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:33.560]   Yeah you're you're in the clear on that one.
[00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:34.560]   No problem at all.
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:36.480]   It's just a five of us talking really.
[00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:37.480]   Really.
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:38.480]   Yeah exactly.
[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:41.840]   In fact if if I can't get this show off the Mac maybe nobody will be listening to this
[00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:42.840]   show.
[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:46.440]   We'll see how call see how well call recorder works.
[00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:50.160]   It works good Leo by the way I want to mention you said something about Google which tripped
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:56.200]   my ancient memory apparently it last day or so they finally fixed it so that iCal syncs
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:57.920]   with your Google calendar.
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:00.440]   Yeah I haven't been able to get that work has anybody been able to get that work I've
[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:05.000]   been using busy Mac you know the busy sync for busy Mac and that works fine but has anybody
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.880]   been able to they you know I downloaded that they have this new this little stub toy that
[00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:13.240]   calibration that will automatically get it working and I've never been able to it doesn't
[00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:14.240]   work.
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:15.240]   Anybody else?
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:17.360]   I just got excited about it.
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:21.240]   We run a lot of the a lot of our production off of Google every calendars.
[00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:23.080]   I do the whole thing on Google calendar.
[00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:27.640]   Yeah so I'm excited about being able to test it but I just saw it.
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:33.320]   I don't ever use web apps and so I'm I seem to be like the minority like every time somebody
[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:37.800]   is like dot Mac web mail is down I'm like who the hell uses web mail.
[00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:40.160]   I'm like the damn mail dot app.
[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:43.120]   Well and if you use web mail why are you using dot Mac.
[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:48.920]   I mean you know I might be like oh it integrates with the because I mean I have dot Mac I've
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:54.800]   had it since the beginning and that's I like it when it's up but it makes me mad when they
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:57.680]   work on the damn web when I can't even sync my machine.
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:03.240]   I'm like hey guys here's an idea instead of adding features to the damn website of dot
[00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:11.040]   Mac look at pictures of your friends or photos why not make it so I can sync my goddamn machine.
[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:16.400]   Well you know I would love if you know the nice thing is you continue using ICal you don't
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:20.680]   really end and you know mobile me synchronization and whatever but to have it also appear on
[00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:27.920]   the GCal is fantastic if it would work but I'm sure it does it's just me it says it's
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:32.720]   it says it's hooked it up but it doesn't actually show any of the calendars so we'll
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:37.840]   see if it works but it's a it's a good feature and if you it's kind of hard to find you have
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:43.840]   to you have to read the help file associated with your Google calendar and it uses CalDav
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:50.560]   which I presume is like web dev but a calendar based sharing capability.
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:54.840]   Real quickly before we get to our picks because we do have a lot of picks Mac internet share
[00:48:54.840 --> 00:49:02.800]   hits a record 8.87 percent that's according to net applications they do a survey of based
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.960]   on browsers I guess.
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:10.480]   Windows drops below 90 percent yeah doesn't happen probably in like two decades.
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:17.840]   Linux had a big jump iPhone up 12 percent to 0.37 percent still a small number yeah
[00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:23.760]   but that's a big big deal apparently XP dropped considerably and Vista were failed to make
[00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:30.640]   up for it I think that's switchers what else yeah yeah yeah it's gotta be it's gonna be
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:37.560]   switchers let's see it's offer business for a couple years now say again I've been telling
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:41.240]   people in software business for a couple years now that this is the best time to be
[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:47.040]   a Mac software developer because if you I released delicious library one in March of
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:52.480]   2004 and normally what you see when you really suffer for the Mac over the last you
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:56.960]   know 15 years is you know you'd release it and for the first six months you do you know
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:50:00.880]   pretty well and then after that I would taper off and after that you'd get like you know
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:06.920]   ten bucks every two months right what's happened over the last three years since because you
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:12.960]   know I went almost exactly three years without a major you know you have to pay upgrade I
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:17.800]   upgraded software but nobody had to pay right so three years without a pay upgrade of
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:24.760]   delicious library one and what happened was I had the same year to year sales for the
[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:29.480]   product for three years because Apple's market share kept increasing and bringing me new
[00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:35.120]   customers and you know so we didn't just run out of customers like we did at Omni with
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:40.360]   all of our apps in the past and so it's a great time to be a software developer because
[00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:45.160]   you know every time Apple gains another percentage of market share that's like you know I don't
[00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:48.800]   know I'm you know ten million people or whatever I don't know the real number but you know that's
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:53.920]   other ten million potential customers for you and it's it's awesome don't you think Mac
[00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:59.200]   Mac people buy more software to I mean I think that even though it's a smaller number of
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:04.240]   people overall that we seem to buy a lot of software we pay for share where I think it's
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:09.640]   always been a good business to be where the good guys yeah well we've already proven
[00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:12.440]   we're willing to pay for something that just works a little bit better and looks a little
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:18.120]   nice right and so it makes us you know a high margin customer yeah it's it's people
[00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:23.760]   who are who are on the lookout for new cool things and so that's sort of a nice pre selection
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:27.360]   criteria and the other thing that people point out because you know you don't you don't
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:31.320]   want to just sit there and go oh all PC people suck one thing that people point out I think
[00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:37.000]   it's really worth you know looking at is that a ton of PCs are corporate machines they're
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:40.960]   sitting there they're right you know sitting on a banker's desk and they're not allowed
[00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:44.960]   to install other side right and so people talk about the you know like why don't you
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:49.280]   bring it for Windows you make more money everyone I know who's small developer in Windows makes
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:54.840]   way less money than me and small developers who develop for both have told me that the
[00:51:54.840 --> 00:52:01.240]   max side makes them way more yes we we've been really you know we don't we develop plugins
[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:06.400]   you know and a couple standalone applications and I know that the PC side has always been
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:11.640]   just a difficult side because there's a lot more tech support for a lot less sales you
[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:17.400]   know for us now we we make keen software so it's kind of the video realm but but it's
[00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:21.960]   just one of those things that it's just much easier and just as you said I mean the our
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:25.560]   market share just keeps on growing you know as the market share grows or as whatever is
[00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:31.280]   happening you know we keep on selling product without you know you know we've seen occasionally
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:37.120]   a new a new product well it's good to be a Mac developer it's good to be a Mac user these
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:41.760]   days I know even though Apple isn't giving us big discounts for Black Friday it's still
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:46.480]   nice hardware and the latest rumor which I think kind of is something Andy and Akko
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:51.920]   probably stimulated is that Apple maybe announce a netbook style computer for a Mac world
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:56.600]   expo you gotta take this one of the grain of salt because it's from an analyst who isn't
[00:52:56.600 --> 00:53:01.440]   basing it on any information is just saying well I think it'd be a good idea analysts
[00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:05.960]   are the worst they're they never are right never I don't make crap up I think yeah they
[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:11.720]   just make it a shit up I think it's gonna be a tablet myself really did you make that
[00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:16.480]   up I think I think I make it every single time there's an opportunity because I just want
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:21.880]   my tablet so badly it's gonna be a pill I think not a tablet a blue pill you're a
[00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:28.120]   well from it and close I think it's gonna I think the whole deal about Mac world this
[00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:34.320]   year is gonna be the new OS yeah snow leopard there's not a lot to show us no leopard though
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:38.160]   I mean I don't I don't think I'm breaking any NDAs by saying that I mean they just said
[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:44.080]   it's gonna be faster right and that's improved yeah better I mean there won't be good marketing
[00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:47.960]   around that same fact well but if it's not a lot of new features it is kind of hard to
[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:53.920]   say you know buy this if you know faster it's it's Steve there's a reality distortion
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:58.240]   feeling what what do you mean right this one I think I think that there's a lot of
[00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:05.200]   great features in the current OS that is most unstable Mac OS I've used in really
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:11.360]   ever leopard really yeah yeah I have to agree with that I think it is the most
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:19.520]   and I don't know I have weird weird you know weird crashes it turning off every once in
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:28.040]   a while I mean I love my Mac but it is not stable version of the OS they just added a
[00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:32.120]   lot and there's a lot of bugs in there you know and so I think that I'm very excited
[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:38.600]   about about the next version both by having to make it make it more stable but also I
[00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:44.000]   think it's gonna be a lot faster you know that's the that's the rumor right yeah
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:50.840]   well I they did announced I've got to be really careful here I understand you're a
[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:55.400]   developer you're under a NDA but what what what did they say publicly about
[00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:58.520]   snow leopard because they said something right they oh yeah they've said it will
[00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:03.160]   not have any new new features it will just be cleaned up I mean that's the
[00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:07.280]   general gist of it okay good yeah so the funny thing was when they announced that
[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:12.200]   and you know Bertrand's on stage and I love Bertrand to death and he's up on
[00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:14.720]   stage and he announces and he says you know and today I'd like to announce that
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:18.360]   you know the big thing about snow leopard is and then he has this whole
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:24.920]   slide he's like zero new features the audience just went a shit they like the
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:27.840]   idea yeah there's five thousand developers and they were just they were
[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:31.440]   just roaring they were like you know oh god thank you thank you thank you just
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:35.360]   fix it yeah well I mean the thing is that they're they're they're they're
[00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:40.240]   they're giving developers stuff because you know the whole quote make it faster
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:43.640]   there's you know real code ramifications to make it faster they're not just like
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:48.320]   you know putting a layer of undercoating on it there's actually a thing so
[00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:51.800]   developers are getting something it's just it's it's not clear to me how they
[00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:57.800]   would sell it to users you know right yeah I think they you know there's we
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:01.240]   no one can figure out what would be a big announcement I mean apples updated
[00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:05.360]   the the laptops they've got well the iMacs I guess they could update the mini or
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:08.480]   the Apple TV maybe they could update these aren't gonna knock the world on its
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:13.600]   side and it's too early for a new iPhone they haven't said a big anything
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:18.240]   particular about the desktops but you know they nail them desktops probably
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:23.000]   but that's not the kind of thing that's at Mac world expo I'm very I'm very
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:27.400]   certain that they're gonna show something that they're not gonna ship the biggest
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:31.880]   selling no I know you're probably right it's one it's one of those things where
[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:36.920]   it's not ready to go yet but we need to start banging the drinking out some
[00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:41.160]   some headspace for this yep so we're gonna say please please have five hundred
[00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:45.320]   and forty nine dollars ready I think you're between May and June I think you're
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:48.840]   right I think a netbook is a logical thing for them to do at this point it is
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:53.560]   it is the big best selling category in fact all the early reports from Black
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:57.400]   Friday where that's what people wanted they want these low priced lightweight
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:02.440]   underpowered netbooks and the Macbook Air is not it well the difference though
[00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:07.800]   that is that it's a netbook is a great device for Windows because you can make
[00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:11.760]   a very ordinary device that sells incredibly well it makes absolute
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:16.600]   sense you have to be a max yeah exactly when you make a Mac it's the core it's
[00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:20.720]   the culture at Apple not to say well look here is here is we whiteboarded
[00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:24.880]   how much it would what we can do a minimal Mac for and well what you know we can
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:27.880]   do it for three hundred forty nine dollars but it would be a cheap plastic
[00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:32.360]   case it would be a lot of OEM to parks it would be just basically part a part
[00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:36.440]   be part see solder together put a logo on it and ship it and I just don't see
[00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:41.640]   Apple doing that I think that despite their best desires to ship a cheap
[00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:44.800]   netbook if that's what they wanted to do they would have to do something they
[00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:48.840]   would just feel compelled to do something weird with the case or put this weird
[00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:52.680]   networking feature into it that would add a hundred bucks to the price and sort
[00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:56.640]   of drive it into Macbook area I'm excited to see what they would do with the
[00:57:56.640 --> 00:58:00.400]   cheap Mac I think they would do something that's sort of like a netbook but not
[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:05.000]   really I mean I would like I would love to see like a tablet that has a keyboard
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:09.120]   component that you could optionally add to it and you know I'd be happy I pay
[00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:12.840]   $800 for an iPhone this twice as well and twice as high and has Bluetooth for a
[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:18.520]   keyboard I mean I'd be I'd buy it tomorrow to see it two iPhones one
[00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:22.560]   old duct tape I get rid of my iPhone that'd be it that'd be my my little head you
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:25.880]   know I'm gonna just lose with the headphone and it's all right I had sometimes I
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:29.560]   sometimes I carry my iPhone and my iPod touch with me and there are times when
[00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:35.520]   I just sort of hold them hands like one of the Nintendo's thinking geez what if
[00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:39.560]   we were just to use like if I if I owned both of these and our and we were to
[00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:46.200]   have a software stack that that that said using you can use the touch as just
[00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:50.800]   the user interface to the screen on the iPhone above you and so you could have
[00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:55.400]   you know variable keyboards you could have variable control pads you would have
[00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:59.680]   more screen real estate you'd have text editing that got out of your way what
[00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:03.600]   is the most intriguing thing to do to get this working would just be a bunch
[00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:08.840]   of development and a little $20 like bifold leather case to hold these things
[00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:15.200]   together well we'll see won't we kids it's only believe it or not it's like a
[00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:17.200]   month to Mac world
[00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:19.200]   he wrote it
[00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:26.360]   what is it the best part of your year like the day after the Mac world I spoke
[00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:30.000]   when you realize wait a minute I have no idea how long it is till the next show
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:35.520]   okay we don't know how long it is the only reason I know is because I have five
[00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:39.800]   weeks to get a presentation together and I have no idea what I'm gonna say
[00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:42.840]   yeah you're supposed to get I'm supposed to get they called me and they're like
[00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:46.640]   what's the title of your presentation at Mac world and I'm like the title the
[00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:53.480]   title is will shiply talks about me yeah that's my title - I've been
[00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:58.840]   watching the my my panel note I'm doing not a panel but a thing on podcasting on

[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:36.320]   presentation which means I actually have to prepare so I'm sure you can echo in
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:41.280]   that feature presentation like the featured answers I actually hired
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:44.400]   somebody we're putting together video clips I think what we're gonna talk
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:49.520]   about is the past present and future of technology programming on the internet
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:53.520]   so we'll start with you know computer chronicles and take it right up to the
[01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:58.320]   present and then that talk about the future history of the comb over yeah it'll
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:01.880]   be fun it's gonna be very it's gonna be very interesting talk a lot about tech
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:07.560]   TV and Twit and and then I think Davor a John C. Davorak Kevin Rose and a couple
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:11.600]   of others who are doing interesting things on you know the internet with
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:14.440]   technology programming will join me on stage it'll be I think it's gonna be
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:21.480]   fun it'll be a never many never before seen clips there's one of Davorak
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:26.160]   demonstrating a 286 on computer chronicles I can't wait to show everybody
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:29.800]   that one I know you have to go Scott so let's get our picks of the week out of
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:35.200]   the way and Scott if you want to lead off you go right ahead he's gone we lost
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:38.320]   gotten he actually had a hard he said he had a hard out he meant he had a hard
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:44.280]   out oh dear what did he just say something a second ago I think he I guess
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:49.840]   on okay well I'm sorry never mind we didn't make that hard out will I didn't
[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:52.360]   warn you ahead of time we like to do pick every week and if you want to pick
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:55.960]   delicious library be my guest but I'll give you a moment to think about it could
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:59.960]   be hardware could be software I'm gonna mention the fact that the micro torrent
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:04.200]   which is the kind of the bit torrent client on the windows side everybody
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:08.600]   loves this in terms of its speed its reliability its user interface they
[01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:13.680]   finally made a Mac version and there are a lot of torrent saw you know programs
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:17.960]   like a zurias tomato torrent transmission which I think is excellent
[01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:23.280]   available on the Mac but but Mike bit torrents a micro torrent is really it's
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:28.240]   kind of the king on the window side and and notorious for its speed so if you
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:34.400]   do download bit torrents it's it's free it's well worth the download and I think
[01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:39.720]   I can I can say highly recommend it now how do you compare it to X-torem I
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:44.640]   haven't used X-torem I love X-torem you'll have X-torem micro torrent okay
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:48.000]   yeah definitely check it out it's very it's very clean it's very simple you know
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.760]   what I should probably do is get the URL that would be a smart thing
[01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:59.480]   I downloaded immediately I guess it's just UTorrent.com but the U is really a
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:04.480]   micron sign it sorts out on the Mac as a U as well so I guess we'll call it U
[01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:09.040]   torrent but a very very good and there is a Mac version now if you go to the
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:13.520]   front page you'll see get it for Windows but then click the link that says Mac
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:17.440]   U torrent coming soon and that's see they even say coming soon but I just
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:23.200]   downloaded it so they have to update their site. Mr. Alex Lindsey what's your
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:30.080]   pick? So my pick for the week is... Oh they're on who's that hello? I was just
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:33.080]   yelling it's I was just yelling it's Skype for a moment there. Oh you're here
[01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:37.360]   you're here you haven't got anywhere. Scott the Skype was doing one of those
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:41.320]   things saying you know what let's talk about fudge Andy what's your favorite
[01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:44.200]   kind of fudge Skype I'm kind of the middle something I like the kind with
[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:48.760]   Marshall guy I'm the middle something. Wow you've got a better scape than I do
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:57.800]   I'd like to talk about fudge. Oh my pick. So I've got I have to have two picks
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:02.320]   for the week. Okay there's two things that I've really enjoyed so so the first
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:07.680]   one is a it's it's called live station and it's a little application that you
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:13.520]   can install and it has basically my favorite news feeds video feeds so
[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:20.560]   CNN IBN Al Jazeera English BBC World News Bloomberg television so all the
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:26.440]   kind of the real news channels are an extreme and it's free and it's got a
[01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:30.080]   great little interface and it will just kind of play in the background I mean
[01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:35.880]   I'm when I'm working here in Tokyo when I'm you know every channel every channel
[01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:40.320]   is Japanese and they're all yelling something and I don't really
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:43.120]   understand what they're talking about so I'm so anyway so it doesn't really do
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:47.120]   me a lot of good to watch the TV but but I can play this in the in the corner
[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:50.640]   it's just a really nice standalone it's not a web app I mean you I don't know
[01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:54.720]   if you can watch it on the web or not but but it's a great little standalone
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:58.280]   that you can log into right now these are probably all web streams it's just
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:02.640]   aggregating them right well you know I know that the reason that I found it was
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:05.840]   actually throughout the zero English I think out of zero English not the Arabic
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:08.840]   one which is a bit propaganda but the English one is probably the best world
[01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:13.360]   news in the world I mean it's just that you get really a much better view of
[01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:18.440]   what's going on throughout the zero English than anywhere else and and so the
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:21.960]   only reason I found it was like that's the only place I could find a solid feed
[01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:26.280]   that was a reasonable resolution to look at and I don't want to ever put real
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:31.680]   player on my computer again so so anyway so the so I found that and runs on
[01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:36.080]   Silverlight which if you don't if you haven't gotten already you should go out
[01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:39.880]   and install everything's doing Silverlight now it's super light it's a great
[01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:44.000]   distribution platform for a lot of the stuff and so really that's interesting
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.280]   to hear you say that oh I love Silverlight really I was when it first came out I
[01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:52.360]   was like ah you know we'll see but it just it just seems to run cleaner than
[01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:56.480]   quick time or or flash I mean flash is great but and I don't know whether it's
[01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:59.600]   the developers and how they're using it or the infrastructure but I just know
[01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:03.200]   that the stuff is working that's running on Silverlight has really you know
[01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:08.960]   worked really really well and so so I'm very impressed with it and and so anyway
[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:14.000]   the so I would I would highly suggest live station the other one is a little
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:20.240]   less serious so these are the two my my two extremes the other one that that I
[01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:25.320]   blame Aaron Mayler Aaron is our producer for this week of photography and he
[01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:28.800]   sent it to me and it's all his fault and I'm gonna warn everybody ahead of time
[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:33.520]   because I try not to play games but Aaron sent me this thing called World of
[01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:39.960]   Goo have you guys seen world of yeah it's great isn't it I just I'm not allowed
[01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:44.120]   I so right now I'm keeping it too I'm not we have in like an hour ride to most
[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:46.680]   of the most of the locations that we're shooting on we're shooting you know all
[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:52.200]   over all around Tokyo and so I only allow myself to open it up on the bus
[01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:56.520]   like at the end of the day you know we've been shooting for 60 hours and I just
[01:07:56.520 --> 01:08:01.360]   want to you know do something else and a world of you is this crazy game where
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:05.600]   you have these stupid little bots and you're trying to build a structure to
[01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:10.080]   get somewhere and you know and there's all kinds there's all these different
[01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:13.720]   challenges and it's kind of a weight distribution you know it's it's a
[01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:16.760]   really kind of this beauty ladder that you're trying to build without it falling
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:23.400]   over and see it's remarkably simple and remarkably addicting yeah so I
[01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:29.560]   those my two live station and world of new two excellent choices very good
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:37.120]   choices Andy and I've got your picture I got a pic that is not knowing knowing
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:42.360]   who we're gonna have on today it's sort of a complimentary thing to delicious
[01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:47.120]   library I love delicious library I wish that every single application with the
[01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:50.120]   possible exception my work process because I don't like a stare at beautiful
[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:54.320]   things while I'm trying to write ugly things work like delicious library oh
[01:08:54.320 --> 01:09:00.160]   there is a product that is pretty cool called it in tele scanner that has
[01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:04.960]   directs it's kind of in the same category as delicious library it's not
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:10.840]   again it's not as slick it's not as cool but it has two things one again direct
[01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:14.720]   support for comic books where what you scan in the barcode but it'll put the
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:17.800]   information for the Grand Concomics debase and all those other online debases
[01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:21.400]   and will basically you scan in the latest Batman it will get you they'll get the
[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:25.200]   artist the title all the characters all that cool stuff it has another thing
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:31.120]   that it's more convenient when you when you're faced with a problem of having
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:34.920]   thousands of comic books that you just want to put in the database for a hundred
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:38.840]   twenty nine bucks you not only get the software but you get a USB like actual
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:43.640]   real barcode scanner so it's so much easier with this thing in your hand to
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:47.880]   just go flip flip flip flip flip processing a box at a time not really
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:50.920]   looking not even caring what's being processed as long as the numbers are
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:56.440]   being slurped in for two twenty nine you can go one step better and the package
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:10:02.280]   will include a little like battery operated independent barcode reader
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:06.160]   that's about the size of like a car remote starter so we don't even need to
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:09.200]   have the thing plugged in having anything plugged into your Mac book or in your
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:15.200]   iMac you just go into your closet and just you know adopt the standard comic
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:20.640]   book long box hunch you're just sort of squatting over it just you know flip
[01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:25.200]   flip flip flip flip flip I mean the big problem is always getting that first
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:28.560]   trip making your first trip to your library and get everything into the
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:32.240]   database after that it's a piece of cake you know when you you know when you
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:38.680]   bring home your 73 new comics per week you know to process each new stack so
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:43.760]   I like it I started using it about a month and a half ago the big question as
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:46.920]   always is going to be am I going to be continuing to use it over the next two
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:50.560]   or three months as I keep buying new comics but like I said when it came to
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:54.360]   the problem of I've got all these long boxes I cannot face the problem of
[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:59.920]   scanning all these in I was the one solution that worked for me it also had
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:03.800]   a little bit like delicious library it also has an online component it will
[01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:08.160]   publish your your database online for free and has an iPhone like online app
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:12.360]   so that you can view your database from any machine with a web browser or
[01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:16.760]   through your iPhone so it's it's prevented me from you know buying my
[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:20.880]   seventh eighth ninth or tenth duplicate copy of you know giant size creatures
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:26.480]   number two excellent excellent excellent you can take to the to the
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:30.120]   store yeah there you go
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:35.320]   there's a good and that I think just just locking my car and now will has a
[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:38.920]   roadmap for where to go with the delicious library and its comic book
[01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:46.720]   support yeah but number one please it's it's it's right up to now I only hit
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:50.640]   the Amazon database and you know so other databases is something I've I've
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:55.000]   thought about but then you know like two already had too many features so we
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.880]   definitely we gave ground to some of our competitors that way by saying look
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:02.080]   we're not gonna hit Library of Congress yet we're not gonna hit Comics database
[01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:06.640]   yet right we don't need them yet but right they should they should watch out
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:10.160]   especially because they're so damn expensive and I'm just like you know
[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:15.080]   yipes the databases are or the no that our competitors like well Intel
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:19.920]   scanners you know the lowest price version is 175 and we're like 40 bucks
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:23.920]   and well the comic versions of hundred twenty nine and that doesn't that doesn't
[01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:28.080]   glue the scanner does does the library support external barcode scanners oh
[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:33.080]   yeah absolutely we have a whole wide range of USB and we actually we sell the same
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:38.080]   exact same scanner that the same Bluetooth scanner that in tele scanner
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:41.520]   cells and so it's kind of funny because you know we're talking to the exact same
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:48.520]   distributor guy and he knows his fault so little library there good that's actually
[01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:51.680]   I point people at it and tell us canner when when they're like well do you do
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:56.920]   you know do you do food I'm like nope they do you do comics no they do well you
[01:12:56.920 --> 01:13:00.080]   should say it's a yes it's a it's a hundred and seventy nine dollar add-on
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:05.280]   just the enter code in tell a scan in our in the in the store and my take an
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:08.440]   extra three weeks because we have to go through an outside drop ship yeah the
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:13.040]   thing is I don't want their bug reports oh there you go well it's your turn
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:17.160]   will ship Lee what is what is your recommendation for the week well if I
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:21.240]   can if I can go outside the realm of computers you're talking about audible
[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:25.560]   and I I realized that the biggest the biggest thing that hit me this week was
[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:30.800]   I got Malcolm Gladwell's new book outliers on audible and I've been
[01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:34.320]   listening to it as I did his previous two books from audible and of course he
[01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:39.200]   he reads it himself and he's got that you know amazing voice yeah I think the
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:43.200]   word sonorous was invented for Malcolm Gladwell he doesn't look sonorous in
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:49.400]   person no he looks he looks he looks yeah I don't he he sees a weird weird duck
[01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:55.280]   but um yeah I'm really mad I started dead Ted the year after he spoke and I'm
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:14:01.200]   never met him and I was like damn it but he's he's one of my big heroes and so
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:04.160]   I'm loving the new book I think it's better than his other ones really
[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:08.800]   recommend everyone buy it on audible because honestly like like you're kind
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:12.680]   of jipping yourself if you buy the book and you don't hear Malcolm reading it
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:16.560]   yeah it's so much better to hear him say listen to the tipping point I would
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:20.400]   agree with you a hundred percent really is good yeah yeah good I'll have to order
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:24.600]   outliers I haven't ordered it yet fantastic great recommendation he says
[01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:28.400]   it only takes 10,000 hours of practice and you too could be an expert at anything
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:34.120]   yeah I would think of this 10,000 mistakes that's another way to put it if
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:38.720]   you only make one mistake an hour I can actually make them faster when did you
[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:46.960]   begin coding will I started coding well I bow when I was 13 I guess 20 years I've
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:52.800]   been doing it for well I'm 39 now so 25 yeah 25 years coding so I you probably
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:57.080]   easily have 10,000 hours under your own I have yeah way more but but I think
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:00.080]   about it it's it was neat to think about because as I'm listening to the book I'm
[01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:04.480]   thinking when did I hit that 10,000 mark and because there were there you
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:06.920]   know there's a lot of code that I wrote in the early days and I'm not
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:09.800]   particularly proud of and then there's there's definitely stuff that I'm really
[01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:13.440]   well he talks about that I mean there is there's a time when you break through
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:17.520]   and oddly enough no matter what the discipline it seems to be about 10,000
[01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:21.840]   hours good recommendation absolutely will take that outliers from Malcolm
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:26.000]   Gladwell and we're glad that it's an audible pick that just adds the beauty of
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:29.920]   it I might mention our friend Jeff Smith has a new ringtones for ringtone
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:33.600]   feeder if you're not a ringtone feeder subscriber yet you ought to be you can
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:39.160]   get the holiday ringtones have just come out I just downloaded them all for your
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:44.600]   iPhone ringtone feeders kind of cool it's a RSS feed but it's like a paid RSS
[01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:48.600]   feed so you would you get a password and then you add it to your iTunes and you
[01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:52.920]   just automatically get the ringtones so it's very cool I just downloaded the
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:57.800]   new ones from Jeff Smith and ringtone feeder thanks to a Closs Love Green and
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:02.520]   Jeff for sending that along to us ringtonefeeder.com so that's a bonus pick
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:05.520]   and I don't think it's very expect camera what the price is but it's just a
[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:11.240]   few bucks well we're done and if God and call recorder willing we have a show
[01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:15.720]   we'll be back next week actually as we're wrapping up Dan just wandered in

[01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:58.520]   blog on will shiply.com which okay talks about coding and life and stuff like
[01:16:58.520 --> 01:17:02.360]   that I'm pretty easy to find I'm actually on the first page of wills now if you
[01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:06.760]   just type in WIL with one L which I'm really proud of because for a while
[01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:11.400]   will we can just totally own to my ass but take it back man well he's he's still
[01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:14.920]   ahead of me but I get to the first page now I really think that's you know
[01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:18.840]   that's the new measure of oh yeah you know how cool you are as you type in just
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:22.920]   your first name and you're like come on baby you go if you type in Mojave
[01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:27.000]   experiment I'm like hits number one and two now which I think is what why is
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:31.480]   that because I just ripped him a new one for being complete dumbasses and you
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:35.720]   get all the all the Google juice that's hysterical yeah in fact I actually
[01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:41.240]   bought it and add by just to bring more people to my site because I want it so
[01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:45.400]   I actually bought the words Mojave experiment oh that's funny it was
[01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:49.240]   awesome this is Microsoft's kind of nutty way to get people to like Vista by
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:53.480]   pretending well first the big mistake they make I haven't read your I'll have
[01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:58.840]   to read your your your insults but the clear first mistake in my opinion is
[01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:01.880]   when you go to the website all the for the first minute all you hear is the
[01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:06.040]   complaints about Vista and for most people that's all they're gonna ever
[01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:09.240]   hear they say oh that's good okay I guess Vista sucks
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:14.280]   and then they say well nobody liked Vista but we secretly showed them
[01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:16.920]   features from Vista Vista and told them it was a new version of Windows because
[01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:21.480]   Mojave and they loved it they've kind of abandoned that ad campaign they
[01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:24.360]   only show now that they don't even mention Mojave they just show the little
[01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:28.680]   clips of people saying oh I didn't know you could do that with Vista
[01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:33.480]   yeah it's like it's like if if if we have an expert running the keyboard and
[01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:39.640]   showing you our Vista in a controlled environment on a machine that we set
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:42.680]   up ahead of time we're software that we install you'll love it
[01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:46.040]   yeah I'm like yeah I would love to have a valley doing everything for me you
[01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:48.840]   know that would that would also be a good way for me to like eat breakfast
[01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:52.920]   get dressed I mean shit everything's better that way yes everything's
[01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:56.920]   better when Microsoft does it for you well that's a good that's a very good
[01:18:56.920 --> 01:18:59.800]   point actually I hadn't really had a really thought about that you're
[01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:05.400]   absolutely right read it all at willshippley.com with one L that's the
[01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:10.360]   call me fishmeal blog which is obviously a tip of the hat to
[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:15.400]   Moby Dick yeah it's only only like two people have gotten that so thank you
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:19.880]   like nobody you ever know what are you talking about why do you want to be
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:23.240]   called fishmeal thanks no sense what's wrong with you
[01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:26.920]   Alex Lindsey's in Japan but you could still catch up with him at pixel core.com
[01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:31.800]   that's the site of the amazing guild of multimedia artists who live
[01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:37.000]   work train together well they don't have to live together at pixel core.com
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:41.560]   pixel core.tv is the place for the podcast including the incredible
[01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:46.840]   this weekend photography that he does with us the late Scott Born who's
[01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:51.160]   faded off faded off he probably had another another photo shoot to go to
[01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:55.240]   that's twippphoto.com for that podcast and we'll give Scott a plug he's giving
[01:19:55.240 --> 01:19:59.000]   away a lot of great stuff including a trip to Yosemite after Macworld
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.680]   that I'm hoping to go on with my new don't tell him
[01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:07.320]   Canon 5D Mark II don't tell him one too he has one too he already got one
[01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:09.880]   he's already got one he's got one down there I don't think he's shooting
[01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:12.120]   with a ton right now but he's just getting his head around it but
[01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:16.280]   man oh you know he's he's got a war bug so you know you can
[01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:19.800]   yeah he's just gonna buy every camera that caught mine still on backward I don't
[01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:24.440]   know how he got his so fast he's got his way he has his
[01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:31.880]   see ordering the D3X I bet you he will of course why do I even need to ask
[01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:36.120]   he's got a D3 and a D700 so here's my question did he get all new Canon lenses
[01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:40.120]   I thought he sold off his Canon lenses yeah I don't I don't know I don't know
[01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:44.440]   what's going on over there I saw the the McCaskles the McCaskles
[01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:51.080]   Chris and Don at Smug Mug got their 5D Mark II and put some 1080p video up on
[01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:57.800]   Smug Mug oh my god I'm just I know I'm I'm I'm really wishing that I had
[01:20:57.800 --> 01:21:01.720]   been able to get it before I came here behind the scenes with the LX3 which
[01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:08.520]   is fine but it's not the same 720p don't make 1080p well it's also a 720p kind
[01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:12.920]   of right you know I'm heavily impressed yeah I'm not that impressed with the 720p
[01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:17.080]   I have to say but it's fine it's it's great good sitting on set I have
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:19.720]   something in my pocket every time interesting happening I just pull it out
[01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:25.240]   exactly and shoot it and so and I nakos the Chicago Sun Time's smartest living
[01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:28.960]   reporter and he is no no no no no Roger Ebert
[01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:32.200]   oh yeah I forgot Roger Ebert's still there of course he's number two right
[01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:36.680]   after Roger Ebert actually the Sun Times is a great paper I've been reading
[01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:41.160]   more of more of it online I guess because of you it's well thank you very much
[01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:45.480]   man it's it's got a hell it's it does what papers do best in that good
[01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:49.960]   journalism good ideas and really real and but I'm leaving I'll obviously leave
[01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:54.520]   myself out of the picture here but some of the smartest most opinionated and
[01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:59.160]   yes articulate people that I've it's one of the few like new sites that I just
[01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:02.600]   read it just because I enjoy the way the people who contribute to it right yeah
[01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:06.360]   I'm the I would agree with you 100% it's kind of won me over I'm really impressed
[01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:13.240]   and of course at the celestial waste of bandwidth www.cwob.com
[01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:19.080]   ladies and gentlemen we are now adjourned another Mac break is broke
