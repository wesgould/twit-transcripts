[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   And oh, there's some news today.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Andy Nacos here for the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Great to see you Andrew.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   And the celestial waste of bandwidth.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   And Adam Inks is here from tidbits, the oldest.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Mac publication and the best for years.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Since 1984, tidbits.com.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Being tired out by Apple for 26 years.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   26 years.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   That makes it 19.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   When did you start?
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   1990?
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   April of 1990 was 81.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Very nice.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   So Andy and I got up a little early.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Well, I got up early.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Andy is on the East Coast like you, Adam.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   So it wasn't early for you.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Bunch time.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Bunch time for you.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   And watched a very tight, very well produced two hours from Apple this morning.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   We spent a lot of time talking about it, Andrew and I did.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   But what do you think, Adam?
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Yeah, I think it was well done.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   It was a classic Apple.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   I mean, it was smooth.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   I thought the little intro with the carpool karaoke guy with Tim Cook at the beginning.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   That's a great way to start.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   It was amusing without being forced.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   I mean, put it that way.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   They did a good job.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   I didn't feel it wasn't setting off the Hokie meters, which sometimes happens in these things.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   And just as an overview thing, I just want to say, I think they're doing, Apple continues
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   to do a really good job of diversity of presenters.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   No kidding.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   That's just, I mean, hopefully we can stop talking about this soon because it'll just be
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   the standard.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   But it was just nice to see that it wasn't all the old white guys.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.600]   Well, and Annie pointed out during the event that the photographs that they used to demonstrate
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.320]   the new iPhone camera also featured a lot of people of color, which was really a good
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.360]   and actually has kind of an undercurrent there that's very important.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.000]   The traditionally film has been tuned for Caucasian faces.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Precisely.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.840]   I mean, a lot of this, when I were talking about the image signal processor in the iPhone
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.200]   7, they didn't say it, but we were sitting there looking at the photos going and they've
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.840]   clearly included stuff in the code in this so that it is not going to screw up on people
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.120]   whose skin is not, well, mine color.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.120]   That's huge.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.120]   Your best palas could be.
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.920]   I think they need to do something about you.
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:06.520]   But no, I think that that's a kind of inclusiveness that Apple didn't even refer to, but is very obvious
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.760]   in the event.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.760]   And I welcome it.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.320]   I think it's fantastic.
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.960]   Apple's a global company too, so it's more than just being inclusive of different people
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:16.960]   in the US.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:17.960]   It's being global.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:18.960]   It is.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:19.960]   And it's fascinating.
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.520]   I mean, one of the things in Ithaca, I'm at Cornell University, tons of Chinese people
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.080]   here and people from China.
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.680]   And one of the things that you see actually a lot of times as women in the summer walking
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:38.520]   around with umbrellas, that skin color has lots of cultural meaning.
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.280]   People think very deeply about this.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:47.880]   So anything Apple can do to be respectful of people's opinions and whatnot is just a good
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:48.880]   thing.
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.240]   I mean, the terrible example when Google Photos was accidentally identifying black people
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.120]   as gorillas, that's about as bad as it gets.
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.280]   But even the little stuff, making sure that when it's doing white balance and skin tone
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:08.320]   stuff that it's picking up on all the gradations of what is out there.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.720]   Well, speaking of tones, we have some new phones.
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.120]   We have some new watches.
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.520]   We have new earbuds or air pods.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.040]   We have a lot to talk about.
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.040]   How should we do?
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.440]   Maybe we just go chronologically through the presentation.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.200]   Maybe that's the easiest way to do it, do it the way in the order Apple did.
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.200]   Although by the time we got to the end, there were a lot of things, a lot of questions,
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.720]   a lot of things missing.
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.520]   In a two hour event, they moved that quickly.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.840]   They obviously got as much in as they could, but nevertheless, there's still some questions.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.680]   We're doing this right after the event, so there may be some answers that we still don't
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:50.320]   have that we will have given the leisure to peruse the documentation.
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.440]   So it started, as you mentioned, with James Corden.
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:01.560]   This is really a nod to the fact that Apple has acquired carpool karaoke as a show, not
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.800]   with James Corden.
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.840]   He won't be doing it, but they're going to be selling that as an Apple exclusive, I guess,
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:10.840]   on iTunes.
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.600]   I think Tim Cook is going to be driving everyone around.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.600]   I don't know what carpool karaoke means if you don't have James Corden.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.520]   He's what makes it work.
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.600]   Also, let's not bury the lead of that segment.
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:27.040]   Apple, the CEO himself, is demonstrating Apple wearable technology for the very first
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.040]   time in the company's history.
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:33.120]   When he put on those, I don't know what purpose the glass of the LEDs in those glasses serve.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.680]   I'm guessing that it's sort of an IR-based audio transport system.
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:44.120]   I think actually you're missing even more important the Apple technology here, Andy,
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:49.480]   which is notice that James Corden is not watching where he's going most of the time.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.840]   This may it may say Range Rover or whatever on back there, but this is clearly an Apple
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:54.840]   self-tratting car.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:55.840]   Oh, interesting.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:01.960]   And I love the way Pharrell just appears magically and disappears from the backseat.
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:08.760]   Pharrell, who was when the Apple Watch first came out, was the first person I saw wearing
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:15.000]   a edition, the gold Apple Watch on his wrist, notably not wearing it in the backseat of
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.160]   James Corden's self-driving Apple car.
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.560]   Well, that's last year's watch.
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.960]   You just want to be seen wearing glass because you want to be shown wearing the ceramic
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:22.960]   watch.
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.160]   You better believe like he was told, "Spharrell, what did we tell you?
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.600]   Take the watch off and put it in your pocket as for the top of the show?"
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.600]   Not the end.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:37.640]   Apple did, by the way, we should just quickly, because people, I don't want people fast-forwarding.
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:42.720]   The Watch Series 2 and the new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus will be a pre-order, available pre-order
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.520]   on Friday in many countries.
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.600]   And then the following week in many, many more countries, I presume that means a midnight
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:54.000]   wake-up call for you and me.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.080]   And then 3 AM for you guys back east, midnight Pacific.
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:01.200]   So the last, last year when it came to the Apple Watch, the only reason why we got them,
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.680]   and I had basically said, "I'm getting off the bandwagon.
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.480]   I cannot do this 3 AM nonsense."
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:13.880]   But I brought the laptop into the bedroom just in case happened to be awake.
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:18.120]   Literally, 3.02 AM.
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.240]   My son, who is up late doing the work.
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.240]   Daddy!
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.600]   Makes me up by printing on the laser printer on the other room.
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.360]   And thank God he did.
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.480]   I guess I'm awake now.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.480]   This is one case.
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.920]   You snooze, you lose.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.440]   By the way, not just to watch, but also the new iPhone.
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.920]   And the one that's going to be so hard to get, I think, will be this piano black 256
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:43.840]   gigger that I'm thinking, if you don't get up at midnight on Friday, you're going to
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.320]   figure out a lot.
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:52.200]   They will arrive in stores and be available for delivery September 16th.
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.560]   So I'm leaving for vacation September 18th.
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.880]   So let's hope Apple's serious delivery.
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:57.880]   That delivery day.
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.880]   That one's going to be so black.
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.720]   There's all sorts of, there's all these black, you know, so black and so again.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:09.800]   Well, and then what the matte black finish they call, this is, we call our new black
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:10.800]   finish black.
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.800]   Yeah, that's under, it should be tactical.
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:14.800]   Good tactical black.
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.360]   We just can't do it anymore.
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.760]   Why aren't they calling it piano black?
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.840]   They're calling it jet black.
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:21.840]   It's shiny black though.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:22.840]   It is piano black.
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.760]   What we could usually call, right?
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.560]   I think because there are other, already other phones are calling themselves piano black
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.560]   and got to be new.
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.560]   And it applies plastic.
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:34.160]   There's something from Hitchhiker's Guide about the blackness, which I got.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:38.680]   Oh, yeah, it's the ship of hot black does the auto.
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:39.680]   It's black.
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.040]   So black, so black that like seems to fall out of it.
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:47.800]   I just, I just pushed a button and a, a, a, pushed a black button and a black light lit
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.360]   up and black to tell me not to push that button again.
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.360]   Yeah.
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.360]   Wow.
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.360]   Very impressive.
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.360]   Yes.
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.360]   Andy and not co with first.
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.880]   It was sort of informative book in my youth.
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.800]   But for me, the best.
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.320]   So, so the new watch has GPS, which people are looking forward to.
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:07.800]   It's swim proof, which all people are also looking forward to really very much pushing
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:11.160]   the all the health features that are going on there.
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:16.800]   And I think the coolest, the coolest hardware thing that Apple has done in a number of years
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:21.960]   is having a mechanical thing that just sort of like squirts the water out of the speaker
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:22.960]   court.
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:28.480]   It actually actually uses a speaker driver to actually squash out, like squeeze out the
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.480]   water from it.
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.280]   I bet that how many, how many videos we're going to see on day one of people trying to
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.520]   get like an actual vision of that coming out.
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.640]   It's a really small dog inside that shakes it.
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:43.520]   I just would love to have been a fly on the wall at that engineering meeting where somebody's
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:49.800]   eyes light up and he goes, you know, we could.
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:54.320]   And what is the, what is the noise that you have to play to get the phone to become a
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.320]   squirt gun.
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.640]   So let's, let's all I know is I'm going to, I'm going to 3D design and put up on maker
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:03.600]   and put on a thing of verse a tiny, tiny little spatoon that you can leave just for comic
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.960]   effect when you're charging your watch.
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:11.600]   So built in GPS, water resistance to 50 meters suitable for swimming twice as fast dual core
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.240]   processor, twice as bright.
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.840]   Now I never found the old watch to be less than bright, but boy, yeah.
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.360]   No, no, I can't see it at all.
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.360]   Okay.
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.360]   So you're a runner, Adam.
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:26.840]   Do you still use the Apple Watch for running or do you use a polar or some other?
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:34.000]   What I usually do is the double barreled approach with a Garmin 620 in the Apple Watch.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.160]   But the, and actually, I don't do that in races.
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.480]   That's the one time when I specifically take the Apple Watch off.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.200]   It is not the Apple Watch is useful.
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.960]   It's more just that I don't like taking watches on and off.
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.440]   It seems to me a good way to lose them.
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:51.440]   So, but I am intrigued by the new GPS chip because that's for runners.
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.400]   That means you don't have to take the phone with you, right?
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.200]   You don't take the day and phone with you.
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.400]   You just don't particularly the pluses.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.320]   They're huge.
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.320]   And they don't.
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.480]   It's just not a good thing to carry.
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:08.240]   I know very, very few serious runners who run with phones.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.760]   And by serious, I don't mean, you know, oh, competitive.
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.760]   I mean, just people who run a lot.
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.960]   Because they're annoying to run with.
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.960]   So that's, I think that's going to be really quite interesting.
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.920]   The brightness, yeah, that's a big deal.
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:23.560]   In the sun, it is very, very hard to see the current model.
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:27.360]   And then particularly again, when you're running, you're kind of bouncing around and
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:31.760]   you can't focus super well, particularly if you're 48.
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:35.200]   But I'm looking forward to seeing that.
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.200]   No, Nike.
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.200]   Go ahead.
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.520]   This one thing is also a really big deal.
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:43.600]   But one thing they didn't say anything about was biking.
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:47.200]   And the real question there, honestly, is battery life.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.240]   Because bikers spend a long time on their bikes.
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.880]   You go for a two hour ride.
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.520]   That's a short ride.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:57.040]   So, you know, if it's not going to have six or seven hours of battery life.
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.680]   They didn't say anything about battery life at all.
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:00.680]   Not a thing.
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:01.680]   Yeah.
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.680]   This is not a good sign.
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:08.320]   Typically GPS reduces, like significantly reduces battery life.
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.320]   Battery life.
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:15.720]   So the Garmin, for instance, will, it powers the GPS down after 30 seconds automatically.
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.960]   Maybe you can change that.
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:23.160]   But they're basically saying is that if you're not actually running, you should just stop
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:28.080]   using the GPS because it will eat your battery life so fast, you know.
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:32.720]   And that's a Garmin 625 to seven hours, the triathlete versions.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.760]   But look, show us again, because that's giant compared to an Apple watch, right?
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:37.760]   It's a big watch.
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:38.760]   There you go.
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:39.760]   Okay.
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:40.760]   It's not terrible.
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:41.760]   It's a little bit better.
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:45.480]   And then the new ones, the new ones are basically the same size, possibly a little smaller.
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.480]   This is a year old.
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.480]   Two years old.
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:48.480]   What about the Nike version?
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.600]   Because they announced a branded Nike version.
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.560]   What do you laugh at?
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:57.760]   Everyone in our Slack, our Slack discussion was like, that is the ugliest watch I have
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:58.760]   ever seen.
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:01.040]   Well, it kind of looks like the shoes, I guess.
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.040]   Yeah, I guess.
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.560]   It's a sport model, a sport band.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.840]   And then it has a dedicated Nike face, I guess.
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:13.960]   Yeah, that's what I don't quite understand is is anything more than a face, you know,
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.240]   in a different band?
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.040]   I mean, the band.
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:21.280]   They would have new hardware, but they've, it's a, it's a second vote on how Apple is
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:26.440]   willing to let other manufacturers have that exclusives to put exclusive watch faces and
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.320]   exclusive software on the device.
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:29.960]   The best bands to come with it.
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:30.960]   Exactly.
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:31.960]   Yeah.
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:39.720]   So yeah, so the Nike one, you know, speaking of someone who is in, you know, seriously
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:47.080]   in the world of athletics, people don't do lifestyle stuff in the same way.
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.880]   You know, you, you, you prick the shoes that fit your feet.
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.360]   You don't say, oh, I have to have Nike's.
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:56.720]   You know, and people don't brand themselves in quite the same level.
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:01.080]   Yeah, because I run a new balance because I pronate and they have a better platform
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.080]   for my feet.
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.160]   You don't choose the brand.
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:08.320]   And so, so that's, I mean, it's not that it will probably do badly or anything, but
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:15.120]   it just, it feels like a bit of a stretch for targeting the, the, the sport market.
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:17.960]   There is an app, a Nike plus run club app.
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:22.120]   Remember that Nike plus was early on something Apple supported with the iPhone and that little
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.120]   tag.
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.120]   Yeah.
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.120]   Yeah.
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.920]   But you had to have special Nike shoes, which was crazy.
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:28.920]   Yeah.
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:29.920]   Yeah.
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:30.920]   Right.
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.640]   And those things, I wasn't, no one was going to buy the shoes if you don't run in Nike's
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:33.640]   because they don't fit your feet.
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:35.560]   So all this is, is kind of interesting.
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.880]   I, I tend to think it's, you know, more not that big a deal.
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:39.880]   Really.
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:45.160]   It might actually get the, the, the, the watch into some areas and system outlets that it
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:46.560]   wasn't sold in before.
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:47.560]   That could be interesting.
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.080]   Get them in the sport, sport story.
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.080]   Yeah.
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.080]   Yeah.
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:56.560]   So, uh, motivating, uh, motivating sayings like, are we running today or?
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:57.560]   That's a good, it's Java.
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:58.560]   It's Sunday.
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:01.000]   Let's get out there and run.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.920]   Um, that's annoying, right?
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:07.800]   And I can't imagine a serious runner needs that and, uh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.960]   it just comes across a little bit sarcastic.
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:10.960]   Yeah.
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:11.960]   Are we running today?
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:12.960]   Yeah.
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.080]   Apparently, ah, according to home kit, you're on the sofa.
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.080]   It's a little bit, it's a little bit like, but to us is breathe app.
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.080]   I was like, stop freaking interrupting me.
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.080]   I haven't worked.
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.080]   I need to breathe.
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:29.240]   Uh, it, it also has some social elements you can get, uh, you know, uh, what do they say?
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.480]   Jim's two miles ahead of you.
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:31.480]   Hurry up.
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.080]   That kind of, that kind of thing.
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:36.080]   If Jim is two miles ahead of you, you're never going to see him.
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.080]   Yeah.
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:41.680]   If Jim is, you know, 30 seconds ahead of you, maybe two miles, you're talking, you know,
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.680]   seven to 15 minutes.
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:47.600]   By the way, the only, there are other colors besides that, uh, yellow and black.
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.600]   Yes.
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:58.200]   There's a gray and black gray and black and, you know, so, um, yeah.
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.680]   All right.
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.000]   There also is a new, uh, addition.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.760]   So the addition watch in the past was the very, very expensive gold.
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.720]   Oh, they didn't have a new one.
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.760]   The new addition is ceramic.
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:11.760]   Oh, the ceramic.
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:12.760]   Okay.
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:13.760]   Yeah.
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:18.000]   1249 for the 38 millimeter, 1299 for the 42 millimeter.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.120]   You're paying the price to have a white watch.
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.760]   And this is, this is kind of a status symbol, right?
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:23.760]   Not it's so white.
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:24.760]   That's right.
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:26.320]   It's as white as you are.
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:30.960]   That really surprised me because I thought that everything else about the, about today's
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:35.680]   a wash announcements was all about how we have figured out why people are buying the Apple
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.520]   watches and what they're using them for.
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:40.080]   Uh, they, we figured that people like them for fitness.
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:44.760]   So we're going to make it do cool stuff, but really work well for fitness.
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:49.280]   And I thought that there was this sort of implied statement over the past year that,
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:54.440]   yeah, we think that the solid gold $12,000 watches embarrassing as everybody else thinks
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.440]   it is.
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.440]   So don't worry about it.
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.960]   We're going to, we're going to make the stainless steel watch the nice watch from now
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:03.320]   on, but okay, it's, it's $1200 instead of $12,000.
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:09.680]   So you can still have a status watch without looking like you are either a, either a premier
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.840]   lead, football player or a recent lottery winner.
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:13.840]   It's a ramek.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:14.840]   I've had ceramic watches before.
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.920]   It's a really nice materials for a lightweight.
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:17.920]   It's hard.
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.280]   It's much harder than steel even.
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:26.080]   Um, it's not, it is, it is, it is a very, it is a very herb tarlock, like a white thing
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.720]   on your, it's not like gold.
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.120]   It's not like stainless steel.
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.400]   It's not even like aluminum, but it integrates.
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.920]   You are saying I'm wearing a white belt.
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:34.920]   I'm wearing white shoes.
[00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:36.720]   You're white shoes in white belt.
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:37.720]   Yeah.
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.520]   It's not the least tacky color.
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.240]   Um, it's when you drop it.
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.800]   No, no, no, no ceramic.
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:43.960]   It's very, very tough.
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:48.600]   I love my, I had a beautiful black ceramic watch that you couldn't scratch.
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:49.600]   You couldn't damage.
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:54.920]   Uh, it's a tough, tough, it's a great material for wristwatches and it's light.
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.480]   Um, so I, I like, it does not shatter.
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:01.760]   It's not, it's, it's a modern ceramic technology is very interesting.
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.320]   Uh, very advanced.
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:04.600]   Um, but it is white.
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:05.920]   They don't have any other color.
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:10.120]   It's gotta be old, but you know, remember designers often have those white glasses.
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:12.920]   You know, that shows their designer that in this scarf.
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:16.440]   And so I'm thinking maybe this maybe is that's for that set.
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:17.440]   I don't know.
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.520]   Maybe it comes with a scarf.
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:20.920]   It's the Johnny I've white room edition.
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:23.760]   Hermes should be, it should come with a scarf with the Hermes.
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.000]   It should come with a scarf.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.360]   The nicest, the nicest announcement I think from a personal point of view though is the
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.640]   they are retaining the first edition.
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:34.960]   This is the second edition watch.
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:39.640]   And now the first edition watch is now down to 269 was it, uh, which makes it a
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:44.640]   attainable, at least within within a nine iron of the cost of a premium fitness watch.
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:48.840]   Uh, I'm, I think that the health stuff that Apple's been doing is some of the most important
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:51.000]   work that they've ever been doing.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.120]   And I will, I like the signs that they are aware that not everybody, you're not, it's
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:20:01.240]   no good to, if you're trying to help out only people who can afford luxury items, that's
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:04.280]   like the, that's like the scenario of gataca or something.
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.280]   Here's the, you need to make things there for.
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:11.720]   Here's their Apple's battery life page, uh, and they're saying these were our goal for
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:15.720]   battery life was 18 hours after an overnight charge.
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:19.840]   This is for both Apple Watch series one and series two, which tells me that the battery
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:25.280]   life is the same, uh, for series one has a new dual core processor.
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:26.280]   Right.
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:27.280]   It's worth no.
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:28.280]   Yeah.
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:29.280]   So it should be faster, which will be nice.
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:35.280]   Uh, all devices, uh, were pre production, uh, Apple Watch series one series two pre-release
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:40.840]   software, um, all battery life based on eight, all day battery life based on 18 hours of
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:47.000]   the following use 90 time checks, 90 notifications, 45 minutes of abuse at a 30 minute workout
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   with music playback via Bluetooth.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.760]   That sounds like a fairly typical, never using the GPS even once.
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:56.920]   Let's see what they say about it.
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:02.920]   Let's see what they say about GPS using GPS, uh, without a phone workout time, five hours.
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:03.920]   Okay.
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:04.920]   That's pretty typical.
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:05.920]   Yeah.
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:06.920]   That's diligent.
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.560]   I said runners, five hours is usually good enough.
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:11.320]   Um, bikers is where that starts to fall down.
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:15.760]   You know, the problem, and I have this problem with all the sports fitness bands is that
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:21.200]   biking, rowing, a lot of the extra weightlifting exercises I do really don't register on these
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.200]   devices.
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:26.920]   Uh, you can, a lot of the, I think most of the serious, uh, bicyclists use bike computers
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.680]   that are actually mounted on the thing anyway.
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:32.360]   So I'm not sure if they're going to be really enticed by, uh, bike features.
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:33.360]   Yeah.
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:37.920]   The, where I think, I mean, what I've found in, in, in the community around here is, is
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:42.080]   that there's a lot of people who are primarily runners or they're triathletes.
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:46.160]   Um, but you know, they do, they only do one tri a year or something like that.
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:50.720]   And so they don't want to spend big bucks on the bike computer as well.
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:55.080]   And, um, and the biking, the, the watch is actually, um, my wife does this for instance.
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:22:00.280]   She goes on these big, um, Wednesday women's rides with 30 or 40 other women and everyone
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:02.640]   gets home and immediately posts to Strava.
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:03.640]   Right.
[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:06.040]   Because that gets, that's sort of the high I got home.
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.040]   Okay.
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.040]   Oh, interesting.
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:11.000]   Um, because they're sometimes they're breaking off at different points to where they, you
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.560]   know, where they parked and everything.
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:15.800]   And so it's a very big social thing, um, in that respect.
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:19.240]   And so it's not so much about, oh, I need to know exactly how fast I'm going at all
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:22.280]   times what my maximum speed was or what my power output was.
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:24.320]   No one's using power meters or anything like that.
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:27.120]   It's just about recording your ride.
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.600]   And so, and that's the watch is usually fine for that.
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.880]   And that's, that's why I think, I mean, that you're, and he's right.
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.800]   I'm serious cyclists will have serious by computer.
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.160]   So I'll have Garmin edges.
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:36.160]   Things like that.
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:38.800]   GPS will record what you want, which is distance and time.
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:39.800]   Yeah.
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:40.800]   And that's all you need.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:44.200]   I mean, it's not like pedal, you care about pedal strokes or anything like that.
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.800]   Then you have, then you have a Garmin edge.
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:46.800]   Yeah.
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.560]   You know, and that's, that's really, you know, you'll actually have a power meter that will
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:51.640]   hook into your computer and things like that.
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:57.200]   Charge time for the new watches about a how an hour and a half to 80% two hours to 100%.
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:58.680]   That sounds faster.
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:01.840]   Um, but I, you know, I just charge it overnight.
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:02.840]   So I might be wrong on that.
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:03.840]   Doesn't everyone?
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:04.840]   Yeah.
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:05.840]   Yeah.
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:09.720]   So, so they are giving you that information now on the, on the website.
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:12.800]   So that's, that's good news.
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:13.800]   And what else?
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:14.840]   Oh, and Pokemon go.
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:17.480]   How could I forgot?
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.360]   You can play Pokemon go on your app.
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:20.360]   Yeah.
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:21.360]   Watch too.
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:25.560]   Well, I actually, I have to say I was on vacation with my eight and 10 year old nephews.
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:27.960]   I'm in late July and we played a lot of Pokemon go.
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:30.480]   This was a, this is a great thing to do with eight and 10 year olds.
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:31.480]   Oh yeah.
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:36.160]   I was in late July and the Pokemon go app was pretty weak frankly.
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:40.480]   And, and I will say that the kinds of things they were showing off on the watch would be
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:41.480]   a huge boon.
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:45.240]   I mean, it was so annoying to deal with the deal with the phone constantly.
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:46.240]   I agree.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:49.520]   And I couldn't even take the damn thing for a, for a run and have it, have it registered
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:50.520]   accurately.
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:51.520]   So it was nice.
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:54.920]   It sounds like they're going to be using that either the GPS chip or at least the watch
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:57.960]   accelerometer to be recording this kind of stuff.
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:02.520]   Interesting, Andy, that you, you mentioned that they've kind of backed off on the gold.
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:06.120]   I don't see looking in the wrong place.
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:09.320]   I don't see a gold edition on the series too.
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.880]   They just have to ask.
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.720]   Maybe you have to know somebody.
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:13.720]   I don't know.
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:19.840]   The most expensive is the ceramic at 1299 for the 42 millimeter.
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:24.520]   They are no longer offering the $18,000 Apple watch.
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:26.600]   That was probably a bad idea from day one.
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:27.600]   Yeah.
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:28.600]   I think that was just embarrassing.
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:33.240]   I'm pretty sure there was a subject of intense debate inside Apple before the launch.
[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:35.800]   And yeah, I'm looking at the front page of Apple right now.
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:38.680]   And you see Apple watch series to the big graphic.
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:43.160]   All of them like coming out of the water, like Esther Williams, information and you see
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:44.600]   everything but gold.
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:45.600]   Here's the good news.
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.000]   If you bought a gold, collect your side edition.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   Right.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.600]   But that's the, now we're going to see like the competition between those who are overly
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.480]   concerned about what other people think.
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:58.920]   Do you want people think that you could not afford the $12,000 gold watch or do you want
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:02.680]   people to think that you have, oh, you have last year's style.
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:03.680]   Oh.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:08.760]   See, I mean, the thing that was always funny about that was that at $18,000, you're competing
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:12.480]   with the watches that talk about how you're going to hand it down to your kids.
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:13.480]   Right.
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:15.040]   You know, this is not this watch.
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:16.040]   Yeah.
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:17.040]   Yeah.
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:20.880]   But an Apple watch, I mean, everyone knew that it was going to be obsolete within X amount
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:21.880]   of time.
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:22.880]   Right.
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:23.880]   And that was 18 months.
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:24.880]   That was the answer.
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:25.880]   Yeah.
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:26.880]   Yeah.
[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:30.480]   Should somebody upgrade if they have the existing Apple watch?
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:32.680]   All depends on the GPS, honestly.
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:36.800]   Swimming, we're swimming in GPS if you're missing those two features.
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:41.960]   And but frankly, if it's been in the, if it's been in the drawer for the past year, it's
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:45.280]   probably not because of the lack of GPS and lack of swimming features.
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:46.480]   So I don't think they will.
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:52.240]   And that's something Apple should probably show some concern about IDC yesterday released
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:54.240]   some sales numbers for the Apple watch.
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.280]   Apple does not release sales numbers.
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:26:01.920]   So whatever IDC this says is projection, but they say that the Apple watch is losing
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:08.060]   ground as the basic wearables gain ground of 48% drop in Apple watch sales year over
[00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:09.060]   year.
[00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:11.800]   Now, maybe that's because people are waiting for Apple watch too.
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:15.400]   I mean, but I think it is dominating fit.
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.440]   Fit is grow has grown 28%.
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:18.440]   Yeah.
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:21.920]   I think the most important thing that teaches us is that whoever is buying a Fitbit is
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.800]   telling people, Oh my God, you have to have this is great.
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:28.200]   People who are buying Apple watches are the people who are excited about it.
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:32.720]   And then they're either not wearing them anymore or once again, they're not using them
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:36.640]   at the office in such a way that anybody is asking, Hey, did you just do that on your
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:37.640]   watch?
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:39.160]   Can I do that on my watch?
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:40.160]   Yeah.
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:44.120]   The, the, I mean, what I will say is that the addition of the GPS and the swimming features
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:51.760]   do mean that if you were using an Apple watch and you're considering buying the next Garmin
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:57.680]   or polar or Nike sport watch, you might say, ah, I'm going to put that money towards an
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.760]   Apple watch and just have one watch that I can wear all the time.
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:06.440]   So that is finally the option there that Apple may, may, may improve a bit on.
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:08.560]   We are talking about the Apple event.
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:11.920]   There's lots more to talk about, including the new iPhones, but we're going to take a
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:12.920]   little break.
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:18.440]   Adam Anks is here from tidbits at tidbitcet.com a free Apple newsletter.
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:24.080]   It's a must read for anybody who watches this show, for instance, and, but also your support
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:28.680]   is welcome and being a paying of tidbits subscriber me to help Adam and his team get
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:29.680]   their work done.
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:32.080]   They also have those great in control manuals.
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:35.840]   And I'm sure somebody's scribbling away on the new in control for the Apple watch too
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:38.400]   and iPhone 7.
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.400]   They will be if they're not already.
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:44.960]   I was going to say, yeah, take control of Sierra and, uh, and Iowa is to well underway.
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:45.960]   Yeah.
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.960]   And we were actually, we're looking to see if there were going to be any Mac announcements
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:49.960]   at all.
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:50.960]   There were absolutely none.
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:51.960]   None.
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:52.960]   Zip.
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:56.240]   That was, that was our, well, what that means is there's going to be, I think there, there's
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.960]   got to be an October event with iPad and Mac.
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:27:59.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:01.640]   We're just, we're just hoping they'd give us a date.
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:02.640]   We always like dates.
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:03.640]   Right.
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:04.640]   Makes our lives easier.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.640]   Yeah, not even a nod.
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:06.640]   Yeah.
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:09.880]   They gave C a more time than they gave Macintosh.
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:19.200]   So, but I think that the message, the new messages app, for instance, for iOS 10 and which will
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:25.640]   be kind of mirrored on the watch that by itself is I could use some in control manual
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:26.880]   information on that.
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.520]   There's a lot of hidden stuff in there.
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:33.360]   Renee Richie had explained to me how to change the make the thing big and to get the, and
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:34.520]   to get the backgrounds.
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:35.520]   It's not obvious.
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:36.520]   You have to figure it out.
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:40.120]   We had to take control of messages book a while back.
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:41.840]   Honestly, it didn't sell well.
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:46.600]   Oh, you know, it's one of those things where it turns out people weren't that interested
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.640]   in learning how to take control of messages.
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.640]   Or they figured it out.
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:51.640]   Well, yeah.
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:53.960]   And I think the, I mean, the new stuff is confusing.
[00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:54.960]   Yeah.
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.560]   But the other thing that we've discovered, and this is, I mean, I sort of hate to say
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:01.040]   this because I think your audience is probably a little different than our core book buying
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:02.040]   audience.
[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:08.000]   But we just did a survey and just everything we've heard people say, really not interested
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.520]   in these features and messages.
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:10.520]   Interested.
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:14.480]   People do not give a damn about big emoji or dropping balloons or things like that.
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:16.640]   They just want to use it for text messaging.
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:17.640]   Wow.
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:18.640]   Yeah.
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.880]   So that's, you know, that's my audience, which is probably skewing a bit older, a bit more
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:24.000]   quote unquote serious.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.360]   You know, the young folks out there probably saying, Oh, I really want my big emoji.
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:31.280]   Actually, I thought it was the soccer mom messages.
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:35.040]   I didn't think it was young people who were using Snapchat anyway.
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:40.400]   I thought it was people like me and soccer moms and those, the middle, the middle age
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:44.320]   folks who are getting me and I'm being very generous to myself.
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:45.320]   Middle aged.
[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:49.640]   Unless I plan to live in a hundred eighteen, which I do.
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:57.440]   Andy and I go also here for the Chicago Sun times and it's great to have you once again.
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:00.480]   You decided not to pursue an invitation to the event.
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.000]   Do you regret not getting to play with this stuff?
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.760]   Because that's the one thing you're missing.
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:06.760]   Not really.
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:11.080]   I don't want, don't care about sharing earwax with my compatriots in the journalism industry.
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:13.640]   I don't, I mean, it's not what I do.
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:17.520]   There are other journalists who need to have as much data on day one as possible.
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:21.760]   I'm, I'm going to spend tonight writing as opposed to furiously typing as I'm doing this
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:26.840]   podcast and I just, I'm, I have much, much better, I'm much more alert today than I would
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:29.960]   have been had I been spending the last 12 hours in airports.
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:35.000]   Well, and the good news is for the first time in a while, Apple's making these available
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.280]   pretty quickly, only 10 days after the event.
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:38.760]   It's been a couple of years since they've done that.
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:43.000]   So you won't have to wait too long to get a hands on in the privacy of your own home,
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.640]   if you know what I mean.
[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:47.680]   I showed it, maybe you don't.
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:51.920]   I showed it a front to you by the ring video doorbell.
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:53.280]   Get your hands on this sucker.
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:54.280]   Oh my goodness.
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:56.080]   I love the ring video doorbell.
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:58.400]   We've got one on the front door of our house.
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:04.400]   And the beauty of it is I can see when somebody rings a doorbell, not only can I see them,
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:05.960]   I can talk to them.
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:12.200]   It's a doorbell with a HD camera, nice wide angle lens, plus a speaker and a microphone.
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:14.440]   In fact, it's got motion sensors too.
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:19.000]   So if somebody just walks up to the front door and then decides to back off, I can also
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.960]   see that when the delivery guy comes with the package.
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:25.160]   In fact, I'm expecting a package I need to sign for today.
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:28.320]   I could just, I say, Oh, ah, I'm in the bath.
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:29.320]   And you just leave it here.
[00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:31.040]   I'll sign in the air or something.
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:33.040]   Sometimes that works.
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:35.120]   Ring.com/Macbreak.
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:40.520]   Right now they've got some pretty good deals on the ring of security bundles they're offering
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:42.360]   because there's more than just a ring video doorbell.
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:47.160]   They've got the original ring doorbell with a year long battery for people without wired
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:51.560]   doorbells and then the pro, which is a slimmer model that doesn't have the battery.
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:53.520]   So that's for wired doorbells only.
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:54.520]   That's what I have.
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:56.760]   I actually think the pro is a great idea.
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:00.960]   It's a slightly higher quality 1080p camera instead of 720p.
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:07.440]   But you also can buy the ring stick up cam, which is like a ring video doorbell minus
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.560]   the doorbell.
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:12.800]   So you can use it to cover areas that the doorbell doesn't like the sides and backs of
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:13.800]   your house.
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:19.040]   And it's wireless when you get this solar panel that works with the ring stick up cam
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:23.640]   to keep it working and charged all day and all night.
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.840]   Very sweet stuff.
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:26.840]   It's weather resistant.
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:27.840]   It's wire free.
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:29.080]   You can put it anywhere.
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:32.720]   You can hear and see and speak.
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:34.760]   Hey, what are you doing in my rose bushes?
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:35.760]   Get out of there.
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:37.600]   Get out of my rose bushes.
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:44.120]   You also can get the ring sign, the illuminated solar security sign that deters and tutors
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:45.720]   before they get to your door.
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:48.840]   It lights up at night thanks to the solar panels on it.
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:49.840]   Just awesome.
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:53.280]   And there's even the ring chime you could plug into any standard power outlet.
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:57.760]   It will ring when your doorbell rings, just like your chimes in your hallway.
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:02.760]   But it's a great way to extend those doorbells out to workshops or garages or places where
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:04.560]   you wouldn't normally hear the doorbell.
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:11.280]   So pick your bundle and get up to 150 bucks off right now when you go to ring.com/macbreak.
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:13.400]   This is a great gift for parents.
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:17.400]   If you have older parents who are a little nervous about security, not happens as we
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:18.400]   get older.
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:19.400]   My mom doesn't get out.
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:25.600]   We have the stick up cam watching her side, you know, Ali by her house and the ring doorbell,
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:27.000]   let her know when somebody comes to the door.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.440]   That is just awesome.
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:34.600]   And it's easy to install ring.com/macbreak up to 150 bucks off right now.
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:37.280]   And we thank Ring for their support of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:38.960]   All right, Apple's event.
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:39.960]   Let's see.
[00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:42.360]   Tim Cook very poised, did a great job.
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:50.240]   No mention as at WWDC of iPhone security of why they were fighting the FBI.
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:51.880]   That's all water under the bridge now.
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:55.680]   They didn't mention privacy security at all.
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:59.560]   I guess they felt like they'd explained iOS 10 and Sierra.
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:02.680]   And you know, and we're going to let what they've said stand.
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:04.880]   People get the message that Apple is all about privacy.
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:07.480]   I don't think they have to belabor that point.
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:08.480]   Yeah.
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:11.400]   And also they're very, very wise at understanding how media works.
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:15.920]   That if they were to, let's say, if they were to make a joke, for instance, about Samsung's
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:20.280]   problems with the Note 7, that's what people would be talking and writing about.
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:25.200]   If they had to start it off by talking about their other quote, ongoing war with governments
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:31.080]   about privacy or their problems with the EU, that would have been one of the big things
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:32.080]   people were talking about.
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:35.720]   This way we're all focusing on the actual hardware that they're trying to have a good
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:36.720]   sales quarter with.
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:37.720]   Yeah.
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:38.720]   And the headphone jacks.
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:39.720]   Yeah.
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:41.600]   We get to that one in a little bit.
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:47.720]   By the way, I remember seeing pictures Renee Richie and Marcus Brownlee posted on Twitter
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:49.480]   this morning of the badge.
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:53.440]   And now I realize those were piano black badges.
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.440]   Mmm.
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:35:00.720]   Should have realized Apple was trying to tell us something with those media badges.
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:02.040]   Let's see.
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:09.560]   After the Apple Watch, we cover everything that they mentioned with the Apple Watch.
[00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:10.560]   Mmm.
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:11.560]   I think so.
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:17.360]   Let's talk about, they mentioned education and their partnership with the federal government
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:18.360]   on the...
[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:22.680]   There were some early announcements, stuff when they were going through Pokemon Go and
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:24.320]   Mario coming to the iPhone.
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:25.320]   Mario was huge.
[00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:26.480]   I didn't mention Mario.
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:27.480]   That's huge.
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:28.480]   Yeah.
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:33.080]   And they got, I'm not even going to attempt his name, but they got the guy who, I guess,
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:34.080]   created Mario.
[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:41.800]   And he's spoken Japanese most of the time.
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:42.800]   Yeah.
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:43.800]   He was great.
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:45.600]   Super Mario run.
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:49.560]   It's a running, you know, endless runner to style app.
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:53.760]   Somebody said, "Looks a lot like Sonic the Hedgehog because he's gathering coins."
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:54.760]   Yeah.
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:56.000]   But it is Mario.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   Yep.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.240]   And that's the first time we've heard of any mention of any of the iWork apps in a keynote
[00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:02.240]   in years.
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:03.240]   That's true.
[00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:04.240]   We do collaboration.
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:07.480]   But as part of the education thing.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:08.480]   Wait a minute.
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:10.680]   Are you saying these collaborations are not new, Adam?
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:11.680]   Oh, no.
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:12.680]   It's a new one.
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:13.680]   But they've done...
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:16.040]   What did they call it?
[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:18.600]   The last update was three years ago, was 2013.
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:20.160]   Oh, they did.
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:21.640]   They did one well before that.
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:24.200]   I remember it never got out of beta.
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:25.200]   Oh.
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:26.560]   They announced it at Macworld.
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:32.440]   And I remember planning to the product manager because it seemed thoroughly featureless.
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.760]   And he's like, "It's not for people like you."
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:39.160]   I was like, "Yeah, people who want to collaborate."
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:40.680]   And that one never made it out of beta.
[00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:43.080]   And they made the big splash about it at the keynote.
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:44.080]   Yeah.
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:46.120]   And there's the stuff they did via iCloud.
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:48.040]   And we'll see.
[00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:51.000]   They glossed over it so quickly.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:56.560]   But real time collaboration needs two big things to be successful.
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:02.240]   One, you need some level of simultaneous commenting that you need to know be able to
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:06.760]   communicate with the people who are screwing with your presentation in real time.
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:09.760]   How do you tell them to don't touch that?
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:10.920]   So that's one thing.
[00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:13.960]   And then the other thing is you need to know who's doing what.
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:19.520]   So this is a common thing in Google Docs with revision track, revision history, or way
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:24.360]   back when in some of the early real time editors where people would be typing in different
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:29.240]   colors so that you can tell who's doing what.
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:34.760]   And again, also having some level of version control so that you can see that Sally just
[00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:36.440]   did that and that was wrong.
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.360]   So you're going to need to revert it.
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:43.160]   So we'll see how the details really work once they get this stuff out.
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:49.320]   But I am not holding my breath because Apple has never done a good job on collaboration.
[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:52.600]   So I mean, I'd like to mention that in the Mario run.
[00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:58.440]   And by the way, I think that's Nintendo's first game to operate a non-Nintendo hardware.
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:00.680]   Nintendo said that they wanted to do this.
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:04.920]   They also said that none of the games would be the existing Mario games.
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:08.520]   They'd all be reimagined new games, which is a shame because I think there's a lot of
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:11.200]   people who would love to play Mario breathers on the iPhone.
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:13.720]   There's not only any reason you couldn't, right?
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:15.560]   Or what is it Mario?
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:18.520]   You just get a game emulator and size loaded.
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:20.200]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:21.960]   That's true too.
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:26.680]   They talked a little bit about the App Store before they mentioned the watch 500 million.
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:27.680]   What was it?
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:28.680]   It was a billion apps.
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:29.680]   What was it?
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:30.680]   It was a billion iPhones.
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:31.680]   It was a billion iPhones.
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:34.680]   It was a billion apps downloaded.
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:35.680]   Wow.
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:36.680]   Yeah.
[00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:44.040]   500,000 games on the store, most popular gaming device in the world.
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:47.760]   140 billion App Store downloads.
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:48.760]   That's amazing, isn't it?
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:49.760]   Yeah.
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:53.160]   The one thing that actually was also interesting about the Super Mario run was they said it
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:54.400]   would have a set price.
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:39:00.000]   You know, win app purchases and which watch all the apps in the App Store go to free
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   plus.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.320]   Let's see how we can hit you up for in app purchases was a nice, a nice change.
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:05.320]   I agree.
[00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:08.160]   Not a freemium app, but just to buy it and use it forever.
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:10.360]   I like that.
[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:11.360]   All right.
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:14.360]   Now we move on to the new iPhone.
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:18.520]   And by the way, if you were watching Twitter carefully, you might have noted that Apple
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:26.600]   scooped itself, somebody at Apple, inadvertently pre-tweeted the announcement and everything
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:31.960]   that we were to find out a few minutes later was released earlier.
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:34.080]   Now I see it as pre-order now.
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:37.360]   And I think that that means that not only they pre-tweet it for today, they meant to
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:42.160]   tweet this on Friday because the pre-orders aren't available to Friday.
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:44.800]   So somebody is in a common way.
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:46.160]   They're trying to get out of the office early.
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:48.560]   It was like right before the Labor Day weekend.
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:49.560]   No one's pushing that.
[00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:51.040]   No one's sticking around after 3.30 in the afternoon.
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:52.040]   I was just pushing Friday.
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:53.040]   No one will see it.
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:57.560]   The ghost of Steve Jobs just threw an iPhone at someone.
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:00.560]   So let's talk about the new iPhones.
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:06.320]   And by the way, Apple's store was down during all this giving some people some thought that
[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:10.480]   maybe we'd be able to buy this now, but no.
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:13.120]   They just closed the store because they want to mess with them.
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:16.120]   Someone was saying that they, I don't know if this is still true, but they had to close
[00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:20.080]   the store back originally because it was all based on web objects.
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:24.240]   And they actually had to shut it down to put in his goose.
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:27.240]   Now they just do it to excite everybody.
[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:29.120]   Yeah, it's really.
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:32.440]   Here's the picture on the front page at apple.com.
[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:34.600]   This is 7.
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:38.160]   And maybe it's just great photography.
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:42.440]   They're good at product shots, but it does look very pretty and sexy.
[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:47.160]   How changed is this though from the iPhone 6s 6s plus?
[00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:51.000]   Really big of one which there is the first change they've made to the home button since
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   version one of now it's all it's no longer mechanical.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.720]   It's now haptically based.
[00:40:55.720 --> 00:41:00.960]   You can imagine ways that they can sort of add to that in the future if they're making
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:03.480]   this into a completely solid state device.
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:07.400]   The first time they're promising waterproofness that the iPhone has always been really, really
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:11.440]   hugely water resistant, not to the point where they could make a promise that they would
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:15.960]   have to back up in case someone did get their phone destroyed by water.
[00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:19.280]   But now they're saying no is we're saying IP 67 you are absolutely going to be able
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:22.760]   to to splash on this and it'll work just fine.
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:26.600]   The CPU bump is significant as it always is.
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:29.080]   And that's it's not on Android devices.
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:34.280]   You often sort of look at a CPU bump kind of skeptically because okay, that means that
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:36.160]   certain benchmarks were run faster.
[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:39.880]   But how is that going to translate into a better experience with apple the way that
[00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:42.440]   they integrate the hardware and that's software in the OS.
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:47.080]   It really does make everything work better, including the camera, which is the next really
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:50.040]   big huge thing for everything.
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:54.360]   I like the fact that Phil Schiller finally, I think for the first time in on the stage
[00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:58.760]   of the keynote made a point of exactly how much is going on behind the scenes of that
[00:41:58.760 --> 00:41:59.760]   lens.
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:03.720]   It's not is a camera module and the camera module sends back to the CPU.
[00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:07.040]   Here is the here's a JPEG that we collected from the sensor.
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:12.240]   No, it's really doing I think he said 100 billion calculations in like a fraction of
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:17.440]   a second, including doing things like sampling several different images and combining them
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:22.120]   in different ways, doing different kinds of color correction, identifying faces, identifying
[00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:23.440]   people in there.
[00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:27.920]   And a lot of cameras do this to one extent of the other, but I don't know any other phone
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:35.480]   platform that takes such a such a big leap into the idea of a synthetic photograph.
[00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:39.280]   I mean, it's still behind you take one, you tap a button once and it takes a beautiful
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:43.520]   picture, but it does so much behind the scenes to make sure that picture comes out great.
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:48.080]   And the two lenses that you get on the iPhone 7 Plus, that's great, but you also get that
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:53.880]   same sort of improved imaging on the iPhone 7 nothing.
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:58.120]   You also are adding, by the way, optical image stabilization on the iPhone 7, which used
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:01.480]   to be exclusive to the 6 Plus.
[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:05.440]   They are talking about a camera that has a, I don't know, I wrote down, I wrote down
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:10.880]   the words that they use that's not a standard that I recognize to explain that it's okay,
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.880]   they call it wide color capture.
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:19.080]   So according to the keynote data, that it will have a much better gradations of color,
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:24.400]   much better sensitivity to shifts and stuff like that and much better translates into
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:25.920]   better skin tones and stuff like that.
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:29.880]   Isn't the wide color stuff related to the larger color gamut they've been talking about
[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:35.080]   like on the iMac monitor where there's a new new Hollywood based standard or something
[00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:36.080]   for them?
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:38.240]   Yeah, this is what I'm trying to get the actual name of the standard.
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:42.320]   They're talking about two separate things from the keynote about here is the, they're
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:46.920]   talking about changes they've made to the screen to make it capable of better color reproduction.
[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:51.200]   And then they've also talked about, so about differences they've changed made to the camera.
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:54.760]   So I'm just trying in my own head not to get those two confused just in case they're using
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:58.880]   actual standard that they can promise on the screen, but on the camera, they just found
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:02.560]   a trick they can use that will have great effects, but they can't tell, they can't tell
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:03.560]   us what it is.
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:09.000]   I was really really stunned when Phil Schiller said that they were, they each photo there
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.840]   was a hundred billion operations being performed behind the scenes.
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:14.840]   What?
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:16.600]   Yeah, yeah, it was sort of like really?
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:17.600]   A hundred billion.
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:20.280]   Well, again, we're talking about one plus one equals two.
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:22.200]   We're not just talking about it yet.
[00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:23.200]   Really?
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:25.000]   How are you calculate that?
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   Like the number of stars?
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.960]   Not so much.
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:35.920]   So here's the color palette you've got, we have to say bye bye to space gray, which was
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:41.600]   I think never a beloved color, but we do have still the rose gold and regular gold.
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:43.600]   We've got a silver.
[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:50.680]   The jet black is the shiny piano black and just black, which I would call matte black.
[00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:56.520]   And if you look at this picture without all the fancy lighting and, you know, glossy reflections,
[00:44:56.520 --> 00:45:00.440]   they look pretty much like the iPhone 6s and 6s plus.
[00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:02.400]   The sizes are roughly the same.
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:05.600]   I'd have to get out of the ruler and measure the difference.
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:07.800]   It's hard yet either, but I think they're pretty.
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:08.800]   Pretty close.
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:15.640]   138 grams for the smaller, 188 grams for the larger one, 4.7 versus 5.5.
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:21.040]   The real question of cases are the dimensions sufficiently similar that you will you need
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:22.040]   to buy a new case?
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:26.720]   I'm thinking Apple said an all new range of cases and batteries.
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:29.120]   That's what Tim Cook said at the end then are filled in.
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:32.960]   So I have a feeling that might be, you know, it doesn't take much of a change to make those
[00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:34.680]   old cases obsolete.
[00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:40.000]   Well, remember that these don't have phone jacks in them and the iPhone 7 plus has two
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   lenses.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   So that's true.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.560]   By definition, it's going to need a new case.
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:46.000]   The wide color display, they're calling P3.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.960]   Is that the in East industry standard?
[00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:48.960]   You were.
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:49.960]   Yes.
[00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:50.960]   P3.
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:56.440]   Dual domain pixels for wide viewing angles.
[00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:59.120]   No more of that dark trench or whatever thing.
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:01.120]   I don't understand some of the things they say.
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:02.800]   I love I love some of this terminology.
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:06.400]   I'm sure it's correct terminology and everything, but it's more like wall wall wall.
[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:08.280]   Why better?
[00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:11.800]   No blue, by the way, we'd heard rumors there might be a blue version, no blue version unless
[00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:14.840]   they announced it later for China or other markets.
[00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:19.720]   The A10 chip, they're now dubbing a 10 fusion.
[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:22.200]   Not sure how that's different from just an A9.
[00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:24.200]   Because it runs hot.
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:25.200]   It's the infusion.
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:28.640]   Well, I think what they're talking, I would guess what they're talking about is the fact
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:31.640]   that it's a quad core processor.
[00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:38.120]   But like many Android phones do this as well, which is that they don't engage all the processors.
[00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:40.880]   Actually, so do the Intel chips on the desktop and laptop.
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:43.200]   They don't engage all the processors unless necessary.
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:49.640]   They can use slower speed, lower capability processors to preserve battery life.
[00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:54.600]   And so I would guess that's what fusion means is a quad core 64-bit architecture with a
[00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:58.160]   M10 motion coprocessor inside.
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:01.200]   In the early days of the motion coprocessor, that was a separate chip, I think.
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:05.640]   But now it's in the dip.
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:09.160]   That was another constant tractoring during this keynote.
[00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:12.360]   Time and time again referring to chips that they manufactured themselves.
[00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:14.160]   They designed themselves.
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:18.640]   They underscore something that Renee for instance keeps telling us, reminding us of time and
[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:22.880]   time again, that Apple is one of the biggest chip manufacturers in the world and also tracks
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:28.520]   with stuff that I keep hearing about chip engineers who their dream is not to work for
[00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:29.520]   Intel.
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:34.240]   Their dream is to do important work and wear sandals and a turtleneck sweater at Incubartino
[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:37.760]   because they're doing some really super interesting stuff, which is the stuff you can do when
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:40.720]   you're not trying to satisfy a hundred million hardware clients.
[00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:46.720]   You're just trying to satisfy one really laser focused product line.
[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:53.640]   So just to go back very slightly, I did just confirm that the weight at the size of the
[00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:57.680]   iPhone 6S and 7 are the same.
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:47:58.680]   Oh really?
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:00.680]   Exactly the same.
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:05.280]   So the only real difference was going to be the headphone jack and the dual camera things
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:08.800]   in terms of certain cases.
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:14.240]   The new ones are like four to five grams lighter.
[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:16.680]   Okay, interesting.
[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:19.120]   Just a little bit, just a little bit like that headphone jack.
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:20.720]   I knew that weight a lot.
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:22.640]   It was on the weight was in the headphone jack.
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:27.280]   It was gold plated and gold is happy.
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:30.680]   Let's see as we continue on, we're just going to run through the spec sheet might as well.
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:34.520]   12 megapixel front camera with F18 aperture.
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:36.080]   That's fairly wide aperture.
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:40.200]   That's and realize that's one of the biggest things you can do for a mobile camera.
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:44.160]   Give it a wider aperture because that prevents the camera from having to go to the higher
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:46.640]   ISO's which is story image quality.
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:52.520]   Just by comparison, one of the biggest buzz pre buzz items for about the new Moto series
[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:57.320]   of phones is the new hassle code developed with Hasselblad, a full camera back.
[00:48:57.320 --> 00:49:01.880]   You could snap onto the back of it that had its own sensor as an actual optical zoom lens
[00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:03.880]   and a flash and everything like that.
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:08.360]   And I haven't used it yet, but I've been talking to people who have the minimum F stop of that
[00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:09.360]   is F 3.5.
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:16.880]   So yes, it's nice to have a larger image sensor as nice to have a real glass lens, but who
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:20.600]   cares because it has to go to super high ISO's to make it even work.
[00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:25.000]   So there are people who are people who have used it are saying that it doesn't even necessarily
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.640]   take better pictures and the Motorola is built in camera.
[00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:32.320]   So going to a faster aperture and that device is a big, big deal.
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:35.560]   The F18 is only for the 28 millimeter wide angle lens.
[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:39.880]   The telephoto lens on the iPhone 7 Plus will be F 2.8.
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:41.600]   But that's not uncommon.
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:43.240]   That's not uncommon.
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:48.880]   And also it's I'm really looking forward to the briefing I get on the camera features
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:52.880]   of this phone because there's so much they can do by having two image sensors on this
[00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:53.880]   device.
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:59.800]   For one thing, when you have a tighter telephoto lens, it's much, much harder to get a smaller
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:00.800]   aperture.
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:07.160]   So even if you are shooting with that telephoto lens, it can still collect image data from
[00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:13.840]   the wide angle super low light lens and use that to correct imperfections in the lens
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:15.080]   you're actually using.
[00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:20.320]   So you're actually taking the picture certainly from the telephoto lens, but it's all the
[00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:22.800]   image processors saying, oh, there's a lot of detail.
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:24.640]   There's no detail in this black area.
[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:28.040]   Well, according to the wide angle version of this, there's actually a bit of a shadow
[00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:29.040]   here.
[00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:30.040]   And that's actually noise.
[00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:31.960]   It's not detail so we can smooth it over.
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:35.520]   There's a million things they can do by combining data from two different image sensors and
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:36.680]   two different lenses.
[00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:43.280]   They will have a smooth gradient of zoom between the 28 millimeter and the 56 millimeter.
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:44.680]   But that's optical.
[00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:48.040]   You will also be able to switch from one to the other just with a touch of a button.
[00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:53.400]   By the way, telephoto is not really the right name for that because it's a 28 millimeter
[00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:55.680]   is the standard iPhone lens.
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:59.800]   That's fairly common wide angle for most camera phones.
[00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:03.280]   The quote telephoto lens really is more of a normal lens.
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:05.560]   It's a 56 millimeters.
[00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:09.200]   So I mean, it's telephoto for a camera phone, but it's not.
[00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:12.200]   They don't think you're going to be going to sporting events and getting a picture of
[00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:13.200]   the quarterbacks.
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:14.200]   I'm not a photo guy at all.
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:20.040]   So can someone tell me whether or not this is going to be better for macro photography?
[00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:22.280]   I don't see how it necessarily would.
[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:23.480]   Yeah, it's unrelated.
[00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:28.080]   I think you'd probably want to get one of those all eclipse or some form of macro lens
[00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:29.080]   temperature.
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:31.080]   Now I don't have to buy the 7 Plus.
[00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:34.440]   Do you have an all eclipse to use an all eclipse on your iPhone now?
[00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:35.440]   I don't.
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:36.960]   It's more just that I really like taking closeups.
[00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:37.960]   I love stuff.
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:41.040]   And you're able to do that with your existing iPhone pretty well?
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:43.040]   Well enough.
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:46.320]   I do want to get an all eclipse or something like that.
[00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:51.720]   But that's sort of actually I've been putting off that purchase because if the new camera
[00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:55.760]   was going to do fabulous macro photography, then that wasn't going to buy a separate
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:59.200]   separate clip plus who knows whether the yellow clip will fit.
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:00.360]   Yeah, I think that's an optic.
[00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:03.680]   I think it's an optical issue, not something you can fix in software.
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:07.440]   So I think they really need different optics to make that possible.
[00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:13.320]   They do claim optical zooms to X because that's just you're flipping from wide angle to telephoto.
[00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:19.360]   Digital zoom up to 10 X when you are on the and that's on the dual lens camera, the iPhone
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:20.360]   7 Plus.
[00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:22.960]   The 7 of course just has one lens.
[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:25.640]   OIS though in both models, that's a big improvement.
[00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:28.640]   The iPhone's success did not have optical image stabilization.
[00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:29.640]   Yes.
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:30.640]   Yes.
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:36.560]   They're going to have now if two LEDs for flash were good, four LEDs has got to be twice
[00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:38.480]   as good.
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:40.960]   But they did do something which I thought was very interesting.
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:48.240]   He said that they will be able to monitor flickering in the modern low power lamps like
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:51.720]   fluorescence and LEDs have a refresh rate.
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:56.280]   They actually imperceptibly flicker and that can interact with a camera.
[00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:59.160]   And so a sensitivity that's interesting.
[00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:01.600]   I've not noticed it makes a difference.
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:06.880]   I mean, I haven't been very unhappy with previous iPhone which didn't have that flicker
[00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:09.080]   detection but we'll see if that makes a difference.
[00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:14.360]   Auto HDR noise reduction exposure control body and face detection burst below the timer.
[00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:22.040]   It's also going to be significant that they've, in iOS 10, now developers have access to
[00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:27.320]   camera raw images so you can store an actual Adobe standard DNG file.
[00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:33.000]   So as much as improved as the color gamut supposedly is, it also means that you'll get
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:38.560]   access to actual like uncompressed original unmodified data from the sensor.
[00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:41.960]   And so something that's been compressed a little bit which is always gives you that
[00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:47.240]   little extra yard, extra bit of yardage that will let you find you that push to get over
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:48.240]   the edge.
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:49.240]   Yeah.
[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:50.480]   I mean, it is pretty significant.
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:56.200]   It also really does appeal to people who are actual real series photographers.
[00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:59.640]   And that's anything that will get them to buy that new phone or sign up for a yearly
[00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:02.920]   subscription is good stuff in their pocket.
[00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:05.600]   So the other thing they talked about that was really interesting in the keynote which
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:13.400]   is not available out of the box or on day one is this new depth effect that will be
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:16.800]   another option along with Penorama and Square and all of that.
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:18.600]   No, it's portraits, what they're going to call it.
[00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:19.600]   Right.
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:20.600]   They specifically called it portrait.
[00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:21.600]   Yes.
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:26.560]   And the interesting that they called it explicitly called it this is a sneak peek of a bonus
[00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:29.600]   thing that we challenged our engineers to create.
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:30.600]   Extra credit.
[00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:34.840]   Which was sort of indicated that we really, really hope this would be ready to demonstrate
[00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:36.960]   but it is totally not rated into it.
[00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:37.960]   It isn't app.
[00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:38.960]   Yeah, it's not right.
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:39.960]   We won't get this right away.
[00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:42.480]   They didn't even get they didn't even provide like a lot.
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:46.720]   We managed to cobble together a functioning something so that we can show it to you in
[00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:47.720]   purpose.
[00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:51.920]   No, they will be able to show us some photos of the camera actually doing this.
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:54.840]   So the idea being that if you put this in X and that's the name of the mode.
[00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:56.560]   The mode is portrait.
[00:54:56.560 --> 00:55:01.200]   You can have a picture in which the foreground is sharp and the background is blurred out
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:03.160]   in a synthetic manner.
[00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:08.240]   It's getting doing that by getting data from those two different lenses.
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:13.280]   So because they're separated on a horizontal plane slightly, you can calculate certain
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:15.320]   depth information.
[00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:20.320]   And it's also calculate it's calculating a depth map of sorts.
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:25.720]   So that useful enough that once the image process or also tells the camera app that
[00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:30.080]   oh by the way, this shape here appears to be a face and a human.
[00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:31.640]   And so the rest must be the background.
[00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:35.160]   It's enough that they can make an educated guess as what's the foreground, what's the
[00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:38.760]   background, how much they should blur to make this effect convincing.
[00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:44.120]   And the demo photos that they showed were actual photos they said taken with this effect.
[00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:46.400]   And it does look quite quite convincing.
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:51.120]   Even though it does certainly seem to fall short of what a lot of people are sort of
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:58.320]   dreaming about, which is to base to guess to manually choose the depth of field of what
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:00.000]   you're actually aiming at.
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:04.880]   The fill made a couple of, I think fill made a couple of technical errors in his statements.
[00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:08.480]   One of them is that say, well, even SL, and it will, as you're taking the picture, it
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:11.320]   will show you a preview of what the background blur will look like.
[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:12.640]   And even an SLR can't do that.
[00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:13.640]   Well, yes, it can.
[00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:18.880]   It has actually a special button called DOF preview so that you can see specifically so
[00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:21.440]   you can see how much you're blurring the background.
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:24.320]   But so that's, I mean, because sometimes you use that for effect, you want to be able
[00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:28.640]   to take a picture of somebody in Kenmore Square in Boston.
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:32.080]   You want people to know that that big sign in the background is the Sitgo sign.
[00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:37.280]   You don't want to be so blurred out that it's just sort of a white and red sort of square-ish
[00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:38.280]   thing.
[00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:43.000]   So that's, but even that alone, it's very much the way that Apple would, I think, put
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:48.280]   in that feature, which is to not add another slider that lets you make a manual adjustment.
[00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:52.840]   But we are going to decide for you what you would want to see with this sort of a feature
[00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:56.120]   and let you get at it by just tapping one button.
[00:56:56.120 --> 00:56:59.560]   The other thing that I'll be curious about is that because they're calling it portrait,
[00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:05.200]   certainly they only showed it working with people is if you will be able to use it for
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:07.120]   depth of field effects on anything else.
[00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:08.120]   Right.
[00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:12.160]   If it's exactly just using that body detection, for instance, to be able to determine who's
[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:13.160]   there.
[00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:16.920]   Well, that's one of the fascinating things about the whole camera demo.
[00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:19.960]   It's sort of like they, when they mentioned that they have that haptic feedback inside
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:21.520]   the home button.
[00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:24.920]   They're showing off specific features that make this more useful like, hey, good.
[00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:28.280]   Hey, look, now you've got like a really good zoom between one X and two X and you don't
[00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:31.160]   have to do the fakery really until you get beyond two X.
[00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:34.360]   Hey, look, we got this really great thing for taking pictures of people that will look
[00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:35.600]   really, really cool.
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:40.440]   But the thing is once you have hardware that has two lenses in it, that means that every
[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:45.200]   possible trick you can do that requires two separate lenses of two separate focal lengths
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:48.000]   and two separate image sensors is now possible.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:54.880]   So they can really add core camera optical features just by pushing out a system update.
[00:57:54.880 --> 00:58:00.000]   So now it's not just if you're looking for the camera taking better pictures, you're
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:05.040]   not just waiting for a new new piece of hardware coming out in September that you have to buy.
[00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:09.400]   It means that you'll be paying close attention during WWDC because it's very, very likely
[00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:14.760]   that the sort of the image quality you're taking with your existing iPhone 7 Plus will
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:17.880]   be improved once you're running iOS 11.
[00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:22.000]   By the way, it might have been a little disingenuous of Phil to imply that it was extra credit
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.200]   work for the engineers.
[00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:25.200]   Yeah.
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:29.120]   As Rogue Voice is pointing out to us in the chatroom, April of last year, Apple bought
[00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:36.600]   an Israeli company called Lynx, a camera module maker promising DSLR like mobile performance,
[00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:43.760]   doing exactly the kind of thing that they, so maybe instead of extra, extra credit, it
[00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:45.920]   was more like we bought a company.
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:46.920]   Yeah.
[00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:50.640]   I remember their technology wasn't just about having like blurred backgrounds.
[00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:54.880]   It's also using all this data to figure out where is their noise in this picture and how
[00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:55.880]   do we eliminate it.
[00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:58.240]   So you can do it to make things sharper.
[00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:01.160]   You can do it to increase the color gamut of the image.
[00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:04.520]   Like I said, it's really exciting to think about what Apple could do with this with iOS
[00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:07.440]   11, let alone a new piece of hardware.
[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:08.440]   Let's take a break.
[00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:09.440]   We'll come back.
[00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:12.520]   We'll talk more about the cameras and I have some sample images, but we'll also want to
[00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:17.080]   talk a little bit about headphone jack or the lack thereof and how those AirPods might
[00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:19.520]   really work.
[00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:22.520]   I have to point out we had bingo cards for the keynote.
[00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:28.240]   Thanks to Megan Moroni and both Megan and I achieved bingo about halfway through the
[00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:29.240]   event.
[00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:35.240]   That was a lot of fun, but no Angela errands, no blue iPhone.
[00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:38.560]   We did get Johnny I but I was a little surprised to hear from Sir Johnny.
[00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:43.640]   He wasn't invisible in the video though.
[00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:46.280]   The video had no white remo's all in black.
[00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:51.240]   And as we know, Johnny's contract prohibits him from appearing on black screens.
[00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:54.680]   We'll have more in just a moment, but first a word from texture.
[00:59:54.680 --> 01:00:01.160]   If you like magazines and who doesn't, I think some really interesting articles come
[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:07.000]   out in magazines like Wired and the New Yorker and Vanity Fair and Rolling Stone.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.880]   Every month there's at least one or two I want to read, not to mention those great photo
[01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:17.280]   essays in the National Geographic recipes from those wonderful cooking magazines like Real
[01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.280]   Simple.
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:19.440]   I mean, I could go on and on.
[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:23.560]   I love magazines, but you're just, you're not going to subscribe to 20 different magazines.
[01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:28.080]   Think of the clutter and going out in the newsstand and buying an issue just for one
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:33.240]   article like that cover story article on Rolling Stone this month on James Corden.
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:37.600]   That's just prohibitively expensive, but texture is such a great solution.
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:45.480]   Texture is like Netflix, but for magazines you get up to 200 of the best magazines, including
[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:52.080]   consumer reports and people and us and entertainment weekly and National Geographic on your iPad,
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:57.440]   on your iPhone, on your tablet so that you can read them anywhere.
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:02.320]   And you get every page, every page that's on the newsstand issue plus back issues plus
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:03.320]   bonus content.
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:05.080]   You can't get anywhere else like video.
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:06.080]   That's not in print.
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:11.800]   And of course, the editorial staff at the texture put together some really good things like
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:16.760]   the new and noteworthy and the top story section so you can quickly find stories you'll be interested
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:18.200]   in.
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:21.840]   And you get all the content from the world's most in demand publications right in your
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:23.880]   iPad, including National Geographic.
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:26.200]   Here's another nice feature that I really like.
[01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:30.640]   Besides reading Boy's Life in Billboard, two magazines, I probably wouldn't buy, but
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:33.960]   you know, I like to read them for old times sake.
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:34.960]   It's fun.
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:35.960]   There used to be a DJ.
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:38.880]   I like to know what's on the Hot 100.
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:47.160]   You'll also, if you subscribe to Texture right now, be able to run it on five different devices.
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:49.120]   That makes it easy to share with your family.
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:54.160]   So one subscription and, you know, for instance, we're going on vacation soon.
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:56.800]   I want magazines to read on the plane.
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:01.760]   You know, as I'm traveling around the world, I would love to do this.
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:04.640]   So fortunately, Lisa has a subscription to Texture.
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:07.760]   So I'll be sharing her texture on my iPad.
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:08.760]   Texture.com/twit.
[01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:09.760]   Sign up today.
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:14.280]   You'll get a free trial, immediate access to all the best magazines, including back issues
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:15.920]   and bonus video content.
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:19.600]   And it's free for a limited time at texture.com/twit.
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:23.240]   Give it a try today.
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:24.440]   I can only say I just love it.
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:26.160]   I mean, I just really love it.
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:30.640]   And boy, when you're about to get on an airplane, not having to go to the airport bookstore
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:34.440]   by a stack of magazines, you're just going to leave on the plane.
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:35.440]   It's nice.
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:38.240]   We're having fun today talking about Apple's big announcements.
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:41.320]   You know, it's a drought as we lead up to these announcements.
[01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:45.640]   And then there's just a waterfall, a cascade of information that we're trying to absorb.
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:49.640]   Fortunately, we have two of the best in the business to help absorb it with us.
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:53.960]   Andy Inako from the Chicago Sun Times, our regular on Mac Break Weekly, and filling in
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:03:00.440]   for Renee Ritchie, who's busy getting his hands on the new Apple Watchbands in his place.
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:04.080]   We've got Adam Inks from tidbits.com.
[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:09.160]   And the best Apple newsletter of all time.
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:10.880]   And the oldest instance going on since the '60s.
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:11.880]   I like that quote tonight.
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:12.880]   Of all time.
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:13.880]   Yeah, all time best.
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:19.520]   It's great to have you both, especially to have a runner on Adam to talk a little bit
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:20.520]   about that watch.
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:25.760]   Because the thing that always gets me on the Apple Watch is it's just this kind of very
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:30.880]   diverse array of completely different features.
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:34.520]   And it feels like each of them is targeted at different slice.
[01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:38.560]   And they think if I could just do the one thing runners want, or I could just do the
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:42.560]   one thing game players want, or I could just do the one thing, and then you know, swimmers
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:47.720]   want, and then hope to kind of slice those markets up and succeed because of that.
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:53.160]   And while they're struggling a little bit, I do think the new Series 2 looks pretty compelling.
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:56.960]   Maybe not for runners, I don't know, but for normal people.
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:00.840]   So I don't want to derail this, but we just got news.
[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:06.080]   Apple has changed the Mac OS Sierra page to have a release date of September 20th.
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:08.160]   Wow, that's great news.
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:13.480]   So September 13th for iOS 10, that's when it becomes official, even an older iPhones
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:14.680]   and iPads.
[01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:19.240]   And September 20th, I'll be in Paris.
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:20.880]   I wonder what my bandwidth will be like.
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:23.560]   We can be able to update your Macintosh.
[01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:29.160]   You'll probably be faster if you just have somebody FedEx you.
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:31.760]   You're absolutely right.
[01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:34.440]   But you have, I don't know, I haven't been using the beta.
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:37.880]   I had a bad experience a couple of betas ago, and I thought, I'm just going to wait and
[01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:40.160]   be a good boy and just wait until they release.
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:41.880]   Adam, have you been playing with Sierra?
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:43.440]   I have.
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:48.520]   We do take control of upgrading to Sierra in progress as well as Sierra Crash Coursebook
[01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:53.520]   and done by Shally McFarland, X of Macworld.
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:55.000]   And so we've been pushing this stuff a lot.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:59.800]   And I haven't been running on my main machine, but on my laptop, it's been pretty interesting.
[01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:02.560]   Syria, obviously, the big interesting thing.
[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:08.480]   And man, optimized storage has us tied up in knots.
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:11.440]   The interface is from the moon.
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:17.920]   And it's a black box that just, there's all sorts of weird little gotchas here and there.
[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:19.800]   Are you talking about the new file system?
[01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:20.800]   APS?
[01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:26.560]   No, optimized storage is a big feature in Sierra where it tries to offload your content to
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:27.560]   my.
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:28.560]   Oh.
[01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:33.840]   And so all sorts of, yeah, there's all sorts of, I mean, it's not in some ways a terrible
[01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:34.840]   idea.
[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:38.400]   You know, you're like talking a small MacBook Air, but it's just thing after thing, all
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:41.800]   these questions, and we still actually don't have answers to a lot of them.
[01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:44.520]   Yeah, so like black boxes on my data.
[01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:45.720]   That's, I don't want that.
[01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:49.920]   This is, this is a cloudy big box in the sky somewhere.
[01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:55.300]   And, and yeah, your stuff goes up there and like we don't yet know whether or not what
[01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:59.680]   happens when something you're sinking your desktop and documents folder and optimized
[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:04.240]   storage kicks in and deletes old documents from your disk.
[01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:06.000]   What's the time machine connection there?
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   Right.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.000]   We just, we just don't know.
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000]   It's not like Apple has never lost data.
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.600]   I mean, I was, I was, I was going to say, I mean, there's certain Apple does a lot of
[01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:15.600]   things.
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:20.160]   Well, there's only one area in which I advise people to actively not trust Apple to do something
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:21.160]   correctly.
[01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:26.360]   And that involves management of your personal files, whether it's a music or there's iCloud
[01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:31.000]   or where there's anything count on at some point, something going missing and you're not
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.440]   knowing how to get it back.
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:38.800]   That's just, I still haven't enabled iCloud iCloud drive on any of my real Macs yet because
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:39.800]   I don't need it.
[01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:43.480]   It doesn't offer any unique features that are useful to me, but more than anything else,
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:46.960]   I'm absolutely certain there's going to be a time, either the first day or the first
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:51.360]   year where I'm looking for a file and then some Apple piece of code decided that I didn't
[01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:53.960]   want it or need it and I don't have it.
[01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:55.880]   And so, I mean, I just hit this.
[01:06:55.880 --> 01:07:01.040]   So the, one of the big features is document and sorry, desktop and documents folder sinking,
[01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:02.040]   which is kind of cool.
[01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:05.160]   So, you know, you turn this on and it moves your desktop and document folders to the,
[01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:08.880]   to iCloud so that they can be synced among all your different computers and access some
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:13.400]   of your iPhones and everything sounds neat, but it really does move them.
[01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:16.640]   So for instance, I wanted to put something in my documents folder and I went to my home
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:18.640]   folder and it was gone.
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:19.640]   That's scary.
[01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:20.640]   I hold documents folder.
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:25.280]   I mean, I almost had a heart attack, but it, I mean, it couldn't Apple have hard linked
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:26.840]   it into this iCloud connection.
[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:30.920]   So it was just in two places at once or something like that, you know, it was, it was very
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:31.920]   true.
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:36.600]   And then if you turn it off, you get these series of really wacky dialogues that make you feel
[01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:38.360]   like you're going to lose data.
[01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:44.600]   I mean, it's, it's, it's, I'm not real happy about it as a, as a user experience at this
[01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:45.600]   point in time.
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:49.040]   And we still have some betas to go possibly, you know, who knows what's going to happen,
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:50.960]   but I'm just saying that's the thing.
[01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:55.200]   If you're installing Sierra and you're asked to turn this stuff on during the installer,
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:56.600]   don't.
[01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:58.240]   They got two weeks to fix everything.
[01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:00.960]   So I'm sure we're worried for nothing.
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:04.160]   For extra credit, it's going to not delete any data.
[01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:09.360]   I am actually really excited about APFS, the new Apple file system, which, but that's
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:10.760]   not up till January.
[01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:11.760]   Right.
[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:13.320]   That's, that's, that's deep waters.
[01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:15.800]   They're not doing it until 2017 and maybe not even January.
[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:16.800]   Yeah.
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:21.960]   And that'll be scary, but, but, but once perfected, that brings modern file system technology,
[01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:28.280]   a la ZFS, to a file system that's more than two decades old.
[01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:29.840]   It's a much needed update from Apple.
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:30.840]   I look forward to that.
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:32.720]   And that's all about data integrity.
[01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:35.120]   That's about the exact opposite of mystery data.
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:38.840]   You know, so yeah, this, we really are back in the guy.
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:39.840]   Mac OS nine days.
[01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:44.840]   Remember that every time it was the least, the, the, that Mac OS was the least reliable,
[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:50.080]   least stable OS in the world because it did not use any of the modern techniques for memory
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:51.080]   and app management.
[01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:56.000]   So it just kept, it kept having to patch and make do the old architecture that they've
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.440]   been using since the very first Macintosh.
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:02.280]   This is why a lot of the file stuff that we're dealing with right now is such a bear
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:06.520]   because we're still using an operating system that was conceived and implemented before
[01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:11.800]   the modern way of managing files and having many hands on a file at the same time doing
[01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:16.320]   this sort of intense edits and having multiple parts of files and having multiple backups,
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:17.760]   multiple security levels.
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:21.920]   Once that's part, once that's hardwired into the operating system, and it really is as
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:26.840]   simple as an application pushing a button saying, I would like this file to do that
[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:35.360]   as opposed to, okay, we have to be able to drive up a mountain on on a bicycle wheel.
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:37.480]   We can't change, we're stuck with bicycle wheels.
[01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:41.920]   So we got to figure out a way to make a bicycle wheel work as an as a driving up a mountain
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:44.720]   at 60 miles an hour thing.
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:45.720]   Okay.
[01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:51.560]   Anyway, well, yeah, look forward by the way, Adam, you can turn that feature of Sierra
[01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:52.560]   off that.
[01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:53.560]   Yes.
[01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:55.320]   Yeah, you don't, you don't have to enable it at all.
[01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:59.160]   And that's why I would say if you're, if you're prompted during an install, that's the main
[01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:03.440]   thing to, because you know, you're busy installing, you don't know, it doesn't tell you that
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:04.440]   much.
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:07.760]   Just saying, no, you can always get to it later.
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:10.320]   And, and they are also doing this.
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:12.040]   I mean, they're bundling a bunch of stuff in.
[01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:17.360]   So optimized storage also involves like offloading the originals of photos.
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:21.520]   If you have a main Mac that's got all your originals and you've got a secondary Macbook
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:26.040]   error that not much storage space, you can just get the non opt, you can get optimized
[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:28.160]   photo storage, which is what you get now.
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:34.600]   So that's being built into that whole bundle or iTunes movies and TV show episodes that
[01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:35.600]   you've already seen.
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:38.760]   It can take off your disk because you've already watched them.
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:44.840]   You know, so that's not a, those, some of those things are much less concerning than messing
[01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:49.080]   with your actual dot, you know, documents and data.
[01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:55.080]   You know, I was going to show some more images and stuff, but we only have a limited amount
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:56.080]   of time.
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:59.560]   Let's move on to the headphone jack because I think that that's, that's the thing we knew
[01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:01.400]   was going to happen.
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:04.880]   Phil Schiller surprised me.
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:08.040]   At the very beginning of the event, and I've been saying this for a couple of days, I said
[01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:13.320]   the most interesting thing will be to hear how Apple spins this, how Apple explains why
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:15.400]   they are removing the headphone jack.
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:24.480]   A well known, widely used, open as a non proprietary connector in favor of a connector that is
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:29.200]   owned by Apple must be licensed for anybody else to use.
[01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:33.280]   I mean, the cynic in me would say, well, there's one word, profit.
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:36.200]   The word Phil Schiller chose was courage.
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:37.200]   Yeah.
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:44.200]   I've already received how many times have I received yet the picture of Burtlar in the
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:48.320]   in the garage with that courage and then with Phil Schiller's face on it.
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:49.640]   Right now it's up to five.
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:50.640]   Wow.
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:52.000]   Didn't take much time.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.000]   What do you think?
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.040]   Is that a reasonable rationale?
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:58.040]   Why, what, what courage is involved?
[01:11:58.040 --> 01:11:59.040]   None.
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:01.600]   Courage to take a lot of abuse from the.
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:02.760]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:04.280]   Or even to lose sales.
[01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:07.400]   Do you, could it costs Apple sales?
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:12.440]   It'll only cost Apple sales from people who were already thinking really hard about
[01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:17.240]   switching to Android anyway or people who didn't have that much of a connection to the iPhone
[01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:18.240]   to begin with.
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:23.720]   I think that they have hard numbers to demonstrate internal that reminds them that people are,
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:27.280]   if there's a reason why someone is going to not buy the iPhone 7, it's not going to be
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:29.600]   because they deleted the headphone port.
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:33.680]   It's something that just like the crummy keyboards on a lot of the Mac books, it's something
[01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:37.520]   that people will sigh and get used to because they're not going to hate it as much as they're
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:41.520]   going to hate switching to an entirely new operating system and entirely new piece of
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:44.080]   the hardware and rebying a whole bunch of apps.
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:47.640]   So that was, I mean, they had two good reasons after that.
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:49.640]   So that was just, that was the.
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:52.000]   Well, but that was the headline.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.160]   That was the, that was, that was number one, right?
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:55.160]   And that was.
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:56.160]   Yeah.
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:58.520]   So the thing that I think is that it may actually, I don't think it would really prompt people
[01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:02.840]   to not buy the iPhone 7 exactly.
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:07.320]   It may prompt people to delay the purchase because they have to think about it.
[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:10.800]   Sort of like, oh, well, but how am I going to do this and how am I going to do that?
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:12.880]   I just have to, I just have to think about all this stuff.
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:17.760]   So, you know, people may be putting it off longer and longer, possibly even for another
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:22.760]   generation as they work through what their issues are going to be.
[01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:28.400]   Apple does, does going to, is Apple will, I shouldn't have had that spice smoka.
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:30.320]   That's clear, clear now.
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:36.240]   Apple did say they will include a $9 dongle in the box that will convert lightning to analog.
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:38.520]   And that's, that's good because it's only $9.
[01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:42.480]   I mean, Apple often charges, overcharges for these dongle.
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:43.680]   Yeah, including in the box.
[01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:44.680]   I mean, it's free.
[01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:45.680]   Yeah.
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:46.680]   Everyone will get on.
[01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:48.680]   And they'll include a pair of lightning headphones.
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:49.680]   Right.
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:50.680]   They couldn't, they couldn't change that.
[01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:51.680]   They have to do that.
[01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:55.080]   And also, and also the pricing of them, if you want to, if you once you lose them or
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:58.760]   put them through the wash, it's going to be 29 bucks for a placement.
[01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:02.400]   I think that's about the same as what the regular wired ones cost were not, if it's
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:04.040]   more, it's not that much more.
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:11.760]   Well, yeah, but the one thing that that does hurt though is the people who lose them constantly,
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:15.440]   break them constantly and actually like, you know, in essence cheap headphones.
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:18.840]   You know, you can get a pair of decent headphones for six bucks on Amazon if you're the sort
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:20.760]   of person who goes through them.
[01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:21.760]   And that's not-
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:24.240]   And by the way, those six buck ones aren't much worse than $30 ones.
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:25.240]   I mean, right.
[01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:26.240]   Right.
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:27.240]   I just-
[01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:32.920]   But the issue is going to be that even if that company, the $6 company wants to sell
[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:36.440]   lightning based headphones, it's going to cost them five bucks, just a license.
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:38.720]   I don't know what the fee is, but something like five bucks.
[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:39.720]   Well, second more than that, is it?
[01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:41.720]   They're going to need to do the Made for iPhone program.
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:42.720]   Yeah.
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:43.720]   And that's expensive.
[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:44.720]   And that's expensive and complicated.
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:47.960]   And you have to have, you know, pliers who were approved.
[01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:54.120]   I was talking to a manufacturer of wireless sensor tags, you know, like HomeKit type stuff.
[01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:57.280]   And I said, is this going to be HomeKit compatible?
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:00.120]   And they said no, because it's just too expensive.
[01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:03.400]   HomeKit also requires MFI certification.
[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:04.880]   And it's just too expensive for us.
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:07.040]   We don't have enough reason to do it.
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:08.040]   Yeah.
[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:09.040]   Yeah.
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:12.680]   And also remember, it's just a lack of the ability to choose the headphones that you
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:13.680]   really, really want.
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:14.680]   If you're-
[01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:19.240]   There's a punishment for not buying and into the Apple standard, and that is having to
[01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:22.720]   keep track of this $9 dongle, which is going to happen.
[01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:23.720]   You're going to be-
[01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:29.680]   Unless you get to get a bit of suguru and just glue it to the end of your lightning
[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:31.840]   based headphones, you are going to lose this.
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:35.920]   You're going to be in a place where you cannot plug in to the device that you-
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:38.560]   If you're using old headphones, you're going to be in a situation where you cannot use
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:41.440]   the headphones you want to use, or you're going to have to find an Apple store and show
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:46.600]   up $9, and just like me with the couple with the VGA adapters on my iPad.
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:51.120]   I now have three of them because of times where I was in a city and thought I had it,
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:54.800]   but I didn't, so I'd have to find an Apple store and show up $30 for another one of them.
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:55.800]   I mean, they did-
[01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:58.960]   I don't feel as though the world is going to come to an end.
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:15:59.960]   I just feel-
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:00.960]   I feel this is a neutral thing.
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:05.000]   The only time that I feel like I have to clear my throat and interrupt is when people
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:09.880]   say this is a brave and wonderful and important thing that Apple is doing because they're
[01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:10.880]   also saying-
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:11.880]   Yeah.
[01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:14.520]   The reason number two is that he mentioned-
[01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:19.120]   Phil Schiller said, and this, it just made me queasy.
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:23.320]   Not merely that it comes down to courage, but the courage to move on to do something
[01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:25.760]   that betters all of us.
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:27.760]   Really, really, Phil.
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:30.800]   How does that better anybody except Apple's bottom line?
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:31.800]   Come on.
[01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:32.800]   Okay.
[01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:35.520]   And you want to courage bundle the AirPods with every iPhone.
[01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:36.520]   That would be courage.
[01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:38.760]   That would be courageous and foolhardy at the same time.
[01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:40.760]   That's my name.
[01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:45.560]   But our- this is the other thing that concerns me.
[01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:52.240]   It strikes me that lightning cables are more fragile, that they do tend to break more than
[01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:53.240]   other cables.
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:54.240]   Is that the case?
[01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:59.200]   That's the lightning cable that I have plugged into my iPad and it's yellow and I count on-
[01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:02.360]   here's the end of it that's starting to crack already.
[01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:04.760]   They're not really good at that.
[01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:09.080]   And their difficulty is that I can't take the amount of money that I might spend on a
[01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:13.840]   pair of lightning headphones and apply that to a purchase someplace.
[01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:19.080]   I won't want to invest in $200 in a really, really nice pair of headphones that I can
[01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:24.240]   only really use with this one set of devices.
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:30.000]   Same thing with the AirPods, which is $170 for a really nice pair of Bluetooth headphones,
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.800]   particularly one that doesn't have connecting wires between them.
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:38.200]   Okay, I can see that, but no, you will not be able to use- excuse me.
[01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:42.920]   Information that I have right now, which is- realize that I've been spending the last
[01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:48.200]   two hours talking into a micro-camera as opposed to calling engineers that I know.
[01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:51.600]   The understanding that I have right now is that- I'm sorry, I need a backtrack there.
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:58.720]   The actual data sheet on it says that it requires a device that can run a 2016 version
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:01.640]   of iOS or Mac OS.
[01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:06.440]   So the watch, the Apple TV, your iPhone, if it runs iOS 10 for instance, it'll run
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:07.440]   it.
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:09.960]   So it doesn't mean that I can take $160 and apply to one.
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:12.040]   I'm upgrading my audio experience everywhere.
[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:13.040]   I spent-
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:17.920]   But are you, if you're still using Bluetooth, what's the upgrade?
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:20.040]   There are audio supposedly, but if you want-
[01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:21.640]   Well, this one remains to be seen.
[01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:22.640]   We have to try them.
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:24.760]   Again, remains to be seen.
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:31.960]   And also, if you want better audio, you have to now convince these people, okay, but here
[01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:36.240]   are- here are a pair of $180 headphones that I don't even necessarily need earbuds that
[01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:37.880]   are wireless that work for fitness.
[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:39.920]   I just want great audio.
[01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:44.040]   Now if you're going to sell me a pair of $200 headphones that are wired that have really
[01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:47.880]   good drivers and a lot of air around them, are you willing to tell me that the-
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:51.520]   these wireless headphones you're selling me, that only works with Apple, are going to
[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:55.960]   be better than these wired headphones that I can use with my desktop computer, with my
[01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:58.600]   Windows machine, with my home stereo.
[01:18:58.600 --> 01:18:59.600]   It's-
[01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:04.520]   Is there an issue with the new wired headphones of charging and listening at the same time?
[01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:06.920]   Do people charge their phone and listen at the same time?
[01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:08.200]   Obviously, you can't do it.
[01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:09.200]   Right, yeah.
[01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:10.200]   No.
[01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:11.200]   Do they-
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:12.760]   Do people do that?
[01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:15.480]   I guess at night, maybe if you're charging your phone, you've gone to bed.
[01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:21.280]   Because if you're- if they say that you're running your audio through speakers and your
[01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:25.080]   bedside, so you would want to be charging your iPhone at the same time.
[01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:28.920]   I mean, I did think that the AirPods having a little charging case were clever.
[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:29.920]   That was-
[01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:31.400]   Yeah, they didn't invent that.
[01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:32.400]   My Moto Hints.
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:35.440]   Moto-rola Hints do the same thing.
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:40.600]   Any headphone that, you know, earbud that just has the battery in the earbud has so
[01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:42.400]   little space for a battery that you just-
[01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:43.840]   It's not all that they're listening.
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:48.160]   So the solution is to have a larger case that has a battery on all day battery.
[01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:51.240]   And when you're done listening, you put them in there 15 minutes later, you can use them
[01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:52.240]   again.
[01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:53.520]   Kind of like the Apple Pencil.
[01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:55.960]   And so that- that- but that isn't anything Apple invented.
[01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:56.960]   That's-
[01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:57.960]   Right.
[01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:00.160]   Frankly, a necessity on anything with a tiny battery.
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:01.160]   So that's another issue.
[01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:06.400]   If you want to charge and listen, and I guess that that's a use case for some people that
[01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:07.400]   is gone.
[01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:08.400]   So that's-
[01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:10.400]   Someone's going to make a break- another breakout dongle that has-
[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:11.400]   Yeah.
[01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:13.800]   That will have a lightning connector and an earphone connector, I think.
[01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:17.240]   And you buy this and don't worry, you will solve every problem you'll ever have with
[01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:18.240]   it.
[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:19.240]   But again-
[01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:20.240]   Actually, you know what?
[01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:21.240]   I do that.
[01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:22.240]   I do that on an airplane.
[01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:25.360]   I will plug in if I have- if I'm lucky enough to have a USB port, I will charge my phone
[01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:29.000]   because I'm going to listen the whole flight on a long overseas flight.
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:32.520]   And I will listen on the headphones, and that way I have something to listen to something
[01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:34.680]   you use for a phone when I arrive.
[01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:36.680]   That's gone.
[01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:41.240]   Wireless looks like the way to go, but again, we'll just have to see with these earpods,
[01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:45.120]   only because Bluetooth is such a poor experience for most people.
[01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:48.800]   As I've been- as I've said many times over the course of this year, as this rumor of
[01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:53.760]   now fact has gotten better traction, they have not said a single thing in their three
[01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:58.600]   reasons that meant that they could not put in a keep a headphone jack if they wanted
[01:20:58.600 --> 01:20:59.600]   one.
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:02.760]   So really, I wish- you talk about real courage.
[01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:07.440]   Real courage is saying we simply don't want to keep making iPhones with headphone jacks.
[01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:11.640]   And we know that this is going to annoy a lot of people who are very, very sensible,
[01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:16.980]   and we hope we don't lose them as customers, but we want to go our own way with this.
[01:21:16.980 --> 01:21:20.800]   As opposed to saying there is things that we can't do with a wired headphone jack.
[01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:25.440]   And we've been- well, that same stupid saw about- they whipped out this photo of like
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:26.440]   telephone operators in the 1920s.
[01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:28.880]   We've been using the same connector for-
[01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:33.720]   That really pissed me off because those were- those aren't headphone jacks.
[01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:35.560]   That's a patch bay.
[01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:39.040]   And so the implication that we've been using headphone jacks since the turn of the century
[01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:41.360]   to for operators is bogus.
[01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:42.360]   That's in fact-
[01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:43.360]   I thought that was iCloud.
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:45.760]   Isn't that what iCloud looks like behind on?
[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:51.960]   I mean, you know, that still continues to impress me with his- well, he's a marketer.
[01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:57.320]   His willingness to kind of bend facts to suit the Apple stories is very, very annoying.
[01:21:57.320 --> 01:22:03.520]   Well, I just think that there's a reason why it's been- by putting- having a wired connector
[01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:08.680]   has been going on for centuries now, including- why isn't he railing against like the HDMI
[01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:09.680]   cable?
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:10.680]   Why isn't that wireless?
[01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:11.680]   Well, because-
[01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:12.680]   Does it work?
[01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:16.840]   Electrons are- if you drop an electron down this end of this copper tube, it will shoot
[01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:18.080]   out the other end of that tube.
[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:21.620]   And you don't have to configure it, you don't have to put a chip in it, it costs about
[01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:23.680]   as much as a length of copper wire.
[01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:26.160]   And so anybody can make it as an open standard.
[01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:31.160]   So that's why- there's a bunch of bogus arguments in favor of dropping the headphone
[01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:32.160]   jack.
[01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:33.160]   That's one of the bogus-
[01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:36.760]   So the legitimate argument would be, and Phil did make this argument, that it's to save
[01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:38.440]   space inside the case.
[01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:43.080]   Space though that I imagine they immediately gave up by putting a second speaker on the
[01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:44.080]   iPhone.
[01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:45.080]   Now, that's nice.
[01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:47.480]   Now we have stereo sound, left-right sounds.
[01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:52.920]   And the cutaway image they had of the- of the iPhone had a big block for the haptic engine
[01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:53.920]   that they're using to power the-
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:55.400]   Well, that's right.
[01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:57.120]   You need a new haptic engine from the home button.
[01:22:57.120 --> 01:22:58.120]   Everything's- everything's-
[01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:02.800]   It's about the size of a stick-a-dentine gum, or trident-strigless gum.
[01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:03.800]   So maybe that's it.
[01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:08.080]   But- but again, these are not- these are problems that every phone manufacturer has,
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:10.640]   and almost every phone manufacturer has solved.
[01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:15.320]   So it's just- again, I wish they had the- it's completely legitimate for Apple to say that
[01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:19.360]   we are the people who get to design the iPhone, and we don't want to have a headphone jack
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:20.360]   anymore.
[01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:21.800]   And we have- we're not doing this capriciously.
[01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:25.960]   We feel as though we're giving all of our users, and I mean, you know, users plenty of
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:30.600]   options to- and we're accommodating them, but this is- we're making this decision first
[01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:33.320]   and foremost because we want to do this.
[01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:36.840]   That's real courage.
[01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:39.160]   There also will be better battery life.
[01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:43.240]   Not because- I don't know if that's because of the expanded battery room for battery.
[01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:44.240]   I think not.
[01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:48.800]   I think it's mostly because of the new A10 Fusion chip that goes into a low power mode
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:50.760]   much of the time.
[01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:57.080]   But Schiller claims an extra hour of battery life on the iPhone- extra two hours of battery
[01:23:57.080 --> 01:24:00.160]   life on the iPhone 7 over the iPhone 6s, right?
[01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:05.440]   The extra hour on the iPhone 7 plus.
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:09.280]   Already iPhone easily a category leading battery life.
[01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:11.040]   So this is very welcome.
[01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:13.400]   And two hours is not small.
[01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:16.360]   That is the difference between, oh my god, where's an outlet?
[01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:20.760]   And okay, there's no question I will make it home or I will make it to my hotel.
[01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:21.760]   That's a big deal.
[01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:25.520]   I think there are a lot of people who are not on the fence, but were already like two
[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:27.000]   miles away from the fence.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:30.680]   People be closer to the fence or over the fence when they realize that they don't have to
[01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:35.080]   take a battery pack with them when they go everywhere.
[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:36.080]   Yeah.
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:39.160]   Still no wireless charging, which would have been nice.
[01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:42.200]   Had they added wireless charging, then it wouldn't be as much of a concern.
[01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:47.160]   Well, that's not as important on iPhones concerning that they do have such great battery life.
[01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:48.160]   It's nice.
[01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:49.160]   It's nice convenience.
[01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:50.160]   I can't imagine them.
[01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:51.160]   It's not the other world.
[01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:52.160]   I agree.
[01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:56.440]   If this pissed off about a headphone jack, I can't imagine how much you'd have to shoot,
[01:24:56.440 --> 01:24:59.880]   how much Thor is in you have to shoot them up with to get them to actually make room for
[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:01.520]   wireless charging.
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:07.360]   Support for touch to pay in Japan using a Japanese standard Finka standard.
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:10.160]   That's good news for people in Japan.
[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:16.320]   And it's notable because the first time Apple has let anybody else have access to the NFC
[01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:22.560]   chip, they're actually being accused of anti-competitive behavior in Australia.
[01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:27.560]   I'm sorry, for not opening the NFC chip to other vendors.
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:31.280]   That means you'll be able to pay, by the way, with that new standard for the Japanese
[01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:32.280]   metro, the underground.
[01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:33.280]   Yeah.
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:36.880]   And they made a big deal about how they have Apple Maps in Japan.
[01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:37.880]   Yeah.
[01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:40.920]   And being able to integrate all this sort of stuff.
[01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:48.120]   Also available, as I said, for order on Friday, available to pick up a week from Friday.
[01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:51.000]   And the prices will not change.
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:57.040]   I'm impressed by that Apple's able to deliver both these new phones at a similar price point,
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:25:58.040]   identical price point.
[01:25:58.040 --> 01:25:59.040]   The storage changes.
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:00.040]   And the storage is doubled.
[01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:02.560]   So the start is no more 16 gig phones.
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:07.120]   Even the iPhone SE will no longer have a 16 gig unit available.
[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:08.120]   Everything starts at 32.
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:09.120]   You know what?
[01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:11.160]   I bet Apple's is happy about that as customers.
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:16.440]   It must have been difficult to try to do updates in that constrained 16 gig space.
[01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:20.480]   I have to admit, the 16 gig, I'm not sorry to see go at all.
[01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:21.480]   Really?
[01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:23.520]   I kind of, no, I was, oh, I'm not sorry to see that.
[01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:24.520]   I should go.
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:25.520]   It was terrible.
[01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:26.520]   Goodbye.
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:30.000]   But I will say that I thought 32 and 64 were both good sizes.
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.000]   Yes.
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:36.000]   That to go from 32 all the way to 128, you know, I was like, yeah, I don't really need
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.160]   128.
[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:39.000]   But I mean, but 32 could be pushing it.
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.040]   It depends what you store on there.
[01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:43.640]   I mean, yeah, it just feels like it's a big jump.
[01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:48.400]   It seems like we store less these days because we use so much music in the cloud streaming
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:49.400]   music and so forth.
[01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:53.040]   When you're on an airplane, the ability to put your entire music collection on your phone
[01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:54.040]   is, it's okay.
[01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:57.800]   And a bunch of, I keep about 30 audio books on my phone.
[01:26:57.800 --> 01:26:58.800]   Yeah.
[01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:03.680]   It kind of makes me want to come back to revisit like Phil Schiller from Keynote's three or
[01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:08.760]   four years ago and say, how's that people want to keep all of their data in the cloud
[01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:10.480]   and local storage is an important thing?
[01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:12.360]   How's that working out?
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:16.880]   256 gig, although you'll have to get the jet black edition.
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:18.360]   Which will get scratched by the way.
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:23.920]   The whole example has apparently a footnote about how micro abrasions may happen.
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:28.560]   So remember they did early on a shiny black iPhone that was plastic.
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:29.560]   And was it?
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:31.720]   No, it was an iPod, wasn't it?
[01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:34.360]   It was plastic and scratched like a mother.
[01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:37.720]   But this is an anodized aluminum.
[01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:39.680]   So is it the paint that's going to scratch?
[01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:42.600]   Yeah, it's that I, daily dot had something.
[01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:43.600]   That's pathetic.
[01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:46.720]   That means you're going to take that beautiful phone and put it in the case just like, oh
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:52.640]   yeah, don't get the, well, I guess it's just matter.
[01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:57.480]   Apple is saying the, here we go, the, the Apple store page says the high gloss finish
[01:27:57.480 --> 01:28:01.480]   of the jet black iPhone seven is achieved through a precision nine step, anodization
[01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:03.000]   and polishing process.
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.640]   It surfaces equally as hard as other anodized apple products.
[01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:10.240]   However, it's high shine may show fine micro abrasions with use.
[01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:12.120]   It's like micro aggressions.
[01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:15.360]   If you were concerned about this, we suggest you use one of the many cases available to
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:16.360]   protect your iPhone.
[01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:17.360]   Wow.
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:18.360]   Yeah.
[01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:19.360]   Wow.
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:20.960]   Well, you know, they say that because otherwise they get sued.
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:21.960]   Yeah.
[01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:22.960]   Yeah.
[01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:23.960]   Who knows what that is.
[01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:24.960]   I mean, it is.
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:31.200]   You know, I mean, there's a level to which these things get used, you know, stuff in
[01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:33.360]   the real world could never stay pristine.
[01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:34.360]   Right.
[01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:40.960]   I, I just think if you have such a beautiful case, it's a shame to, you know, I'm beautiful,
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:42.600]   you know, outside a shame to put it in a case.
[01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:46.320]   Well, actually I'll be curious about they didn't, I mean, we didn't say about how
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:50.480]   like the jet black and the matte black will feel.
[01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:54.320]   But you know, I have a case on my, on my iPhone six because it's too slippery.
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:55.320]   Yeah.
[01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:56.320]   It's hard to hold.
[01:28:56.320 --> 01:29:01.120]   And so it has nothing to do with the performance of the case or I don't drop it anything like
[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:02.120]   that.
[01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:05.160]   I just worry about slipping out of my hands, which I'd never had trouble with previous
[01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:06.160]   iPhones before.
[01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:07.160]   Right.
[01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:10.260]   So I do think that I'll be curious if the matte black and jet black have a different
[01:29:10.260 --> 01:29:11.260]   tactile feel.
[01:29:11.260 --> 01:29:13.280]   I assume the others will have the same.
[01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:14.280]   I can see.
[01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:15.280]   Yeah.
[01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:18.400]   People who Twitter feeds from people who are in the room.
[01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:21.880]   And one of them is Lee saying that it's a lack grippier than he thought it was going
[01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:22.880]   to be.
[01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:25.560]   I don't know if that means that he got 30 people in front of them.
[01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:30.280]   And now it's just all sticky from sweat.
[01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:33.880]   It's all the ear wax.
[01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:34.880]   Let's all right.
[01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:35.880]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:37.960]   Get our picks to the day so we can wrap this up.
[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:42.640]   But if you just some last thoughts, anything I've left out, I mean, there was such for
[01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:44.640]   two hours, they get a lot in there.
[01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:49.600]   Anything else to plus a two to access from from Shia.
[01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:53.000]   By the way, and I didn't appreciate this at the time, the first song she did with the
[01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.920]   bodies lying on the ground and the tears.
[01:29:55.920 --> 01:30:01.600]   I found out later that's a song she did about the Orlando shootings at the Pulse Disc
[01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:02.600]   Attack.
[01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:08.240]   And that's why the bodies and the tears that was a memorial for the people who died in that
[01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:11.600]   horrible, horrific shooting in Florida.
[01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:13.240]   So that explains.
[01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:17.560]   And kind of not the most uplifting song to end the event with, but I love her as an artist.
[01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:20.120]   And also, I was glad to see her there.
[01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:21.120]   Yeah.
[01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:23.320]   It's she's not that not the most accessible.
[01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:27.200]   And that's so therefore one of the people that Apple, I think, would tap for for performance
[01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:28.200]   like this.
[01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:29.200]   Yeah.
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:31.760]   You're never going to see Justin Bieber or someone like him, I think.
[01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:32.840]   Well, they had John Mayer.
[01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:33.840]   That's pretty accessible.
[01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:36.200]   Well, that was a that was a long time ago.
[01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:39.200]   Hey, but I have a long memory here.
[01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:40.960]   Anything else to talk about?
[01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:43.560]   I don't want to miss any of the fun that.
[01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:48.280]   They had a bunch of stuff on education and the Connected program.
[01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:49.280]   Yeah.
[01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:53.200]   It's the only thing I have to say is it sounds great.
[01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:59.200]   You know, they're talking about 114 schools and 50,000 students and those numbers sound
[01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:00.200]   good.
[01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:02.800]   But when you actually look at the number of schools and students out there, it's such
[01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:03.800]   a drop in the bucket.
[01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:06.000]   It's more like a pilot program, isn't it?
[01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:07.000]   Yeah.
[01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:12.680]   I don't want to ever say anything negative about improving educational opportunities
[01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:13.800]   and things like that.
[01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:18.880]   But when I, my son's a senior in high school, so I've been dealing with this for a while.
[01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:23.480]   And when I see what the schools are going through, so much of it is just based on money.
[01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:28.600]   And so our school went, went Chromebooks and just hugely cheaper.
[01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:29.600]   Yeah.
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:31.400]   I think that means it's better, right?
[01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:36.560]   When I write my stuff tonight, I can't avoid the phrase that it'd be nice if schools could
[01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:39.720]   have Apple devices in them without having to get them for free from Apple.
[01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:43.280]   It'd be nice if they could actually afford the Apple-made stuff that schools could afford
[01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:44.280]   to buy.
[01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:48.800]   Again, good stuff for the 50,000 kids who get to use this, the free stuff.
[01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:54.520]   But when I talk to educators, I know it's either Chromebooks or Raspberry Pi or combination
[01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:55.520]   of both.
[01:31:55.520 --> 01:32:03.920]   And with Raspberry Pi, I know plenty of teachers that are like, "Look, if I can buy 30 Pi zeros
[01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:09.720]   for $150 and basically I'm teaching, one of these kids how to do something and here's
[01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:12.640]   your own device to play with, I'll even do that."
[01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:13.640]   It's amazing.
[01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:14.880]   These things do.
[01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:18.520]   Gentlemen, prepare your picks of the week.
[01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:20.280]   We will be talking about those.
[01:32:20.280 --> 01:32:25.000]   In fact, I have the ultimate iPhone case coming up for you.
[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:29.360]   I mean, this is one you won't mind putting your piano black iPhone in.
[01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:36.080]   But first, a word from Squarespace, the place to make your next website.
[01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:38.960]   We've had Squarespace as a sponsor for a decade now.
[01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:44.360]   Been thrilled to really help Squarespace become the power that it is.
[01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:51.360]   It is the place if you want to make a blog or an online store or a portfolio as a photographer
[01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:52.440]   or an artist.
[01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:56.520]   But even just for the simple cover page, that's how I began my Squarespace journey with my
[01:32:56.520 --> 01:32:58.360]   latest site, LeoLlePort.com.
[01:32:58.360 --> 01:33:03.840]   I created a cover page because I just wanted a place to go where I could put links to my
[01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:06.200]   social network and so forth.
[01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:07.200]   And a little slideshow.
[01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:08.200]   This is just a simple cover page.
[01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:09.720]   It took me no time at all.
[01:33:09.720 --> 01:33:13.160]   And by the time I did that, I went, "Oh, I should try some other templates.
[01:33:13.160 --> 01:33:17.560]   Maybe create a blog, a photo portfolio, event calendar."
[01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:20.360]   And by the time I was done, I had a full-fledged website.
[01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:21.360]   Couldn't have been easier.
[01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:23.080]   Mobile responsive, you bet.
[01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:24.080]   This site looks great.
[01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:27.800]   In fact, I can even demonstrate it at any size.
[01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:29.600]   That's one of the great things about Squarespace.
[01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:35.280]   You can actually squeeze it down to smartphone size and it still looks fantastic.
[01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:37.080]   e-commerce comes with every template.
[01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:42.840]   The best designers plus the best engineers make it a fabulous place to make your site.
[01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:47.800]   They also have domain name sales now, which means it's the best place to get a domain
[01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:52.840]   name because you immediately get a parking page that's not got ads and junk on it.
[01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:57.720]   It's beautiful parking page as you begin to develop that site.
[01:33:57.720 --> 01:33:59.240]   That's at the new Squarespace domains.
[01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:03.640]   They've always offered a free domain name with a year registration.
[01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:06.080]   Incredible 24/7 support.
[01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:07.080]   New templates all the time.
[01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:13.000]   In fact, they've just introduced their kind of their magazine style templates with grid
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:17.120]   style landing pages and infant scroll related posts.
[01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:23.160]   All the things that make these well-known web publications look so great and it's yours.
[01:34:23.160 --> 01:34:27.040]   So you don't have to have all that fancy engineering and design team behind you.
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:29.200]   You've got it already with Squarespace.
[01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:33.960]   Squarespace is the best hosting, the best software to make the best websites regardless
[01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:38.240]   of what you want to do, either with just a few clicks of the mouse or if you're a designer
[01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:40.920]   and you want to get into the guts of it, you can do that.
[01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:45.280]   You can also go to third-party Squarespace designers, developers and experts that are
[01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:46.440]   very affordable.
[01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:50.520]   That's what Lisa did for her site, Artisanal Agency and Man, she got a great looking site
[01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:52.560]   for very low cost.
[01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:56.560]   It's just a fabulous place to create your next website.
[01:34:56.560 --> 01:35:01.200]   By the way, if you've made three or more active Squarespace websites, welcome to the Squarespace
[01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:02.200]   Circle.
[01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:03.200]   This is new membership.
[01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:07.040]   It includes advanced guides, optimized support, six month trial periods for new projects and
[01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:08.040]   a lot more.
[01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:09.440]   Try it free.
[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:13.200]   You can do what Alex Lindsey does, create a website for somebody.
[01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:16.000]   He said anytime I go to a restaurant, they don't have a webpage.
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.520]   Like what business doesn't have a webpage these days.
[01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:22.320]   He'll actually create a free Squarespace site for them.
[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:26.280]   While he's eating dinner and then just say as he's leaving here, here's a site.
[01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:28.120]   Why don't you use this?
[01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:29.120]   That's cool.
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:31.280]   Squarespace.com, don't forget the offer code MACBRAKE.
[01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:35.240]   You don't need it for the free trial, but you will want it if you decide to buy 10%
[01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:42.720]   off as a way of saying thank you and showing your support for MacBrakeWeeklySquarespace.com.
[01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:47.000]   Don't forget the offer code is MACBRAKE.
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:51.760]   Adam Anks, I don't mean to spring this on you, but you got something you'd like to pick
[01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:54.800]   of a software or hardware or anything you want to show us?
[01:35:54.800 --> 01:36:03.200]   The thing that I was a little hesitant about this because it's not quite there, but it's
[01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:04.600]   close.
[01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:09.760]   This is a browser extension called Greenhouse.
[01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:15.640]   The idea behind Greenhouse is that there's versions for Chrome and Firefox and Safari
[01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:17.040]   and all that.
[01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:21.560]   What it does is it scans the text of every webpage that you view.
[01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:29.040]   If it finds the name of an elected representative or candidate for say president, it highlights
[01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:35.040]   it and you can mount it over and it will show you where this person gets their money.
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:36.520]   Oh, that's awesome.
[01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:43.160]   Now, the reason why I was hesitant, this was done a couple of years ago by I think of the
[01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:46.120]   guy with time, the guy was a high school sophomore.
[01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:47.120]   Good kidding.
[01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:48.680]   I'm not kidding.
[01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:49.680]   High school sophomore.
[01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:52.760]   I think in Seattle.
[01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:56.280]   I learned about it after the last election cycle.
[01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:59.280]   I've been holding on to this for two years to write about tidbits because it's really
[01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:03.120]   only interesting during election cycles.
[01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:07.520]   I was comparing some of the data against where he gets the source and it wasn't matching,
[01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:09.920]   so I contacted him.
[01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:17.560]   He said that he doesn't have the current data for people other than Clinton and Trump and
[01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:18.560]   the San Andreas.
[01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:22.240]   He's getting it from opensecrets.org, so you can always go there and get more.
[01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:25.520]   So basically he's now a freshman at Stanford University.
[01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:26.520]   Wow.
[01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:30.360]   He just started and he's trying to get all this new data into it.
[01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:31.840]   That's basically that.
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:34.120]   Yeah, so I'm looking at the New York Times page.
[01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:35.560]   He's got Hillary Clinton.
[01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:40.360]   He's got Bernie Sanders, but he doesn't have Jill Stein, the green candidate.
[01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:42.680]   So that would be great to see.
[01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:44.640]   So it's one of those things.
[01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:48.600]   He promised me that he was getting the data up there.
[01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:49.600]   Hopi does.
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:53.560]   I think it was great to hear that this kid did this.
[01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:57.680]   And it's just it's so neat to be reading along in some article about what's going on
[01:37:57.680 --> 01:38:01.040]   in politics and you just hover over and you're like, "Well, it looks like someone's getting
[01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:02.560]   his money from oil and gas.
[01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:04.880]   That might be why he's voting this way."
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:05.880]   Yeah.
[01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:07.600]   So that's my pick of the week.
[01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:08.600]   Yeah.
[01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:09.760]   Very, very interesting.
[01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:10.760]   It's the greenhouse extension.
[01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:14.280]   I'm using it on Chrome, but I think they have versions for other.
[01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:16.680]   All are green.us is the URL.
[01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:18.840]   All are green.us.
[01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:20.840]   Very good pick of the week.
[01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:24.880]   I just wanted to show something that I just got in the mail and I'm really getting excited
[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:25.880]   about it.
[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:30.360]   In fact, so excited that I actually went out and bought some more of their products.
[01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:31.360]   It's not cheap.
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:35.480]   This is kind of a premium product called This Is Ground.
[01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:39.480]   They make leather cases.
[01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:41.440]   He says he's inspired by, "Remember the old?
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:45.320]   I used to have, for years, I had a Franklin planter in a zip."
[01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:46.320]   Remember this?
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:47.320]   In the zip?
[01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:48.320]   The day planner.
[01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:49.320]   The day planner.
[01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:52.480]   He's inspired by that, but these are instead, these are designed for tech.
[01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:54.160]   So for instance, this is the newest.
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:56.320]   This is the mod three that just came out.
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:38:57.520]   It's got, here I could show it over here.
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:02.800]   It's got a nice slot for my iPad Pro.
[01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:04.760]   You can, I'm going to use this on my travels.
[01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:07.280]   Of course, it's going to be fantastic.
[01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:09.880]   They have a variety of inserts that you can put in here.
[01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:13.360]   These are magnetic to suit your needs.
[01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:21.600]   So lots of straps and holders for things like wires, pens, pencils, everything you would
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:23.400]   want to put in here.
[01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:25.440]   It just, and then it zips up and it can hold a surprising.
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:26.440]   This is the new one.
[01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:28.200]   They just did the mod three.
[01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:29.440]   It's beautiful.
[01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:31.960]   Plus it smells so good.
[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:35.160]   Designed in California, but made in Italy.
[01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:38.160]   And of course, they're the master craftsmen of leather.
[01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:42.080]   In a variety of shapes and sizes.
[01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:45.920]   He sent me this and I thought, wow, that's really nice for review.
[01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:48.560]   And then I immediately went out and said, but I'm traveling.
[01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:49.560]   So let me see what else.
[01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:53.120]   And I ordered the backpack that does similar things.
[01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:58.040]   And the other thing I really like about this, you can order it with a Karma Go if you want
[01:39:58.040 --> 01:40:02.320]   built in Wi-Fi or a tile if you don't want to lose it.
[01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:04.160]   I think that's really pretty cool too.
[01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:05.920]   We're going to get them to use the tracker instead.
[01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:07.640]   But that's OK.
[01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:11.440]   Just really the tiles of another Bluetooth tracking device.
[01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:12.680]   Beautiful leathers.
[01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:15.520]   Little pricey, like the backpack's $800.
[01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:18.840]   This mod three tablet I think is two or $300.
[01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:21.680]   So they're not for the faint of heart or the--
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:25.680]   But you don't want the native Italians to mock your style sense.
[01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:26.680]   Exactly.
[01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:32.080]   I really just-- oh man, it just feels good to carry this around.
[01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:33.080]   They look pretty damn nice.
[01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:34.080]   Don't they look nice?
[01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:37.160]   You know I have a fetish for this stuff.
[01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:39.920]   And a good leather case costs a lot of money.
[01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:42.600]   But wears quite well and so forth.
[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:45.520]   I'm pretty impressed with what they've done for this.
[01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:50.600]   So just a little LA company you might want to keep your eye peeled for and save up your
[01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:52.560]   pennies for them when your ship comes in.
[01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:57.040]   This is ground.com.
[01:40:57.040 --> 01:40:58.040]   This is ground.
[01:40:58.040 --> 01:41:02.920]   Since Alex Lindsey isn't here, I do something that costs an Alex.
[01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:03.920]   It's the unit of money.
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:07.720]   Yeah, $700 is one, Alex.
[01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:12.120]   He's living in a different world entirely.
[01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:14.600]   Andy Enoco, your pick of the week.
[01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:20.360]   Mine is something very analog but a very non-Alexan price but very, very useful.
[01:41:20.360 --> 01:41:25.560]   It is-- and this is a generic thing, not a specific, but a little pocket compass.
[01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:26.560]   Ooh, I like it.
[01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:29.120]   I mean, it acts an actual pocket compass.
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:30.120]   Oh, oh.
[01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:32.680]   I'm suggesting that you buy-- this is made by Brinton.
[01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:38.440]   I'm suggesting you go out and you buy a little pocket-sized keychain compass made by a manufacturer
[01:41:38.440 --> 01:41:41.120]   that makes like $300, $400, $800 compass.
[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:42.840]   This is the bottom of their range.
[01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:43.840]   It looks nice.
[01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:48.200]   But that means it's not possible for Brinton to make even a cheap compass that is not a
[01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:49.200]   good compass.
[01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:50.280]   It's liquid filled.
[01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:52.840]   It doesn't jam up.
[01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:54.960]   It's definitely will point to magnetic north.
[01:41:54.960 --> 01:41:59.000]   And I'll give you two good reasons why this costs $6.
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000]   And so you buy this.
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:08.480]   You throw this into your laptop bag or your backpack or whatever you carry every day and
[01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:14.520]   forget that you have it until the day that you are at an airport and Google Maps, or
[01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:16.880]   Apple Maps is giving you walking directions.
[01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:18.880]   I was like, OK, you just want to go this way.
[01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:19.880]   And it's north.
[01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:23.160]   Yeah, but which way am I facing right now?
[01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:27.680]   The most of my walking I do when I travel is walking up north or south to figure out what
[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:30.520]   is the next cross street and which way am I accessing?
[01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:33.120]   Because Mr. Telephone, you're supposed to.
[01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:37.080]   I know that you think with this arrow that you're putting on the map that I'm facing
[01:42:37.080 --> 01:42:39.440]   a certain way, but you're almost always wrong.
[01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:43.720]   But then you'll remember, wait a minute, didn't I spend $6 for a real damn compass?
[01:42:43.720 --> 01:42:45.560]   But just three months ago, oh, yes, there it is.
[01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:48.440]   And yep, I'm facing east, which means I walk this way.
[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:52.160]   The perfect iPhone accessory, ladies and gentlemen, a physical compass.
[01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:54.080]   I do that all the time, though, Andy.
[01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:56.040]   It thinks that I'm pointing this way, but I'm not.
[01:42:56.040 --> 01:42:57.040]   Yeah, it never works.
[01:42:57.040 --> 01:42:58.520]   And so I finally got sick of it.
[01:42:58.520 --> 01:42:59.880]   And I've so I bought like three of these.
[01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:02.000]   I've got one in each bag and I third on the side.
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:07.200]   But the other reason why is you should never be 100% dependent on.
[01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:11.760]   I will be able to navigate my way out of here, provided that my battery has a charge and
[01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:13.400]   it can get a signal.
[01:43:13.400 --> 01:43:19.280]   And if you have this with you, it basically means that there is no way, no how long as
[01:43:19.280 --> 01:43:21.080]   you looked at a map beforehand.
[01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:22.320]   So okay, my phone is dead.
[01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:25.960]   I don't know exactly how to get home, but I remember to get back to my hotel.
[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:32.120]   But I remember looking at the map that West Chester is about is southeast of here of where
[01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:33.120]   I'm staying.
[01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:36.040]   So if I just keep going in this direction, I will eventually get there.
[01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:40.800]   I use it over the weekend, not that I needed it necessarily, but I was doing some I was
[01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:41.800]   at the state park.
[01:43:41.800 --> 01:43:43.080]   This beautiful, beautiful woods.
[01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:47.880]   I've never been in before and dense woods with like little trails that are kind of not
[01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:48.880]   really marked.
[01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:50.840]   But of course, people need them for decades.
[01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:52.320]   And fortunately, my phone was working.
[01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:55.360]   I had plenty of battery left and I had like a headlamp on, even though it was after it
[01:43:55.360 --> 01:44:00.360]   was after dark, but it was the belt and suspenders stuff where I had my phone up, but also had
[01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:01.640]   this looped around my finger.
[01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:05.920]   So I knew that, okay, I know this long as I keep going north a little bit east or north,
[01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:07.560]   that's where the main road is.
[01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:12.360]   I was never lost, but that meant that there was no way that I was going to get lost because
[01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:13.440]   I had this with me.
[01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:17.440]   So some years ago, Andy, I did some orienteering races.
[01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:20.680]   And for those who don't know, orienteering races are a lot of races where you're actually
[01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:23.160]   trying to hit points.
[01:44:23.160 --> 01:44:27.800]   I turned out, I mean, I figured, okay, I'm probably not very good at the map stuff, but
[01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:30.440]   I could maybe make up for it in the running bit.
[01:44:30.440 --> 01:44:33.920]   I ran so many miles that I didn't need to.
[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:38.760]   It turns out compass and map work is something that is a little harder than a lot of people
[01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:40.480]   think it is.
[01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:47.600]   And so it's definitely worth putting some thought into maps when you are not under stress if
[01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:50.120]   you're interested in using the compass for real.
[01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:51.120]   Yeah.
[01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:52.120]   And I just want to underscore.
[01:44:52.120 --> 01:44:56.000]   Again, it doesn't, this one made by Breton is working great for me.
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:59.800]   However, I'm saying, no, Matt, just don't go to Amazon and say, Oh, look, here's a,
[01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:02.200]   here's a no name compass, like a little pocket compass.
[01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:03.440]   That's it's 10 for $5.
[01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:04.760]   I'll buy one for everybody.
[01:45:04.760 --> 01:45:07.200]   I actually started off by buying a couple of those.
[01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:10.320]   And the thing is they jam up and they don't really work again.
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:13.520]   Just when you see a model that's a size and a price you like, that's fine.
[01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:15.920]   Just take the brand name, put into Google and so on.
[01:45:15.920 --> 01:45:20.440]   So it takes to a website that has, and now if you are in the active military, here is
[01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:24.760]   the one with 1,800 different attachments that will help you to navigate across a desert
[01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:25.760]   800 miles.
[01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:30.400]   Okay, I think these people know how to, they will not put their name on something that is
[01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:33.280]   that that is going to let you down, even if you're just trying to get out of a state
[01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:34.280]   park.
[01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:35.280]   Wow.
[01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:36.280]   Wow.
[01:45:36.280 --> 01:45:39.400]   I'm thinking I need one before I leave the country.
[01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:40.640]   I'm going to be in St. Petersburg.
[01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:42.480]   I don't know where the hell I'm going to be.
[01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:44.400]   Especially, especially internationally.
[01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:47.600]   I can remember a couple of times where I thought that, well, gee, I don't, I don't really
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:51.040]   need to buy, I'm only going to be, I'm only going to be in Barcelona for two days.
[01:45:51.040 --> 01:45:54.680]   I'm not going to buy the international data, but I'm meeting someone for dinner and there's
[01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:55.760]   a map here.
[01:45:55.760 --> 01:46:00.480]   And I just, and I just need to know where I am relative to where I used to be and what
[01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:02.000]   direction do I have to head in.
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:05.200]   And that's when I said, okay, I'm going to now just go out and find a Wi-Fi hotspot,
[01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:10.200]   go to my AT&T site and buy data because I can't deal with this.
[01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:13.920]   But if I had, if I had simply had a six dollar compass in my hand, I would have known, okay,
[01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:15.160]   I know that the hotel is here.
[01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:17.320]   I know the restaurant is West.
[01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:21.160]   If I keep going West, eventually I will find a landmark that will let me get it.
[01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:22.920]   Andy is such a nerd.
[01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:24.920]   It's an attitude skate.
[01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:26.160]   And a cheapskate.
[01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:28.200]   Seven dollars for Bronton.
[01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:29.200]   Six bucks.
[01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:31.560]   Well, okay, shipping, but yeah.
[01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:33.080]   Hey, great show.
[01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:38.360]   Thank you, gentlemen, for joining me on this most auspicious yearly annual holiday, the
[01:46:38.360 --> 01:46:41.160]   day the new iPhones come out.
[01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:42.920]   Andy and I go with the Chicago Sun times.
[01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:43.920]   You may now get to writing.
[01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:46.000]   I have a feeling you've got a little bit to file.
[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:51.040]   I got the only thing I can do before I start writing is I've got, I did take some pizza
[01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:52.160]   dough out of the freezer.
[01:46:52.160 --> 01:46:53.680]   It's now like in a cloth covered bowl.
[01:46:53.680 --> 01:46:58.320]   I get to please get the oven preheated so when I can take a break, I can have a hot
[01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:01.720]   bread and pizza that I'm not allowed to leave the house to get to the sun.
[01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:04.000]   I have a gun that sounds like fun.
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:05.680]   I'm coming right over.
[01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:10.960]   And also with us as always a thrill and a pleasure to have Adam angst my personal hero
[01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:18.800]   because he created tidbits and kept me knowledgeable back in the 90s kids in the 90s.
[01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:22.080]   And he's and he's and he's still he's still doing it.
[01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:23.600]   T I D B I T S dot com.
[01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:27.800]   Of course you can get it for free, but subscribe to help support Adam and his team do great
[01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:29.520]   stuff and look for the in control guides.
[01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:34.080]   There's always good information there that you can really use ebooks available on every
[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:40.320]   platform and just I have to say a shout out to Tonya and Josh centers and Michael Cole and
[01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:43.880]   and Julio Ojeda Zapata who have been writing while I've been here.
[01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:44.880]   Nice.
[01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:50.360]   So our coverage is going up as we speak and huge thanks to them for what I would normally
[01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:54.000]   be heads down in the keyboard doing as well.
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:55.680]   So I get to edit now.
[01:47:55.680 --> 01:48:00.640]   Very back to work back to the grindstone you and your penguin.
[01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:01.640]   Thank you everybody.
[01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:05.520]   We'll see you next time every normally every Tuesday we did it differently this week so
[01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:11.080]   we could cover the Apple event 11 a.m. Pacific on Tuesday 2 p.m. Eastern 1800 UTC for Mac
[01:48:11.080 --> 01:48:12.440]   break weekly.
[01:48:12.440 --> 01:48:15.320]   The team will reassemble next week.
[01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:17.600]   I still will be here not on vacation quite yet.
[01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:18.720]   I hope you will as well.
[01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:24.480]   If you can't be here live you can always get it on demand after the fact twit.tv/mbw or
[01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:27.600]   wherever you get your favorite podcasts.
[01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:28.800]   We're on every platform.
[01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:32.480]   Stitcher the twit apps are everywhere.
[01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:36.600]   Everywhere everywhere.
[01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:37.600]   See you next time.
[01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:40.800]   But now back back to work my friends because guess what?
[01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:42.040]   Break time is over.
[01:48:42.200 --> 01:48:42.560]   Bye bye.
