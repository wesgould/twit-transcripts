[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.560]   the latest news from Apple.
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.360]   Has Apple been up to anything of late?
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.320]   Anything going on and all?
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.960]   Joining us to talk about an Andy Inako from the Chicago
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.720]   Public Library.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.480]   No, the--
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.000]   Leaving the Uvey.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.440]   The Worcester Public Library.
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.440]   I don't know what library you're in.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.200]   I'm supporting my local public library.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.200]   It's local public library from the Carnegie Library
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.160]   in beautiful downtown Bangkok.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.200]   Nice to see you Andrew.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.480]   No hat today.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.720]   Because I got a haircut.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.400]   And so I'm not-- the reason why I usually wear the hat
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.160]   is because usually I get this really bad poofy thing happening
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.480]   like up top there.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.400]   And for weeks and weeks and weeks,
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.560]   I would try to fix it before the show,
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.080]   but before getting desperate and just grabbing a hat
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.760]   and putting it on.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.240]   But your fame is your trademark is your big old fedora
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.640]   that you always wear.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.440]   Do you know where that--
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.040]   Yeah, but--
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.760]   --that anymore?
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.680]   Oh, no, I do.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.280]   I just-- I realized that I didn't want it to become a thing
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.600]   where if I ever showed--
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.040]   I didn't want to become such an iconic thing
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.480]   that if I ever showed up without it,
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.560]   people would be saying, hey, why don't you wear on your hat?
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.440]   I've worn a hat like that.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.680]   I'm very, very glad that I've documented evidence
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.240]   by a friend of mine that even when I was like 17 or 18,
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.600]   I was wearing a hat just like that.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.480]   It's just like my favorite kind of hat.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.280]   And so there was a time like about 10 years ago
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.720]   where I realized that maybe I should take it off
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.760]   when I'm giving like talks and stuff like that
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.280]   because it's not-- it's impolite.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.680]   Are you-- is that a fedora?
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.840]   Is that actually a fedora?
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.440]   I don't know if I named it properly.
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.280]   It's not a fedora.
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.200]   It's technically like an Australian like ranchers hat
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.480]   or cowboy hat sort of thing.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.920]   Oh, I like that.
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.480]   But I love it because it's not terribly expensive.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.440]   It's like waterproof.
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.840]   It has this wire around the brim so that you can always
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.960]   adjust it the way you want.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.880]   And for someone who travels a lot,
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.400]   I can stuff it in the overhead bin
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.120]   and it gets crushed by bags.
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.000]   And then like while I'm waiting to de-play,
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.440]   I can just like spend just a couple of minutes
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.960]   just sort of fussing with it and it's right back
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.040]   to where it was before.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.160]   I have a box of them.
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.200]   It's like, whenever they stop making these,
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.680]   I want to have like a three year margin
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.440]   to find something I like as much as this one.
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.360]   I'm very pleased to see that Jim Dowernpple
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.400]   did wear his beard today.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.960]   Yes.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.040]   From the loop, loopinsight.com.
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.640]   Hi, Jim.
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.640]   How are you, Leo?
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.760]   I'm great.
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.880]   How's Rock n Roll been treating you?
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.240]   Rock n Roll is great.
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.680]   Always the best.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.920]   Also joining us.
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.640]   Hey, great to have the Mac Observer here,
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.480]   Dave Hamilton.
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.280]   Dave, good to see you.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.120]   Thanks for having me.
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.960]   It's good to see you too.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.200]   Yeah, it's good to be here.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.200]   Always a pleasure.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.040]   I love it.
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.960]   Andy is in New York City for a special meeting
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.040]   of all the I'more folk.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.920]   So he's missing out on today's show.
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:27.720]   I-
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.720]   As is Laurie.
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.920]   As is Laurie Gill, 'cause she said I'more as well.
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.120]   I have in my hot little hands an iPad
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.200]   that's about to be converted to iPadOS.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.680]   Today's the day Apple pushed up their 13 one release
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.160]   for both iPhone and iPad and today's the day.
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.280]   So I want to push the button now.
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.000]   And convert it.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.560]   If you're not yet using 13 one, use it.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.840]   Especially if you're on 13.0 with your new iPhone,
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:58.680]   you use it.
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.400]   You really want to make that upgrade.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:07.040]   Yeah, 13 has a bunch of bugs to the extent
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.720]   that if you had not upgraded it on the day of,
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.040]   I would have recommended that you wait a few days
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.360]   because they did push it up.
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.320]   They originally was scheduled for,
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.560]   was it end of month or even later than that?
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.800]   And then we suddenly found out that no
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.680]   is going to be here just after the weekend.
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.840]   By the way,
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.200]   just after the weekend was when your iPhone
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.560]   was supposed to arrive, Andy and I go.
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.240]   No, just before the weekend.
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.080]   (laughing)
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.920]   I had.
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:32.760]   Yeah.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.720]   So you shouldn't mess with UPS.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.560]   That's my new--
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.040]   No, let's let my UPS there's still,
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.080]   they're still lovely people.
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.280]   It's the FedEx people.
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.560]   But so I got my review hardware,
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.920]   but iPhone 11 and the Apple Watch 5.
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:48.760]   Nice.
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:49.600]   Actually, Apple PR was nice.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.520]   They gave me in Patriots and Red Sox colors,
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.040]   which was a nice thing of them.
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.600]   But so I just have some advice
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.640]   on the under the guise of me blowing off some steam here.
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:05.640]   So my radio spot was at like 12.15 or something
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.560]   in the afternoon, which is great.
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.400]   Okay, well, by 1030,
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.440]   that's going to be cutting it really, really close.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.840]   And so Apple paid extra to have it delivered by 830.
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.560]   So of course, by like 730,
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.840]   I was literally on a bench,
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.760]   like on the sidewalk outside my house,
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.440]   like waiting for the FedEx truck.
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.160]   Of course, and they didn't show up.
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.000]   And by like 905, it's like, okay,
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.080]   if I don't leave, I can either wait
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.320]   and then maybe catch a later train
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.480]   and hopefully still make my show
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.480]   or the sensible thing to do is to leave now
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.040]   905 and suffice to say that A, there was no,
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.400]   I'd not seen a FedEx person B when I left.
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.480]   There was no FedEx tag on the door.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.400]   And it turned out that the FedEx driver
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.760]   just didn't even try to deliver it.
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.440]   He said that they logged it as,
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.960]   oh, we tried to deliver at 8.22 a.m,
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.600]   but no one was there to sign for it, which was BS.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.720]   Okay.
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.400]   So, okay, so that's so much for Friday.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.440]   So I thought, well, okay, maybe it'll be Saturday.
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.960]   And so Apple PR was being really,
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.480]   I mean, I hate that they were doing all this extra work
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.320]   on my behalf because of FedEx,
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.320]   but so we'll tell you what,
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.520]   if they're having a problem like reaching my house,
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.120]   why don't we, so I don't have to wait
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.320]   in the house all day on Saturday,
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.480]   why don't we just have them delivered to the Walgreens
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.640]   that sort of nearby, even within walking distance,
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.240]   because they have one of those secure lockers
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.240]   where, you know, all the, and you sign for it.
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.320]   So great, so I get a notification saying,
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.920]   just you'll be there after 3 p.m.
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.840]   just go there and like, we bring a photo ID
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.520]   and boom, get there and it's not there at 4 o'clock.
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:46.080]   Now, the reason, so the reason for that one was that,
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.920]   I checked the tracking and it said,
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.360]   well, we tried to deliver,
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.200]   but he wasn't there to sign for it
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.920]   and the business was closed.
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.000]   And it turned, but that wasn't what happened.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   What had happened was that they're not,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.560]   the driver is not allowed to drop off a package
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.520]   in that locker if it has lithium batteries in it.
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.120]   This was something that they didn't tell Apple about this.
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.040]   They didn't tell me about this.
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:14.240]   So finally, I just said, look, just hold it at the depot.
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.840]   I will come and pick it up.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.440]   And so it worked, even though I thought,
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.120]   as I was opening the box, I was like,
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.520]   what are the chances that just to put a cherry
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.440]   on the top of this, they open up the box
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.200]   and they put in like a boxing glove
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.840]   on a giant like iron metal spring
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.240]   to just punch me in the head while I open it.
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.560]   So what I'm saying is that,
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.080]   if you are arranging for deliveries of tech stuff
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.600]   and particularly Apple stuff,
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.440]   don't count on 8.30 AM delivery.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.720]   I've since heard from a lot of people
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.000]   that this happens all the time,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.600]   I don't even necessarily want to blame the driver.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.600]   It could be that they're under some punishing quota
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.280]   that they can't possibly meet.
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.880]   So I don't want to necessarily blame the,
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.680]   you don't want to yell at the desk clerk
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.920]   for a problem that was caused by policy.
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.360]   But nonetheless, you will pay extra for 8.30 AM delivery,
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.120]   but don't count on it.
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.920]   Maybe it'll happen, but don't count on it.
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:10.320]   Also don't use those drop off pickup centers
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.600]   if it has a lithium battery in it,
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.080]   because again, maybe they won't let you do that.
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.320]   Really, the only sure way to make sure you will get it
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.680]   at a time that you can arrange is
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.600]   if they hold it at the depot for you.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.400]   Oh well.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:20.960]   Oh well.
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.880]   Or you could do what Jim Dowrymple did
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.800]   and go to the Apple campus and get hit.
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:25.200]   Jeez.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.920]   That was much easier.
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.680]   I didn't have to deal with any of that.
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.960]   I can't afford the $1,000, $1,200 shipping fee
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.560]   of flying out there and saying, "No, tell her."
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.400]   It's shipping you instead of the phone.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:38.800]   You're right.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.400]   That's a good, excellent point.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:44.720]   Dave, do you have the new iPhone yet or not?
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:45.840]   Of course.
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.560]   Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.000]   We've got several of them here.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.240]   So what do you think?
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.600]   Screen's nice.
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.400]   The cameras are fantastic.
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.480]   I'm really blown away by how well those cameras do.
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.280]   Do you think they do?
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.360]   The wide angle is great.
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.480]   And when you move from camera to camera,
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.160]   you don't notice it.
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.800]   Like the software totally takes care of that for you.
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:11.120]   Yeah.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.800]   It's just so smooth.
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:13.360]   Yeah.
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.680]   And really, they've done a nice job with it.
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.160]   I mean, I know that was sort of the thing
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.000]   that they're pushing this year,
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.240]   but they delivered.
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:22.960]   I think so.
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.960]   And the screen, it's killer.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:29.360]   Displaymate gave it an A+ saying it's the best screen
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.760]   we've ever seen, although they did say they did admit.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.320]   So they'll probably be better screens eventually,
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.640]   so we're going to have to change our rating system now.
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.800]   But for now...
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.240]   There's better screens someday.
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.200]   Yeah, for now.
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.880]   This screen is top of the line.
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.320]   Very bright.
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.400]   They liked HDR.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.600]   They liked night shift.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:53.920]   They also liked the super dim setting down to two knits,
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.160]   which is about...
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.600]   That is really...
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.720]   Two knits is dark.
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.320]   Very dark.
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.280]   True tone they liked.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:02.720]   The diamond sub pixels.
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.560]   That's kind of unusual.
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.840]   It's used on...
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.280]   We've gone a long way from...
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.560]   Remember when OLED displays just have pentile pixels?
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:11.600]   It was awful.
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.760]   We've gone a long way from that.
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.360]   They said the viewing angle is not perfect.
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.760]   There's a little color shift, but still very good.
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.000]   Power efficiency is good.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:22.960]   We know that...
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:26.880]   Power display efficiencies increased 15%.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.600]   We know that because the battery life is mind-boggling.
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.120]   It's been a lot of things combined.
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:35.360]   They say the primary goal of this display technology
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.200]   shoot out series has always been to publicize
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.720]   and promote display excellence.
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:42.640]   Well, we got an excellent one.
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.400]   A plus.
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.840]   And this is on the Pro Max, obviously, not the 11.
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:52.480]   I just think it's great that we're at the level of sophistication now,
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.680]   where it used to be that if you wanted to demonstrate
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:57.760]   that one panel was better than the other,
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.920]   you would put them side by side and compare.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.000]   Now you really have to go to the spectograms.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.280]   You really have to go to the graphs
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.600]   to really see what each one of these panels is doing.
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.840]   I think it's wonderful for consumers that it's...
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:12.000]   You have to get really deep into the budget level of phones
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.920]   before you get a display that is anything less than really, really good.
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.640]   What I also think is interesting is that a lot of times,
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:23.280]   certainly with Samsung, they don't value color accuracy,
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:23.840]   particularly.
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.560]   In fact, they go for more love of a punchy OLED.
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:30.080]   Apple, according to the display mate,
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.480]   calibrates each phone individually at the factory.
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:36.800]   And it supports not only a full gamut at RGB,
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.520]   yes, RGB, but it's also full gamut at P3,
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:46.240]   which is kind of amazing for a smartphone to be perfectly accurate,
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.920]   is mind-boggling.
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.440]   Well, look what they're doing with it, though.
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:52.400]   I mean, not only the pictures,
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:57.360]   but you also have the 4K60 video and...
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.360]   Oh, the video's amazing, yeah.
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:03.760]   Yeah, they're just doing everything that they possibly can to make this
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:09.680]   generation of smartphones out of reach for the competitors.
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:12.720]   And I, with the cameras in particular,
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.440]   I certainly think that they've done that.
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.640]   Well, remember, we haven't seen the Pixel 4 yet.
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.320]   That's coming out October 15th.
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.960]   So Google, they compare it to almost a year old Google phone.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:30.720]   So we'll see what the Pixel 4 which is historically the pixels have done very, very well.
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:35.040]   Surely that's going to be very private and secure for each user.
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.280]   Oh, come on.
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:42.400]   Come on, you don't buy into that old canard that somehow the iPhone is magically secure.
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.000]   Not more.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.840]   Come on, Leo.
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:49.520]   Fine, but don't embarrass yourself on your own show.
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:50.320]   Come on.
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.400]   All right.
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.880]   I won't mention any zero days or anything.
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.880]   Talk about anything.
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:03.280]   I mean, there's a difference between zero day stuff and the way your account is handled, right?
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:09.120]   I mean, certainly every operating system is going to suffer from some zero day exploits.
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:13.920]   That's very different from we take your data and sell it out the back door,
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.880]   which one company does and another does not.
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.960]   So I'm Facebook for crying out loud.
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.280]   Google does have policies in place.
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.040]   They do.
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:23.600]   They do.
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.160]   They don't.
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:24.640]   They don't.
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:26.720]   They don't just take your data and sell it out the back door.
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.240]   That's absolutely not correct.
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.640]   That's kind of unfair, but that's fair.
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:31.120]   They do.
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:35.680]   They do know they do absolutely monetize it and they're and you should be aware of that
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:39.840]   and you should be concerned about that depending on where your comfort level is.
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:44.400]   But on the balance, they have a smart assistant that is actually smart and actually assists you
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.200]   in the
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.960]   like, let me look up a speech version of let me Google that for you.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.080]   They just openly sell it out the front door.
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:55.520]   It's the front door.
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:55.920]   That's right.
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.200]   Thank you for that.
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:57.680]   That's right.
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.920]   It's also not really fair to say they're selling your data.
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:04.880]   They they are selling advertising and an aggregate selling your data.
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.480]   Google, you know, you can't go to Google and say, I'd like to know where Leo LePorte lives.
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.720]   Yes, I can.
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:11.440]   It's very easy.
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.760]   If you just go to Google and I say, where does Leo LePorte live?
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:14.800]   It might actually.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:15.520]   It's not but it's not.
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:16.320]   Okay, but it's not.
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.240]   That's not Google telling you.
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.200]   Google is not telling you.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.640]   I don't know if it's a beta for that.
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.720]   And you can do that on the iPhone too.
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.840]   If it works on an Android device, it works on the iPhone as well.
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:26.800]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:32.880]   But I know I don't I think it's unfair to say that they're somehow like Facebook does,
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:36.320]   leaking your data just in general, but they do they do.
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:39.440]   Yes, we everybody acknowledges that that's the trade off.
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.120]   I'm not convinced that Apple is super private either.
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.880]   Their iCloud stuff isn't secure.
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.760]   As we've known, we've seen that over and over again.
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:53.120]   If you're a foreign government, they're glad to hand over that data or even a United States
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.200]   government, they're glad to head over that data.
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:59.200]   So I really I think it's absolutely really.
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:15:59.920]   I don't know.
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:00.880]   Well, maybe they're not glad.
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:01.440]   I'm sorry.
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.600]   I should say they they hand over with a frown.
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:07.920]   And a lot of resistance, but they don't show the actual.
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:13.600]   Eventually I hope Apple will make the iCloud trust no one encryption and then encrypted.
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:14.720]   It is not currently.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:19.200]   And no, it well, it can't be if you want to access it in your web browser, right?
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:24.080]   Like I message can be, but we don't get I message on the web because Apple doesn't
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:26.160]   have the keys to decrypt our I messages.
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.800]   So Apple has chosen convenience over privacy.
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.680]   That's that's trade offs companies make.
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:41.600]   And I don't I don't I think it's I think it's not fair to say, oh, Apple somehow magically secure
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.400]   and no one else is it Apple.
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:49.280]   I think probably does respect my privacy more because they're their business model is selling
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:49.680]   hardware.
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:51.760]   It's not binary magic.
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.480]   But they actually put work into it.
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:56.000]   And they do put a lot of work into it.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.480]   Although yeah, I think you could make a strong case as Google puts some work in a security as well.
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.040]   But it's it's not binary, right?
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:07.280]   It's a continuum between Uber secure and Uber convenient.
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:09.120]   Now we know we know it's not secure at all.
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:09.840]   That's a whole different.
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:10.640]   Well, there's that.
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:12.480]   That's true.
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:18.960]   But like we could choose to live in a house that has no doors, no windows and is just
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:24.000]   bricked from ground to ceiling, but that's not convenient at all, right?
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.240]   Getting in and out is sort of difficult when you do that.
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:26.720]   That's right.
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.400]   So I you know, it's a continuum.
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:35.440]   And I think Apple chooses a spot that's closer to secure than, you know, let's just prioritize
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.080]   convenience.
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:42.400]   That said, they do a pretty good job of making security convenient with things like face ID and,
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.080]   you know, all of that stuff.
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:49.200]   They they really work to make it so that I didn't used to put a passcode on my iPhone before
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.320]   time ID because there's a lot of credit for.
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:52.960]   Yeah.
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.400]   Because you weren't alone, Dave.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.960]   Most people did not put passcodes in their phone.
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:01.200]   It always surprised me when I'd see people just unlock their phone or swipe up.
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.880]   And it was like, I always did.
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:03.360]   Really?
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.640]   I always did.
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:05.200]   Yeah.
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:05.680]   Me too.
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:05.840]   Yeah.
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:06.320]   I did.
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:06.800]   I did.
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:12.160]   I you know, for me, it was it's only a four digit passcode, but I always put one in.
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.040]   Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.360]   I thought you said you always just swiped up.
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.520]   You you do you use the passcode.
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:24.080]   But yeah, we know the vast majority of iPhone users did not until maybe touch ID.
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:28.960]   When I remember exactly when Apple started making that this now it's mandatory.
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:31.760]   You have to have a passcode and you have to have face ID built in.
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:32.800]   And I think that's appropriate.
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:34.480]   That's a that's.
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:41.760]   And I think you can give Apple a lot of credit for nudging its users into a more secure space.
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.440]   That's one of many ways they do that.
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.400]   So that's good.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:44.880]   Yeah.
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:45.040]   Yeah.
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:46.800]   No, they do too.
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:47.440]   Go ahead.
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:50.160]   I love one of the new features of iOS 13.
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:53.520]   And you'll see it on your new iPhone or as you upgrade.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:58.320]   Where it's telling me whenever an app is going out and getting my location and uploading it,
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:02.960]   it's telling me I saw yesterday on on I think it was on Reddit.
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.640]   Somebody said map that me Apple just told me has set my location
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:09.520]   23 times to its surfer.
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:13.040]   And I haven't opened the application once in the last 24 hours.
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:16.480]   And to get that information and then to have a setting that says, you know what?
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:20.880]   Only allow it to do this when the app is open or never allow that.
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:22.400]   That is absolutely.
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.280]   A big boon to consumers.
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.320]   Google's copied that.
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:27.040]   I should point out.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:29.120]   Well, Google is now doing that.
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.040]   Well, no, they had that.
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:31.680]   Well, they had that.
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.040]   Well, okay.
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:35.200]   I wouldn't say copied, but there.
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:38.880]   This is a priority that all companies are starting to face.
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:45.360]   Google, I think Google and Apple because they have a sense of responsibility to their users.
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:51.200]   Facebook because it's very expensive to have your CEO having to go to the Senate and having to
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.800]   go have meetings with the president.
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:56.960]   And if they want to make sure that they get to keep a hold of Instagram and WhatsApp,
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:04.240]   they're going to have to at least put some put some make a show of caring about what people do.
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.920]   We have with their with their data.
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:09.840]   But yeah, this is something that every single consumer is becoming more hip about.
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:13.680]   Fortunately, now we have the Congress getting more hip about it as well.
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:14.640]   We have 50.
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:20.400]   We have 48 state senators and along with DC, excuse me, state district attorneys,
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:25.120]   including plus DC and Puerto Rico getting together, just saying we are going to form
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:31.760]   of coalition to investigate how well Apple and Facebook and Google and everybody handle data
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:37.520]   with how well they compete because in 10 years time, we're not going to see the same regulatory
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:41.600]   field that we have right now, which is a barren landscape where anybody can do anything.
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.800]   And there are no repercussions.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:49.040]   By the way, speaking of copying and by the Apple copies Google and in their camera app,
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.000]   there's this night mode.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.920]   That's absolutely a copy of Google's night site.
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:54.560]   But I think cross copying is fine.
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:58.560]   I don't think that's that that smurches either one for Google to copy Apple or Apple to copy
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:05.760]   Google, although Google in the in the face of Apple launching arcade just launched arcade
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:10.240]   for and they even gave it a tab on the on the app store.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.680]   This is the Google Play.
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:14.240]   What is it called?
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:17.040]   Andy, I can't remember what they call it, but it's a it's a it's a
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.040]   feature.
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:24.240]   Yeah, but for for for surprisingly, interestingly, chosen $4.99 a month,
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:29.040]   you get free access to a bunch of not just games, but a bunch of apps as well on your
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:29.040]   end.
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.400]   Yeah, it's Google Play.
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.760]   Also also add a sense.
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:31.760]   Yeah.
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:32.320]   Thank you.
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:33.360]   I was looking forward.
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.520]   Let's be clear about night mode.
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:44.320]   Apple has been working on night mode and and you know, camera features like that for many years
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:52.000]   as as everybody everybody wants, you know, better low light condition shots.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:59.120]   So they didn't just copy night mode from people on it from Google and to Apple's credit.
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:01.200]   They did it right.
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.320]   They didn't rush into it.
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:05.840]   And the night mode is I think much better integrated into the operating system.
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:06.880]   It is a night mode.
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:10.240]   Initially, an Android was a nightmare because you'd be in night mode and all of a sudden,
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:12.080]   some app would launch with a bright white screen.
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:15.440]   You're like, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.200]   Here's a here's a great image from the Verge.
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:22.160]   Google Maps has used location 93 times in the background over the past three days.
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:24.000]   Do you want to allow this?
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:31.120]   Although interesting article, it says this is why so many apps are now asking for Bluetooth access.
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:36.560]   That's how they're tracking you without using maps.
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:39.440]   Duncan would like to use Bluetooth.
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:40.640]   Yeah.
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:41.280]   Why?
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:43.440]   Well, it turns out they've got a beacon in the store.
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:48.480]   And if Bluetooth is turned on, the store will know you're an addon.
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:52.800]   So that's just not necessarily a bad thing.
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:54.560]   No, it might give you a free.
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:55.360]   Don't know.
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.080]   Yeah.
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:56.400]   Yeah.
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:57.360]   It is good to know.
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.360]   It's a free don't give you a free donut.
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:22:59.920]   A free donut.
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:04.800]   I have to admit it puzzled me because I was my iPhone kept saying, you know, hey, this was
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.440]   as a why does Macy's want Bluetooth?
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:08.400]   What is it doing?
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.400]   There are so many reps are now asking me for Bluetooth.
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.120]   So that's why.
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:12.320]   Yeah.
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:14.160]   That's why we need regulation.
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.000]   If we have all of this is sort of negated.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:23.040]   If you have the ability, if everyone who collects data and retains data has the responsibility of,
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:27.360]   if I contact Duncan Donates and say, oh, by the way, any data you've collected off of this specific
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:33.040]   device, you're going to erase it within 30 days and they are required to do so or face a
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:39.440]   punishment of $10 per user per day, then we'll start to see actual control of your data.
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:45.120]   I think that most people, they're not necessarily concerned about their data being collected so
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:51.360]   much as one, it being collected without their information or consent and be not having any control
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.360]   over that data once it's collected.
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:24:00.160]   So if you address those two, then let me imagine how many people use browsers that don't have
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:04.320]   add tracker, blocker plugins built in, which is to me is insane.
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:10.240]   It's like leaving your bike just leaning against a city railing without no long on it.
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:15.360]   I would never, I would never use a browser without something that controls ad tracking,
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:20.160]   but people do that anyway, but people who do care, they need to have the ability to control that.
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:26.160]   I think it's, you know, I always wonder about this because I didn't care for a long time and
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:30.800]   I've started to care a little bit more recently and have done taking steps to kind of protect
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:37.280]   myself like using Firefox and so forth. But I wonder the vast majority of normal users,
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:42.880]   to the A, do they know and then B, do they care? What do you think, Jim? Do you think people know?
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:51.600]   So I think people look at these stories about this and say, wow, that's terrible. I didn't know
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:56.640]   that would happen. Wait a minute, I got to go check in on Facebook. Right. Yeah, exactly.
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:02.720]   So I think the average user views this as something that will never affect them
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:10.800]   because, well, I don't do much on Facebook and this is just something for me. Nobody cares about
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:19.920]   hacking me or nobody really sells ads to me. That's not what they see. Now, what I think ends up
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:30.160]   happening is that you get a group of people, privacy people or tech people, that are really
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:37.200]   and rightfully so wound up about the privacy issues that are going on right now. And what
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:42.560]   happens with that is that they end up surrounding themselves with other people that think that way.
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:48.240]   It's an echo chamber. And they believe that they're making this huge monumental change
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:53.520]   when in actual fact they're not. They're just continuing to surround themselves with people
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:26:00.320]   that agree with their opinion on privacy and security. And the average people are going about
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:08.240]   their day on Facebook. And that's proven because Facebook continues to make billions,
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:16.800]   tens of billions of dollars a quarter. I know. So in order for this monumental change that
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:25.280]   these people, and I praise them for their zeal in trying to fix a lot of these problems,
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:30.320]   I just don't think that it's working to the extent that they believe it's working.
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:37.200]   And in order to see it really work, what's going to need to happen is that you will need to see
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:46.000]   Facebook say last quarter or a year ago quarter, we made $25 billion. This quarter,
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.880]   we made five. That would be.
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:55.200]   >> Well, that's already happening to say, well, we expect the FTC to find us $9 billion next quarter.
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:59.600]   The EU will be finding us $11 billion in a month.
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:03.360]   >> Yeah, but Andy, this isn't for a quarter's
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:11.680]   work that they've done. This is an investigation that has gone on for years. So they've made
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:17.840]   $25 billion a quarter. Let's say that the investigation has been going on for five years. That's 100
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:25.280]   billion a year that they've made for five years. And they're going to find them $5 billion,
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:30.160]   $11 billion. Who cares? I'd happily pay that and keep the other $80 billion.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:33.360]   That's part of the problem that we see too.
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:39.760]   >> That's why we need EU style regulation on the worst of these things. Right now,
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:51.200]   Zuckerberg is personally on the hook for the details of the 2011 agreement they made,
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:57.440]   Facebook made with the FTC to settle that ongoing dispute because they agreed to certain terms
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:01.200]   that they then absolutely refused to stick to. So the FTC came back.
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:08.960]   >> Exactly. So the FTC came back and said, okay, guess what? Now you are going to be
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:13.200]   personally responsible for this. You're going to appoint a couple of officers that are going to
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:19.680]   be personally responsible for the consent agreement as well. And if you fail, now we are talking about
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:24.320]   you personally are going to be paying fines and or you personally are going to be serving jail time.
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:30.240]   You need to put that kind of skin in the game. Given that, the Equifax breach,
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:37.440]   the only person who went to that Equifax who went to jail for being so irresponsible with
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:43.600]   people's credit history reports that tens of millions, 100 million reports were leaked out.
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:48.080]   The only person who went to jail is the officer who decided that gee, this news is going to come
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:53.520]   out in a week, the stock is going to tank, I better sell all my Equifax. That guy went to jail.
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:57.920]   But as far as the other people that a settlement the same, well, maybe we'll give you 100 bucks,
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:03.360]   but you probably will never actually collect it. This is why we need to, we can't have regulations,
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:09.360]   we have to have laws now. There's a regulation and a law. Congress passes laws. The FTC and
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:13.760]   the Justice Department passed regulations. We need laws now.
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:16.640]   So what about that camera though? Really good, huh?
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:23.280]   To answer your question, how many people?
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:29.840]   Care? Yeah. Yeah. On Mac Observer, you know, we can tell how many.
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:32.560]   Oh, yeah, because you got ad blockers coming to your site.
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:40.880]   Of course. And it's about 12% that's on a site like Mac Observer. So these are informed people,
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:46.560]   but I assume there's some level of them that choose to whitelist our site, right? Because
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:50.560]   they're fans of the site or whatever. Does Mac Observer do the pop up thing where it says,
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:56.080]   I see you're using an ad blocker support us? You know, I wrote a thing to do that about 10
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:01.200]   years ago, and I turned it off. It's like, what am I? It didn't make any difference whatsoever.
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:04.000]   I was like, why do I want to? It's pretty like it's not worth it. Yeah.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:10.720]   Is that number correlated to how many people proportionally are visiting your site via mobile
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:16.240]   devices where privacy plugins are not quite as easy to install and manage?
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:23.520]   That's a good question. That's aggregate numbers, but it, you know, it hasn't really changed over
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:29.040]   the years when we went from no mobile to, you know, many, many mobile.
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:34.480]   Yeah, it's always been that kind of between 10 and 15. In fact, it used to be higher. Now,
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:38.400]   it's lower. So maybe that is the reason it mobile kind of brings that number down a little bit.
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:42.720]   Yeah. I'm just going to tell you right now, I'm turning off my ad blocker on Macobserver.com.
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:47.520]   Thanks, man. I appreciate that. I recommend everybody does that.
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:56.800]   So bring it back to Apple quickly, just that this is why I do appreciate that Apple is sincere
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:01.680]   about caring about privacy. But remember that for years, they were railing against Facebook.
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:05.920]   So irresponsible, oh, Google is so irresponsible. These other companies are so irresponsible.
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:12.000]   We're not so irresponsible. But okay, guess what? Because your browser on the iPhone is one of the
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:18.320]   most popular browsers in the entire world, you could just simply change Safari. So that
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:23.440]   security so that ad blocking is kind of hardwired into the system and that it's always informing
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:28.480]   the user of what what's going on with cracking. But you didn't really care about that, did you?
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:32.800]   So that's what that's why I'm saying that I do believe that there's sincere about it. But when
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:39.680]   when Apple decides to hold themselves up as being so above everybody else, when they're willing to
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:44.800]   fight and make the pose for the statue about thinking that privacy is a human right and human
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:50.640]   freedom, unless you live in China, in which case we want to have respect for local laws.
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:55.280]   That's this is why I really think that we have to have a more honest discussion
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:32:01.920]   industry wide about where the lines are, what we are willing to accept, what we're willing to
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:06.240]   absolutely not cross the line on. And this is why I'm always and I'm always a little bit skeptical
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:11.760]   whenever any company Apple included make such a bold and broad statement about what they believe
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:15.680]   in and why they are superior to another company in that field.
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:20.720]   I have to give Apple some props because I do think that they are attempting increasingly to
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:27.360]   encrypt more and more in preparation for the day when they want to be able to say to a government,
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:33.520]   "Gee, we'd love to give it to you, but we don't have it." And that was of course what happened
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:39.680]   with the famous FBI versus Apple case and so forth. And I think Apple after that said,
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:45.520]   "You know what, from now on, let's work harder on making it impossible for us to satisfy government
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:51.200]   requests. What's going to happen in countries like Australia or Russia or China where you're not
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:55.440]   allowed to encrypt these things? That's another matter. That's a matter for another day. Sorry,
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:33:01.680]   Jim, go ahead. Well, I was just going to say that no matter what company you are, you have to abide
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:13.120]   by the laws and rules of the countries that you're in. So to say that Apple is maybe,
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:19.200]   I'm paraphrasing here Andy, maybe weak on China, I think is a bit unfair because Apple has to
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:30.800]   operate within the law in China. Now, the rest of the world basically is okay with being very closed
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:36.720]   and private and secure. They applaud that. And Apple does that in all those places that it can.
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:44.480]   But having said that, I do agree that I wish there was something more that Apple could do in
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:53.520]   China to help out there. And maybe in the future they will, if that opportunity is there.
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:58.960]   They could leave the market. I mean, that's what Google did. You could leave the market.
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:07.200]   But even though they did leave the market in 2011 before it became as big a market as this
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:11.280]   right now. And we also know that everybody knew it was going to be valuable. Come on.
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:18.960]   But also we know that that was a laudable thing that they did, that they did walk away.
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:24.400]   However, now that we do know that Project Phoenix was a real thing, they were trying to create
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:31.040]   a search engine that would work within Google's, excuse me, the Chinese government's rules
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:34.320]   before they got pretty much slapped down. They're still,
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:39.680]   now we're getting into an hour long discussion, which we probably shouldn't get it to.
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:45.920]   Let's move on. But yeah, let's move on. I will say about the camera that I did. So I took my first
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:51.600]   portrait selfie after it right after I set it up. And then like kind of looked at the screen.
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:55.120]   Okay, it looks kind of nice. And then when I finally looked at it on my laptop screen, it was like,
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:35:02.880]   I'm just concerned that people think that Andy wants all of his skin tones,
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:07.840]   like sort of evened out. And he wants like all the lines near his eyes to be softened.
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:12.720]   And he wants his eyes to be big and bright. I think that this first iteration that I've seen
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:18.080]   in the iPhone 11, it looks a little bit pageant-y, just a little bit.
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:23.840]   And I know that we've done a lot of the 10s, remember? And Apple backed down on that. I
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:28.240]   don't, I haven't noticed that in the current one, but remember, we're waiting on Fusion.
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:30.800]   Actually, let me take a break. When we come back, I'd love to know what,
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:34.800]   I'm sure, Jim, you've been broof briefed, maybe Dave has to. I would like to know what you guys
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:40.320]   think about the Fusion camera, which is coming out later this year and what difference that
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:46.720]   will make. I'll also love to talk about now that it's out 13.1 and what we're seeing there. And
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:51.520]   there's a lot more to talk about, including some good news for Austin.
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:59.040]   But first, a word from our sponsor, cap, Terra. If you're in business, I feel so sorry for,
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:06.480]   I see these surveys of businesses and in which they say, what version of windows are you using?
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:12.960]   And it's still of like 30 or 40% Windows XP. And I know why that number is so high
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:18.320]   because they've got software that runs their business that requires it or requires Internet
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:26.400]   Explorer 8. Oh, you know, that's sad. That's just sad. You should not be suffering with old,
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:30.480]   insecure software to run your business when there's great new software out there. And I have the
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:36.240]   place to find it. Cap Terra. Cap Terra lets you find the right software for your needs.

[00:36:54.560 --> 00:37:04.880]   I mean, I actually like it. Believe it or not, I like to go to sceptera.com and select spa software
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:10.400]   and just look in just looking random businesses and the software that's out there. And I'm always

[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:44.800]   about various products, including the platforms it runs on. And then I love this.

[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:10.560]   What did I say? Oh, Fusion. Let's talk about the Fusion software.
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:15.040]   Jim, did you get any briefing from Apple about what they're going to do with Fusion and when
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:20.320]   it's going to be? No. They didn't talk about it. No. No. They did say it's coming. I mean,
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:24.560]   it's not a rumor, right?
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:33.520]   Oh, Jim knows everything. And he's obviously signing on disclosure agreement. Deep Fusion.
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:39.440]   They did talk about it. Come on. You can say that much. I don't know. I don't know.
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:47.360]   All they've said is a brand new way of taking pictures with a neural engine in the A13 chip
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:53.200]   that will look at your image and say, "Well, that's a human. That's a dog. That's a wall."
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:40:00.720]   And add to the detail, reduce the noise. This is that thing where it shoots nine images
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:06.320]   before you press the shutter button. It's captured four short images, four secondary
[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:11.440]   images. When you push a button, it takes one long exposure photo. Does the analysis in a second
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:21.280]   and comes out with a photo? Dave, did they tell you anything? No. I can say they didn't tell me
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:26.960]   anything. Maybe they're not saying anything. Maybe they told Jim more than me, which wouldn't
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:32.800]   surprise me. But yeah, computational photography, mad science. That's all I know. But it sure looks
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:37.680]   cool, doesn't it? We don't know when. It is not on your phone now. Go ahead, Andy.
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:42.080]   I did ask them about it during my briefing. And the only thing I got out of them was that it was
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:48.240]   for now optimized towards people and portraits, things like that. So it's not necessarily going to
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:52.640]   be, "Hey, I see that you're taking a picture of dolphins at the beach. I know what dolphins look
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:57.280]   like. I know that I know I want to use a high-speed shutter. I know that I want to fuse that." But yeah,
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:02.960]   it does feel like just like all the lighting features that came out a couple years ago,
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:08.400]   it does feel like this sort of feature where if I spend two weeks testing it out and writing
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:14.480]   about it, whatever I say about it will be almost completely useless after six or seven months,
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:17.840]   I do feel it's always something they're going to be continuing to improve as time goes by.
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:22.960]   How much of this you think is a way of hedging their bets against Google's Pixel 4 coming out
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:27.840]   in a couple of weeks? Well, I don't think they have to hitch their bets against the Pixel.
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:35.360]   But I do think that this is a great example about how both the Galaxy Note and the Pixel and the
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:41.840]   iPhone and also Huawei's new phones, all these ones really push all the other horses in the race
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:47.920]   to go further and further and faster. I mean, Jim was right. It's not as though Apple said,
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:52.480]   "Ooh, night sight. Great pictures in low light. That's a great idea. We should do that." But it does
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:57.920]   mean that it does give Apple, last year, gave them a bar saying, "Okay, when we are rolling out
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:04.240]   this feature, here is the bar we need to eclipse." And also things like, "What isn't good? It really
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:09.440]   does take impressive pictures, but what is not convenient about it? Okay, how about having to
[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:17.840]   actually activate the feature?" So I think that they are aware that Google, as usual, is going to
[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:23.520]   stress how good their artificial intelligence machine language-based photography,
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:26.000]   photogrammetry is going to be, and they have to top it.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:35.280]   Yeah, I totally agree with Andy on that. When you look at how companies are pushing each other,
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:43.840]   that's definitely a good thing. It is good for all of us. But when you look at these different
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:51.520]   features, we have to remember that all of these companies have been working on machine learning
[00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:57.840]   and things like that for quite a while. It's who's going to come out with the best machine learning
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:04.320]   and who's going to come out with the easiest way to implement it. And looking at some of the
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:09.680]   things that Apple has done, where they make it automatic, that may be great for the average user,
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:16.800]   and maybe not so great for the pros. And these are the things that Apple has to try and weigh
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:22.480]   when it releases new features of who are we trying to please here.
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:26.400]   Well, who are they trying to please with this slophie? That's my
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:36.720]   Instagram influencers, clearly. I think that's Andy. Me, definitely, goes, when I'm on Instagram,
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:41.120]   what I want to see is I want to see someone doing a spit take or even vomiting or sneezing in
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:46.240]   super slow motion. And finally, my dreams have been answered. It will happen. Apple is actually
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:52.400]   trying to trademark the term slophies they've applied to the US patent trademark office for
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:57.120]   the term slophie. And the rest of the makers are saying, you know what, Apple, you can have that.
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:02.080]   That's right. Save yourself to $5,000. You can have it.
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:06.480]   That's just PR move, right? I mean, it might as well do it.
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:09.280]   But it has a trademark slophie with a pH.
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:16.640]   No, and our good friend, Micah Sargent, owns that. So stay away, Apple. Stay away. That's all I
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:22.240]   Well, if he has it and it sounds the same, then that automatically causes it to
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:30.880]   be rejected. You're breaking a young man's heart. I know if he already has it, then he'll,
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:34.640]   then Apple will have to buy it from him. Well, he registered it right when Apple announced it.
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:42.560]   So I don't know if there's prior art depends on when Apple also misspelled it. He spelled it
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:52.400]   with a pH. Got it. Yes. Sluffy.net and slophie.org. So it's a complicated story. It begins with
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:59.360]   the United States government granting Apple exemptions for tariffs on Chinese imports,
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:05.600]   including the power supply and the motherboard. These were all going to be
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:15.760]   tariffed in September on Friday of last week, the US Office of the US Trade Representative
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:22.640]   granted Apple exemptions on the Magic Mouse 2, the Magic Track Pad 2, and various external
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:30.160]   components. Exclusions go till August 2020. In fact, any tariffs already paid will be refunded.
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:38.240]   Does not cover the Apple Watch iPhones or AirPods. Those will be tariff starting December 15th.
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:43.680]   I wish I could have that refund check. Can you imagine what that was looked like?
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:48.320]   Just just that one check. Yeah. I just want 1% of that refund check.
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:54.160]   You can have the other 99. I'm good. So really immediately after that announcement,
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:46:01.760]   Apple says, Oh, guess what? Now we can make the Mac Pro in Austin. Oh, so the announcement was on
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:08.000]   Friday, Apple announced it on Monday. Yeah. But anybody had me let's be realistic here.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   Apple always made the Mac Pro in Austin. So that's a good point, although there was some question,
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.720]   and Apple was careful not to say where they were going to make it.
[00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:28.240]   Also, we have Apple continuing to make the same product in the same place in the US is not really
[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:36.880]   as much news as what the media would would have us believe. I think that they're trying to make
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:42.000]   a bit more out of it than what's actually there. Well, first of all, this cheese grater is nothing
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:48.880]   like the old at Mac Pro. Let's be honest and name only is there any similarity whatsoever.
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:53.280]   Certainly not in price. Are you going to buy one, Jim, for your music?
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:47:01.200]   And I would love to have one of those with my music. But you know, I mean, if you start looking
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:10.080]   into music and stuff like that for the average user, you know, you can do a lot on an iMac.
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:18.640]   So they're so powerful. I just got a new camera that is a 61 megapixel camera.
[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:25.520]   This thing chokes almost any device. I loaded up Lightroom, which is normally a pig on the iMac Pro.
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:33.440]   It's no slower. It handles it. No problem. Easy peasy. So there's a lot of headroom on the existing
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:41.280]   iMac Pro. Yeah, even just the regular iMac like Jim said, regular iMac. That machine is smoking.
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:47.920]   It is way more than most of us would need even doing, you know, especially like home stuff with
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:53.840]   music. I can't imagine that you'd really ever run into a problem with that. Even if you had a lot
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:58.720]   of plugins running and EQs and compression and all that, I think it's still handled just fine.
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:03.920]   Depending on that, if you use products like Universal Audio, which I use, you're offloading
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:11.840]   all the processing onto external gear. So now your CPU is freed up just to handle, you know,
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:19.600]   the live recording of music or mixing or editing. So it will be made at the Flex Plant, same place
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:24.880]   that the trash can Mac is made. I don't know if is is the right word for the trash can Mac.
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:29.280]   It's probably they made a few thousand in 2013 and they just stopped.
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:35.760]   That's actually what people were saying at the Flex Plant is we haven't made a new one of
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:38.960]   those in ages. We service them, but we haven't made a new one in ages.
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:48.880]   Yeah, that's a I know. I feel like this new Mac, this new Mac Pro is going to be like a
[00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:53.280]   Rolls-Rise. It's going to be handmade. They're going to have a tailor come in and stitch the
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:57.680]   leather. They're going to do it all by hand because, you know, they're myself, I mean,
[00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:01.200]   how many are they going to sell these? It's they're going to sell a lot of those, I think.
[00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:04.960]   You think it's even it's starting at $1000 in the one you want, at least 20?
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:10.480]   This is this is the ultimate Pro machine. I guess so. Pro's have been waiting for.
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:16.320]   Yeah. And you're going to get the movie studios, all of the music studios, the high-end scientific
[00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:23.280]   market, you know, all of these people are going to go buy a new Mac Pro. I was going to buy one
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:27.760]   for each one of the go with it. I don't know. I'm going to get the West Wing and the East Wing
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:31.760]   should have their own Mac Pro, I believe. Well, I agree with you. I'll send you a bill.
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:33.760]   Not to mention the pool house.
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:40.720]   Those XTR monitors. Yeah. Yeah. On the deck, absolutely.
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:47.840]   Actually, I just bought those outdoor Sonos speakers. I might as well have bought a Mac Pro Christ.
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:52.320]   How does Sonos keep charging? It's so much 800 bucks or something crazy.
[00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:56.960]   Did you check out the new Sonos move? That's what I'm talking about. The move.
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:50:00.800]   That's what you're talking about. Yeah. Yeah. I I've been messing with that for a little while.
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:06.080]   I mean, it's a great speaker, right? And having it be airplay and Bluetooth and battery powered
[00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:10.160]   and basically checking off all the boxes that anybody ever complained about that Sonos doesn't
[00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:15.280]   make a speaker that has X, that's got it, right? I feel like it's 100 bucks too expensive.
[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:19.760]   400 dollars. And of course, if you want stereo, you got to have two of them.
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:24.160]   Yeah, that's right. That's right. But they've did a nice job with like,
[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:27.760]   so you already got yours. Mine was shipped, but I haven't received it. You've already got yours.
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:35.840]   Yeah. Yeah. And it's it. What's really cool about it is they wanted to make sure that the sound
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:40.640]   from the tweeter from a high-end speaker didn't just come straight out like a tweeter normally
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:44.720]   would. They knew it was going to be used outside. So they wanted the sound to spread.
[00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:51.520]   So the tweeter is actually placed face down in the top of the unit. And there's this wave curve
[00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:57.840]   piece of plastic. They went through like 65 iterations of it or something. And it not only spreads the
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:02.720]   sound out about 180 degrees, but it also drains because you're going to get rain on the thing
[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:09.280]   when you leave it outside. So yeah, it's pretty cool. I left mine outside in a rainstorm about a
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:15.200]   week ago. And that's just because I had to. And you know what? It did fine. It did great.
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:19.520]   I like so you don't actually have to plug it into charge it. It has a charging stand. It charges
[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:25.680]   on right. It yeah, it's like a ring. It calling it a stand isn't quite right because acoustically,
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:31.840]   you wouldn't want the speaker sitting in like the top of that ring. Right. So the speaker actually
[00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:38.400]   sits on your table. And then the ring is perfectly shaped to charge it when you drop the speaker
[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:43.200]   in essentially inside the ring. It's you wouldn't listen to it inside the ring.
[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:49.040]   Yeah, you could totally. That's the ideas. Maybe have that ring in your kitchen or whatever.
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:53.440]   Oh, I find it the ultimate grilling accessory, right? Because I can grab it and take it outside of me.
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:56.400]   That's why honestly, that's why I got it.
[00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:04.000]   That that in the hot tub. I want to be able to take it outside. Dave, can I ask a really
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:13.200]   important question? Does the ring leave a ring on your fine furniture? I had it. I had it for about
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:20.480]   a week. And the answer is no, but but we'll see. So yeah, you're placing it wrong. Yeah.
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:28.320]   That's it. You clearly don't have the sort of super expensive furniture that Apple thinks that
[00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:33.360]   deserves to be placed underneath their own speaker. No, I have a house full of solo speakers. I don't
[00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:40.000]   have an expensive furniture to go like God. Yeah, you buy Sonos. You know, I thank God they've kind
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:45.120]   of kept up with the times because I have such an investment in Sonos, not just at home, but here
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:51.840]   we have Sonos all over the studio here. Have you checked out those new symphonus speakers, the Ikea?
[00:52:52.240 --> 00:53:00.560]   No, no, you can get it. It's a hundred bucks Leo for the bookshelf speaker. It's fully Sonos
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:06.640]   and it's fully compatible. It is a Sonos speaker. It's just sold by Ikea. It's a
[00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:08.720]   90-minute- >> Do I have to assemble it from a flat pack?
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:11.680]   You could if you wanted, but you don't have to.
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:12.160]   >> Okay.
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:18.560]   >> And it's AirPlay 2 and all the stuff that new Sonos speakers are except it's a hundred bucks.
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:24.480]   >> Wow. >> No, don't get that one. That's the silly lamp thing. I have one of those. It's
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:32.000]   no, but the bookshelf one is- >> It looks like an lamp in the world. I want to buy it just to
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:40.400]   reward them for that marketing copy. >> Well, it looks like a home pod with the plastic lamp on top
[00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:41.920]   of it. >> Yeah, don't get that.
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:43.520]   >> It looks like E from what? >> That's not for you and me.
[00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:48.160]   >> That's not for you. >> If you started playing music and a disco ball popped out of there,
[00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:51.680]   that would be cool. >> I'd buy that.
[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:58.160]   >> No. >> The lamp isn't even smart in that, right? That switch on the side is just to turn the lamp
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:00.960]   on and off. That's the case. >> You should be able to talk to the lamp.
[00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:02.160]   >> But the speaker is smart. >> Yeah.
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:05.360]   >> Okay. >> You should be able to talk to the lamp.
[00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:08.560]   We have a t-shirt. >> Talk to the lamp.
[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:13.280]   >> Where's the show going? >> Down the tubes?
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:17.360]   Oh, no, it's too late. >> Down the tubes?
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:19.440]   >> See what happens when Randy doesn't show up?
[00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:26.720]   >> No, no, he didn't help either. One bad thing we're learning from the makers of
[00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:38.480]   Halide, the wide-angle camera on the iPhone Pro, they can't access raw capture. They can't access
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:48.080]   the lens directly. So the ultra-wide camera isn't yet capable of capturing raw image data or manual
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:56.960]   focus, so Halide can't do its thing with that ultra-wide angle. This is Ben Sandofsky from Halide.
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:55:03.520]   >> Manual focus makes sense because it's a super wide angle lens. It's probably got this
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:10.000]   really huge depth of field anyway. The raw is interesting. It's maybe that they don't want
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:16.480]   people to see exactly what raw, exactly how distorted it is and how much pixie dust
[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:21.600]   the iPhone has to sprinkle over to turn it into what looks like a normal image.
[00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:24.800]   >> Well, you know they're doing it. It's an 18 millimeter effective,
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:29.200]   which means it's going to have some curvatures, some barrel distortion, no matter what.
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:34.240]   And clearly when you look at the images, it's been corrected. So maybe that is the reason.
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:39.840]   >> Yeah. But other cameras do, like for instance, on the Google Pixel phone,
[00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:46.560]   they do have their advanced HDR, which if you, because it's a synthetic image, there shouldn't be
[00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:51.680]   a raw file capable from it, but they generate what they would, what they admit is sort of like a
[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:57.200]   faux raw say, well, we'll give you sort of all the features that you would kind of want from a raw
[00:55:57.200 --> 00:56:02.240]   file, even though this is a completely synthetic image. So it's not like Apple couldn't do that
[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:07.520]   in the future if they have any concerns, but that is interesting. It's kind of, and it's a little
[00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:12.160]   bit disappointing, but hopefully we'll see it in the future. Because when you talk about this being
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:19.040]   a pro phone and pro camera, where a lot of people are going to be using it for like field journalism,
[00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:25.520]   where, so it's unfortunate. >> So it's also, I think,
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:34.320]   I don't mind it as much because it's such a kind of odd look, it's actually 13 millimeters equivalent,
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:44.480]   not 18. So it is very wide. It's kind of weirdly wide. I love that look, but I think it is kind of
[00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:51.840]   an extra flavor. It's like the licorice of camera lenses. >> Red licorice, not black licorice,
[00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:55.120]   we should say. >> Okay, definitely black licorice. Some people like it.
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:59.120]   >> Some people like it. >> Some people love it. >> Other people will get high blood pressure
[00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:03.920]   for meaning too much of it. >> But I honestly think that's a really great feature having a super wide
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:11.760]   angle lens, because if you always, the thing is you can't back up farther at then a certain point
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:16.720]   to get everything in, but you can always crop something in. So I would love to have both telephoto
[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:20.240]   and super wide, but if I had to choose one, I would definitely take the super wide.
[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:25.120]   >> Yeah. No, especially if you're taking building pictures, things like that, or as you say,
[00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:29.600]   in areas where you just can't. >> Or get everybody, we want to get everybody in the table in the
[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:37.840]   shot. >> Yeah. I like wide angle photography, actually. I'm a fan. This is 16 to 35
[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:44.000]   minutes on this, and I really enjoy that. >> Let's see, anything. I want to talk more about
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:49.360]   the hardware. We're getting the new iPads, the 10.2 inch low cost iPad, shipping to customers
[00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:53.520]   tomorrow in store later this week, according to Mac rumors, that's good.
[00:57:53.520 --> 00:58:01.200]   Actually, I got a good question for you. You guys receive an invitation to another Apple event
[00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:07.520]   yet? >> I most certainly have not. >> No.
[00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:10.560]   >> Not I. >> Do you think, Jim, there will be another Apple event?
[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:15.600]   They got to announce the Mac Pro if I'm going to show it.
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:19.520]   They already showed the Mac Pro. >> They did that.
[00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:23.440]   >> Okay. I don't think they do another event just to say, "Hey, look at the Mac Pro."
[00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:27.840]   >> Not just for that, but there's more iPads. There's iPad Pros in the mix.
[00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:33.600]   There's 16-inch. >> Yeah, I'm literally waiting for that 16-inch
[00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:39.280]   MacBook before I buy another laptop. >> Yeah, but it'd be interesting to see what
[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:45.520]   they choose to do. One way is to have not, it wouldn't be even a big event, more like a town
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:50.960]   hall event where there's only about 100, 150 people in there. But another one is to
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:56.720]   for Apple to decide what concerns and what concerns do we want to address in the populace
[00:58:56.720 --> 00:59:01.520]   about what we've changed with this new MacBook. And it's possible that the best way for them to do
[00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:06.400]   that is to make an announcement release a whole bunch of really cool videos and real
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:12.480]   cool website for people to check out. But make sure that they choose eight people that are really
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:18.240]   going to be copacetic with the changes that they've made and let them have it for a couple of weeks
[00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:24.080]   and let them sort of make the announcement, so to speak. Because it's hard to know what,
[00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:29.440]   at this point, it's hard to know what merits for Apple. We're going to bring everyone into
[00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:35.200]   a Cupertino. We're going to book a big haul in order to show this off. I don't think that there's
[00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:40.080]   anything that's left on the boards yet that would merit anything more than 100 people in town hall.
[00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:45.440]   >> It is. It would be a pro event. So it could be like that school event.
[00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:49.600]   >> Yeah. >> But maybe do it in Hollywood Studios.
[00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:56.560]   >> New York City, there are a whole bunch of small spaces that are like the friends that almost,
[00:59:56.560 --> 01:00:00.560]   where it's all Oak Panel. You can set it up. Microsoft does that a lot with a lot of their events.
[01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:05.200]   Amazon does that for their events as well, where they can really control the thing and make it into
[01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:10.480]   the room that they want a professional level piece of hardware to be shown off in. Because it's not
[01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:17.760]   going to be about getting consumers excited about new phone colors. It really is going to be about
[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:24.000]   getting people who bill at thousands of dollars per hour excited about buying a $20,000 computer
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.720]   that will help them with their half a million dollar projects.
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:29.440]   >> So Jim, you don't think they'll do an event?
[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:40.160]   >> Well, I think it's going to be how fundamentally changing the industry this computer is or what
[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:51.520]   they think it is. Like Andy said, they could easily explain a new MacBook Pro with videos and
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:58.160]   everything else. But if they feel that this is a monumental shift, then they'll have an event.
[01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:00.640]   >> Right. Yeah. Okay.
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:05.280]   >> I mean, they've already showed the Mac Pro. There's no need to really show that again.
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:11.040]   All they're doing now is putting it out there. A redesign of the MacBook Pro would be a significant
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:14.320]   event. >> Well, it could be.
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:19.920]   >> It could be. >> If it's more than just the screen, I mean, if there's more power in there,
[01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:29.760]   and it's a device that is going to be more widely used, then I could see that. Maybe if there's
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:38.800]   iPad Pros along the way, and they do a MacBook iPad type of combined event, but it all depends on how
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:45.280]   monumental they think it is. If they're just going to upgrade processors and stuff, then,
[01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:51.040]   you know, a small bump, then I don't think that that would warrant an event.
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:58.000]   >> Yeah, that's true. I mean, we already have an eight core MacBook Pro, right? So is making the
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:03.840]   screen on the eight core MacBook Pro enough to warrant, you know, assembling everyone from all
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:08.160]   corners of the earth? >> Do you discredit the rumor that they're going to abandon the butterfly
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:14.080]   keyboard for this? You think that that's a possibility? >> Well, you and I might see that as a reason to
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:18.320]   assemble people from all corners of the earth. I'm not sure how you'll understand how that kind of
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:26.800]   part. >> Potentions. >> Yeah, exactly. >> Well, but it is a fly in the soup. And if you know that
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:33.680]   most of the coverage, when you write constructively about the MacBook Pro, you're writing about one
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:38.480]   of the things that you have to write about is a keyboard that was failing, failing, failing, failing,
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:44.640]   that a lot of people don't even like when it works. And so it depends on whether Apple sees that as a
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:48.960]   it's time for us to do a minor maya culpa and say that we are still working on this, we're still
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:52.880]   developing this. We know that one of the things that you might want to be interested in is how are
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:57.920]   we progressing on the keyboard? And so here is a lot of stuff that we're talking about about how we
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:02.160]   changed, fixed, upgraded, whatever the keyboard, or it's possible that they're going to say that
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:07.440]   most of the customers are happy with it. Let's not call attention to it. I think that the fact that
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:14.560]   they keep when it became a support issue, when it became a durability issue, that's when it stopped
[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:18.960]   becoming something that they could really say, oh, well, some people like we think that most people
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:23.760]   like it. When they when you have so many stories of people saying, well, I'm I had to download a
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:28.560]   special app from the app store just to make just to make the stuttering keys on my keyboard,
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:34.320]   stop stuttering. That's when they have to at least make part of that presentation. And here's how
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:39.440]   we've redesigned the keyboard along with talking people for private briefings and saying more in
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:44.320]   depth that here is what we have found. And here's what we're doing to change it. That is something
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:46.160]   again, they have to take the fly out of the soup somehow.
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:53.440]   And I'll say again, and I've I've said this before, I have used all generations of these
[01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:59.280]   keyboards on MacBook Pros over the past few years. And I have not had an issue.
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:07.200]   Now, I realize that some people do and I feel terrible for those people because I can't imagine
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:14.960]   how frustrating that might be. But, you know, just as a one in four Mac break weekly panelists
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:22.000]   loves the Apple butterfly keyboard. Yeah, every one of them that we've purchased here,
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:26.480]   the review unit MacBook Pro that I have does not have that issue. But every one of them,
[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:32.000]   MacBook Air and MacBook Pro that we've purchased here has had within six months of it leaving the
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:38.320]   factory. It's had the stuttering keys. So you're right, Andy, it's it's there's a personal preference.
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:42.960]   It's a like there's a functional issue with these things. Well, but and for me, I haven't had I
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:48.720]   like you, Jim, I've not had a problem with it. I just don't like it. So I like it. Yeah, you
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:54.480]   like it, but that's a that's the personal preference part. So yeah, so yeah, I mean, honestly, I would
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:05:01.600]   I'm waiting because I love the idea of a 16 inch screen in the 15 inch body. I like the body design.
[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:06.880]   I don't think they need to really redesign it except maybe I would like to see more connectors.
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:13.440]   Maybe I guess that that that horse has left the barn and I would really like to see.
[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:20.400]   Well, there's two things. One is a better keyboard, a real keyboard with some travel and maybe not
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:24.400]   the touch bar, but just the fingerprint part of the touch bar like on my MacBook Air. I would
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:29.440]   love to see that too. So I think there's places they could go with it, but you know, they're not
[01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:35.760]   making that for me. I'm waiting to see what they do. And if because I'm due to buy a new laptop,
[01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:40.720]   new high and laptop, it's going to be that if they offer that, if they don't, then it's going to be a
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:48.640]   Lenovo. I personally don't use the touch bar. I could never really figure out how to use the
[01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:54.800]   touch bar, you know, for the purposes. I know what what it is, but are they still all in on the
[01:05:54.800 --> 01:06:00.720]   touch bar? I guess they are. Yeah, big time because they just added it to the lowest priced
[01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:07.040]   MacBook Pro. They sort of revamped that in June. There's no escape Mac left. No, that I like the
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:15.200]   touch bar. I like the one out of four Mac quickly cut. They just suck the same one.
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:23.360]   That has one follow up question. Do you also recommend sugarless gum for people who chew gum or
[01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:29.680]   do you not recommend sugarless gum for them? My attorney says that I need to decline to come in.
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:36.000]   Four out of five doctors recommend a hearty breakfast. I just I hope that the key points too.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:43.840]   And that's absolutely fine. I hope that Apple puts a lot more of their passion into this idea of
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:50.480]   the new features of Catalina and the new iOS. We're just the idea of all the people who have
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:56.720]   iPhones or iPads and the ability to say, well, what if we just say if you've got what if we just let
[01:06:56.720 --> 01:07:02.080]   developers use this as a touch interface with its own like on screen controls, its own on screen
[01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:07.200]   buttons, its own like you can have a jog shuttle, you could have a color palette on it. That would be
[01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:13.360]   just such a transformative thing, not just for the MacBook, but for laptops in general. We've been
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:19.600]   seeing on the window side of things some early experiments in having like laptops that have
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:26.000]   additional screens built into them. And not all of them are I think really successful,
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.400]   but I think that all of them are really, really interesting in terms of a direction that
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:34.880]   a laptop or even desktop computing can go in. It's been a while since Apple really
[01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:40.640]   did something that just every on the on the desktop or on laptops that everybody decided that,
[01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:44.640]   wow, this is such a good idea that we have to think about how we're going to incorporate this
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:48.960]   in our own designs. And if they were to say that not only would they be selling a lot more
[01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:56.320]   iPhones and a lot more iPads, but they really, really would be transforming the Macintosh
[01:07:56.320 --> 01:08:00.560]   and making it to something that's really prepared for 2020, 2021, 2022.
[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:07.200]   All right. Well, I guess I'm going to get rid of that save the date and just wait for a
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:13.520]   press release. If they did announce it, it would be in October, right? Yeah.
[01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:15.280]   Or you think they can't wait too long because
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:21.840]   things that have holidays, things that things that happen after October tend to happen when
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:26.160]   they've absolutely promised by the end of a certain calendar year and they can't back away
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:30.800]   from it at this point. And so that's when you see that we have three of them available for order
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:36.800]   on December 31st while you're still drinking for New Year's. That's about if it's not if it's not
[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:40.400]   available in by let's say the first week of November, I don't think we'll see anything.
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:45.840]   That's what happened in 2013. I got the trash can Mac. They they announced it and I ordered it,
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:49.040]   but it didn't arrive till January. Yeah, I remember that. Yeah.
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:55.600]   All right. Well, we'll see. We'll see what happens. Let's take a break. When we come back,
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:09:01.760]   I want to talk about the watch. I bought something in the app store. Wow, that was wild on the watch.
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:08.960]   That was an interesting experience. We'll also talk about something that Jim is going to like
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:18.560]   a lot. I think lyrics, lyrics in iOS. But first a word from WWT worldwide technology. Everybody
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:26.720]   knows WWT. If you if you are buying for a company and you're getting the big iron, the technology
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:32.880]   that makes the company sing, you've heard of WWT because they are the people who make it sing
[01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:37.120]   for you. They're the ones who can get that system working and running and help you buy
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:43.920]   exactly what you need. It was about 10 years ago. WWT started their advanced technology center.
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:50.320]   And this thing is amazing. The ATC like no other testing and research lab in the world. It contains
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:56.560]   more than half a billion dollars in equipment from hundreds of OEMs, key partners ranging from
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:10:03.120]   heavyweights like NetApp and Cisco and VMware to emerging disruptors like Tanium and Equinix and
[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:10.400]   Expanse. The engineers at WWT use this advanced technology center to spin up proofs of concepts,
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:17.120]   do pilots for their customers, helping them choose the best solution, which really reduces the time
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:25.280]   from concept to delivery down to weeks instead of months. But here's something really cool. They
[01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:33.600]   offer lab as a service, a dedicated lab space within the ATC where you as a customer can perform
[01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:40.800]   your own testing. You have access to that half billions billion dollar equipment that vast technology
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:45.360]   ecosystem, WWT has already built. So you can say, well, how is this going to work with that? For
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:52.080]   instance, you can use if you're interested in the NetApp cloud volumes on tap, you can use on tap
[01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:57.440]   on flash, NetApp disaster recovery as a service. You can set up labs, hundreds of other labs
[01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:02.640]   representing the newest advances in every area of enterprise technology, flash storage,
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:08.720]   multi-homed clouds, hyper converged infrastructure, cloud data management and on and on and on. So
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:14.560]   you can see ahead of time before you buy exactly how this is going to integrate with your existing
[01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:26.800]   system. They launched it this summer and it is a hit. The WWT ATC lab as a service. It's a multiplier
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:31.920]   effect of knowledge of speed, of agility, anytime, anywhere around the world for your
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:38.240]   as a customer, WWT, you get access to all sorts of information articles and case studies. You get
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:44.880]   hands on in the labs. You get tools that can make a difference in today's rapidly changing world.
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:50.880]   And here's the best part. You can use it anywhere in the world 24/7. You don't have to go to St. Louis
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:57.360]   to learn more about WWT and their Advanced Technology Center to sign up for access to this new on-demand
[01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:05.040]   lab platform. I want you to go to www.wt.com/twit.
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:10.960]   Worldwide technology simplifies the complex. Take advantage of this. This is remarkable.
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:18.080]   www.wt.com/twit. WWT delivering business and technology outcomes all over the world.
[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:25.440]   And just for you, we thank them so much for their support of. Mac, break, weekly.
[01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:30.960]   Boy, there's so much stuff to talk about in 13.1.
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:39.040]   But first, let's talk about lyrics because I know Jim has got to be happy about that. Apple music.
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:42.800]   lyrics to live by. Have you played with this yet?
[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:50.240]   I am thrilled with the lyrics. So you see it as you listen to the song?
[01:12:50.240 --> 01:13:02.000]   Yeah. Nice. Yeah, there's a lyrics button. It's fascinating to see it, to look at it.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:08.800]   Nice. To read along with it. It's just one of those things. If you're...
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:13.440]   Especially the music you listen to, Jim. I don't want to say anything, but you never know what
[01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:22.240]   the guy's saying when he's... It's nice to know he's saying, "My love is like a red, red rose."
[01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:26.880]   You just would never know that. No, I'm teasing you. I'm teasing you.
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:31.600]   I have to say, there's a lot of music. I listen to the Rolling Stones. I never knew what
[01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:38.640]   those songs were about. Right? You never knew. But you put on the lyrics and all of a sudden,
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:47.600]   you're reading a story with these lyrics. So I really like it myself. I think it's great to have
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:53.760]   that option in there that the lyrics come up as the music comes up. You don't need to scroll.
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:14:00.560]   You don't need to do anything. You're basically sitting there, reading a story to music. Nice.
[01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:05.760]   I love it. They've also added... I called it lyrics to Live By. This is a video series
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:11.520]   that they're doing with names like Halsey, Hunter Hayes, Midland, The Stories Behind Their Careers.
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:19.360]   I think this is really where Apple differentiates from Spotify and all the other competitors by
[01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:27.440]   their love for music and the unique way I think that they curate and do their music stuff. It's
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:33.440]   for people. I always feel like it's for people who used to listen to... That's because this is me.
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:39.040]   I used to listen to album-oriented rock radio and I would listen to specific DJs because they
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:43.120]   would know about the music the way they mixed it, the way they talked about it. You could tell
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:47.440]   their love for it. I feel the same way a little bit about what Apple's doing and I think it's an
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:54.480]   important part. I'm sure that's some of the influence of Johnny Iovine and some of it's just
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:15:01.200]   because of Apple's DNA with music. Whatever it is, it's good. They're music fans. They care. They're
[01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:08.080]   music fans. They care. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's good. Then there's a songwriting gods and
[01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:13.120]   goddesses, playlists from Elton John, Johnny Mitchell, Neil Young, Bruce Springsteen. So you get
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:19.120]   some great playlists in there. This is... Yeah. And Discovery, I think, is very good on Apple music
[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:25.520]   as well. That's a tough one to compete with because Spotify's Discover Weekly playlist is so good.
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:34.240]   But Apple does something similar, I think. Yeah. Apple's playlist. I find myself gravitating
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:40.560]   more towards Spotify's playlists than Apple's. Yeah. And I don't know why that is. I mean,
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:47.920]   I've noticed it consistently over the last whatever year and I'm not exactly sure why, but I find
[01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:51.440]   myself... I kind of agree with you. Spotify's playlist. And I'm no longer a Spotify premium
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:58.640]   member, but I kind of agree with you on that. And even the radio that Apple does, I do have to say
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:06.800]   that the radio is better than Pandora, for sure, without the weird repeats and stuff. But... Yeah,
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:11.840]   that's what gets me. But I just canceled my Pandora. Yeah. You don't need it. Because the repeats
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:16.240]   were just so awful. Yeah. And Pandora always likes somehow managing to get a Beatles song in no
[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:22.480]   matter what the playlist was. I want to hear country music. Is there anything wrong with shooting
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:28.080]   Beatles song in the middle of anything? I love the Beatles. Okay. It was just a... The Beatles
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:32.880]   is the Kevin Bacon of music batch. No matter what's changed, they'll always find a connection to a
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:36.880]   Beatles song. No matter what the algorithm is. It's always a Beatles connection. I think you're
[01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:44.000]   exactly right. Let's see. There's arcade. How do you guys like arcade? Love. Have you used it?
[01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:50.720]   Oh, Jim, you got to get out of that music shell you're in. No. I'm just not a gamer.
[01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:57.520]   You know, I understand why people use arcade and I understand that it's going to be very popular.
[01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:04.560]   But it's just not something that I use. I just don't play games. So...
[01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:08.560]   Yeah. Jim, can I say something that I'm not a gamer either?
[01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:14.160]   And of course, I signed up for it as soon as I activated the iPhone 11 and been downloading. So
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:17.920]   many of these cool games, they're not really... The games that I've been finding are...
[01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:21.760]   They're more like puzzles. They're more like interactive pieces. A lot of them are like
[01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:27.520]   interactive pieces of art. They're not the sort of games that get me all wound up and anxious and
[01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:34.000]   nervous. They're like calm with their tricles. So I like them a lot. But they just...
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:39.520]   That was frustrating to me. I don't know that I would have signed up if I didn't...
[01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:43.840]   I mean, I guess I would have anyway, but I signed up because I knew it would actually save us money.
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:47.440]   Having a 17 year old son. Absolutely. But...
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:50.720]   Happy though, that's a good question. Because he's a...
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:53.920]   Totally happy. He's presumably a hardcore gamer right at that age.
[01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:59.520]   He plays a lot of games for sure. Yeah. No, he's happy. In fact, he was showing me...
[01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:02.320]   Well, we were having lunch. He doesn't seem to go to school a whole lot. I don't know.
[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:07.520]   He's worked out a nice thing to perform so far. But anyway, we were having lunch together today.
[01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:10.480]   And he's like, "Have you seen Hot Lava? This game is amazing." It's so fun.
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:14.960]   It's so fun. Yeah. And I was like, "Oh yeah, look at this."
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:18.800]   Okay. I got it. This is operator 41. You have to sneak around and get to the phone
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:25.120]   before the Gestapo guy gets you. And it's kind of... I'll tell you what I love about these games.
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:30.160]   They're games that probably wouldn't kind of make it on the App Store without...
[01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:33.760]   Because they're just... Some of them are really more arty.
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:36.080]   Without... Without... Without... With... Without... With... Without... Yeah.
[01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:40.000]   But I think this is... These are... These are just really... Oh, God, get in there, get in there.
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.600]   Oh, yes, I did. I got there. I snuck around.
[01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:47.760]   It's like... It's like Castle Wolfenstein on rails.
[01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:54.080]   Yeah, but there's no shooting. And this is pretty typical of Apple's stuff is that they don't like
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:19:01.120]   to do... Shoot 'em up. There's some fighting, but this is really... It's just creative. They're
[01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:08.560]   very creative. And five bucks a month, and it seems like an unlimited supply of entertainment.
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:13.200]   I'm curious, I worry about the game... I'm curious, I worry about what's going to do the game ecosystem
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:18.880]   outside the arcade. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How many games need to move into arcade
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:24.160]   as arcade sort of moves along, right? That's the real question is, what does it look like
[01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:31.840]   a year from now? And does the exclusivity remain? And if it does, can people migrate into it in
[01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:36.320]   order to take advantage and participate there? Like, I got a lot of questions. I would not want
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:43.040]   to be launching a big title on the App Store, especially a freemium title right now on the App
[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:48.080]   Store within that purchases, because I feel like people are going to go, "Yeah, no, I'll do this
[01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:55.680]   what I got." Go ahead, Andy. Yeah. But particularly, I hope that I get to actually pay for and keep
[01:19:55.680 --> 01:20:02.800]   a game like "What the Golf?" Because it would be awesome. Yeah, it's almost like a stand-up routine
[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:08.960]   that you're just in the audience of. Because it's not... I mean, it starts you off thinking that,
[01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:15.520]   "Okay, look, it's a cute little cartoony mini golf game." But then you take a swing and on the
[01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:19.520]   second or third hole, you take a swing and you've actually just thrown the player. And now,
[01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:24.480]   like every time you swing, you're throwing the player onto the green. And now it's just a level
[01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:31.920]   after level after level. And I just... I would like to be able to own the games that I really, really
[01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:37.120]   like, and have access to play them and replay them whenever I want, that would be disappointed if
[01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:47.920]   someday it left Apple Arcade and the developers didn't find a way to put it back in the App Store
[01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:53.040]   or whatever. Because it's the same problem you have with Netflix and other streaming services,
[01:20:53.040 --> 01:21:00.240]   where you hate to think that, "Okay, I can only watch friends or Seinfeld until Netflix or Hulu
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:06.080]   loses the rights to it." And then maybe if I sign up for this other, you like to own things. I would
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:11.920]   also like to... I would also like the pleasure of taking $5 out of my wallet and giving it to the
[01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:17.520]   people who wrote this app. Well, you're right. I'm gonna cry. Here's some money. I want you to
[01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:22.240]   have some money. I want the next time that you buy a muffin at Starbucks, I want you to maybe
[01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:27.600]   think that it was the $18 that I gave you, four of those singles paid for that muffin.
[01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:32.880]   I'm gonna cry if they take this away. You're right. I never even thought about that.
[01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:42.640]   Yeah. This game is hours of fun. And if they said, "Oh, yeah, it's no more." But you know what,
[01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:47.520]   maybe that's actually now that you mention it. That's gonna be the secret of this is, "Oh,
[01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:51.760]   you want to keep playing it? I'll just pay us $5 and you can keep playing it." Maybe that's why
[01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:59.520]   these guys are putting up with that. Yeah. That's an interesting... That's the nature of the streaming
[01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:04.320]   world or the subscribing world that we live in, right? Things leave Netflix and it's like, "Oh,
[01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:12.240]   crap." Maybe that is a reality. I don't know. It's interesting to see. Maybe the thought of this
[01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:17.760]   whole thing is that when games do leave the arcade because they bring in new games,
[01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:21.760]   then you'll buy it. Then you'll buy it. Because people will be allowed to sell them. Yeah. I think
[01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:25.840]   that's probably it. Yeah. Yeah. Now I'm gonna be bummed because in a couple of months I'm gonna
[01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:32.720]   have to buy this. But that is a good incentive for the developer, isn't it? Yeah. I wonder if
[01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:39.120]   Apple allows that. What kind of long-term deal? Because if everybody's like, "Well, cool. I'll use
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:45.360]   Apple Arcade to get people hooked and then a month in, I'll bail and now you gotta pay me 20 bucks."
[01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:51.120]   I don't think Apple wants that. No. I don't think that you can bail. I think it's going to be a
[01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:58.800]   situation of where maybe Apple, they keep adding games. So at some point, they're gonna have to trim.
[01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:03.840]   If they trim, then your game is gone. But let's not forget that Apple is helping to fund these
[01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:09.280]   games too. Yeah. Right. So it could be that you're being paid for the development and everything
[01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:18.480]   by Apple. And then if they want to shelve it, it's theirs to shelf. Right. Yeah. But at least it's
[01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:25.840]   not, it's only exclusive to iPhone regards to mobile platforms. So there's nothing for
[01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:32.160]   there's nothing for making a version for Windows or for consoles or for the Switch. So at least
[01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:38.960]   there's that. Yeah. This is now on the Apple TV. Today's the day you can update your Apple TV and
[01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:47.520]   go out and get, I don't know what I'm doing here. Apparently building something. I don't know.
[01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:55.840]   Definitely not podcasting. Oh, that podcasting. Yes. Yes. I remember that. That's so 1995.
[01:23:55.840 --> 01:24:02.480]   We're transitioning to a Twitch stream starting with this episode where we just
[01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:07.120]   be all gameplay all the time. Just add two letters, man, and you're good to go. Yeah.
[01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:15.760]   Yeah. There we go. Apple has also added some shortcut capabilities, right, to iOS 13.1.
[01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:21.920]   Automation is built in. Automation. What is automation? Tell me about that.
[01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:27.360]   Home automation, which was taken out, I think, during the beta's went back in. So now you can
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:32.880]   have home automation shortcuts, which is one of the greatest things about having shortcuts to
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:40.320]   begin with. So I'm glad that that didn't go away forever. I have to find friends who have
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:46.880]   also have you one chip equipped phones because now the point to point your phaser at someone
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:53.120]   else's you want to equip phones. Is that turned on? That comes on with 13.1. Oh, I didn't know that.
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:59.360]   So I should air drop. I should try air dropping to somebody and see if I can aim at them, right?
[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:04.080]   Now they should mix that with what the golf and I should be able to pull this back and fire a
[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:09.600]   baby at them. That would be cool. But no, what they should do is it should make.
[01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:17.600]   Oh, I didn't realize that that's turned on as of this. Okay, that's exciting. That's exciting.
[01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:23.520]   Dark mode. You love dark mode. Who doesn't love dark mode? This is iPadOS. We're talking about now.
[01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:33.120]   You will absolutely want to upgrade both your iPhone if it's on 13.0 and your iPad if it's on
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:41.600]   12.x because the 13.0 version had some security issues and lots of bugs. And do you probably
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:46.960]   already upgraded your new iPhone 11? I would presume. Yep, my iPhone has got upgraded just this
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:53.360]   morning. Yeah, I updated mine during the show here. Yeah, it doesn't take too long. Maybe 20
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:57.360]   minutes. Well worth it. In fact, it's important, I think, to do that.
[01:25:57.360 --> 01:26:05.120]   There are a lot. We won't do the what's new. We've actually got a pretty big
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:11.600]   show off on iOS today of 13.1 and we talked about that. Well, let's talk about the watch.
[01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:17.040]   We also showed a little bit about the new watch OS 6, which by the way, everybody eventually will
[01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:23.840]   be getting except for, I think, zero and series zero on zero one. But right now, series three,
[01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:30.560]   four and five will be getting it. Here's the, this is kind of cool. The app store is right there on
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:37.280]   the watch. So you can now download and install apps from the watch, which I think is really cool.
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:44.480]   Yeah, we have to be so close to having a multi-platform version of watch OS. It has to be,
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:52.160]   it's becoming so much like the iPod and like the iPhone, where it is a state in and of itself that
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:27:01.120]   doesn't require necessarily an iPhone that I hope we see an Android compatible edition of the software
[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:06.480]   by next year. Really? That's an interesting idea. You think they'll go cross-platform?
[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:13.840]   I think there's a lot of money over there. And also, it's embarrassing, the state of
[01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:19.360]   WearOS. It's terrible. It's terrible. Exactly. And again, you're talking about a very,
[01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:26.720]   very happy Android user. And I have a couple of watch OS, excuse me, WearOS, whatever they're calling
[01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:33.840]   it, we used to be Android Wear watches. And they're okay with what they are. They are wristwatches.
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:39.120]   They feel like wristwatches that happen have one or two sort of smartphone features
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:46.080]   tacked into them. Whereas the Apple watch, I've been wearing this for a whole day.
[01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:50.320]   But also, I've had a series one that I still occasionally work from time to time.
[01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:54.240]   This feels like something that's taking advantage of, well, let's have an actual computing platform
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:59.360]   on your wrist that does something beyond just giving you notifications. Again, they're doing
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:04.720]   nothing. There's just nothing there. There's a piece I think that was written,
[01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:10.400]   though I forgot who wrote it. But last week, really just talking about all of the problems
[01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:14.800]   and getting in deciding that there might be a future for Android Wear.
[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:19.600]   From they can't get developers on board to they can't even get hardware manufacturers.
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:24.880]   When they add new features to WearOS, to the operating system, they can't even get manufacturers
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:30.640]   to say, yes, we will add features that will let you make and receive phone calls from the watch,
[01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:34.160]   even though that Google, you just finally come up with that feature.
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:41.280]   It's just I gave up waiting last year. And now I will be very, very serious about this.
[01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:47.440]   I'm not joking about this. I could switch to the iPhone. I could not switch to the iPhone.
[01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:52.400]   The iPhone 11 is very, very good. I really like it. I've never stopped loving iPhones.
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:58.240]   But if I do decide to switch from an Android daily driver to an iPhone,
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:03.360]   it's going to be because I like the Apple watch so much that I know that this is the only way
[01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:08.480]   that I can get a watch that I really, really like. That's how bad the situation is.
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:12.480]   So maybe I've just made the argument for why Apple would absolutely not want to
[01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:19.440]   create a Android version of watch OS. But on the other hand, there are a lot of people all
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:24.640]   over the world who have Android phones from all kinds of manufacturers. All of them will have 200
[01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:32.800]   to $600 to spend on a watch that absolutely kicks the butt of Android Wear watch and is also
[01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:38.560]   better markedly than Samsung's own gear watch. I think that there's a lot of money that's there
[01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:45.360]   on the table. And now that they've put so many of the features of that much required phone
[01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:48.960]   onto the watch itself, I really think that they're getting very, very close to it.
[01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:56.720]   I don't have the new watch. What do you all think of always on? Is that a game changer?
[01:29:56.720 --> 01:29:59.680]   Yeah. I really don't know.
[01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:07.840]   Yeah. I really do that. I mean, it's one of these things that you don't know that you're
[01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:12.160]   frustrated by it until you're frustrated by it. Oh, I know I'm frustrated by it.
[01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:15.760]   Right. Because I often have to flip this like three times to see the time.
[01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:21.440]   Yes. Or you flip it, it doesn't come on and then you flip it and then you start tapping on it.
[01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:28.000]   So the great thing, I mean, when you look at a watch to see the time, you just kind of
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:32.320]   expect it to be there. So you look up and the time is there and you look.
[01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:39.760]   When it's not, then you're interrupted in whatever it was you were doing, whether you're talking to
[01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:47.920]   somebody or whatever it is. And then it becomes an actual item like a task that you have to do.
[01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:52.080]   Well, all I wanted to know what time it was, it seems like a simple thing.
[01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:57.440]   Well, now you can. Now you don't even have to pick your wrist up. You can just sort of glance.
[01:30:57.440 --> 01:31:04.560]   And it's there. So I really like it. I think it's much better.
[01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:09.120]   And Dave, you didn't seem like you were that overwhelmed by it.
[01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:16.240]   No, I'm still the watch that I have that I don't put on my wrist while I'm recording because
[01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:23.120]   it would distract me is still a zero G Apple watch that arrived on release day. But with the new
[01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:28.800]   features of watch, it was six, especially the SPL the sound pressure level.
[01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:31.840]   Oh, yeah. It's in there. As soon as I started about that,
[01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:36.640]   it said, do you want to turn that on? Yeah, absolutely. He hasn't gone off yet. But
[01:31:36.640 --> 01:31:41.920]   my wife's got a newer watch than me. And she's got watch, it was six with that in there.
[01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:46.880]   And we were at David Burns, American, Utopia thing in Boston last night. Oh my God,
[01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:52.560]   jealous, freaking amazing. And he, you know, at one point, her watch told her, like, we're above 90
[01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:57.200]   decibels, you know, 30 minutes of exposure. And it was like, right. Because it wasn't that loud.
[01:31:57.200 --> 01:32:02.320]   I am obsessed with protecting my hearing. And I had earplugs with me, but I didn't have a man.
[01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:05.520]   And she showed me her watch just because it was the first time she had experienced it. It was like,
[01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:11.040]   Oh, crap, right. And I put my earplugs in. And so I had already decided I'm going to get, you know,
[01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:15.840]   one of the newer watches. So just so I can have that feature. And the always on it was,
[01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:21.040]   I had decided I was buying it before I knew that always on was in there. But that's a, I agree,
[01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:25.840]   that's a game changer. It's so frustrating to have to like jerk around with your wrist and tap
[01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:30.640]   and click. It's like the old Pulsar watches from the 80s. Like I used to have a watch where I could
[01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:34.480]   push it. And at least I got eight seconds out of it. Sometimes with the Apple watch, you know,
[01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:39.440]   I have it. And it's like, Oh, crap. Now it's gone. So forget that. How was American Utopia?
[01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:46.000]   It was so amazing. It's going to Broadway. You saw, you saw like one of the last nights in Boston.
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:50.800]   Yeah, it ends on Saturday. I think yeah, my wife took me as an early birthday present last
[01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:58.080]   night. So it's really, really cool. Oh, totally worth seeing. It's, you know, what you see there
[01:32:58.080 --> 01:33:05.120]   are the props. That's it. It is just people on stage. But these people are all amazing musicians.
[01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:10.240]   And you know, I mean, I could go on for a long time about this. David Byrne is like the way he
[01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:17.600]   was a fan of burn music, of course, talking heads, African style music, where each part sort of fits
[01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:26.640]   into the hole in this very conceived way. And the way he sort of orchestrated this whole thing is
[01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:31.200]   really, I mean, it's amazing and very well suited to his music. But that's not great surprise. So,
[01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:37.200]   yeah, yeah, really, really fun. And he's so personable. He's so comfortable being awkward.
[01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:43.440]   Like that's the thing about him. You know what I mean? Like he's not being awkward. Yeah, yeah,
[01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:48.880]   he just is. Yeah. Yeah, it's good. I like it. I understand he's also grown into that big
[01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:58.160]   suit from stuff. Yes, it fits now. That's right. All right, anything else? I want to get you out
[01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:01.920]   of here, Andy, and you got about 10 more minutes. So let me let me let me take a break. We'll get

[01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:06.800]   Let's start with Dave. Dave Hamilton, pick of the week this week.
[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:14.560]   My pick is it's a Mac app called Mac updater. They run a website to call Mac updater.net,
[01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:20.960]   but it's an app that you run on your Mac. It scours everything that you have. And then
[01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:28.720]   we'll not only tell you what apps have updates available, but also will allow you to update them
[01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:34.880]   right there from within the app. No, no, no, no, no, it's my new favorite app. Of course,
[01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:39.120]   I spend so much time keeping my Mac up to date now, but there's so many things like,
[01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:45.120]   you know, if you're a geek like me, you wind up downloading stuff and you don't realize that
[01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:50.400]   you need an update to an app until you launch it to use it. And then you don't want to wait to
[01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:57.120]   update it because it's like, well, I know I'm just launching it. I'm using it. And so this makes
[01:36:57.120 --> 01:37:04.160]   sure I never run into that. I've been blown away by how well it works. So much fun. Yep.
[01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:07.920]   So Mac updater is my pick. This has been around for a long time and I, you know,
[01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:11.520]   I've never I keep forgetting about it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it.
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:19.600]   They made it a lot better this year. So I had used it in the past and it just didn't stick.
[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:25.520]   But now it sticks. So yeah, it's been our new favorite on Mac Geek up to. I mean, it's like,
[01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:29.280]   it is my favorite app. So great. Great. Great. Thank you.
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:34.400]   Welcome. It's on the app store. Just download it right. Or is it on the app store?
[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:39.040]   No, I just downloaded it right from them. I think it can't be on the app store, right? Yeah.
[01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:42.960]   I think that's right. Yeah. But just go to Mac. It's too good.
[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:49.120]   It messes with your stuff. That's why. And they're good way in a good way.
[01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:56.000]   Annie and I go pick of the week. I'm setting up this new iPhone 11 for real deep soak testing.
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:59.680]   As a matter of fact, probably next week, I'm going to switch my SIM card from my Android phone
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:03.440]   into the iPhone so I can use this in my primary for a month or two, which means that I'm trying
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:09.600]   to I'm not treating it like a hotel room. I'm trying to move into it as a home. And issue number one
[01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:17.120]   was going to be how do I get media on there without having to have it either in a cloud service
[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:23.520]   or in an iTunes library. It's like I've got I've got the I tunes library of stuff that I just
[01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:28.480]   normally commonly have on my laptop. And then there's the stuff that's well, I've also got I've
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:35.200]   got a 256 gigabyte phone here. I've got a phone. My master library is about 120 gigabytes. I would
[01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:41.040]   like to have all of my music available on my phone without having to create a 120 gigabyte music
[01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:46.720]   library on my on my MacBook. Sometimes I've got like movie files I'd also like to put on there
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:54.480]   again without having to put a 7.1 gigabyte movie file that I recorded off my DVR into my laptop
[01:38:54.480 --> 01:39:00.880]   as part of the library. So that's why I installed a reality documents by reality, R E A D D L E.
[01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:05.280]   Still don't know how to pronounce that. I always say, you think it's real. I don't see
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:12.480]   I don't see they say read. Okay. They say read. Yeah, they built like a book reading app initially.
[01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:17.040]   Yeah, so it was a really really. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, exactly. But I when I saw the the
[01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:20.880]   extra D tricks me to thinking that they really want me to think that there's something about
[01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:27.120]   Adl in there. But it's spelled. Re-Adl. Let's just put it that way. Yeah. But what whether you have
[01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:31.680]   whether you have a any sort of iOS device, whether it's an iPad, whether it's an iPhone,
[01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:38.240]   this is a great app that will just simply let you copy files from your from your from any desktop
[01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:44.800]   into this into the for the personal storage area of this app. So as a result, again, I've got for
[01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:51.280]   formal playlists and formal like music library stuff. I've got that I've got maybe a couple dozen
[01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:56.240]   albums and iTunes and sync to the phone. But I also have like every single album I own every
[01:39:56.240 --> 01:40:03.120]   single track I own just copied into the phone via Re-Adl, which means that it's not quite as
[01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:07.840]   sophisticated as a regular music player, but it's smart enough to know that, Oh, well, look, I see
[01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:12.320]   that you've got like a folder full of music files. I'm now going to turn myself into a music player
[01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:17.760]   and play them in sequence of what's inside the folder. It also supports a lot more file formats
[01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:23.680]   than you would probably get through iTunes so that if you've got like a web M file, if you've got
[01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:29.840]   some sort of an open so like a really great lossless file format that iTunes isn't support yet,
[01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:34.320]   it will also play all that stuff. In addition to solving the problem of I've got a bunch of
[01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:39.680]   documents and files and information files and PDFs that I just want to have access to wherever I go,
[01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:44.720]   like the manuals to my camera, the manuals to whatever gear I'm carrying with me. I just like
[01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:50.640]   the fact that it's a simple no fuss just open iTunes, click open iTunes, go into the sync panel,
[01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:58.080]   then drag it into Re-Adl's, Re-Adl's, I keep alternating Re-Adl and Re-Adl and just drag it into
[01:40:58.080 --> 01:41:03.760]   Re-Adl's documents, copper, and it will just simply find its way onto that thing. You can copy things
[01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:10.000]   from Dropbox, one of the cheap app, but my goodness is it's super, super, super useful. I've had it on
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:14.960]   the iPad for a while and it's been a while since I've had it on an iPhone, but I think it's even
[01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:20.880]   more support for us on the iPhone. Andy, I'm going to let you go because I know you've got to get
[01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:27.280]   out there. You have one minute 30 seconds to evacuate the building. I hope the Boy Scouts like
[01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:31.840]   having a light set up in a MacBook, so I just got to flee with my phone right now.
[01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:36.160]   Hey, when are you going to be on the WGBH talking about? I presume talking about the iPhone.
[01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:41.280]   Probably Friday. I don't have a time yet, but as usual, check out my Twitter feed at
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:46.560]   Adonatco, I-H-N-A-T-K-O for all such announcements. Thank you, Andrew. Thanks, guys. Cheers.
[01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:54.320]   I have no idea how to use this, but Apple has released finally its AR reality composer.
[01:41:55.440 --> 01:42:02.400]   I have no idea what I'm doing with this, but I can create a horizontal vertical image or face.
[01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:08.880]   You want to augment faces using the front camera? You can. Don't know how to use it.
[01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:13.680]   Don't know anything about it, but presumably you're smart enough to know, so it's there.
[01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:17.840]   It's free. It's finally out on the App Store. I think they were probably waiting for 13.1.
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:28.880]   I don't know anything about it. Just play with it. Jim Dowerimple, give me music.
[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:36.640]   All right, here comes some music. The band that I am recommending this week is called
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:48.960]   "Crowbot." It's CRO-B-O-T. Is it like "Cronuts"? This is just a classic hard rock band.
[01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:54.240]   That's it right there. There's a song on there called "Burned." The first song of the album,
[01:42:54.240 --> 01:43:03.440]   it is just fantastic. It's just plain hard rock, the kind of stuff I really like. Listen to the
[01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:09.600]   description on Apple Music. Sounding like a relic of an error when fuzz drenched hard rock was
[01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:16.480]   delivered with greasy swagger and reckless abandon. Yeah, baby. It's because they're from Putsville,
[01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:25.200]   PA. Yeah, baby. Listen to that. Jim Dowerimple, we love you. Loopinsight.com.
[01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:34.880]   He is the man, the beard, the legend. Jim, we'll see you soon, okay? All right. Rock and roll, baby.
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:42.000]   See you, Leo. Thanks, Dave Hamilton. MacObserver.com. Anything you want to play? You got podcasts,
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:46.880]   galore, Dave. Yeah, come if you want answers to your Apple questions, come listen to Mac
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:52.560]   Geek. We answer everybody's question and we've been doing it for too long. Longer than we have.
[01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:56.160]   Keep doing it. Keep up and doing work, Dave. Great to have you on. Thanks, man. Yeah, it's fun.
[01:43:56.160 --> 01:44:01.600]   Thanks, of course, to Andy as well. We do Mac Break Weekly every Tuesday, right after iOS
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:07.600]   today. That's supposedly 11 AM Pacific, between 11 and noon. Let's put it that way. 2 PM Eastern
[01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:17.120]   time or 3 PM Eastern time or roughly 1,700 UTC. Watch or listen live at Twitch.tv/live. You can
[01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:22.480]   also ask your echo, "Hey, echo. Listen to Twitch Live," and it'll play it. You can also go to our website
[01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:30.080]   and download copies of the show, Twitch.tv/MBW. Best thing to do, subscribe. That way, you'll get

[01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:43.280]   I thank you so much for being here. Now my friends, it's time to get back to work because Breaktime
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:45.760]   is over. Bye-bye!
