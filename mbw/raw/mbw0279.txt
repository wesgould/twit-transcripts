[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.200]   How are you?
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.160]   Welcome to the Twit Holiday Specials.
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.240]   I'm your host, Father Twitmus.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.320]   And yet today, we're going to have some best of Macbreak
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.320]   Weeklys to celebrate the holidays.
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.080]   We gave everybody the week off so that they could be with their
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.880]   family and friends and hookers.
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.120]   And we're going to just-- we're just going to show you some
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.280]   of the best moments from the past year.
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.080]   Starting with, we're very beginning of the year.
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.880]   You know what the big story in January 2011 was?
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.160]   The iPhone comes to Verizon.
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.160]   Take a look.
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:41.200]   So after you played with it for a while, Andy, did you have
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.640]   any thoughts?
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.160]   I mean, there's a little antenna line different in a
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.200]   different spot, but it must have felt otherwise pretty much
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.960]   the same.
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.360]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.960]   And there's really just no difference between just some
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.200]   of the iPhone 4 that most of you guys already have your
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.640]   pockets.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.000]   So don't run out and get one.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.080]   Yeah, I mean, if for God's sake, we all wait--
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.880]   all you people waited three years for this.
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.680]   Can you not wait another five months to get the iPhone 5,
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.680]   which will almost certainly be available on the Verizon
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.000]   network?
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.880]   That would be my suggestion, right?
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.080]   Is a priority on it.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.320]   Have you got an iPhone 4?
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.320]   Stop.
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.320]   Stop.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.000]   Although it's having some conversations, I think all of
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.840]   us in this conversation have heard from every friend and
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.000]   every relative and every friend of a relative about the
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.360]   rumors and the good behind it.
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.760]   You can finally do the--
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.240]   And something that I've sort of been picking up from this is
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.440]   that a lot of people like to have all the family members
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.400]   phones on the same carrier and on the same plan.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.600]   So that might be a really big mover into people switching--
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.640]   People adopting these.
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.920]   So there's so many people who are like a husband and wife.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.840]   They both want to be having the exact same phone.
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.240]   I was talking to a couple last night who was exactly like
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.280]   that.
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.680]   One of them is Matter Factor for Christmas.
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.640]   Got a gift card and was trying to figure out how to use
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.960]   it then if there's a ride, an iPhone.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.400]   Hey, we all get iPhones for the family.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.840]   Yeah, we do.
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.480]   So there's so many dimensions to this, especially with
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.280]   FaceTime as a way of sort of underscoring that it wouldn't
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.040]   be nice for everybody in this whole family to have not only
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.160]   the network that we've been having for a while, but also
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.400]   to have this new technology.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.760]   Does FaceTime matter anymore?
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.000]   I mean, you filed that report via Skype.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.840]   You can use 3G and Wi-Fi, which you can on FaceTime.
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.560]   You still have the same capabilities.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.240]   But it's Skype, so everybody can use it.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.040]   Isn't Skype kind of Trump FaceTime?
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.160]   Not really, because FaceTime is a button on the phone that
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.040]   appears every time you make a phone call.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.240]   Skype is an application that clever people have to tell you
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.800]   exist and then show you exactly how it works.
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.360]   So for us, clever people, it's moot.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.840]   I wasn't necessarily including myself in that.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.000]   Although I will say that this is the first time that I will
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.600]   be sending real love to Skype.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.120]   I said, "Nasty things about them in the past."
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.000]   That's the fact that I'm able to do this and be part of this
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.800]   show without having to bring the most big laptop, which I
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.400]   normally have to do just to do this.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.320]   This is a 100% iOS business trip.
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.440]   And I have a Skype, at least partially the thing for that.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.480]   That's pretty awesome, man.
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.800]   I think that Apple has missed an important window and is
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.320]   missing an important window with FaceTime as they--
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.560]   What could they have done to preserve their lead?
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.160]   They need to make it something that's widely available to
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.040]   developers to be able to incorporate FaceTime into
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.600]   their applications, incorporate it through Skype or
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.120]   whoever else.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.160]   But anybody who wants to build a video application, it should
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.080]   be easy.
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.320]   It should be a library that they can simply say, "And then I
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.720]   want to get a FaceTime call."
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.560]   And boom, I've got access to that.
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.920]   Rather than make it this kind of--
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.320]   I think the test case is going on too long.
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.160]   I think that's the thing that Apple has really missed the
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.000]   boat on.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.800]   And I don't know how--
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.520]   Tom, do you use FaceTime ever?
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.080]   No, I'm still on the 3GS.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.400]   Oh, Tom.
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.120]   You're like me, still back with Leopard.
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.720]   Well, I'm waiting for Verizon.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.840]   We can't use all the new--
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:54.320]   Were you?
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.160]   Will you switch?
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.320]   Oh, interesting.
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.560]   So we do have somebody else switch.
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.280]   Sure.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.880]   I'm ready.
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.800]   Like February 3rd?
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.800]   As soon as it's available.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.200]   I guess you have to wait till February 10th.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.720]   I think so.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.160]   Are you under contract?
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.760]   No, I waited.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:08.640]   See, so you're an example.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.920]   I've been eligible for a new phone since the force came out.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.960]   See, this is what's really interesting is I think there are
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.040]   a lot of people like Tom.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.360]   I think there is pent up demand.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.040]   It should be a better phone, because I actually make phone
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.360]   calls.
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.200]   That's crazy.
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.200]   That's why I'm waiting, Tom.
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.720]   I don't know.
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.440]   It should be a better phone if you say that it's the network.
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.640]   But it may be the hardware.
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.680]   Yeah, will you let me know?
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.880]   Sure.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.920]   Because I'm not buying it until Tom says it's OK.
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.800]   I'm waiting for you, dude.
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.240]   I'm waiting.
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.960]   And I'm getting one for Carly to associate.
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.200]   We'll have Tom's while I'm on.
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.480]   OK, well, we can make a phone call between him.
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.240]   So we'll have it up on the fence.
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.160]   They can FaceTime and everything.
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.200]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.880]   I don't believe I could be wrong.
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.880]   But I don't believe that the company that would say,
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.080]   let's start spreading out into TV.
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.360]   It's a business that we don't know a whole lot about.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.600]   And there really is no benefit for us to branch into it.
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.680]   But we can say that we're selling a TV set.
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.560]   They're the company that would correctly say,
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.440]   we don't care where you buy your TV from.
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.720]   We want to sell you the box.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.400]   It has the cool electronics in it that makes everything else
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.280]   that we sell with an Apple logo on it that much more valuable.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.200]   And which helps you increase-- turn the tap of money
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.840]   from your pocket into the iTunes store.
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.960]   Just turn it all the way to full blast now.
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.040]   I guess for me, though, I think that the last step, though,
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.320]   is the camera inside.
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.280]   I mean, I just want a 46-inch iMac.
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.040]   I mean, the thing is that it's-- or just iOS.
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.600]   I don't need it to have anything else.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.600]   But I feel like-- number one is I feel like the Apple TV, too.
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.160]   I'm waiting for them to open up the iOS
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.960]   so that we can actually use applications there.
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.240]   That's the ultimate little net box if they did that.
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.600]   Well, and John Louise points that out.
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.040]   He's saying, well, see what happens there.
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.360]   That's a $99 net box.
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:48.920]   Yeah.
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.200]   You know, the sun's very interesting.
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.120]   You know, with iOS.
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.240]   But I agree with Andy.
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.200]   I think that one of the reasons Apple's done so well,
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.200]   they've stuck to their knitting.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.280]   I looked at McDonald's.
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.960]   In the old days, they would make a ferry.
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.360]   Everybody else was making-- Dairy Queen
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.680]   had 300 of menu items.
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.400]   But John said, we do this, this, and this.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.760]   In fact, it really didn't all start
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.640]   to go to hell in a hand basket till the McRib.
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.600]   Isn't there actually a principle of neuroscience
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.520]   that says that increasing the number of options
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.160]   leads to poorer decisions and longer decisions
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:18.880]   rather than better?
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.000]   Yeah, but Apple didn't have phones.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.240]   There's actually-- no, that there's actually
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.320]   the hard top limit that if you give someone three options,
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.440]   they can make a good decision.
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.480]   If you give them five options, they'll take them four times
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.080]   as long and they'll make a bad one.
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.440]   I think this is one of the reasons.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.840]   I think they're very aware of that.
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.800]   There's actually a hard number, maybe even somewhere
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.000]   in Apple that says we cannot make more than X versions
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.200]   of this product.
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.440]   Too many skews.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.240]   I just think that to me, a TV is just such--
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.840]   it's like the last extension of the tiny iPhone,
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.680]   to the iPad, to a--
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.520]   Yeah, but it's such a trophy that you don't want to have.
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.520]   OK.
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:00.480]   I think that if Apple were to Sony and other companies
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.840]   would be old-fashioned enough to say that, well, we're not
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.440]   in the consumer electronics business,
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.520]   unless we sell a TV set and a console stereo.
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.880]   We can't-- our mommy won't love us and think we're successes
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.760]   unless we're selling a console stereo.
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.400]   With a record player.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.960]   And a room for records, not realizing that, well, actually,
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.720]   that's been years to same.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:20.920]   I'm kind of with Andy on that.
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.840]   But on the other hand, I'm not going to predict because I've
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.800]   never been able to predict what Apple's going to do.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.400]   We're taking our old iMacs, the 21 or 24-inch iMacs
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.880]   that we've been doing production for Mac Break-On.
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:30.840]   Because we've got-- Those are TVs.
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:31.400]   I know I understand.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.400]   And so we're putting them on the walls in Twit.
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.120]   I mean, in the new studio, we'll put them on the wall
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.240]   to manage schedules.
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:37.760]   Right.
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:42.080]   And the thing is, is that what I really want is an iOS version
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.280]   of that because I don't really need all of this to that.
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.400]   I guess here's the real point.
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.800]   The last-- I've bought a new TV.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.000]   I'm steadily replacing all the big CRT TVs in my house
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.960]   with LCDs, maybe, of course, of one a year.
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.000]   I think I replaced the last one this year.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.840]   And the first one cost me about $600.
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.040]   The second one a year and a half ago
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.800]   cost me something like 400 bucks.
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.120]   Last year, a TV that's just as good as the first one I bought
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.320]   cost me $213.
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.240]   And that's what Apple's seriously going
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.160]   to have to compete against.
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.040]   Because people are not going to-- the people who buy TVs
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.880]   are not looking for, oh, what's my XMLRPC?
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.800]   Yeah, but that's what they said about phones.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:19.840]   That's what they say about computers.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.200]   I mean, that's what Apple does is they create something--
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.880]   I said the same thing I said, don't get in the phone business.
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.440]   Here's a phone.
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.200]   That's a TV.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.680]   They're real different.
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.280]   I don't think it's a scalable--
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.800]   It's a scalable--
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:33.720]   You've made your point.
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.560]   We have to take a break.
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:34.960]   I want to--
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.400]   For God's sakes, people buy these things
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.520]   to watch "Mory Povich."
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.480]   Oh my god, who's my baby dad?
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.480]   Because this is not the same market as the people
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.200]   who are buying these things.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.880]   And that will be the final word.
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:50.240]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:50.840]   That's right.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.960]   I'm broadcasting today from the This Week in Tech Party
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:54.400]   van.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.560]   If you can guess where I am and come by and say the phrase
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:58.960]   that pays, well, what do you know?
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.800]   You'll get a free t-shirt or a free set of winter gloves
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.360]   that I use to knock the ice off of my car.
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:04.880]   Or you're going to--
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:05.240]   Yeah.
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.200]   You're going to get whatever we have
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:13.800]   in the lane around in the car.
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:14.800]   What else do you have there, Andy?
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.280]   What do you have for people here?
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:16.960]   Well, let's see.
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:22.400]   I got the Scotch tape, alkaline batteries.
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.760]   I've got a Beatles tape that my friend John sent me a while
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.720]   back.
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.080]   Don't have a tape deck H. Papermate Marker ordered the case
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.440]   that the cassette came in.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.800]   So all of this--
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.080]   I'm going to put this back into the prize treasure
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.040]   chest.
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.760]   And I'm walking the prize treasure chest.
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:44.760]   And that key is only going to be openable by the person who
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.080]   has the phrase that pays.
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:52.120]   So by all means, I am a heart parallic of internet radio
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.080]   promotion here.
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.160]   For those of you just tuning in over, those of you listening,
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.680]   we had some connectivity issues, but we've gotten it working
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:10:58.960]   now.
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:02.360]   And Andy is coming in via Skype on the iPhone.
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.000]   So this is working.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.840]   And it's looking remarkably stable.
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:08.680]   What are you using to attach your iPhone?
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.640]   I can't show you because I haven't disconnected it.
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:12.600]   This is the--
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:17.240]   OK, this is my favorite car mount for anything.
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.880]   This is the Ram Mount system.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:19.920]   I don't know if you can see that.
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:20.960]   There you go.
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:21.800]   This is cool.
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.800]   I'm using my rear view mirror to see the image.
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.080]   This is the next one.
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.720]   So yes, this is the Ram Mount system
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.040]   that I absolutely swear about.
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.600]   So that's got a sticky backing.
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.800]   Is that like a sticky backing?
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.800]   Well, this right here is my own little modification.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:40.080]   It's just the standard mounting pad with some Velcro on top of it.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.600]   The thing is, it's completely modular.
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.920]   So basically, this is component one, the big suction cup with
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.840]   sticks to anything and absolutely will not let go.
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.000]   The rocker arm right there.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.040]   And then you can basically buy anything you want to stick to
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.160]   the end of it.
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.520]   Ideally, you would probably go and buy a cuffed--
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.240]   an actual holder that they've developed specifically,
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.320]   specifically for the iPhone 4.
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.520]   But I tend to put so many things in and out of this thing
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:11.400]   that I just prefer to just put a pad of Velcro up there.
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:16.040]   But this does very much look like the Christmas message
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:18.720]   from Apollo 8.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.680]   And now we've given you--
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:24.320]   By moving the camera around, we've given you some more clues
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.920]   of where Andy might actually be.
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.880]   So possibly later in the show, we'll
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.880]   share you a couple more examples.
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:34.040]   And the question is, can you find Andy by the end of the show?
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.640]   Clue number one.
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:39.560]   You can hear a bell from here, but there's not an e-mailer.
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:40.800]   I have some bad news.
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:41.520]   What?
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.560]   The Mexican Coke is all gone.
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.880]   The Mexican Coke is all gone.
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:47.440]   We have this.
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.440]   So bring it over.
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:48.760]   We have this.
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.040]   This is coming to you right now.
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.440]   Is this made with true cane sugar?
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:56.320]   Can I have a straw for Mr. Inaka?
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.760]   No, that's fine.
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.920]   If it's not-- if it's some sort, if it's a tipsy,
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:01.920]   I really don't really want to do it.
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.480]   I didn't do it that way.
[00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.440]   As soon as you turned that up, I was expecting--
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.440]   Oh, shit.
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.760]   I was like, well, I didn't need that TV.
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.320]   In fact, not only was the top on there,
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.880]   but we had a good gas bubble built up.
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.560]   But I'm not going to drink out of the bottle.
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:14.640]   That's rude.
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:16.400]   And probably somebody else has already done that.
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:17.280]   Watch this.
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.120]   I just put it behind the TV, and it goes away.
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:19.880]   Dada!
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.760]   This is me putting my iPhone on a tripod.
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:23.280]   What the hell?
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.360]   Oh, FaceTime.
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:27.360]   In case we have to do the rest of this five FaceTime.
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.080]   I'm prepared.
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:31.640]   But I look at-- I think my wife is closer to normal.
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.400]   We got the back up.
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.240]   See, that got the microphone cut out like--
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.600]   You cut the fuck out.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:37.400]   I can see--
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.680]   I can see--
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.240]   There are squirrels out there right now whose face are like,
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.040]   oh, my, what?
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.720]   Such language.
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:47.240]   I think actually, you just had to scare it.
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:48.480]   You had to scare Skype with it.
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.960]   So now that that phone's off, his connection's going to be great.
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:54.320]   You just had the Skype ladies hiding underneath your desk
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.480]   right now, which is terrifying.
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.480]   She doesn't want anything to do with Andy.
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.160]   But I'm better now.
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:13:59.800]   I'm over it.
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:00.800]   I'm happy.
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:05.320]   So-- and then I love this idea of having an SSD plus a bigger
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.160]   drive for storage.
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.720]   That's what a hybrid drive essentially does.
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:11.280]   It gives you a boot part that's flash and then a big spinning
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.520]   part that's for capacity.
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:14.480]   Best of both worlds.
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.440]   So now we're talking about a laptop,
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:20.320]   because a sandy bridge that has fast graphics, but maybe
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:23.280]   a 10-hour battery life, has light peaks.
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:24.640]   So it's very thin.
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:26.000]   3G?
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.240]   No, no, no.
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.960]   Don't mess with thick.
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:29.560]   No.
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:30.960]   No, no.
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.920]   I think Apple's learned its phone company lesson at this point,
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:34.920]   don't you?
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:35.680]   Oh, man.
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:38.360]   I just find that that's like this really--
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:39.640]   my iPad.
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.840]   Now, I know I know I'm not supposed to be the big example.
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.000]   10 second boot time.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:43.520]   10 second.
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:44.480]   I just want to finish this thought.
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.400]   10 second boot time.
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.680]   I mean, this is the killer.
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.080]   This is-- you're exactly right, Andy.
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.200]   Otherwise, there's no pressure to upgrade,
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.120]   because we've got fast.
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:53.840]   I've got an I7.
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:54.560]   There's lots of memory.
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.560]   There's lots of hardware.
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:57.600]   There's no pressure to upgrade.
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.000]   Apple has to do something if they're
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.320]   going to get people to buy a new MacBook Pro that makes people
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:05.720]   go-- people like you, Alex, and you, Andy, and me go, huh?
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.040]   Because we're the only ones left buying them.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.080]   I mean, because everyone's-- no, I was saying,
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.680]   because everyone's buying the airs.
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.120]   I mean, the thing is, is that everybody
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.520]   had the air on this cruise.
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:16.760]   It was air or iPad.
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:19.240]   There were very few 15s or 17s.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.480]   OK, but that's a disproportionate sample.
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.560]   You're talking about people who are going to South America
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.320]   if we're cruised to Argentina.
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.320]   OK, you're right.
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:26.800]   Dead arctic.
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:28.040]   They're a little bit of an octave ring,
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.400]   the 17-inch MacBook that--
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.760]   By the way, never made it to Antarctica.
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:32.880]   The weather was bad.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.480]   What a surprise.
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:37.600]   You know, if I had really thought about it--
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.880]   so I asked the excursions director, Martin.
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:45.240]   Said, Martin, how many times has this excursion made to Antarctica?
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:46.240]   Any kind of fun for it around?
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.160]   He finally said none.
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:48.680]   Zero.
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.120]   So they put it on the-- they put it on the--
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.800]   $3,300.
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.120]   And they think about it.
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.520]   And you get to the-- OK, so I'm all dressed up in a snow suit.
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:00.120]   I mean, I was prepared for freezing weather, right?
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.480]   Argentina is 80 degrees and muggy.
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:06.200]   So I had basically a trunk full of garb
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.640]   that would cover any possibility.
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:11.120]   I've got ski pants on, hiking boots.
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:14.040]   I've got waterproof cortex all over me.
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:17.040]   I've got silk long underwear if you forgive the image.
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.960]   And I'm really-- I am loaded for bear.
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.560]   We get to the auditorium.
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:24.660]   There's 40 of us, including Woz, including many Mac maniacs,
[00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:25.880]   because these are the kind of people
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.280]   who want to go to Antarctica.
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:27.800]   We get there.
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:30.440]   They say, we go to the airport.
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:34.680]   They bring out an actor, because we never saw this guy again.
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:39.600]   And the guy says, this is the best pilot in all of Chile.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.960]   If these men says we can go, we can go.
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:44.200]   But if he says we cannot, we cannot.
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.680]   And the guy has a sheaf of papers, this thick.
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:47.920]   And he really looks the part.
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.120]   I think it must be a highly paid actor.
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.960]   And he looks-- and he's got the-- it's totally an act.
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.080]   He's got the thing.
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.240]   Somebody in the crew had said, I saw the 8th stamp on this.
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.200]   It was like 3 AM.
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.320]   This guy knows what's going to-- he's looking at the papers.
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:16:59.960]   Mm.
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.240]   Oh, mm.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.240]   I am sorry to report.
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:08.000]   We will not be going to Antarctica today.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.280]   So every-- and I got a picture.
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:12.080]   I put it on Twitter of Woz's in front.
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:15.120]   Everybody's like, we're very sad.
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:16.440]   And we're a little hot.
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:22.040]   So here's their-- and it says in the fine print,
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.880]   and if you can't get to Antarctica, which we've never done,
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.440]   we'll send you to Torrey Stelpines, which
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.640]   is a beautiful national park.
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.400]   And you can only get to by plane.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.200]   So we had the plane.
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.120]   We were stuck with the plane, because you can't cancel a plane
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.320]   at the last minute.
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.120]   The pilot's there.
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.160]   His point just--
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.120]   Just pile a new--
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.600]   They've paid for the actor pilot.
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.240]   So the actor pilot now has said his lunch.
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:41.840]   He leaves.
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.920]   We never see him again.
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.040]   Because he's not a pilot.
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:48.200]   I am the best bush pilot in all of Chile.
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:48.880]   So he leaves.
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:49.840]   He's done his job.
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:52.040]   It's probably the same papers every time.
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.720]   And then we get on the plane.
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.360]   They fly to Torrey Stelpines and drive us around
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:18:00.840]   on a bus for nine hours in our snow suits.
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.200]   You know, the only one who was comfortable-- you know
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.440]   who was comfortable?
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:04.040]   Woz.
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.120]   You know why?
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:08.840]   He's wearing a t-shirt and shorts to go to Antarctica.
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:10.720]   I think, evidently, he had talked to somebody,
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:12.040]   and they'd said, you know, they actually
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.400]   don't have to go to Antarctica.
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.400]   No, no, Woz says, I run hot.
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:19.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:19.920]   He's like, fine.
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:20.880]   And Woz says, no, that was great.
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:21.720]   I loved it.
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.480]   And Janet, his wife, is on the bus.
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:24.600]   We're all like--
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:25.920]   And we're Janet in this bus.
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:26.720]   And we can't move.
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:30.680]   It's like, you know, Cartman in our snow suits anyway.
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:31.600]   But not that I'm bitter.
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:36.800]   So OK, so I'm bitter about Skype.
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.400]   Leo's bitter about the Antarctica equidation.
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.680]   Alex, what are you bitter about?
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.080]   Alex, let's see.
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:45.240]   You know, I actually often show the shows here.
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.200]   I am very bitter.
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.240]   I'm a bitter man.
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.760]   Today, I just can't think of anything
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:52.160]   that I'm particularly bitter about.
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:54.440]   We were a bitter crew back then, weren't we?
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.320]   Hey, how about this?
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:57.880]   Apple versus Samsung.
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.960]   It was the fight of the year.
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:00.960]   Watch.
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:07.480]   Samsung, in fact, Apple was pretty outspoken.
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.960]   They say, they're copying our stuff.
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.480]   Slavishly copying.
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.480]   That's what they say.
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:15.000]   Slavishly copying and pervasively copying.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.560]   At one point, they say, the Samsung Galaxy S line
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.200]   might as well be an iPhone.
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.200]   What?
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.880]   They're not holding back with the Gorseman from Apple.
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.240]   Good point.
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:30.120]   So first up, we should say you're standing on this,
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.000]   is you are an attorney.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.400]   Are you practicing now?
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.520]   No, I've practiced for a long time.
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:36.680]   But I was a copy of an attorney.
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:37.920]   This was your field?
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.520]   Yeah, well, I'm not a patent attorney.
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:40.320]   I was a copy of an attorney.
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.040]   But I have a lot of patent attorney friends.
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:44.120]   I've been doing these breakdowns for a while.
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:45.560]   I feel like I know what I'm doing.
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.480]   And this isn't just a patent lawsuit.
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.280]   There's trademark in it, too.
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:50.840]   Right.
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:53.400]   It's actually really, really heavy weight.
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:57.000]   So if you look at how Apple sued HTC or how they sued
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.160]   Motorola or Nokia, it's a bunch of patents.
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:03.840]   And they're very fundamental system level patents.
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.320]   This is how the touchscreen works.
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:06.680]   This is how multi-touch works.
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.800]   All this very wonky technical stuff
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:12.640]   that normal human beings would not be able to figure out
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:13.880]   that first read.
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:17.440]   The this lawsuit is much more--
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.480]   you made your stuff look just like ours.
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.320]   And you made it look just like ours.
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:24.920]   And you did it intentionally so that people would be like,
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.160]   that is just like an Apple product.
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:27.200]   I'll just buy that instead.
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.200]   Listen to this.
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.680]   It's a lot of the lawsuit.
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:33.320]   Jury trial demand, complaint for patent infringement,
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:37.600]   federal false designation of origin, unfair competition,
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.920]   federal trademark infringement, state unfair competition,
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.680]   common law trademark infringement,
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.960]   and an unjust enrichment.
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:46.440]   Yeah.
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:47.960]   What's unjust enrichment?
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:51.400]   Unjust-- it's actually a catch all at the very end.
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:52.600]   So if everything else fails--
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:53.800]   So you got rich.
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:55.880]   If everything else fails, Apple can say, well,
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.160]   they took our stuff and made money on it in a way they shouldn't--
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:58.680]   Shumini.
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:01.800]   So that'll get wrapped up in a trademark infringement patent
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:02.000]   infringement.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.200]   Are they--
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.760]   That's like the last quiver or dying breath.
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.000]   The lawsuit is just--
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.160]   Are they asking for an injunction?
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.880]   Do they want to stop to halt sales?
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:11.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.600]   I mean, they're asking for the whole kit in kaboodle.
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:14.840]   They want them to stop sales.
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:18.040]   They want to be prevented from ever violating their patents
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:18.360]   again.
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:21.440]   And that's up and down Samsung supply chain and divisions.
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:24.720]   They want trouble damages for patent infringement.
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:26.800]   They want an accounting of Samsung's profits
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.360]   so they can figure out which were improper profits.
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.880]   They want money for corrective advertising.
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:35.000]   So the claim is that because they violated the trademarks
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.800]   and trade dresser products, that Apple has
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:41.280]   to do some additional advertising to restore their brand,
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.880]   essentially, and so they want money to restore their brand
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:44.360]   in that way.
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.560]   I mean, it's a long list of damages.
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:49.920]   But the damages at this point, if I was Apple's lawyer,
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:51.160]   I would list everything I could think of.
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.840]   I want everything I can think of because some of it
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.800]   will get whittled away by the court.
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.000]   Some of it will go whittled--
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.160]   if this ever gets to a jury, which would be years and years
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.440]   from now, some of it will get whittled away there.
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:04.400]   So the list of damages looks enormous
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.720]   and ridiculous now.
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.120]   But that's really the-- we're going
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.680]   to put everything in the kitchen sink in in hopes
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.040]   that we get 50% of it.
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.400]   So this is just typical.
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.680]   But now, here's something that's not typical.
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:18.080]   Apple is a big Samsung customer, more than $5 billion
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:21.680]   worth of Samsung components in 2010.
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:25.120]   At 5.7 billion, actually, it's really, really enormous number.
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:27.480]   But the thing about that is Samsung,
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:30.480]   we think about companies in sort of the American corporate
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:31.040]   sense, right?
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:33.440]   So Apple is incorporated in California,
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:36.400]   and it has Steve Jobs as a CEO and a board of directors,
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:37.960]   and everything flows down from them.
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.960]   Samsung is this Korean cable arrangement,
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.640]   which has relatively formed us.
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:45.320]   It's this enormous company that has multiple divisions
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:46.600]   with multiple division heads who are--
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.000]   They make bulldozers.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.880]   They make bulldozers and sinks.
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:50.400]   Yeah.
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.720]   Samsung Electronics, they have the consumer business
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:55.760]   and the manufacturing business.
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.600]   There's got to be some relationship between the two.
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:58.640]   I wanted to touch on this.
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:02.920]   But quite frankly, I'm not an expert in Korean business
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:05.440]   structure, and I didn't want to speculate too heavily
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.840]   on how this might affect Samsung.
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:10.640]   So you're saying the components that Apple buys from Samsung,
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:17.360]   the 4% of their income, maybe a different division.
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:20.120]   So maybe that division will just say, oh, that's fine.
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.720]   Go ahead and sue those sons of customers.
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.320]   As far as I know, Samsung and mobile,
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:25.760]   when they go out to design a phone,
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:28.520]   they have to bid on processors just like Apple does.
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:31.280]   And they have to bid on displays and RAM and all that stuff.
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:34.000]   So you see Samsung phones, the Tegra processors,
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.960]   the Qualcomm processors in them, the Samsung's Windows Phone
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:41.280]   products, Microsoft said, you have to use Qualcomm processors,
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:42.720]   and they went out and did it.
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:46.280]   So there's a bit of a division just because of the structure.
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:48.520]   And like I'm saying, I didn't want
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:51.520]   to get too far down this road because I'm not
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.200]   an expert on Korean business organization.
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:56.880]   But there is a distinct division between the elements
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:57.840]   of Samsung's business.
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.120]   And I don't think Apple is worried
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:03.320]   about disturbing the relationship with Samsung's semiconductor
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:05.600]   because they're in a flight with Samsung.
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.880]   You have to think that they've factored into it.
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.040]   But there is also that element of, well, they just
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:10.680]   do Samsung.
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.640]   And I bet these guys have lunch together,
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:15.000]   and they're not happy about it as they come.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.120]   Well, look at the-- this is part of the complaint.
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:23.920]   Apple's filing, comparing iPhone to the Galaxy S,
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.120]   there's some merit in this.
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:26.480]   I mean, if you look at them side by side,
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:27.920]   but all smartphones look like iPhones.
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.440]   What would you think about this as like a Gucci bag?
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:32.880]   I mean, Gucci goes after people who basically make bags that
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:35.080]   look exactly like Gucci.
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:35.600]   It's the same.
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:38.240]   The idea is that we've created a certain look.
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.600]   We've created a certain experience that--
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:42.440]   and if you make one that looks exactly the same,
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:43.840]   that's counterfeiting.
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.440]   That's the argument that--
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.640]   Is this counterfeiting?
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.440]   No, you're not posing as an iPhone.
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.440]   Go on those days, tablets.
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:54.000]   I mean, once you decide that your design
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.280]   conceit is going to be no buttons as little decoration
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.040]   as possible, can you possibly now say
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:02.400]   that you have a design trademark on the idea of simplicity?
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:05.120]   I mean, yes, this looks exactly-- these look almost exactly
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:07.680]   like iPads, but can you really say that the fact that it's
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.920]   a black square of glass without any buttons on it,
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.320]   that that's something that Apple has--
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:12.680]   But I think the problem--
[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:14.680]   I think if that's all they did, I don't think that'd be a problem.
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.920]   And I'm not the expert on this panel.
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:19.160]   But I would say that when you start making the interface
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:22.360]   look identical to the iPad experience as well,
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:25.560]   that's when things start to get stickier.
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:25.880]   Right.
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:27.160]   So I mean, if you look at--
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.000]   there are a million ways to design a phone.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.640]   I mean, first of all, you can look at the market,
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.800]   and you can even look at some of Samsung's products.
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:36.520]   And you can see there are a million ways to design a phone.
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:39.480]   And if you look at, again, Apple suits against Motorola,
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:40.440]   HTC.
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:41.800]   They didn't do this trade dress stuff.
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.240]   They didn't do this trademark stuff.
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:46.360]   They focused very deeply on sort of core Android system
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:47.680]   patterns.
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:51.520]   It's when you-- because if you look at Motorola's blur or HTC
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.720]   sense, those interfaces are totally different.
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.360]   If you look at the Droid X, it just
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:56.480]   doesn't look like an iPhone.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:58.920]   If you look at an HTC, what's the new one?
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:01.280]   The sensation just doesn't look like an iPhone.
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.840]   Well, they all have big panels of glass.
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:04.440]   Well, no, because--
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:05.880]   They all have home, well, like I said--
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:09.760]   It's just sort of an in total kind of equation, right?
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:11.600]   It's not-- I have panel of glass,
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:16.160]   and you add it up to these icons, and the back is black.
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:17.200]   That's not how this works.
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.880]   The sort of--
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.440]   So you don't think this challenges Android?
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:23.880]   It's not-- there's a bit of Android.
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.480]   The patent challenges are Android.
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:29.600]   But the trademark stuff, that's all about when a consumer
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:33.800]   walks into a Verizon store, and the guy says,
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:37.400]   we don't have the iPhone yet, but this fascinate from Samsung
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:38.240]   is basically an iPhone.
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:38.960]   It looks just like one.
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.800]   It works just like one by this instead.
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.760]   And the consumer is like, yeah, that looks like an iPhone.
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:44.120]   They walk at the door.
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:45.280]   That's the problem, right?
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:46.320]   And that's what Apple's getting at,
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.840]   is you are basically copying our products
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:50.560]   in order to get people to buy them,
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:52.080]   because what they really want is an iPhone.
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:53.640]   What about this image?
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:57.320]   What about this image that was just sent to us from our chatroom?
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.760]   This is a Samsung F700.
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:01.280]   I just came everywhere.
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.800]   This has been sent to me like 500.
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:06.520]   OK, so this came out--
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:09.240]   well, it was released February 2007.
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:10.600]   The iPhone came out January 2.
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:13.200]   Clearly, this had a bit of a design before the iPhone came out.
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:16.000]   This is the kind of thing they show in court, right?
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.040]   No.
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:18.040]   No.
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:19.920]   I mean, yeah, I mean, sure.
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.760]   This image is like doctored, right?
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.800]   That wasn't Samsung advertising for it.
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.400]   And that hand image--
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:26.040]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:27.960]   But the phone's the same?
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.200]   No, but the phone isn't the same.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:33.160]   So if you look at the design patents and what they have,
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.040]   the patents say have specific claims.
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:36.040]   Let me see what you're saying.
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:37.920]   One up here.
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.720]   So this isn't germane, then.
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.240]   It's germane in that, yeah, there
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.560]   were other touchscreen phones like this.
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:46.440]   And Apple's complaint is very histrionic
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.360]   in saying that they completely invented
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:50.520]   the idea of a phone, right?
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:52.680]   But that's like Apple, you know?
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:56.800]   If you look at the design patent or the trade dress--
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:58.680]   let me try to bring this up here.
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:00.600]   If you look at the specific trade dress elements
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:06.040]   that Apple's claiming, which I am trying to find--
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:07.840]   so you've got rectangular products
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:10.080]   you have with four corners that you've formally rounded,
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:11.960]   substantial blackboarders above and below,
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:13.280]   which you don't have there.
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:16.040]   I mean, you have the casing, but they're not part of the glass.
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.280]   You have a metallic surround.
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:19.240]   You have a grid of colorful square icons,
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:20.440]   which you don't have there.
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.760]   Those are not colorful.
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:22.760]   OK.
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:24.840]   I mean, you have four icons on the bottom,
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:27.600]   the springboard that are application icons that don't change.
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.800]   I mean, this is like the technical nitty
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.640]   gritty of what they're after.
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:35.080]   And I don't think that this is trade dress.
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:39.520]   So a lot of this hinges on what do consumers perceive
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:41.200]   when they look at this thing, right?
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.360]   Do they think it's an iPhone?
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:45.240]   And it doesn't matter if it came before or it came after.
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.800]   So in court, you would hold this thing up.
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:49.200]   And the ordinary consumer in the market would say, oh,
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:50.280]   that's an iPhone.
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:53.200]   Even though it came out, you know, whatever, six months before,
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:57.560]   the action in the marketplace has been such that consumers now
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:00.800]   associate that product with the iPhone and with Apple.
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:02.680]   And that's really the crux of it, right?
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:05.680]   I mean, that's the first thing Apple is arguing
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:08.600]   is that Samsung is taking our relationship with consumers
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:11.240]   and they're trading on it by copying the things that
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:13.720]   indicate to consumers this is an Apple product,
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:15.680]   this is an iPhone, this is an iPad.
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:16.960]   I have to say, what I'm going to do is--
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.040]   Does this image--
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:20.200]   This image that I'm showing right now is from your website.
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:22.400]   This is mynext.com.
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:26.960]   And that is pretty striking.
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:28.760]   There is a lot of similarity there.
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:31.680]   You know, we say it all the time.
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:34.000]   I think what's really telling about this is, you know,
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.920]   there are Android fanboys in this world who are very
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:38.600]   vehement about Android doing everything right
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.120]   and Google doing everything right.
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:42.680]   And even amongst them, and even the feedback I've gotten
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:45.040]   from them has been, yeah, Samsung probably
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:46.760]   went too far here, touch with as well as that.
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:49.280]   Or so than other Android phones?
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:50.440]   Yeah, almost completely so.
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.720]   Now, if you talk to HTC, if you talk to Motorola,
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.720]   they're trying to do something different.
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:57.120]   They're trying to meaningfully differentiate their products
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:58.520]   away from Apple, right?
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:01.160]   If you look at HTC Sense, it is totally different.
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:03.760]   It's got all these widgets and active wallpapers
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.680]   and integrates with your social networks.
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.680]   And Motorola does kind of the social and everything
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:09.280]   with Blur and it got their own widgets.
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:10.880]   And they're out there.
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:12.920]   They are doing something completely different.
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:15.200]   You know, that's sort of what the patent system is designed
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.240]   to make you do, right?
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.560]   It says, OK, well, Apple did the grid.
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:20.760]   So now everybody has to try to do something different.
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:24.600]   And in some way, that's supposed to push innovation forward.
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:27.200]   Apple did something similar with Microsoft
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:30.480]   over the recycled bin.
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:31.640]   This was some time ago.
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:33.920]   So that was a long time ago, it was the '90s,
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:34.720]   a long time ago.
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.320]   And what happened in that suit?
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:37.520]   So that was a copyright suit.
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:40.240]   And Apple's entire strategy there was flawed.
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.000]   I think they learned a lot from it.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.440]   So Microsoft released Windows 3.1.
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:47.960]   And they had a license to some parts of the Mac OS interface,
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:51.680]   like the original system 6, system 7 interface.
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:53.800]   And Apple said, well, you had a license to some parts,
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:55.200]   but you took the whole thing.
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:31:00.000]   And we will claim a copyright to the whole thing.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.960]   The look and feel of Mac OS will kind of copyright to it.
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:06.640]   And the court said, well, that's not how copyright works.
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:07.280]   And you lose.
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:09.280]   And that took 10 years for the court to do that.
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:10.360]   It took a long time, I remember.
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:11.080]   It took a long time.
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:12.480]   And it was doomed from the start.
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:15.480]   I don't think just reading it's done in any sense.
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.480]   They're not claiming anything like that.
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:20.160]   Now they're claiming, again, it's all
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:21.800]   about the relationship with the consumer.
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:25.160]   They're claiming, you know, you made your trading
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:27.440]   on the elements of our interface, our packaging,
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:30.400]   our hardware, our software that say to consumers,
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.880]   it signaled the consumers, this is an iPhone.
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:35.600]   You do a great job of comparing icons in your article.
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:37.320]   Again, this is my next.com.
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:37.840]   The phone, the text.
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:39.440]   You know, this is right from Apple.
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.320]   This is Apple stuff.
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:45.320]   The picture gallery, even the settings button is a gear--
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:48.480]   I think the most telling one, whatever, to keep.
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:51.520]   I think the most telling one is the bottom, the music player.
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:54.600]   So in the middle there is the Samsung's TouchWiz
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:55.880]   music player icon.
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:59.000]   And on the left is the iOS iTunes icon.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.240]   And on the right is the sort of desktop windows and OS10
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:03.240]   iTunes icon.
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:04.040]   And it's the same.
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:06.080]   I mean, that's a copy.
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:09.400]   And iTunes is like one of the most powerful brands,
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:11.400]   media brands, in the world.
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:14.760]   And to rip off that icon basically says to consumers,
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:15.640]   oh, this is music.
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:17.800]   This is iTunes on my Samsung device.
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:20.440]   And that's not a lab.
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:21.560]   There's like, fine, whatever.
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:22.240]   It's a phone icon.
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:23.480]   It's green, whatever.
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:25.960]   When you rip off the icon of the most powerful media company
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:28.560]   or powerful media brand in the world, which is iTunes,
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:29.760]   you are really treading on the engine.
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:30.480]   Yeah, ready.
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.600]   So it sounds like not only do you
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:35.320]   think that this suit has merit, but you
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:40.760]   think that Apple will be successful.
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:41.880]   I know it's unpredictable.
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:44.240]   Success is a murky thing to define a lawsuit, right?
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.920]   70% of cases settle.
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:48.280]   And like we've been saying, Apple and Samsung
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:51.920]   are huge partners in many more ways than they are competitors.
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:54.240]   Apple can't make the A4 or A5 processor.
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:55.160]   That Samsung's helped.
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:58.080]   I mean, there are vanishingly few other foundries in the world
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:01.000]   that can do it at that scale and at that cost.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.600]   So what's success?
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:07.920]   I think success for Apple is Samsung stops making touch
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:09.720]   with this look exactly like iOS.
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:12.360]   Samsung starts to be more innovative, right?
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.960]   And that's kind of like success for the consumer as well.
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:17.120]   I mean, if the end result of this is that Samsung has to go
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:19.320]   and make touch was better and start making phones that
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:22.360]   don't look like the iPhone, that's kind of a win, right?
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:24.000]   I mean, because then the people who want an iPhone can go
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.400]   by an iPhone and the people who want something new and different
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:28.360]   can go by whatever Samsung makes next.
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:29.360]   And so we'll see.
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:31.880]   I mean, there's people hate patents.
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:33.360]   People on the internet particularly hate
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:36.000]   the idea of ownership, which I think is very funny.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.120]   And they hate the idea that Apple can own a messaging icon.
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:41.840]   And there's a certain aspect of that that's true.
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:43.720]   I mean, it feels ridiculous.
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:47.040]   But at the end of the day, they're just using the,
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:48.960]   you know, they're availing themselves with the resources
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:49.960]   of our society, right?
[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:50.960]   Which is bad.
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:51.960]   This is what you do.
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:52.640]   Very popular protection, right?
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:56.040]   So whatever, they're doing it and those systems are designed
[00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:58.040]   to make companies actually compete.
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:00.640]   And I think we're all better off if, you know, whatever,
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:02.560]   Apple wins or they settle or whatever it is.
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:04.440]   We're actually all kind of better off if Samsung
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:06.440]   stops copying Apple in touch ways.
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:08.800]   And they start doing their own thing because that will
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.160]   force Apple to better the next time.
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:11.840]   I mean, let me make the opposite argument,
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:13.080]   a little bit of the opposite argument,
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:15.960]   which is that all of these user interfaces and designs
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.480]   and everything are influenced by the other.
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:19.920]   I mean, this Windows lawsuit, for instance,
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:21.720]   yeah, Windows looks a lot like Macintosh.
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:24.320]   But that was good for Windows users
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:27.080]   that there was some consensus about how to do a GUI.
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:30.120]   Wouldn't want something con vastly different.
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:33.160]   I don't, the real, I guess it correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:37.280]   anyway, but it strikes me that the crux of this is,
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:42.280]   is Samsung trying to succeed by tricking consumers?
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:45.120]   - Yes, that is, I mean, you got it, that's the not, right?
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:46.680]   I mean, that's fundamentally it, they're saying--
[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:50.120]   - They could be inspired by it as long as that's okay.
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:51.440]   - Right, well, yeah, right.
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:53.560]   I mean, that's why the Motorola student,
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:56.040]   and the HTC student, the Nokia suit and whatever,
[00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:58.480]   all those other Apple Android lawsuits,
[00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:02.240]   those are all about very technical underlying system patents,
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.080]   right?
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:04.080]   How did you make the computer work?
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:06.280]   How are you addressing the RAM, all that stuff?
[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:08.280]   This is about, I mean, that stuff is in here,
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:09.720]   but it's almost the foundation.
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:12.400]   The meat of the lawsuit, the front half of the lawsuit,
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:15.480]   is all about stop pretending to be Apple.
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:18.080]   - Well, let me ask, maybe this is the wrong audience,
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:22.640]   but come on, Alex Lindsay, would you accidentally buy
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:26.000]   a Samsung Galaxy S thinking it was an iPhone?
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.200]   - But I could see my parents doing that.
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.040]   - Really?
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:29.160]   - I could see my parents not knowing the difference
[00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:30.160]   between these two--
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:32.560]   - Oh, honey, it looks just like an iPhone.
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.200]   - Yeah, I could definitely see my parents
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:37.680]   walking into Verizon store and walking out thinking
[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:39.480]   that they've got something that was just like the iPhone.
[00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:40.320]   - I don't think so.
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:43.600]   - But I can't imagine even the most technically--
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:44.920]   - No, I haven't touched the person.
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:45.960]   - I haven't heard this so many times.
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:46.960]   But you haven't heard this?
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:49.720]   The Galaxy S on Verizon, fascinating, right?
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:51.800]   Well, before the iPhone came to Verizon,
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:53.320]   people wanted a Verizon phone.
[00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:55.200]   They had Verizon contracts, they were happy with the service,
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.320]   whatever, and they would go into the store and say,
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:59.280]   "Is the iPhone out in Verizon yet?"
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:01.440]   And the salesmen would say, "No, it's not gonna be out.
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:02.560]   "Maybe it'll come later.
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:04.240]   "Right now we have The Fascinate,"
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:06.400]   which is designed to be just like the iPhone.
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:08.980]   (upbeat music)
[00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:12.760]   - Steve Jobs, the Opera.
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:14.040]   - The Prom-- the Prom--
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.240]   - Exactly, you could do that.
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:16.920]   Zuckerberg, as--
[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:20.920]   - Rounded corners, you must have rounded corners.
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:21.920]   - I'm sorry, this is--
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:24.360]   (laughing)
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:26.400]   I can't, I almost launched into a song
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.280]   that would have gotten us the explicit tag, but--
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:29.120]   - Oh, go ahead.

[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:35.320]   I don't wanna go to the hotel.
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:37.240]   (laughing)
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:39.840]   - No, that's it, it's downhill from here, go ahead.
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:41.240]   - Yeah, we think that in a mall,
[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:42.680]   they should just release lions,
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:44.400]   so that if you're gonna be wasting time there anyway,
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:45.600]   you should have to risk your life.
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.200]   - Yeah, make it more exciting.
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:48.760]   - Louis C.K., at least in front of Louis C.K.
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:51.000]   - I do think lions like to hunt gazelles.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.800]   - That was a joke.
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:56.200]   - That was a joke.
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:57.640]   - I was afraid I was up very early this morning.
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:58.560]   - Did you write this in?
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:37:59.720]   - I put my stuff, well, I was--
[00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:01.160]   - If you wanna get a gazelle,
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:03.560]   it's key to think ahead of the gazelle.
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:04.840]   Where will it go?
[00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:05.840]   Did you write this?
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:06.760]   (laughing)
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:08.280]   What were you on?
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:10.120]   How can you let it think it's getting away
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:12.360]   while it's working towards one of your compatriots?
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:13.920]   Watch the gazelle for a few days.
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:16.760]   You'll see the cynical nature of its roaming.
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:19.160]   It's not random, scare it,
[00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:21.360]   and it will run that circle quickly.
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:23.560]   Have a partner waiting on that circle,
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:26.160]   and nom, nom, nom, lion is happy.
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.520]   (laughing)
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:29.600]   What the hell were you smoking, Alex Lindsay?
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:31.320]   - It was like five o'clock in the morning
[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:32.440]   I was working on the notes,
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:33.680]   and I noticed that Andy was there,
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:34.960]   and I was hoping he was gonna react,
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:36.600]   and so I kept typing. - That's pretty great.
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:39.080]   - And actually gave us instructions for hunting gazelles.
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:41.760]   - Exactly, that's-- - There they are.
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:46.000]   Now watch, that gazelle will go exactly the same way,
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.040]   each time, so make sure you've stationed another lion
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:50.080]   right where he's headed.
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:51.000]   - See, there they go.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.320]   - Go gazelles, go.
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:53.320]   - Oh no, no, no.
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:55.080]   - There it comes-- - There's another lion
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:57.200]   waiting on the other side.
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:59.920]   Sorry gazelles, not this time.
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:01.520]   - No, no, no, no. - I was just hoping
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:03.640]   to not embarrass you and everybody that--
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:05.760]   You stole that tip from Wayne Gretzky.
[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:06.600]   (laughing)
[00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:08.160]   - That's right, go where the fuck is headed.
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:10.320]   - Go where the gazelle is going to be,
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:12.080]   don't go where the gazelle is.
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:14.400]   - That's right, that's the Wayne Gretzky gazelles,
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:16.280]   and there they are, happy lions,
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:18.800]   you know I'm showing gazelle sandwiches for dinner.
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:22.680]   Thank goodness they hit the gazelle in the bush.
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:24.160]   (laughing)
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:25.280]   Is that a dog in there?
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.120]   What is that?
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:26.960]   - Really, really?
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:27.800]   - Looks like people are.
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:30.160]   - Looks like there's a German shepherd in with a lion.
[00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:32.640]   Get out of there, there's a little leg sticking out of there.
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:33.480]   All right.
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:38.640]   And now we return from Olde Weigorg for a tip from Andy Inaco.
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:41.640]   - Oh, oh, oh, well I hope you're enjoying
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:44.880]   this very special best of Mac break weekly.
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.600]   We're gonna have more in a moment, but you know,
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:49.280]   there are some people we really have to thank
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:53.040]   for making 2011 a Happy Jolly Prosperous Year
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:54.920]   for the Twit family.
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:58.560]   And number one on the list always, audible.com.
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:01.800]   Without Audible, there really wouldn't be this new
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:04.320]   Twit Brick House and all of the great things
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:05.400]   we've done this year.
[00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:08.480]   Audible, as you know, is an amazing bookstore,
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:13.480]   audiobooks, 100,000 audiobooks in every category.
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:15.400]   Lots of good holiday books too, you know,
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:17.400]   if you haven't picked out a book for the family
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:20.240]   to listen to, maybe a New Year's Eve story,
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:22.960]   you'll find them all at Audible, thrillers, fiction,
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:24.480]   non-fiction.
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:26.400]   So there's lots of great tech titles as well.
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:29.040]   Here's the deal, if you go to Audible,
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.400]   you know what, I have to find the name.
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:34.000]   There it is, audible.com/macbreak.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.080]   Boy, that was tricky, wasn't it?
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:37.080]   Couldn't have figured that out.
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:40.040]   Audible.com/macbreak, you'll be signing up
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:42.840]   for the gold account, that's a book a month,
[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:46.680]   but you're first month's free and your first book's free.
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:49.160]   You can cancel at any time at absolutely no charge to you
[00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:51.760]   and your book will be yours to keep forever.
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:53.240]   So that's a pretty good deal.
[00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:57.760]   I really think that if you haven't yet tried Audible,
[00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:58.800]   you really must.
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:03.280]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:07.400]   And now we go back to the best of Macbreak weekly.
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:10.160]   What are we doing on this one?
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:11.000]   - I've had two.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.560]   - Oh, there was a kind of a big product announcement this year.
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:17.280]   We were at Austin for South by Southwest,
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:19.640]   and Apple released the iPad too.
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:21.480]   Let's see that original announcement.
[00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:24.060]   (upbeat music)
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:29.600]   Good morning.
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:33.360]   (audience cheering)
[00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:34.360]   Thanks for coming.
[00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:35.840]   (audience cheering)
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:36.680]   Thank you.
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:39.680]   (audience cheering)
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:43.520]   Thank you.
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:46.520]   (audience cheering)
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:48.240]   Thank you.
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:51.240]   (audience cheering)
[00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:53.720]   Thank you.
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:56.720]   (audience cheering)
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:42:02.200]   We've been working on this product for a while
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:03.840]   and I just didn't want to miss today.
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:07.640]   So thank you for having me.
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:12.200]   And we got something great to announce today.
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:15.920]   We're going to introduce today iPad 2.
[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:18.440]   The second generation iPad.
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:21.440]   (audience cheering)
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:25.680]   So, what is iPad 2?
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:26.520]   What have we learned?
[00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:28.520]   What can we improve?
[00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:31.920]   Well, it is an all new design.
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:33.600]   It is not a tweak design.
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:35.880]   It's not got marginal improvements.
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:39.000]   It's a completely new design.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.080]   And the first thing is, it's dramatically faster.
[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:46.040]   We have a new chip.
[00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:47.760]   We call A5.
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:50.520]   Our chip wizards have come up with this.
[00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:52.600]   And it's great.
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:55.320]   It's dual core processors.
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:57.120]   All right, two processors inside.
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:43:01.880]   And so we get up to twice as fast on CPU performance.
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:06.000]   But we've really gone all out on the graphics performance.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.920]   Up to nine times faster graphics.
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:12.120]   The graphics in this thing are wonderful.
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:16.720]   Same low power as A4.
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:18.520]   We don't want to give up any of that.
[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:20.280]   Legendary battery life.
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:23.920]   And even though others are starting to ship,
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:25.600]   I think this is going to be the first
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:28.360]   dual core tablet to ship in volume.
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:32.120]   So A5 is really a quite an achievement.
[00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:34.720]   And it's going to give us something that's up to twice
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:39.200]   as fast on CPU performance, up to nine times faster on graphics.
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:41.640]   And the first iPad was no slouch.
[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:45.120]   All right, Andy, you are thorough.
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:48.480]   You are a professional trained journalist.
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:53.120]   You know how to take something like the new iPad 2,
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:54.720]   how to hold it in your hands,
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:56.960]   how to, you're not like John C. Devorek,
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:58.720]   who looks at the box and reviews it.
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:01.560]   You actually take it out of the box and review it.
[00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:04.000]   - Well, it's that small,
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.320]   there's those little details that will really,
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:07.160]   really set the box.
[00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:08.160]   - He goes the extra mile.
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:09.000]   He actually-
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.520]   - Sometimes I even charge it before I drop it.
[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:13.200]   (laughing)
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:14.040]   - Well, that's just crazy.
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:15.960]   - One thing I should point out is that it comes almost fully charged,
[00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:18.160]   which is really a nice thing.
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:19.080]   So you don't,
[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:21.360]   but the other thing I'd like to point out,
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:22.760]   I got mine, you know,
[00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:25.000]   I lean weighted in line at the pop-up store in Austin.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.760]   They had us, it was just really cool.
[00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:28.320]   Only sold iPads.
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:30.000]   And she brought it to me.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:30.840]   I was so excited,
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:32.560]   it was at the Citrix breakfast actually.
[00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:35.000]   I turned it on and it said connect to iTunes.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.880]   And I thought, oh, I can't use it till I get back to my room.
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:40.320]   So you still have to connect it to a computer.
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:43.160]   We are not completely in the post-PC era.
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:45.080]   - It's still, it's not a paperless office quite yet.
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:45.920]   No.
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:48.520]   - I guess the store would activate it if you ask them, but.
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:51.720]   - I don't know if they do that
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:52.680]   'cause remember that it has,
[00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:56.040]   linking to your desktop also gives you backups
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:57.960]   and also gives you your connection to the iTunes store.
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:59.280]   - But you couldn't say to them,
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:02.680]   look, I don't have a computer and I still want an iPad?
[00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:04.480]   - I do not know, I should probably find that out.
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:05.920]   - That's an interesting thing.
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:07.320]   My guess would be no,
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:09.920]   because you certainly wouldn't want the-
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:11.600]   - I believe they will activate it.
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:12.440]   - I'll activate it.
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:14.480]   - They probably would do something like say, well, dude,
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:17.160]   you know you're not gonna be able to back it up.
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:19.280]   'Cause you can buy apps directly on the iPad.
[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:22.920]   You can get music on the iPad, but I think they will activate.
[00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:25.240]   Yeah, the chat room saying they will activate it.
[00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:30.240]   - And also one of the parts of my sort of insights
[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:32.560]   as I've been playing for the past few days
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:36.480]   is that Apple has really turned an interesting corner
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:39.600]   on the iPad in that they weren't complete.
[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:41.240]   I don't think they were completely sure
[00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:43.360]   about how people would relate to it
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:44.600]   after they released it.
[00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:48.320]   And they were ready to open up one of three different envelopes
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:49.160]   (laughs)
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:51.560]   after the end of six months to decide
[00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:54.520]   what path are we gonna take with this?
[00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:57.720]   And they decided to go really gutsy and say,
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:00.120]   this is not an accessory to another computer.
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:02.280]   This is a computer in and of itself.
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:04.000]   And it's a destination computer.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.480]   We want you to think about doing movies on it.
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:09.800]   We want you to think about using all your presentations,
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:11.240]   all your work processing off it.
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:13.920]   We also wanna make sure that no matter what you wanna hook it up to
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:16.120]   and use it with, you'll be able to use it with that.
[00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:18.080]   So this is, I think Apple,
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:20.120]   if you thought that Apple was pretty strong
[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:22.960]   about the iPad in 2010, I think in 2011,
[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:24.720]   you're gonna see them being even more aggressive.
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:27.280]   They're gonna go, I think they stopped going
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:28.960]   after the netbooks and this year,
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:31.840]   they're gonna start going after notebooks with the iPad.
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:33.000]   - I understandably so.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.960]   I mean, that was clear in Steve's presentation
[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:37.280]   when he said post PC era.
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:38.120]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:41.320]   - He said, he basically declared victory.
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:44.080]   He said, well, unfortunately,
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:45.560]   with that old statement, it's not bragging
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:46.880]   if it's actually true.
[00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:50.840]   It's, no, all the competition got completely papered
[00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:54.680]   with this, I was trying to, twice now,
[00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:58.000]   I've tried to figure out how to write pieces about the iPad
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.120]   to in which it doesn't sound as though I have totally drunk
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:06.160]   Apple's Kool-Aid, at least on the iPad's front.
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:09.960]   There is, I've written, I wrote a piece that was published
[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:12.760]   on yesterday, I believe, that was just talking about,
[00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:14.600]   oh, here is the, here's the state of tablets,
[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:16.400]   here's which iPad you might hear,
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:17.920]   here are all the feet, if you're thinking about getting
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:21.320]   an iPad in about three months when there's more to purchase,
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:23.080]   here's the model to buy, here's what's coming out
[00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:24.960]   from other manufacturers in the next year.
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:27.640]   And there was just, there's just nothing coming out
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:31.240]   in 2011 that is going to be in any way competitive
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:32.080]   with the iPad.
[00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:33.920]   If you're talking about something that looks like this
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:36.080]   and fills the exact same role of an iPad,
[00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:38.760]   there is nothing on the market that even merits
[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:39.840]   basic consideration.
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:40.680]   - Oh, no, what's this?
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:42.520]   - He's in that premature to say that, I mean,
[00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:43.440]   - No, it isn't, no it isn't.
[00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:45.240]   - I haven't seen the playbook.
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:48.000]   - I have seen him use the playbook.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.440]   - Why are you laughing?
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:51.640]   You don't think it's even possible that Blackberry
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:52.480]   could be, okay.
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:54.280]   - No, no, actually, yeah.
[00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:56.640]   - It actually thinks it's absurd to even
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:59.440]   - It's say that the technical term is preposterous.
[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:01.440]   - Okay, and the zoom, and you have a zoom, I presume.
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:03.800]   - Here's the problem is I've had a bunch of Blackberry
[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:07.240]   like touchable, like screen, you know, screen type phones.
[00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:09.880]   And they were so far from usable
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:13.040]   that it kind of exited my, even my reality.
[00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:13.880]   - Okay, so that's that.
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:15.200]   - So zoom, no.
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:17.720]   - Stop, wait, wait, let's go back to the playbook.
[00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:19.600]   Now, I actually called that one out as,
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:21.920]   if there's any one tablet that's not made by Apple
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:25.080]   that I'm optimistic or interested or slash optimistic about,
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:28.800]   it is the playbook because it's the one tablet
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:31.480]   coming out in 2011 where it's clear that they're not
[00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:32.680]   trying to make an iPad.
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:34.640]   They're trying to make something different.
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:37.120]   I think one of the smartest things that Blackberry did
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:39.640]   was listen very, very carefully when Steve Jobs
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:42.280]   railed about, oh, seven-inch tablets are stupid.
[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:44.080]   There's no way it can possibly work.
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:46.520]   They're gonna die, die, die, die, die.
[00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:49.480]   And Blackberry, they said, okay, so Apple is definitely
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:52.040]   not gonna make a seven-inch, no, seven-inch tablet.
[00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:54.880]   Let's make ourselves a really good seven-inch notebook,
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:57.600]   tablet, and I only had about a half hour of time
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:59.080]   with a working playbook so far.
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:00.400]   But I like what I saw it.
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:01.240]   - I did too.
[00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:04.200]   - But it was quite impressive, it multi-test beautifully.
[00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:06.040]   Where they're gonna have problems is what Steve Jobs
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:08.040]   pointed out already with Honeycomb is that
[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:10.640]   there is the app ecosystem.
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:11.480]   I mean, it's--
[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:12.320]   - I think the app people--
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:14.000]   - Well, it's not Honeycomb, they're doing--
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.360]   - No, I know it's not Honeycuz CUNIX,
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:17.560]   but I'm saying that that's the same, you know,
[00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:19.560]   Steve said there's only 35 apps or whatever.
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:21.320]   He said 10 apps for Honeycomb.
[00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:22.920]   It's even worse for Blackberry.
[00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:25.520]   - They said 100, but here's the difference.
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:28.600]   I'm not convinced that you need to have a million apps
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:30.920]   available for a million apps to make it work.
[00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:34.400]   I do think that if you have a decent tablet
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:36.360]   that fits a certain role, that works well,
[00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:39.960]   and is priced right, if you have the right 10 apps for it,
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:42.640]   including the Kindle app and Amazon will build Kindle app
[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:45.120]   for it, if you come out with a new wristwatch
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:47.720]   and you ask Kindle, Amazon to please make a Kindle app for it,
[00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:51.000]   they'll make you a wristwatch based version of Kindle app.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.320]   A good office suite, good web browser,
[00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:54.640]   make sure the email is good enough
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:56.200]   that you can rely on it all day long.
[00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:57.520]   - That's a question mark with a playbook
[00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:59.280]   because it doesn't come with an email app,
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:01.080]   which is very strange.
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:02.120]   - We'll find that out.
[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:05.480]   It's unfortunately asked with all of these tablets,
[00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:08.680]   the biggest damage is that they're not willing to tell us
[00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:11.320]   in advance how much these things cost.
[00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:13.000]   - That's because they can't get anywhere near the price.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:14.160]   - That's an interesting issue.
[00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:16.400]   - They couldn't do it, the Zoom, they couldn't do it, right?
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:18.760]   But it is a faster system.
[00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:20.680]   - Well, now they're better components, right?
[00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:22.320]   - But the test, no, the test with the iPhone--
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:23.640]   - I'm not too fast.
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:25.680]   - Yeah, I pedaled the Zoom.
[00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:27.320]   - We're talking about the Zoom iPad 2.
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:29.640]   - More expensive than the iPad 2
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:32.120]   because it has higher quality components.
[00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:33.560]   - But it's not as fast as the iPad 2.
[00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:34.400]   - It doesn't.
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:36.320]   - What components are better?
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:37.160]   - Camera?
[00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:39.520]   - I spent--
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:42.200]   - The playbook camera is definitely better, we know that.
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:45.640]   - Guys, I did spend Sunday doing side-by-side
[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:47.520]   photo shootouts and I don't think--
[00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:48.520]   - No, I agree.
[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:51.200]   - It reinforces the idea that the iPad 2 camera
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:55.200]   is kind of awful, but I compared it against the Zoom camera
[00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:57.280]   against the Samsung Galaxy Tab camera.
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:59.360]   They're all really designed for video
[00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:01.080]   and not for still pictures, so you're not gonna get
[00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:03.680]   a good camera and a tablet right now.
[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:06.280]   - Yeah, actually, Mac world, I think, did a side-by-side
[00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:08.200]   comparison also of the pictures.
[00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:13.680]   Galaxy Tab, iPad 2, Motorola Zoom.
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:16.600]   They agreed with you that the,
[00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:21.200]   unfortunately, the camera, the still camera
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:23.360]   and the iPad wasn't so good.
[00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:24.200]   - But that's okay, yeah.
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:26.120]   - It wasn't as good as the iPad 4.
[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:28.680]   They didn't have a BlackBerry, of course, to test, so.
[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:30.920]   - I think it's premature to say there won't be anything
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:32.160]   in 2011 that's as good.
[00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:34.080]   I don't know how you can say that, Andy.
[00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:38.000]   - I've, because there are five different manufacturers
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.480]   who have announced an intention to enter into this market.
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:43.600]   I have now seen all five of their pieces of hardware.
[00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:46.200]   None of them have been able to add an innovation
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:48.880]   that can exceed the iPad 2 in 2011.
[00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:51.680]   There is no feature that they have in their device
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:53.480]   that the iPad does not have.
[00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:56.760]   They will not be able to get anywhere near the depth
[00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:58.800]   and the quality of the apps that are there.
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:01.960]   Also, none of these devices I have seen
[00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:04.680]   have anything close to, anywhere as close to,
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:07.680]   as integrated and as coherent as the experience
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:09.040]   you have on the iPad.
[00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:11.640]   Android 3.0, it's a big leap forward.
[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:13.920]   And when I reviewed the Zoom a few weeks ago,
[00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:16.440]   I did say that it's the first tablet I've seen
[00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:18.160]   that's actually in the iPad's class.
[00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:19.800]   If you want to use something,
[00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:21.960]   if you need something that does the job of an iPad,
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:22.800]   the Zoom can do it.
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:24.040]   I just want to do it quite as well.
[00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:24.880]   But you still don't,
[00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:26.800]   you still have an incredibly clumsy
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:29.480]   and inconsistent experience from app to app to app.
[00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:32.160]   That's why I think that 2012 will be very interesting
[00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:33.880]   because each one of these companies
[00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:36.160]   that's competing with the iPad
[00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:38.160]   will have extra components in place.
[00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:41.640]   HP, for instance, has announced that
[00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:44.160]   they're really going all in on WebOS.
[00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:45.840]   It's gonna be their phone OS,
[00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:47.360]   it's going to be their tablet OS.
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:48.840]   - Yeah, I thought that was also,
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:50.160]   we'll also ship on all the desktops and all of them.
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:51.640]   - I thought that was quite interesting.
[00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:54.240]   So WebOS is gonna be an interesting player as well.
[00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:56.880]   - So that's, again, that's an example of,
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:58.760]   don't try to make another iPad,
[00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:00.160]   try to make your own thing.
[00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:03.560]   So there's so many great reasons to buy an HP desktop
[00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:05.040]   or an HP notebook anyway.
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:10.040]   So you need to buy yourself a brand new I-21 Core processor
[00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:13.480]   upgrade to your notebook in 2012.
[00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:16.000]   In late 2012, early 2013,
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.080]   now you're finally in a mindset
[00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:18.840]   we really want to buy a 10 inch tablet.
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:20.640]   You've got the iPad, which is wonderful.
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:22.400]   Then you've got this HP tablet,
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:25.480]   which will act as a completely transparent,
[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:27.240]   I'm speculating here, please, really,
[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:28.240]   I'm speculating.
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:29.680]   But now you have, on the other hand,
[00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:31.560]   you have this other tablet that is designed
[00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:34.000]   to be absolutely intimately related
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000]   to everything that you do on your HP,
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:39.080]   where it will automatically find your HP computer
[00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:41.520]   no matter where it is, run the exact same apps
[00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:44.040]   in the exact same way with the exact same data.
[00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:45.800]   This will just be a projected version
[00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:47.280]   of everything you've got in your desktop.
[00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:49.760]   That suddenly makes it an interesting buying decision
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:51.760]   when you've got these two tablets side by side.
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:53.760]   But that's not going to happen until 2012.
[00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:56.280]   In 2011, I don't see any competition.
[00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:59.200]   And of course, I did realize how far I was sticking my neck out
[00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:01.840]   by saying something that dramatic.
[00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:03.400]   And believe me, that's one of those things
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:06.520]   where I type something and I keep looking at it
[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:09.080]   and I focus on it every time I look at that draft.
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:11.640]   But in the end, if I truly believe that
[00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:14.160]   and I truly believe I can defend that, I have to say it.
[00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:16.120]   So if there's something else in November,
[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:18.480]   the first line will be, I was wrong, I was wrong,
[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:21.880]   I was wrong, the new Lombata Wear Disco Pad 21,
[00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:24.160]   well, it's the most awesome thing ever.
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:25.320]   I just throw it in my eye.
[00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:28.840]   - So let's then maybe qualify what you said.
[00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:31.640]   - In my crystal ball, from what I can see so far,
[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:33.280]   there's nothing even on the horizon.
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:35.400]   - But don't we, yes is usually where people
[00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:36.240]   are blowing their water.
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:37.160]   I mean, that's when they're showing us
[00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:38.160]   that this is what we're going to do.
[00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:39.000]   - True.
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.120]   - When we didn't see anything at CES, no,
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:41.200]   I agree with you on that.
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:43.160]   - You know, they wouldn't let me touch the zoom.
[00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:44.000]   - Yeah.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.280]   - Well, we've touched the zoom now.
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:47.080]   - Yeah, but I'm saying, but that's like,
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:47.920]   it was so early on.
[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:50.280]   - I was doing a 10 inch with Honeycomb.
[00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:51.960]   I liked the Galaxy Tab a lot.
[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:55.240]   I would say it was close, I would consider perhaps closer
[00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:58.360]   to the iPad to then you did Andy, but I agree with you
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:01.080]   that there's nothing in the class of iPad to
[00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:03.800]   even the Galaxy Tab, which I think is a very good product.
[00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:08.120]   - I still feel like this is like the iPod version two
[00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:10.080]   where you, you know, everyone's scrambling.
[00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:13.440]   The iPod made this huge impact and then everyone scrambled
[00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:14.440]   and then it got too far ahead
[00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:16.400]   and then everyone just kind of gave up, moved on.
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:17.680]   - Well, Apple didn't advance.
[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:19.560]   Now, this would be my thumb now,
[00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:21.080]   we're going to interrupt yours briefly
[00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:22.320]   and then we'll get back to Andy.
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:24.760]   Apple didn't advance the game that far.
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:26.640]   They kind of advanced them minimally far.
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:28.440]   It's thinner, it's a little lighter.
[00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:30.640]   It's got a camera, not a great camera.
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:33.200]   It's faster, but until we see apps that take advantage
[00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:35.920]   of it, it's not particularly noticeably faster.
[00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:37.160]   - Oh, it is way faster.
[00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:39.200]   - In every app, I don't see that.
[00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:40.880]   Most apps are single threaded, so I don't think
[00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:41.720]   I wouldn't expect that.
[00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:45.040]   - Well, it doesn't, it's so hard to find a benchmark
[00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:46.840]   that is, that's real world.
[00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:49.280]   But my benchmark was actually,
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:53.960]   the best solution that I could come up with was auto-stitch.
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:56.240]   And I decided that I'm going to,
[00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:57.440]   'cause it's an iPhone app,
[00:55:57.440 --> 00:55:58.840]   you can see that I'm running it actually just
[00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:00.360]   in, it's an iPhone app.
[00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:03.480]   Where I just, I took a 23 shot panorama.
[00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:04.320]   - That's big.
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:06.360]   - And decided that I'm going to calculate how,
[00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:07.920]   I'm going to have time, how long it takes
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:09.720]   for the iPad 2 to build that panorama
[00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:11.120]   and how long it takes for the iPad 1.
[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:12.400]   - That's a fair comparison.
[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:16.400]   - And the iPad 2 got it 2.2 times faster
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:17.240]   than the original.
[00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:18.240]   Everything works faster.
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:20.440]   Now you're right in that a lot of different applications
[00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:22.360]   are going to be tuned for it.
[00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:24.200]   They're right now, I have a list right now
[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:26.800]   that Apple provided me with the apps that they know
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:30.440]   for a fact have been optimized specifically for the iPad 2.
[00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:33.200]   The most, the biggest games are,
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:35.640]   they didn't even, as far as I know so far,
[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:38.000]   and I'm still trying to talk to the actual developers
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:39.800]   of these games, what they have,
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:43.760]   they haven't actually made processor specific enhancements.
[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:47.000]   They've simply said there is so much better performance
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:48.280]   in this chip that all we have,
[00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:50.520]   that you know how we decided that we're not going to have
[00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:54.120]   this really, really higher density texture map
[00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:56.920]   for the crowd scenes and the glints off the armor
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:59.200]   and the weapons because the iPad 1 processor
[00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:00.000]   is going to handle it.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.120]   Let's just upgrade all of those textures
[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:04.040]   'cause now we know that the graphics processor
[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:05.760]   and the CPU can definitely handle it.
[00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:08.000]   That's why you don't necessarily see, or my experience,
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.400]   you don't necessarily see greater frame rates,
[00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:13.040]   but you do see that every single object
[00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:14.960]   is greater detailed because,
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:17.160]   and not because they optimized it for the processor
[00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:19.600]   because they simply replaced the game elements
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:22.720]   with ones that would take a lot more time to render properly.
[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:25.040]   - The two places that I noticed it the most
[00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:28.440]   was in GarageBand and also in the daily,
[00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:30.120]   you know the Rupert Murdochs.
[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:31.120]   - Yeah, really?
[00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:32.120]   - The daily was like--
[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:33.640]   - You're actually still reading that?
[00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:35.720]   - Yeah, it's pretty awful.
[00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:36.960]   (laughing)
[00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:38.600]   - You still have the free subscription I hope.
[00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:40.000]   - You're not playing with it, you know.
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:40.840]   - You're paying for that.
[00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:41.680]   - I have friends that work there.
[00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:43.800]   - So it's wonderful then.
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:45.120]   I just love it.
[00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:46.880]   - You know, they have, but my brother shot,
[00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:48.360]   there was a, they did a thing on Rango,
[00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:50.200]   and my brother actually shot the interviews.
[00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:51.360]   I mean, he shot the video for us.
[00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:52.520]   - Oh, all right, well then I like them.
[00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:54.960]   I see the daily is keeping great people
[00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:57.120]   like your brother, gainfully employed on it.
[00:57:57.120 --> 00:58:00.680]   - Exactly, so the, but it was when it came out,
[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:02.440]   it was really clunky.
[00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:04.320]   You know, on the iPad one, you know,
[00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:05.720]   like when you start moving stuff,
[00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:07.400]   everything doesn't really wanna move very well
[00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:08.840]   and everything else, and on the iPad two,
[00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:11.400]   suddenly it was like, boom, it really made a difference.
[00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:12.560]   The other one though is GarageBand,
[00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:16.160]   where on the iPad one, it's constantly re-optimizing,
[00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:17.640]   and on the iPad two, it's just--
[00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:19.680]   - They never really wanted you to run GarageBand.
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:21.560]   I mean, you can run GarageBand on the iPad one,
[00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:23.920]   but it's clearly positioned for the iPad two.
[00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:24.760]   - Yeah.
[00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:27.840]   - My son still enjoys it on the iPad one, but--
[00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:30.000]   - Is it the multi, is it multi-instruments
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:30.840]   that I have, Mark Times?
[00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:33.760]   - It's actually any individual instrument seems to work fine.
[00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:37.760]   It's when you add, it's when you start layering them.
[00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:38.920]   - That's a multiple tracks.
[00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:40.240]   - Yeah, when you start adding multiple tracks,
[00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:41.800]   it starts to get ugly.
[00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:45.760]   - I have to say, this, yeah, I could see how this
[00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:48.280]   would really challenge the GPU and the processor
[00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:49.120]   and what it's doing.
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:50.120]   - You played with smart keyboard, right?
[00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:52.320]   - Small keyboard, I mean, just, the smart instruments
[00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:54.560]   are really what's most interesting to play with.
[00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:58.000]   This is a spectacular program.
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.320]   This by itself should sell a lot of iPad two.
[00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:04.200]   - Yeah, so I showed that to my wife,
[00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:06.040]   and she literally within like a minute
[00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:09.000]   of looking at GarageBand, she was like, I need one.
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:10.040]   I need one, when do I get one?
[00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:11.800]   I said, well, there now, I should have bought two.
[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:14.760]   I was like, thinking.
[00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:16.680]   It's all I gotta say, now I have to wait weeks.
[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:20.040]   With her still on the iPad.
[00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:20.960]   - So what else, Andy?
[00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:23.040]   Give us some more of your thumbnail review.
[00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:29.080]   - Mostly, it's hard to really appreciate exactly
[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:31.880]   how much thinner this actually is compared
[00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:32.840]   to the previous one.
[00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:38.160]   I have to make a certain point kind of delicately.
[00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:41.360]   I wanna do a personal note to Apple.
[00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:43.080]   I love it that it's that much thinner.
[00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:45.520]   It's incredible that this is actually a multi-core,
[00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:48.040]   really, really incredibly powerful computer.
[00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:51.000]   Please don't make it any thinner than this.
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:54.280]   I think that they found exactly how thin they can make this
[00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:56.800]   without making it a little bit harder to use.
[00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:59.600]   I kind of wished before, I started using it
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:02.280]   without the cover attached, and I kind of wished
[01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:04.280]   that the back were a little bit grippier
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:06.760]   because when it's this thin, there's no hard edge
[01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:08.960]   of any kind to sort of settle into a crook.
[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:13.840]   I could sort of sense myself being stupid at some point,
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:16.240]   trying to put this inside my bag
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:19.160]   and my finger slipping on it and actually dropping it.
[01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:22.520]   But balanced against that is this cover is you cannot,
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:27.520]   it's, I have to sort of reel back a lot of my enthusiasm.
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:31.680]   But certain things about looking like a stupid Apple fanboy.
[01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:35.360]   But this cover, only Apple, I think,
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:37.400]   could put this much thought into something
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.160]   as simple as a protective cover.
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:42.080]   Because you've probably seen how it has a school thing
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:44.400]   where it automatically wake itself and sleep itself.
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:46.280]   Look how fast it does that.
[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:47.560]   That's how fast.
[01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:49.400]   You don't have to wait, you don't have to unlock it
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:52.040]   or anything, you open it, and as though it was never
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:53.480]   asleep to begin with.
[01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:56.760]   You've seen the other two modes where you can set it up
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:59.920]   as a typing easel or as a stand easel.
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:02.800]   But then as I'm sort of like playing with this
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:04.640]   and I'm thinking, "Dang it, it's kind of hard
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:05.680]   "to hold it and read."
[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:07.960]   I realize that you can accordion fold it.
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:11.080]   And this is the most comfortable thing in the world
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:12.680]   to hold onto and read with.
[01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:15.760]   I was at a diner, having breakfast at a diner this morning,
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:18.640]   holding it like a newspaper while I'm having my pancakes.
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:21.320]   And it's the most comfortable thing in the world
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:22.360]   to hold onto.
[01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:25.040]   It feels, you feel as though, yes, this thing costs me
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:29.080]   500 bucks, but man, did Apple really want to earn
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:32.200]   every penny of my money in this design?
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:34.000]   I fix it, did a tear down, of course,
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000]   not only the iPad, but also a cover.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.000]   They tear down the cover.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:37.840]   (laughing)
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:39.000]   I love how I fix it.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.240]   You think, what's the easiest thing you could possibly do?
[01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:42.760]   Well, of course, the slick thing we're gonna do
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:44.280]   is we're gonna put a magnet in it.
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:46.400]   But it's designed so that it's almost,
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:49.600]   you have to work to get this to go on the wrong way.
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:52.180]   (upbeat music)
[01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:56.440]   Frosty sat on the mute button, I think.
[01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:58.700]   (laughing)
[01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:01.040]   Meanwhile.
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:02.320]   (laughing)
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:03.480]   Meanwhile, back in the ranch.
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:05.200]   (laughing)
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:06.040]   Did you put your mute button?
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:07.040]   Did you put your mute button?
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:08.480]   (laughing)
[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:09.720]   Oh Lord.
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:11.040]   So, uh,
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:11.880]   - She turned, she turned.
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:12.880]   - Oh, he does that trick.
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:13.720]   It's really cool.
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:14.960]   If you could see it, unfortunately, just off camera
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:16.880]   where he lifts the biscuit off his nose.
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:18.200]   (laughing)
[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:19.040]   - Oh shit.
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:20.360]   - He'll sit there and sit down on his nose.
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:21.200]   - For hours.
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:22.200]   - For hours.
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:24.520]   - He's shut up, boy, and then you say okay.
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:27.840]   And he just goes (snorts)
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:28.760]   Snarfs it right up.
[01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:29.600]   Such a well-trash.
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:30.560]   - You're a buster, shut up, go,
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:31.400]   bust your, shut up, go, go.
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:33.600]   - Busters, that his name, he keeps changing.
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:34.440]   - Hmm?
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:37.760]   - Well, see, his job title is Distracto.
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:38.600]   (laughing)
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:39.920]   - Distracto the Wonder Dog.
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:41.400]   (laughing)
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:43.400]   - At least that's how I claim him when I use,
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:45.000]   when I use his salary to, you know,
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.840]   siphon to hide some of the money
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:49.240]   that I've been making off of the poker sites.
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:51.560]   - So there was this company named Lanza.
[01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:53.960]   My name is Ryan Brown.
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:56.240]   I work for Lanza Healing Hair Care.
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:58.320]   Listen to your last Mac break.
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:00.600]   I heard you were talking a lot about John Gruber's hair.
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:03.600]   So now everyone in the Twit Cottage can have great hair.
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:05.520]   (laughing)
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:06.840]   - No, that's not really possible.
[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:07.800]   - They sent me.
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:09.120]   - Nice one to say.
[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:10.560]   - They sent me.
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:11.440]   Wow.
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:15.000]   I mean, a lot of hair care product from Lanza.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:15.800]   I've never heard of them,
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:18.000]   but now I will be being ever,
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.720]   oh look, here's a hair mask.
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:22.800]   - Now they have the clarifying gel.
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:23.920]   - I'm gonna put this on right now.
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:24.760]   We're gonna see.
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:26.600]   Let me see what it says.
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:28.040]   It says, "Use twice weekly,
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:30.640]   "or as often as needed apply to damper dry hair,
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:33.400]   "leave in for five minutes."
[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:35.520]   30 minutes for seriously dehydrated hair.
[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:36.560]   Well, mine's very dehydrated.
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:39.520]   Let me just put some of that in there.
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:41.680]   And this is gonna really help the show.
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:45.560]   Yeah, look at that.
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:47.040]   All right.
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:47.880]   - All right.
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:48.960]   - Thank you, Lanza.
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:51.360]   Mm.
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:53.480]   (laughing)
[01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:55.120]   It is a little Pee Wee Herman, isn't it?
[01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:56.000]   A little eraser head.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   - Yeah.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.880]   - Yeah, I love it.
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:00.640]   - Of course I call it a contribute to this section.
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:01.480]   Kind of nice.
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:02.320]   - You're done.
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:04.160]   You're kind of left out, aren't you?
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:05.920]   - Yeah, well, you know.
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:07.080]   - You want some hair care products?
[01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:09.640]   I don't think we have anything to gross hair.
[01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:11.520]   - Oh, how about this?
[01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:14.040]   - Given how successful last week was,
[01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:15.560]   I think it's time to go for the,
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:18.480]   I'm sure there's somebody who does like mustache wax,
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:20.920]   you know, stabilizers, combs, beard trimmers.
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:22.160]   - Let's go for it.
[01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:23.000]   Maybe Lanza does.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:23.840]   - Maybe Lanza does.
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:24.680]   - And then the mustache.
[01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:26.080]   - Look at Adams hair looks good.
[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:28.800]   You've been obviously taking good care of your hair.
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:29.680]   (laughing)
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:31.240]   - Yeah, I guess so.
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:32.400]   - I'm gonna send you, Don,
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:34.880]   we're gonna put this podcast over, I must say.
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:37.560]   - When you come, Don, when you come out next week,
[01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:41.040]   I'll give you this, this is Lanza's healing style.
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:41.880]   - Okay.
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:42.720]   - This will heal your.
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:44.280]   (laughing)
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:46.080]   That's a tough taste.
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:47.640]   It smells, but it smells good, doesn't it?
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:49.360]   Don't I smell good?
[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:51.760]   Oh dear, starting to stiffen.
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:54.020]   (laughing)
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:59.080]   - Healing volume, this is like Christmas anyway.
[01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:01.480]   - And so this clip will be the answer to the question
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:04.160]   from every watcher of every podcast you do this week.
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:05.640]   How, why was your hair look so funny
[01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:07.880]   that I've thrown that podcast this week's?
[01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:10.600]   Well, because I did Mac break weekly just before it,
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:12.120]   and I got this impulse.
[01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:14.120]   - Oh, you're right, I have another show to do.
[01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:16.160]   (laughing)
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:17.240]   Oh well.
[01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:18.920]   - Can you do a Christopher Walken impression?
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:19.760]   - Thank you.
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:21.240]   - If you want to do it before your next couple.
[01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:22.440]   - This would be good, this would be the time to do it.
[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:23.920]   Well, thank you.
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:25.240]   - Very concerned.
[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:29.520]   I get a lot, thank you to Ryan Brown in lawns of marketing.
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:32.560]   By the way, his email address is at me.com.
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:34.360]   - You know, I still haven't got that stuff out of my hair,
[01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:36.080]   that's why I'm wearing this hat.
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:38.360]   So we continue with our best of Mac break weekly.
[01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:42.880]   Hope you're enjoying our post Christmas kind of holiday.
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:46.160]   I ate too much turkey, and now I have to rest week.
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:47.880]   We're gonna be back in just a moment with more,
[01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:49.880]   but first I want to remind you that this show,
[01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:53.880]   as always brought to you by our friends at Ford Motor Cars.
[01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:55.480]   CES is coming up in a couple of weeks,
[01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:57.080]   we're gonna do our live coverage from CES.
[01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:58.240]   Ford will be there.
[01:05:58.240 --> 01:05:59.160]   In fact, I'm very excited.
[01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:00.840]   I'm gonna get to have dinner with the CEO,
[01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:02.200]   Ford Allen Malali.
[01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:04.160]   And if you've got any thoughts,
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:05.960]   you'd like me to pass along to Allen.
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:08.480]   I want you to email me, Leo@twit.tv.
[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:09.760]   I'll be asking him questions,
[01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:11.280]   I'll be talking about the cars,
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:13.960]   my experiences with the amazing Ford Sync,
[01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:16.400]   and my Ford Touch, things we could do better,
[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:18.840]   things I'd like to see him work on for future.
[01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:20.040]   You know, I love the app link,
[01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:23.160]   we've seen that with the ability to tie
[01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:27.360]   the smartphone to the Sync.
[01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:29.680]   But the feature that I recently tried out,
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:32.000]   that I was very intrigued by,
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.840]   I took a ride in a brand new 2012 Ford Focus,
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:38.560]   and we tested out the Sync services,
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:40.080]   actually watch this video.
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:43.920]   Hey, Leo Le Porte, brick, twithouse,
[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:45.480]   and once again I want to show you
[01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:48.200]   the cool stuff Ford is doing in their new vehicles.
[01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:50.960]   This is the 2012 Ford Fiesta,
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:53.480]   very affordable car with great features,
[01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:55.600]   including the Ford Sync.
[01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:57.040]   I want to show you how Sync now
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:58.720]   can use mobile apps on your phone,
[01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:01.560]   like Pandora, Stitcher, to listen to iPods,
[01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:03.600]   Pandora to listen to music,
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:05.840]   OpenBeak to listen to tweets,
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:08.280]   and they just added Slack or radio too,
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:09.520]   it's pretty amazing.
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:10.800]   First, let's get in the car,
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:13.320]   almost everything you do with this Ford Sync,
[01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:15.000]   you do with your voice,
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.560]   and I kind of like that.
[01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:19.240]   So here's the Ford Sync button here on the turn signal,
[01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:21.240]   let's turn the car on and I'll show you how it works.
[01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:22.360]   Let's have Pandora running,
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:24.800]   I'm gonna connect this to the USB connector,
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:26.920]   notice USB connector right here,
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:29.720]   I'm using the standard iPhone cable,
[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:32.160]   that's great because it's also charging the phone
[01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:33.040]   while I'm listening to it,
[01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:34.640]   I can just keep it here, make phone calls,
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:36.520]   and I do it all with my hands on the wheel,
[01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:38.920]   my eyes on the road, just press this button.
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:43.040]   - Mobile apps, please say a command.
[01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:43.920]   - Pandora.
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:48.600]   So now my Pandora is connected,
[01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:50.320]   and I can listen to a station,
[01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:55.560]   let's say I'll play a station Lady Gaga, how about that?
[01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:57.840]   (bell chimes)
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:59.680]   - Pandora, please say a command.
[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:03.220]   - Play station Lady Gaga.
[01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:07.800]   So now I'm listening to Lady Gaga,
[01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:09.480]   this is great because it means I,
[01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:11.120]   as I'm driving along,
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:12.760]   I can listen to songs that I love,
[01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:13.680]   from artists that I love,
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:15.280]   I can even create new stations,
[01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:16.760]   if I don't like a song that's playing,
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:17.760]   I can thumbs down it,
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:18.880]   if I like it I can thumbs up,
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:20.840]   in fact let's do a thumbs up right now.
[01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:23.400]   (bell chimes)
[01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:25.640]   - Pandora, please say a command.
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:26.480]   - Thumbs up.
[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:30.600]   Thumbed up.
[01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:32.360]   (laughs)
[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:33.520]   How about skip?
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:37.680]   - Pandora, please say a command.
[01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:38.520]   - Skip.
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:43.160]   (bell chimes)
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:44.960]   - All right, now we're rockin'.
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:47.720]   (bell chimes)
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:52.720]   This is all streaming in via 3G.
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:54.160]   So I can be just drivin' down the road,
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:55.440]   listen to the great radio,
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:57.400]   if I want more information about a song,
[01:08:57.400 --> 01:08:58.400]   or I wanna buy a song,
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:08:59.240]   I can tell it,
[01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:00.880]   I can create new stations.
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:01.800]   So the beauty of this is,
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:05.880]   I don't have to take my eyes off the road,
[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:07.320]   I know it's on the display there,
[01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:08.160]   but I don't have to,
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:09.720]   I can just drive along and I can say,
[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:10.560]   well what was that song?
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:12.080]   And it will tell me,
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:14.080]   I just love that.
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:15.680]   So you can see how easy it is,
[01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:17.800]   you can listen to podcasts using Stitcher,
[01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:20.320]   you can listen to music using Pandora,
[01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:23.120]   you can even have your tweets read to you with OpenB.
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:26.640]   That's the sync with the new app link,
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:28.040]   more and more apps all the time,
[01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:30.720]   which means more capabilities from Ford Sync,
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:32.440]   and you don't have to do anything,
[01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:34.720]   as long as you got the apps on your phone,
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:36.040]   that's all you need.
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:36.920]   Pretty cool.
[01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:39.960]   Drive one today at a Ford dealer near you.
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:41.520]   - I'll help you get a chance to drive a Ford
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:43.760]   sometime soon at a Ford dealer near you.
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:45.320]   Really, truly great stuff.
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:48.920]   Now, another big boy, Apple had a really big year in 2011,
[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:50.320]   there was a lot of news,
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:52.600]   including the new version of OS X,
[01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:53.720]   our first look,
[01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:54.560]   "Hoo!"
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:56.360]   at Lion next.
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:58.940]   (upbeat music)
[01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:06.360]   - We've had Lion now for a week.
[01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:08.880]   How are we feeling about Lion?
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:13.160]   - So far, other than a couple things not working,
[01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:14.000]   I think it's been working.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.920]   I have to admit, I only put it on my small laptop,
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:19.120]   and it's in a dual boot,
[01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:20.120]   'cause I'm just still,
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:22.480]   I tend to do these things very slowly.
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:23.480]   So for the show, I've been doing it,
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:24.320]   but it's only been like,
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:26.040]   "Oh, I gotta do some homework."
[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:27.480]   And look at it,
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:28.840]   'cause most of all the production computers
[01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:30.000]   were taking a little bit more time,
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.240]   because there's been a lot of production programs
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:33.080]   that are breaking when you use someone.
[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:37.360]   - A surprisingly large number of incompatible apps.
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:38.720]   - There's a lot of incompatible apps.
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:40.680]   And so, people just need to remember,
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:41.520]   a lot of people have been going,
[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:43.320]   "Oh, I installed Lion, and nothing worked."
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:46.200]   And you're kinda like, "Okay, well, you need to watch
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:47.720]   and make sure that your app is ready to go,
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:49.640]   especially if you have more expensive apps
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:50.600]   that take a little longer,
[01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:52.560]   especially production apps on the Mac.
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:54.840]   You need to take a little time and just slowly move into that.
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:58.320]   We have one iMac in the back that has Lion
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:10:59.680]   that we're kinda starting to test.
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:01.160]   - I put it on everything.
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:02.520]   I put it on everything.
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:03.360]   How about you, Andy?
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:05.360]   What is your take so far?
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:07.080]   - Well, it's kind of interesting that you mentioned
[01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:09.280]   that you only have it on the iMac.
[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:11.960]   I have come to realize that I was at a disadvantage
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:13.920]   because I had the developer edition,
[01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:17.760]   and it was only on an iMac that I don't use for anything else.
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:19.480]   So that had two different effects,
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:20.880]   'cause I'm working on a few books
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:23.120]   and I can't have it on my main MacBook.
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:25.160]   So that was the other situation.
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:27.240]   But I find that it makes a lot more sense to me
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:29.480]   now that it is on a smaller screen,
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:31.720]   something with an integrated touchpad than it did
[01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:33.600]   on a big iMac with a keyboard over here
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:35.320]   and the touchpad over there.
[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:38.240]   So I find myself using gestures a lot more.
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:41.560]   I find myself using spaces a lot more than I did before.
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:43.080]   And also the flip side of that though,
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:46.720]   is that it also means that things that were only,
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:49.080]   when I was just testing it out a couple hours a day
[01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:51.640]   and writing my review, that were just,
[01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:53.880]   "Oh gosh, that's kind of weird that works that way."
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:55.960]   Now that I'm using it 10 hours a day for a week
[01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:58.820]   or now, oh, for the love of Holy,
[01:11:58.820 --> 01:12:00.760]   logo-stipping, whatever.
[01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:04.920]   - Is that a good for the love of or a bad for the love of?
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:07.240]   - For the love of the explicit tag, yeah.
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:09.240]   I mean, I think that--
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:10.480]   - Is that a happy Andy?
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:13.320]   - I'm sorry, you were breaking up there.
[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:15.000]   - Is that a happy Andy?
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.080]   - I love lying.
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:16.920]   I think it's great.
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:17.760]   I think it's a critical upgrade.
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:18.720]   I think that everybody should,
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:21.280]   after they've made absolutely sure that they're not
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:22.840]   gonna be locked out of their favorite apps,
[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:24.120]   I think that everyone should upgrade to it.
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:26.640]   But it's only underscored my impression
[01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:30.000]   that the invisible scroll bar thing is just,
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.520]   it's not just simply a redesign, it's a mistake.
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:35.120]   It's a full-on mistake.
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:37.040]   It's a stupid mistake.
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:39.040]   I've been taking screen captures of every time,
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.400]   especially when I'm on the web,
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:42.280]   I'll find a circumstance under which something
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:47.280]   simply doesn't work because a panel inside,
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:49.480]   like, for instance, Google Reader,
[01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:51.960]   thinks that it has the entire width of the frame.
[01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:55.720]   So we'll put a little pop-up menu dingus button
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:57.880]   at the extreme right of that column,
[01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:00.840]   which is great because that still works just fine.
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:03.280]   But now if you expect to have a scroll bar there,
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:05.600]   you will move the mouse pointer to reveal the scroll bar.
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:07.280]   You wanna grab that handle to scroll
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:08.800]   all the way up or right down to where you wanna go.
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:10.400]   But as soon as you click down,
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:12.000]   Google Reader gets the click
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.240]   instead of the scroll bar.
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:14.080]   >> Right.
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:17.960]   >> And some of the other apps where it looks so,
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:20.240]   there's like a box or window that looks so pretty
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:22.080]   and so well designed that I think,
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:24.440]   okay, well, I'm seeing everything that's inside this window.
[01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:25.800]   Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope,
[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:27.320]   it just happens at the bottom of the box,
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:28.560]   the bottom of the window happens to be
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:31.560]   a natural division between one section of content
[01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:32.400]   and the other.
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:34.120]   You have no idea that there's actually four more pages
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:35.320]   where it's stuck to scroll through.
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:37.320]   >> That is a loss,
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:39.240]   'cause this scroll bar used to tell you,
[01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:40.680]   used to give you information.
[01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:42.760]   >> And yes, you can always switch that back.
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:46.560]   And yes, I've got two separate issues here.
[01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:47.960]   You know that I don't like the idea
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:50.080]   that they reverse the direction of scrolling.
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:51.880]   But I can at least dismiss that as saying,
[01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:53.920]   well, you know what, it was arbitrary to begin with.
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:56.000]   It's just after a few weeks I'm gonna get used to it.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.200]   I still don't think it's a good idea,
[01:13:57.200 --> 01:13:58.320]   but I'll get used to it.
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:00.880]   This idea of invisible scroll bars
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:03.000]   absolutely flat out,
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.720]   bad, stupid idea that I have to guess
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:08.400]   is the subject of long arguments
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:10.480]   that we just simply said we got a ship.
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:12.680]   It's a stupid idea, period.
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:14.320]   >> You agree, Alex?
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:16.480]   I haven't gotten used to it either.
[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:17.720]   (laughing)
[01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:18.920]   >> I think Andy said it all.
[01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:22.240]   I like the scroll bar, I'm attached to it.
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:23.400]   I don't like the reverse.
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:24.640]   I don't like the, I mean--
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:25.480]   >> It's defense.
[01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:26.400]   >> And it's defense.
[01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:27.240]   >> In its defense.
[01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:28.080]   >> It looks nice.
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:31.200]   It takes a plus space, so we have more content.
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:33.440]   >> We have pretty big screens as it is.
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:35.200]   I don't feel like I'm running out of content a lot.
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:37.000]   >> I'm working hard here.
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.360]   >> You're working at it at all.
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:39.200]   >> In its defense.
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:41.000]   >> You're trying to rebuild your apple cred.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:41.840]   >> Yeah.
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:43.720]   >> Well, you know, here's a funny thing.
[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:45.600]   I like lion, I haven't had any problems.
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:47.880]   I got used to the fact that the scroll's reverse,
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:49.240]   and I don't even think about it anymore.
[01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:51.120]   I do like some things like, for instance,
[01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:53.120]   this where you launch mission control
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:55.920]   with a three finger up motion.
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:59.680]   I like being able to go from full screen to full screen using,
[01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:02.240]   I never used, I stopped using spaces almost immediately,
[01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:05.400]   and now I automatically am using it all the time.
[01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:08.960]   I just, I think I'm starting to like it, to be honest with you.
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:10.960]   And I've lived with the scroll bar thing.
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:14.720]   You know, I think I maybe just don't have the habit
[01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:17.920]   that you guys did of using the scroll bar directly.
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:20.080]   'Cause that's where you, that's the biggest loss, right?
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:22.880]   Is that you can't just, it's harder to click on it.
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:24.760]   >> Well, not only does it make it harder to click on,
[01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:27.960]   but there are many instances in which things now
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:30.640]   do not work because of this design conceit.
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:31.480]   >> Okay.
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:33.720]   >> That happens a lot during the web,
[01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:36.160]   but it also happens more often than you would think
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:39.680]   in real apps where if it makes something stop working,
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:41.680]   that idea, or rather you have to have
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:43.760]   an exceptionally good reason for doing it.
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:46.200]   And when you say that, yeah, but, you know,
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:48.680]   we need all that extra real estate on our 2000 pixel
[01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:50.720]   by 1500 pixel display, I mean, goodness,
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:52.800]   that would be a whole extra six thoughts
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:53.880]   are going to waste.
[01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:54.720]   >> Right.
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:56.160]   >> Like, yeah, again, it makes perfect sense
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:58.840]   on an iPhone screen does not make any sense whatsoever,
[01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:00.360]   even on a MacBook Air screen.
[01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:01.200]   >> I hear you telling us about it.
[01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:04.160]   >> I absolutely agree with you on spaces.
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:07.960]   Again, when I move to a machine with a smaller screen,
[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:10.120]   that's when spaces really comes into play.
[01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:10.960]   >> It doesn't feel that--
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:14.160]   >> All of this stuff seems good on the air.
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:15.200]   And it's better maybe on the air
[01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:17.640]   than it is on the 27 inch screen.
[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:18.480]   >> Absolutely.
[01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:20.200]   >> I think that that's the case.
[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:23.440]   And I think they expect to sell a lot of 11 inch airs.
[01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:25.160]   So they're kind of building an OS for the years
[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:26.400]   and for the iPads, right?
[01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:30.960]   >> One million copies sold on the first day.
[01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:31.920]   >> It's a good start.
[01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:33.240]   >> How about the upgrade process?
[01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:34.280]   Has that been pretty painless?
[01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:36.680]   I mean, I actually haven't done a clean install yet.
[01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:38.840]   I've done nothing but an upgrade in place.
[01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:41.520]   I did make a USB key right away.
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:44.160]   And I mentioned this last week, but a reminder,
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:47.600]   you know, you can't make the USB key once you install line,
[01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:48.640]   it deletes the installer.
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:51.160]   So you have to get the installer out.
[01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:52.920]   >> I think Don McAllister did a great little tutorial
[01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:53.760]   on that as well.
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:54.600]   >> He has a screencast on it.
[01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:55.440]   >> He has a screencast on it.
[01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:56.280]   >> A screencast on it, yeah.
[01:16:56.280 --> 01:16:57.120]   >> Yeah.
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:00.000]   >> But I think the install went surprisingly smoothly
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.960]   and the fact that a million people now have downloaded this
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:07.120]   and presumably installed it and I haven't heard a single howl
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:09.720]   of pain, any upgrade issues that I've heard?
[01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:10.560]   Anybody heard it?
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:12.280]   >> I didn't do a clean install even after I said I would.
[01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:13.120]   >> I know, I didn't need it.
[01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:14.440]   >> I was like, oh, I just want to see it.
[01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:15.280]   And so I just put it on.
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:16.120]   >> Just put it on.
[01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:16.960]   >> And it works.
[01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:18.920]   >> They're a few simple issues.
[01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:22.200]   There's some permissions issues that often happen
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:24.200]   when you do a regular upgrade.
[01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:26.120]   There are also some permissions issues that have to do
[01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:28.760]   with the fact that now the OS interacts
[01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:30.240]   with files in a different way.
[01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:34.040]   So things that you'll want to do something to an app
[01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:36.280]   that you could have done, look at the split.
[01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:37.120]   It's no leopard now.
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:39.560]   I'm sorry to do that to your own app.
[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:41.240]   >> I don't, I have to admit I'm not crazy
[01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:44.200]   about the new Finder conceit of all my docs.
[01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:46.960]   I want to see the computer and you have to go back
[01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:49.200]   into settings so that you can see the computer.
[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:52.440]   Otherwise there's really no way from Finder
[01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:54.560]   to get to your computer's contents.
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:57.800]   >> I'm not sure, frankly, that's more of a style thing
[01:17:57.800 --> 01:17:59.600]   that gave me a little bit of a blip,
[01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:01.360]   but I understand the logic they're going to.
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:03.720]   They moved, I'm expecting, when I haven't attached
[01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:05.680]   USB device like a memory card, I'm expecting it
[01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:08.040]   to be in a certain place, now it's actually a different place.
[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:08.880]   >> Where is it?
[01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:10.480]   >> I don't see it in other favorites.
[01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:12.440]   Is it hidden somewhere that I'm missing?
[01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:14.400]   >> I'm sorry?
[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:16.120]   >> I don't see any of your favorites.
[01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:17.320]   Is it under devices?
[01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:21.040]   See, I can't see, in other words, I can't see my hard drive.
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:22.480]   I want to see my hard drive.
[01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:23.320]   >> Okay.
[01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:25.840]   >> Okay, yeah, that is a level of abstraction.
[01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:27.880]   They decide to get a new way with,
[01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:30.560]   which I actually think is a good thing.
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:31.880]   >> It's not that abstract.
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:33.320]   >> It's my hard drive.
[01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:34.800]   >> But we're old folks.
[01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:36.320]   We want to know what we think.
[01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:37.160]   >> Really?
[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:38.000]   >> But I hear you're ending part of this.
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.600]   >> Okay, I want to go to the system library file.
[01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:44.000]   I defy you in the default behavior of the Finder
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:48.560]   to find, I could find the, Leo, well now it's crap.
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:51.640]   I could find, now I don't know what's happened, it's broken.
[01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:54.280]   But find, go to, because you frequently, don't you,
[01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:58.120]   maybe I'm only the one who actually have corrupted my Finder.
[01:18:58.120 --> 01:18:59.600]   Let me reopen it.
[01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:02.840]   Maybe I'm the only one who does this, but System Library,
[01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:05.080]   so you get there from the root.
[01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:07.720]   How do I get to root directory here?
[01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:10.200]   I can get to Leo, but they're hard drives, don't you see that?
[01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:12.120]   >> And there's no more, by the way,
[01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:14.080]   as far as I could tell, library folder.
[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:15.080]   >> But weren't you just at Macintosh folder?
[01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:16.400]   >> In the home, didn't we see the Macintosh?
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:17.760]   >> Yeah, 'cause I had changed the,
[01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:21.120]   where when you open a new one, I changed that.
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:23.200]   Go under Finder Preferences and you'll find it.
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:24.600]   >> I did, I changed the Preferences.
[01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:29.760]   But by default, there's no way to go from Leo,
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:31.680]   my home folder, up a level.
[01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:35.160]   >> But that's kind of okay, because there's something
[01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:38.560]   that was told to me back when the transition from Mac OS
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:42.640]   to a core of Unix went, an Apple engineer told me that,
[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:45.680]   if our philosophy about the Unix switchovers,
[01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:48.880]   that if you don't want to see the Unix and you see it,
[01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:50.280]   if you fail, if you want to see it,
[01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:52.560]   but you can't find it, then we've also sailed.
[01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:54.360]   >> It's not that hard, I mean, you go to the Go menu,
[01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:56.040]   you can find it, if it's coming in.
[01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:58.640]   >> People who have that sort of sophistication,
[01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:00.480]   who want to access to the root library folder,
[01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:02.640]   they can, I think they can pretty easily find it,
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:04.240]   but it's not gonna confuse people,
[01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:07.520]   who are gonna maybe save a file someplace outside
[01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:09.200]   of their home directory, which they can do,
[01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:10.400]   and then they can't find it again,
[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:12.600]   because it's not their documents for a world
[01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:14.400]   where default behavior is your in your home directory.
[01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:15.640]   >> And I think that default behavior also,
[01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:17.880]   if you're not geeky, the idea is that,
[01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:21.360]   many people never need to see their system folder,
[01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:23.000]   and so the idea is to keep them out of it.
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:23.920]   >> Don't go there.
[01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:26.840]   >> As a father of a three and a half roll.
[01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:27.680]   >> That's a good find.
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:29.920]   >> Parts of my TV interface that I didn't even know existed.
[01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:30.840]   >> No, that's a good point.
[01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:31.760]   >> Everything else, I'm kinda glad
[01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:33.280]   that the system folder is no longer available,
[01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:36.000]   because every time my kids open up my iPhone,
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.120]   I've got different desktop images and different pieces,
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:40.920]   and they've changed a bunch of settings.
[01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:44.360]   So I think that if you're talking about a school
[01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:45.920]   or a corporation or whatever,
[01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:48.320]   no, you're right.
[01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:49.160]   >> You're right, you're default,
[01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:50.640]   hiding all of that stuff just keeps you full out of trouble.
[01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:52.360]   >> It's exactly what Andy said,
[01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:56.120]   which is if you're smart enough to wanna use the full system,
[01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:57.320]   there's ways to get to it,
[01:20:57.320 --> 01:20:58.760]   but it's just not by default.
[01:20:58.760 --> 01:20:59.960]   It's hidden.
[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:02.360]   >> I also think it's a good trend to try to,
[01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:04.760]   what I was saying before about abstracting the file system,
[01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:06.120]   where it's no longer really important
[01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:08.400]   that I have a certain file that's inside a pictures folder
[01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:10.960]   inside my user directory, inside my documents folder.
[01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:12.960]   So long as whenever I need this file,
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:14.760]   the operating system can help me find it.
[01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:17.200]   So I think it's kinda cool that we now have an on,
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:19.760]   at least an alternate view on my Mac,
[01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:21.520]   that simply says, I know that at some point
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:23.280]   I wrote this outline, I don't know where it is.
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:25.860]   (upbeat music)
[01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:33.080]   I'm actually, I'm reviewing the Nook tablet this week
[01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:35.760]   in the Sun Times, and I looked at the draft
[01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:37.240]   that I finished last night, and I'm saying,
[01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:38.400]   I gotta cut this part down,
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:40.400]   the part where I spent a thousand words
[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:42.560]   basically yelling at everybody who said,
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:44.960]   "Oh, it's luggage, the page turns don't look like
[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:46.280]   "days curved paper anymore."
[01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:47.120]   - I looked at the hair.
[01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:49.560]   - I lunched it and happened, it took three seconds to,
[01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:50.520]   oh, this is a piece of,
[01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:53.000]   oh, what a humiliating embarrassment for,
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:57.840]   oh, for God's sakes, you gotta tab with a cost of $299.
[01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:00.280]   That screams a million different things,
[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:02.400]   and you know what, if I had an extra 300 bucks,
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:05.760]   yes, I would buy an iPad, maybe I don't have an extra 300 bucks,
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:07.560]   and maybe I don't have a pocket that can hold
[01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:08.920]   a thing that's, shh.
[01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:10.280]   - So am I wrong, Andy?
[01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:12.040]   Am I wrong in thinking that this is all about
[01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:15.760]   people's attitude toward, it's where they're coming from, right?
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:18.520]   If you're coming up from like a Kindle, an E in Kindle,
[01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:20.280]   you're gonna have a totally different expectation
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:21.680]   than if you're coming down from an iPad.
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:25.520]   - Well, not only that, I think that when I see not all the,
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:27.840]   not all the like complaining reviews,
[01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:29.880]   but some, but a lot of them,
[01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:34.440]   I'm really taken back to those halcyon days of April in 2010,
[01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:36.040]   if those of you who are listening
[01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:38.240]   who are really going to think back that far,
[01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:40.640]   and you see all these really negative reviews,
[01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:43.520]   the iPad has said, "Oh, I can't believe they built
[01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:45.400]   "a netbook without a keyboard."
[01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:49.280]   It doesn't have even one USB port, let alone three.
[01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:51.080]   Like, okay, you're an idiot.
[01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:53.280]   They didn't decide, they tried, they didn't decide,
[01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:56.360]   what Apple did was they decided not to build a netbook,
[01:22:56.360 --> 01:22:58.680]   but to take all the things that are people are attract,
[01:22:58.680 --> 01:23:00.400]   that attract a netbook to their,
[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:01.720]   they attract them to netbooks,
[01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:06.160]   small, large battery, a huge battery life, inexpensive,
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:09.040]   does a certain core group of things extremely well,
[01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:11.080]   and they articulated it in the form of the iPad.
[01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:14.600]   I really think that the Kindle Fire is that exact same thing
[01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:15.840]   only applied to the iPad.
[01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:17.960]   We're not, they didn't try to make an iPad,
[01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:20.720]   they simply said, "What is it that people really like
[01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:23.280]   "about the iPad, and how can we make this into a product
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:25.520]   "that makes sense for us Amazon?"
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:30.520]   And you start off with 199, not 200199.

[01:26:07.540 --> 01:26:11.540]   - It's hard to justify upgrading from the four to the four S,
[01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:14.460]   although the four S is a lot more significant of an upgrade
[01:26:14.460 --> 01:26:17.780]   than the lack of a change of appearance would indicate.
[01:26:17.780 --> 01:26:19.260]   - Yeah, that's an interesting choice,
[01:26:19.260 --> 01:26:20.740]   although I think that was intentional on Apple
[01:26:20.740 --> 01:26:23.700]   to make you feel okay if you have an iPhone 4, right?
[01:26:23.700 --> 01:26:25.100]   - Yeah, well, not just that, but I mean,
[01:26:25.100 --> 01:26:28.140]   it isn't it silly to think that Apple would design,
[01:26:28.140 --> 01:26:29.740]   would come up with a design as radical
[01:26:29.740 --> 01:26:31.340]   as the design for the iPhone 4,
[01:26:31.340 --> 01:26:33.700]   and then say, no, it's really, it's,
[01:26:33.700 --> 01:26:36.380]   God, that's so 2010, that's so dangerous.
[01:26:36.380 --> 01:26:38.260]   - It's so dated, I really, really don't,
[01:26:38.260 --> 01:26:41.540]   I mean, when you design something that has really no features
[01:26:41.540 --> 01:26:44.180]   like this and it says simple and classic as possible,
[01:26:44.180 --> 01:26:46.420]   the whole point of that design is to make sure
[01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:49.700]   that you could be using this phone five years later,
[01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:50.540]   and--
[01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:53.100]   - Oh, come on Andy, come on, you know that--
[01:26:53.100 --> 01:26:55.900]   - You know that the iPhone 5 will not look this way.
[01:26:55.900 --> 01:26:56.900]   - Or will it?
[01:26:56.900 --> 01:26:58.500]   - Well, I don't know.
[01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:00.620]   It didn't take very long for everybody
[01:27:00.620 --> 01:27:02.820]   to start backpedaling on all of those--
[01:27:02.820 --> 01:27:05.980]   - Yes, all of my iPhone 5 predictions
[01:27:05.980 --> 01:27:08.300]   were absolutely spot on, I assure you,
[01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:10.340]   it's just, and this was a direct quote from somebody
[01:27:10.340 --> 01:27:12.980]   that I don't wanna name 'em, but he was saying,
[01:27:12.980 --> 01:27:17.980]   my sources tell me that when Steve Jobs knew
[01:27:17.980 --> 01:27:20.900]   that the end was coming, he decided that he was going
[01:27:20.900 --> 01:27:24.460]   to put all of his passion into the iPhone 5,
[01:27:24.460 --> 01:27:27.540]   and that the iPhone 4S was a shabby little attempt
[01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:30.140]   at an iPhone, that was fine, so long as he put his passions
[01:27:30.140 --> 01:27:31.940]   into the iPhone 5, all the wonderful features
[01:27:31.940 --> 01:27:33.540]   that I promised you were gonna be having,
[01:27:33.540 --> 01:27:34.380]   we're gonna be in the iPhone 5.
[01:27:34.380 --> 01:27:37.460]   - So that story too, and I thought that was reprehensible.
[01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:39.460]   - Yeah, I thought that was, that's just dumb.
[01:27:39.460 --> 01:27:43.780]   - Using Steve Jobs' name to justify your bad lead
[01:27:43.780 --> 01:27:45.780]   or your bad tip, or--
[01:27:45.780 --> 01:27:47.740]   - Yeah, it's reprehensible.
[01:27:47.740 --> 01:27:51.340]   - Yeah, well, I mean, it takes a, I've done this before,
[01:27:51.340 --> 01:27:54.300]   and I've heard a rumor and had enough data behind it
[01:27:54.300 --> 01:27:57.060]   that I thought it was valuable for someone to hear,
[01:27:57.060 --> 01:28:00.260]   and with great, I was so tentative about
[01:28:00.260 --> 01:28:01.820]   saying this sort of stuff, I did,
[01:28:01.820 --> 01:28:03.260]   and once or twice I've been wrong,
[01:28:03.260 --> 01:28:06.060]   but if that happens, that's life in the NFL.
[01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:09.900]   You gotta say, okay, I wasn't just being irresponsible,
[01:28:09.900 --> 01:28:12.100]   I thought I had it right, but I didn't, oh well.
[01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:14.660]   - And my experience of talking to anyone
[01:28:14.660 --> 01:28:18.020]   that might be down in one infinite loop is that,
[01:28:18.020 --> 01:28:20.260]   when Steve Jobs was there, he pretty much paid attention
[01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:21.340]   to everything.
[01:28:21.340 --> 01:28:23.260]   - Yeah, including the t-shirt design,
[01:28:23.260 --> 01:28:24.900]   and the leather and the--
[01:28:24.900 --> 01:28:27.220]   - Where in the van, I mean.
[01:28:27.220 --> 01:28:28.660]   - Yeah, everything, so it--
[01:28:28.660 --> 01:28:31.060]   - It was really kind of stunning to see that article,
[01:28:31.060 --> 01:28:34.340]   so I'm in to just see somebody double down, like what?
[01:28:34.340 --> 01:28:36.740]   Three days later, I'm talking about that.
[01:28:36.740 --> 01:28:38.180]   - We were right, we're still right.
[01:28:38.180 --> 01:28:40.140]   - You just wait.
[01:28:40.140 --> 01:28:41.420]   Well, come back in a year.
[01:28:41.420 --> 01:28:43.780]   - And I know this is hopeless,
[01:28:43.780 --> 01:28:46.580]   but can we now please just remember
[01:28:46.580 --> 01:28:49.620]   these rumors are worthless, they're worth them,
[01:28:49.620 --> 01:28:51.420]   the toilet paper they're written on?
[01:28:51.420 --> 01:28:52.620]   I mean, it's just--
[01:28:52.620 --> 01:28:53.500]   - Of course we can't.
[01:28:53.500 --> 01:28:54.660]   Three days later, Leo.
[01:28:54.660 --> 01:28:55.500]   - I know, immediately.
[01:28:55.500 --> 01:28:56.860]   - We're talking about it, here we are.
[01:28:56.860 --> 01:28:59.460]   Immediately, it's incredible.
[01:29:00.740 --> 01:29:01.580]   - All right, well.
[01:29:01.580 --> 01:29:03.460]   (laughs)
[01:29:03.460 --> 01:29:05.180]   You know what, I'm glad they didn't change the case
[01:29:05.180 --> 01:29:06.340]   'cause all my accessories still were.
[01:29:06.340 --> 01:29:08.420]   - Well, that's, I think that was one of the big features
[01:29:08.420 --> 01:29:11.300]   of it, not changing is is that I have so many cases,
[01:29:11.300 --> 01:29:12.700]   and I have so many little chargers,
[01:29:12.700 --> 01:29:14.700]   and all kinds of things for my iPhone,
[01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:15.540]   that it was gonna be,
[01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:18.540]   I was a little bit, I was bracing for impact
[01:29:18.540 --> 01:29:20.460]   for a new iPhone 5 that I was gonna get,
[01:29:20.460 --> 01:29:21.620]   and now I have to get a whole bunch of new cases,
[01:29:21.620 --> 01:29:22.820]   and so I was kind of glad.
[01:29:22.820 --> 01:29:26.660]   - Yeah, so gosh, there's so many things to talk about,
[01:29:26.660 --> 01:29:29.820]   I don't wanna kind of lump 'em all in one big bunch,
[01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:33.380]   so let's start with,
[01:29:33.380 --> 01:29:37.780]   golly, I mean, a lot has happened since I was here last.
[01:29:37.780 --> 01:29:41.460]   Let's start with the iPhone 4S sales.
[01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:44.340]   The 4 million, Apple announced,
[01:29:44.340 --> 01:29:48.980]   4 million iPhone 4S is sold in the first weekend.
[01:29:48.980 --> 01:29:51.540]   Not only eclipsing previous iPhone sales,
[01:29:51.540 --> 01:29:54.580]   eclipsing all previous smartphone sales,
[01:29:54.580 --> 01:29:57.740]   not only eclipsing all previous smartphone sales,
[01:29:57.740 --> 01:30:00.860]   possibly the fastest selling consumer electronics device,
[01:30:00.860 --> 01:30:02.980]   of all time, why?
[01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:04.180]   - I'm bad for a minor upgrade.
[01:30:04.180 --> 01:30:08.580]   - Weren't we a little disappointed by what was in this?
[01:30:08.580 --> 01:30:09.900]   Yeah, we thought it was a minor upgrade.
[01:30:09.900 --> 01:30:11.260]   I guess we were wrong.
[01:30:11.260 --> 01:30:14.260]   - Well, is that the pre-orders as well as the,
[01:30:14.260 --> 01:30:15.900]   as well as the new sales?
[01:30:15.900 --> 01:30:16.740]   So that's the,
[01:30:16.740 --> 01:30:18.340]   so there was 3 million pre-orders, I think,
[01:30:18.340 --> 01:30:20.060]   wasn't there in the first weekend now?
[01:30:20.060 --> 01:30:22.660]   So then another million bought them.
[01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:23.820]   - Well, it doesn't, you know, I mean,
[01:30:23.820 --> 01:30:25.180]   the point is that they count it the same way
[01:30:25.180 --> 01:30:26.780]   they always have.
[01:30:26.780 --> 01:30:28.580]   - It's the most sales ever.
[01:30:28.580 --> 01:30:31.620]   That people went to stores and,
[01:30:31.620 --> 01:30:35.980]   or got in the mail their iPhone 4S is 4 million of them.
[01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:37.860]   Partly sprint, right?
[01:30:37.860 --> 01:30:40.060]   Pen up demand at Verizon, right?
[01:30:40.060 --> 01:30:41.500]   - I think this is, I think,
[01:30:41.500 --> 01:30:43.100]   I think with smartphone sales,
[01:30:43.100 --> 01:30:44.580]   there's so many factors that come into play
[01:30:44.580 --> 01:30:46.540]   because it really isn't an,
[01:30:46.540 --> 01:30:49.140]   it's not like an iPod where you can sort of buy one
[01:30:49.140 --> 01:30:50.700]   whenever you want.
[01:30:50.700 --> 01:30:52.620]   This might have been a perfect storm sort of event
[01:30:52.620 --> 01:30:54.260]   where not only were the features there,
[01:30:54.260 --> 01:30:56.180]   not only was it a good presentation,
[01:30:56.180 --> 01:30:59.500]   but also just a lot of people were in a position
[01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:01.580]   where they were able to,
[01:31:01.580 --> 01:31:04.260]   they were able to buy a new phone at this time.
[01:31:04.260 --> 01:31:07.060]   I think that a lot of people were also sort of aiming themselves
[01:31:07.060 --> 01:31:10.220]   towards 2011 as the year that they were gonna finally ditch
[01:31:10.220 --> 01:31:12.660]   whatever they had existing, whether it was a 3GS,
[01:31:12.660 --> 01:31:13.620]   whether it was an Android phone,
[01:31:13.620 --> 01:31:15.860]   whether it was even just a basic feature phone
[01:31:15.860 --> 01:31:17.420]   and finally get into iPhone.
[01:31:17.420 --> 01:31:19.740]   So there's a lot of, there's a lot of factors here.
[01:31:19.740 --> 01:31:21.660]   The fact that there was 4 million units
[01:31:21.660 --> 01:31:23.820]   and like in no time whatsoever,
[01:31:23.820 --> 01:31:25.740]   that's a little bit too many for me
[01:31:25.740 --> 01:31:28.500]   to simply think that Siri and a brand new camera
[01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:29.820]   was enough to get people to say,
[01:31:29.820 --> 01:31:33.020]   yes, now finally, now there's finally voice interaction.
[01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:34.540]   That's what I was waiting for for the iPhone.
[01:31:34.540 --> 01:31:35.740]   I've got to have this phone.
[01:31:35.740 --> 01:31:39.580]   - I also think it's probable that there were a lot of 3GS
[01:31:39.580 --> 01:31:41.740]   and 3G users who finally upgraded,
[01:31:41.740 --> 01:31:44.180]   who hadn't upgraded to 4 for whatever reason.
[01:31:44.180 --> 01:31:46.300]   Maybe they listened to consumer reports, I don't know.
[01:31:46.300 --> 01:31:48.820]   - They were fairly, I mean, they were fairly informal surveys,
[01:31:48.820 --> 01:31:52.300]   but I think you had a Piper Jaffee Analyst, Gene Munster
[01:31:52.300 --> 01:31:55.780]   and somebody else, maybe UBS analyst,
[01:31:55.780 --> 01:31:58.740]   Manor Dami can't remember talking to people online.
[01:31:58.740 --> 01:32:01.060]   And what they were saying was that it was somewhere between
[01:32:01.060 --> 01:32:04.300]   75 and 77% of the people that they talked to were upgrading.
[01:32:04.300 --> 01:32:05.140]   - Aha.
[01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:06.140]   - So I mean, a lot of people were--
[01:32:06.140 --> 01:32:08.540]   - Upgrading for even from iPhone 4.
[01:32:08.540 --> 01:32:09.420]   - Well, it didn't say.
[01:32:09.420 --> 01:32:10.260]   I mean, that's the problem.
[01:32:10.260 --> 01:32:11.100]   They actually, I don't understand,
[01:32:11.100 --> 01:32:12.500]   if you're gonna stand around online,
[01:32:12.500 --> 01:32:14.060]   why don't you ask some really important questions?
[01:32:14.060 --> 01:32:15.540]   Like they didn't talk about how many people
[01:32:15.540 --> 01:32:17.460]   were going from Android to iPhone.
[01:32:17.460 --> 01:32:19.980]   They talked about device makers, generally speaking.
[01:32:19.980 --> 01:32:22.180]   So they know that it was this many people going from LG
[01:32:22.180 --> 01:32:24.260]   to the iPhone, or this many people going from Motorola
[01:32:24.260 --> 01:32:25.100]   to the iPhone.
[01:32:25.100 --> 01:32:27.020]   And so you can sort of say, some of those
[01:32:27.020 --> 01:32:28.660]   are gonna be Android Upgraders, but a lot of them
[01:32:28.660 --> 01:32:30.260]   are just gonna be people who are going from, you know,
[01:32:30.260 --> 01:32:32.020]   dumb phone or flip phones.
[01:32:32.020 --> 01:32:33.820]   I'm actually really curious to see what they say
[01:32:33.820 --> 01:32:36.940]   about iPhone sales on tonight's earnings call,
[01:32:36.940 --> 01:32:38.460]   because the weird thing to me is, I mean,
[01:32:38.460 --> 01:32:39.860]   we all talk tech, right?
[01:32:39.860 --> 01:32:41.780]   There are so many people who just didn't even seem
[01:32:41.780 --> 01:32:43.500]   to realize that we hadn't gotten a new iPhone
[01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:46.500]   over the summer, and that we were about to get a new iPhone.
[01:32:46.500 --> 01:32:48.100]   People were just still going to Apple stores
[01:32:48.100 --> 01:32:49.020]   and buying phones.
[01:32:49.020 --> 01:32:52.020]   So I mean, I'm wondering if even going into
[01:32:52.020 --> 01:32:54.380]   what we thought was gonna be an iPhone 5 or an iPhone 4s
[01:32:54.380 --> 01:32:56.060]   or an iPhone Super or whatever we thought
[01:32:56.060 --> 01:32:57.100]   it was gonna be called.
[01:32:57.100 --> 01:32:58.380]   I'm wondering if even going into that,
[01:32:58.380 --> 01:33:01.660]   we still saw a record number of iPhone sales last quarter.
[01:33:01.660 --> 01:33:03.140]   - Yeah, I bet we could happen.
[01:33:03.140 --> 01:33:04.500]   - I bet we did.
[01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:05.780]   Like I just sit there and just go, you know,
[01:33:05.780 --> 01:33:07.300]   "Text, you know, text Doug."
[01:33:07.300 --> 01:33:08.140]   And then I go, "Okay, better."
[01:33:08.140 --> 01:33:09.780]   - I like it better if you say, "Tell Doug."
[01:33:09.780 --> 01:33:11.380]   It's just so imperative.
[01:33:11.380 --> 01:33:13.140]   - Tell Doug, it works.
[01:33:13.140 --> 01:33:13.980]   - Yeah.
[01:33:13.980 --> 01:33:17.220]   - Oh, the only, I just love just saying tell,
[01:33:17.220 --> 01:33:19.060]   "Tell Alex I'm gonna be late."
[01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:20.500]   I just love doing that.
[01:33:20.500 --> 01:33:22.820]   And it says, "Okay."
[01:33:22.820 --> 01:33:25.500]   - Well, and one of the things that's a little,
[01:33:25.500 --> 01:33:27.580]   a little no, it definitely feels like dragon.
[01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:29.140]   So if you've used dragon software,
[01:33:29.140 --> 01:33:30.940]   you know, you can put all your punctuation in as well.
[01:33:30.940 --> 01:33:32.740]   - So you can period question mark.
[01:33:32.740 --> 01:33:34.380]   - Can you say period, question mark, quotes.
[01:33:34.380 --> 01:33:36.260]   - Can you say bang, hash bang?
[01:33:36.260 --> 01:33:37.500]   - I don't know, I haven't tried that.
[01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:38.340]   - I have to try that.
[01:33:38.340 --> 01:33:39.700]   - But I've done like open, open parenthesis,
[01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:42.140]   close parenthesis, you know, like all that stuff
[01:33:42.140 --> 01:33:44.060]   can be put in.
[01:33:44.060 --> 01:33:46.700]   It is easier, I have to say, to input like text messages.
[01:33:46.700 --> 01:33:49.940]   If you use the, when you open up the keyboard
[01:33:49.940 --> 01:33:51.660]   and use the little microphone,
[01:33:51.660 --> 01:33:53.620]   because I have to admit, when you tell Siri,
[01:33:53.620 --> 01:33:56.260]   I wanna text somebody, she cuts you off so fast.
[01:33:56.260 --> 01:33:57.460]   Like if you have to think for a second
[01:33:57.460 --> 01:33:59.660]   about what you wanna say, she immediately goes,
[01:33:59.660 --> 01:34:00.500]   "Okay, that's enough."
[01:34:00.500 --> 01:34:02.420]   - One thing Apple does very differently from Android.
[01:34:02.420 --> 01:34:04.940]   Now, admittedly, Android has these voice commands,
[01:34:04.940 --> 01:34:06.220]   voice actions, and I have used them.
[01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:08.540]   I'm one of the few, 'cause I always tell people,
[01:34:08.540 --> 01:34:11.540]   use them using their great, 'cause I love them.
[01:34:11.540 --> 01:34:13.020]   I do believe the recognition is better,
[01:34:13.020 --> 01:34:14.740]   but that's one significant difference.
[01:34:14.740 --> 01:34:17.340]   Siri, if you use the keyboard microphone,
[01:34:17.340 --> 01:34:20.540]   will patiently wait for you to say, "I'm done."
[01:34:20.540 --> 01:34:23.060]   And can go on and on and on,
[01:34:23.060 --> 01:34:24.420]   and Android will not do that.
[01:34:24.420 --> 01:34:26.700]   Android will stop as soon as you pause,
[01:34:26.700 --> 01:34:27.900]   often and, and, and, and, and,
[01:34:27.900 --> 01:34:29.140]   and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,
[01:34:29.140 --> 01:34:30.900]   and the other thing is, is that if you have pages
[01:34:30.900 --> 01:34:33.940]   on, on, on your iPhone,
[01:34:33.940 --> 01:34:35.140]   you can sit there and just hit it,
[01:34:35.140 --> 01:34:37.300]   and then just dictate, and then, entire,
[01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:39.140]   you know, and you can just keep on dictating,
[01:34:39.140 --> 01:34:40.900]   like you would with, with, with Dragon,
[01:34:40.900 --> 01:34:42.820]   and then, when you look at the iCloud,
[01:34:42.820 --> 01:34:44.380]   then you can have it available on something else
[01:34:44.380 --> 01:34:46.300]   to clean it up and, and do anything else you want with it.
[01:34:46.300 --> 01:34:48.620]   It's pretty, you know, it's one of those things
[01:34:48.620 --> 01:34:50.540]   where we talk about, and I know Andy especially
[01:34:50.540 --> 01:34:53.620]   talks about a lot, the, the subtle fit and finish.
[01:34:53.620 --> 01:34:55.140]   He's talking to Siri right now.
[01:34:55.140 --> 01:34:56.460]   The subtle fit and finish.
[01:34:56.460 --> 01:34:57.820]   I saw you do that.
[01:34:57.820 --> 01:34:59.780]   - No, no, I was just, I was, go ahead, I was just.
[01:34:59.780 --> 01:35:03.900]   - The subtle fit and finish that Apple adds to something
[01:35:03.900 --> 01:35:06.860]   is enough, to me, to put me over the top
[01:35:06.860 --> 01:35:07.940]   and using this.
[01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:10.220]   I used it on Android, and I still use it on Android,
[01:35:10.220 --> 01:35:13.260]   it's just a little bit, but just enough a little bit better.
[01:35:13.260 --> 01:35:15.100]   - Yeah, yeah, I really think it works well.
[01:35:15.100 --> 01:35:16.780]   It's really some, some basic things.
[01:35:16.780 --> 01:35:19.420]   I'm still shocked that the, that Android speech synthesis
[01:35:19.420 --> 01:35:21.260]   is so awful.
[01:35:21.260 --> 01:35:25.580]   It's, Siri will say, I, okay, hey,
[01:35:25.580 --> 01:35:27.780]   I've scheduled you an appointment for 2 p.m. Tuesday.
[01:35:27.780 --> 01:35:29.340]   Two has a lunch with Leo.
[01:35:29.340 --> 01:35:32.100]   And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,
[01:35:32.100 --> 01:35:35.380]   well, there is one thing that Android has,
[01:35:35.380 --> 01:35:36.500]   that, that Siri does not have,
[01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:38.060]   you can change the voices on Android,
[01:35:38.060 --> 01:35:40.460]   and you can put better voices on Android.
[01:35:40.460 --> 01:35:42.340]   - Yeah, but why would you ship it with a piece of crap?
[01:35:42.340 --> 01:35:43.940]   - Well, I'm sorry to say, I'm just saying space.
[01:35:43.940 --> 01:35:46.180]   Probably I would be, I might guess, but I don't know.
[01:35:46.180 --> 01:35:47.100]   - Yeah, well, whatever.
[01:35:47.100 --> 01:35:49.420]   - No, I, I think that's phone specific,
[01:35:49.420 --> 01:35:51.180]   by the way, manufacturer specific.
[01:35:51.180 --> 01:35:53.420]   But, S-Vox is a tool that you can add,
[01:35:53.420 --> 01:35:55.060]   and will allow you to add other voices.
[01:35:55.060 --> 01:35:57.260]   This is, this is the other side of the equation,
[01:35:57.260 --> 01:35:58.540]   as long as I'm gonna be fair,
[01:35:58.540 --> 01:36:00.420]   yes, fit and finish is better on Apple,
[01:36:00.420 --> 01:36:01.660]   but it's much more restrictive.
[01:36:01.660 --> 01:36:04.820]   You can't, you know, you're stuck with the voice they give you.
[01:36:04.820 --> 01:36:05.660]   - But I think that that--
[01:36:05.660 --> 01:36:06.740]   - You can't change it to the British voice.
[01:36:06.740 --> 01:36:09.780]   Apparently though, if you change it to the foreign language
[01:36:09.780 --> 01:36:13.340]   voices, it doesn't, it doesn't do as well, or as much.
[01:36:13.340 --> 01:36:14.980]   It's very interesting.
[01:36:14.980 --> 01:36:17.820]   - Well, I think that by staying focused on one thing,
[01:36:17.820 --> 01:36:20.260]   rather than making it available, it's easier to make it
[01:36:20.260 --> 01:36:21.780]   more stable, it's easier to make it more--
[01:36:21.780 --> 01:36:23.460]   - They're probably concomitant features.
[01:36:23.460 --> 01:36:24.460]   - Also, yeah.
[01:36:24.460 --> 01:36:26.980]   - Also, this is one of the reasons why they're calling it
[01:36:26.980 --> 01:36:29.180]   a beta, one of the things that is explicitly on their
[01:36:29.180 --> 01:36:31.860]   to-do list is to expand the international reach
[01:36:31.860 --> 01:36:33.820]   and the international compatibility of Siri.
[01:36:33.820 --> 01:36:37.900]   So, if there's a reason why Apple has done this,
[01:36:37.900 --> 01:36:40.020]   kind of unprecedented thing, you think of the last time,
[01:36:40.020 --> 01:36:42.540]   I think the last time they actually released a beta
[01:36:42.540 --> 01:36:45.060]   into the public was the first public beta of OAuth 10,
[01:36:45.060 --> 01:36:46.540]   at 10.0.
[01:36:46.540 --> 01:36:48.180]   So, the idea that they're saying,
[01:36:48.180 --> 01:36:51.100]   we got something really cool, we think that it's useful
[01:36:51.100 --> 01:36:54.340]   as it exists right now, but we can't figure out how people
[01:36:54.340 --> 01:36:56.380]   are going to want to use it until lots of people
[01:36:56.380 --> 01:36:57.340]   start using it.
[01:36:57.340 --> 01:37:02.220]   So, for the first six months, it spends a lot of time saying,
[01:37:02.220 --> 01:37:04.820]   I don't know what you mean by do these pants
[01:37:04.820 --> 01:37:05.980]   to make my butt look big.
[01:37:05.980 --> 01:37:08.180]   We like me to search on the web for it now,
[01:37:08.180 --> 01:37:09.260]   then that's the sort of thing that's gonna be
[01:37:09.260 --> 01:37:10.540]   the first three or four months.
[01:37:10.540 --> 01:37:11.660]   - Oh, I mean, there's so much.
[01:37:11.660 --> 01:37:15.100]   New voices, SDKs, you know, certainly they should know
[01:37:15.100 --> 01:37:18.540]   other apps should be able to work with Siri and vice versa.
[01:37:18.540 --> 01:37:21.500]   But I do believe that all of this will be fixed
[01:37:21.500 --> 01:37:22.420]   once they come out of beta.
[01:37:22.420 --> 01:37:25.700]   Apple's, I can't remember Apple doing a public beta
[01:37:25.700 --> 01:37:27.260]   on a product like this before.
[01:37:27.260 --> 01:37:28.580]   You know, the--
[01:37:28.580 --> 01:37:29.420]   - It's more like, it's probably,
[01:37:29.420 --> 01:37:31.260]   I don't want anyone to overhear me saying,
[01:37:31.260 --> 01:37:35.060]   "Lord of not go, master of all he surveys,
[01:37:35.060 --> 01:37:35.900]   creator of world--"
[01:37:35.900 --> 01:37:37.460]   - There's the negative.
[01:37:37.460 --> 01:37:39.300]   - There's the negative, and you can see what it does
[01:37:39.300 --> 01:37:41.860]   on your contact card on the iPhone.
[01:37:41.860 --> 01:37:43.820]   It actually puts in quotes below your name,
[01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:45.540]   the name you've chosen.
[01:37:45.540 --> 01:37:48.820]   And so you see it says, "Leo, gorgeous quote."
[01:37:48.820 --> 01:37:49.660]   So I'm gonna have to-- - Excuse me,
[01:37:49.660 --> 01:37:51.100]   if I have my Klingon name.
[01:37:51.100 --> 01:37:53.140]   (laughing)
[01:37:53.140 --> 01:37:57.460]   - Arndel, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
[01:37:57.460 --> 01:37:59.460]   - If you had an iPhone 4S, Ken,
[01:37:59.460 --> 01:38:01.300]   what would you have Siri call you?
[01:38:01.300 --> 01:38:04.220]   - I don't know, you have, I sort of stump now.
[01:38:04.220 --> 01:38:05.060]   (laughing)
[01:38:05.060 --> 01:38:06.220]   Probably some kind of,
[01:38:06.220 --> 01:38:07.660]   it'd probably be some kind of superhero,
[01:38:07.660 --> 01:38:09.260]   that'd reach back to mythology.
[01:38:09.260 --> 01:38:11.100]   I don't know which, not Zeus.
[01:38:11.100 --> 01:38:12.380]   - Is Zeus's dad?
[01:38:12.380 --> 01:38:13.860]   - Zeus's dad, Thor?
[01:38:13.860 --> 01:38:14.700]   I don't know.
[01:38:14.700 --> 01:38:16.340]   - No. - That's a whole different--
[01:38:16.340 --> 01:38:18.340]   - That's a whole different galaxy.
[01:38:18.340 --> 01:38:19.620]   - That's a different mythology, yeah.
[01:38:19.620 --> 01:38:20.460]   - Did Zeus have a dad?
[01:38:20.460 --> 01:38:22.260]   I thought he was the father of all things.
[01:38:22.260 --> 01:38:24.220]   - Well, no, there were, I mean, weren't the Titans.
[01:38:24.220 --> 01:38:25.060]   - Wait a minute.
[01:38:25.060 --> 01:38:26.420]   - You know who's gonna know?
[01:38:26.420 --> 01:38:27.740]   - What am I thinking? - I think he would know that.
[01:38:27.740 --> 01:38:29.180]   - Yes.
[01:38:29.180 --> 01:38:31.420]   - Let's just, who is Zeus's dad?
[01:38:31.420 --> 01:38:34.300]   If you ask it, who's your daddy?
[01:38:34.300 --> 01:38:35.740]   It gives you some funny answers.
[01:38:37.100 --> 01:38:39.100]   - No, it's-- - I think it was Cronos.
[01:38:39.100 --> 01:38:41.860]   - Cronos, I think Cronos was the father of Tum.
[01:38:41.860 --> 01:38:44.180]   - Yeah, chatter is faster than Ciri.
[01:38:44.180 --> 01:38:48.180]   - Who is Zeus's dad?
[01:38:48.180 --> 01:38:51.340]   It's it, I don't know, Liz's dad.
[01:38:51.340 --> 01:38:53.740]   - I don't know who Zeus's father is.
[01:38:53.740 --> 01:38:55.740]   - Oh, I'm dead.
[01:38:55.740 --> 01:38:56.580]   - Just don't worry.
[01:38:56.580 --> 01:38:58.820]   - Just think about how powerful Ciri would be
[01:38:58.820 --> 01:39:01.780]   if it was connected to something like the mechanical Turk.
[01:39:01.780 --> 01:39:03.220]   Where there was some sort of algorithm
[01:39:03.220 --> 01:39:06.060]   that sort of went through some sort of system,
[01:39:06.060 --> 01:39:08.620]   kind of like the poll the audience on,
[01:39:08.620 --> 01:39:09.820]   who wants to be a millionaire.
[01:39:09.820 --> 01:39:11.540]   Where it goes out on the list of anybody
[01:39:11.540 --> 01:39:13.980]   who gets like one penny for every correct answer,
[01:39:13.980 --> 01:39:17.860]   it will feed back, if it gets like X number of answers
[01:39:17.860 --> 01:39:19.980]   that are agreed upon by random people,
[01:39:19.980 --> 01:39:21.940]   figures out that, okay, that I bet that that is
[01:39:21.940 --> 01:39:23.100]   the correct answer to Zeus's dad,
[01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:25.020]   but it'll say according to the,
[01:39:25.020 --> 01:39:27.540]   according to a bunch of random strangers.
[01:39:27.540 --> 01:39:29.460]   - This is why an SDK is important.
[01:39:29.460 --> 01:39:31.700]   This is why Apple, well, it's not traditionally
[01:39:31.700 --> 01:39:33.220]   how Apple does things, but it would love it
[01:39:33.220 --> 01:39:34.460]   if Apple would open this up
[01:39:34.460 --> 01:39:37.260]   so that you could in fact have an app, for instance,
[01:39:37.260 --> 01:39:38.580]   it would be a mechanical Turk app,
[01:39:38.580 --> 01:39:40.460]   or you could even tell Ciri.
[01:39:40.460 --> 01:39:42.300]   You can't even launch apps with Ciri right now,
[01:39:42.300 --> 01:39:45.500]   which is kind of, I think, I'm just really curious.
[01:39:45.500 --> 01:39:48.220]   - I think there's a psychological aspect here
[01:39:48.220 --> 01:39:50.660]   that we all know that Ciri is an AI,
[01:39:50.660 --> 01:39:52.980]   it's just a piece of software, it's a nice feature on a phone,
[01:39:52.980 --> 01:39:54.980]   but it really plugs into that part of our brain
[01:39:54.980 --> 01:39:57.740]   that recognizes a specific personality
[01:39:57.740 --> 01:39:59.740]   and how we trust that one person
[01:39:59.740 --> 01:40:01.620]   and how we communicate with that one person.
[01:40:01.620 --> 01:40:03.220]   And if we, I think this is a case
[01:40:03.220 --> 01:40:04.900]   where we really do need a curation
[01:40:04.900 --> 01:40:07.860]   so that things that Ciri can say back
[01:40:07.860 --> 01:40:09.180]   and answers that they can provide
[01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:12.300]   are never really variable, that they're consistent
[01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:14.500]   and that they're basically being funneled through,
[01:40:14.500 --> 01:40:16.100]   even if it's just one copy that decides
[01:40:16.100 --> 01:40:18.340]   that we're gonna trust these three sources
[01:40:18.340 --> 01:40:19.500]   for navigation information,
[01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:21.980]   we're gonna trust these four sources
[01:40:21.980 --> 01:40:24.460]   for movie information or movie show times
[01:40:24.460 --> 01:40:25.540]   and stuff like that.
[01:40:25.540 --> 01:40:28.500]   So I'm not sure if there were free for all API
[01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:30.780]   where I'm suddenly getting answers
[01:40:30.780 --> 01:40:33.780]   from the novelty Valley Girl Speak generator
[01:40:33.780 --> 01:40:38.780]   on what's the safe cooking temperature for a steak?
[01:40:38.780 --> 01:40:40.900]   Oh my God, I think it must be like 100 degrees or something.
[01:40:40.900 --> 01:40:41.900]   - Oh my God. - Yeah.
[01:40:41.900 --> 01:40:43.260]   - Really? - And I think that also,
[01:40:43.260 --> 01:40:45.220]   I think that one of the things that Apple
[01:40:45.220 --> 01:40:49.020]   has consistently done is do things very slowly.
[01:40:49.020 --> 01:40:50.300]   They introduce a new feature
[01:40:50.300 --> 01:40:53.940]   and then they're gonna let it stabilize and figure it out.
[01:40:53.940 --> 01:40:55.700]   I mean, we didn't have applications on our iPhone
[01:40:55.700 --> 01:40:56.700]   when we first got it,
[01:40:56.700 --> 01:40:58.660]   other than the ones that Apple gave us
[01:40:58.660 --> 01:41:00.460]   and then they slowly open that up
[01:41:00.460 --> 01:41:01.860]   and they slowly open these things up
[01:41:01.860 --> 01:41:03.700]   in a way that they can control it
[01:41:03.700 --> 01:41:08.060]   and try to maintain some kind of quality assurances.
[01:41:08.060 --> 01:41:10.380]   And so I think that what we're seeing right now
[01:41:10.380 --> 01:41:13.300]   is a very, very, very early version of Siri.
[01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:16.420]   I think this is gonna get much bigger, much more complex.
[01:41:16.420 --> 01:41:17.540]   - Do you love me?
[01:41:17.540 --> 01:41:23.340]   - I'm not allowed to.
[01:41:23.340 --> 01:41:27.860]   - Well, sometimes Siri doesn't do what you want it to do.
[01:41:27.860 --> 01:41:30.020]   So we're gonna come back with our final segment
[01:41:30.020 --> 01:41:32.460]   from the best of 2011 for Mac Break Weekly.
[01:41:32.460 --> 01:41:33.620]   Hope you're enjoying this.
[01:41:33.620 --> 01:41:35.220]   Before we get to the final segments,
[01:41:35.220 --> 01:41:37.100]   I would like to mention something
[01:41:37.100 --> 01:41:37.940]   we've been using lately.
[01:41:37.940 --> 01:41:39.420]   It's this.
[01:41:39.420 --> 01:41:40.820]   You don't see this very often.
[01:41:40.820 --> 01:41:43.060]   A phone, but it's not just any old phone.
[01:41:43.060 --> 01:41:44.980]   This is our Ring Central phone.
[01:41:44.980 --> 01:41:45.940]   And you know, it's amazing.
[01:41:45.940 --> 01:41:49.420]   I've been using the Ring Central app on iPhone.
[01:41:49.420 --> 01:41:51.380]   They have an Android app as well.
[01:41:51.380 --> 01:41:54.940]   And it's cool because I can check all my phone calls,
[01:41:54.940 --> 01:41:56.300]   all my messages.
[01:41:56.300 --> 01:41:58.540]   Occasionally, almost always a message comes in
[01:41:58.540 --> 01:41:59.780]   that I don't want to handle.
[01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:03.500]   I forward it off to Lisa, my business partner,
[01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:04.740]   Eileen, my producer.
[01:42:04.740 --> 01:42:07.780]   It really is incredible.
[01:42:07.780 --> 01:42:10.700]   This phone system, if you wanna put a phone system
[01:42:10.700 --> 01:42:12.860]   in your business, you don't wanna PBX in the basement.
[01:42:12.860 --> 01:42:14.980]   You want the complexity, the service,
[01:42:14.980 --> 01:42:15.900]   contract and all of that.
[01:42:15.900 --> 01:42:19.140]   I want you to take a look at RingCentral.com.
[01:42:19.140 --> 01:42:21.860]   Not only is it very affordable, very easy to set up.
[01:42:21.860 --> 01:42:24.580]   You just literally plug in the phone and it works.
[01:42:24.580 --> 01:42:26.580]   But the features you get that you can't get
[01:42:26.580 --> 01:42:28.660]   on a standard PBX are amazing.
[01:42:28.660 --> 01:42:30.180]   It's not facts in your inbox.
[01:42:30.180 --> 01:42:31.380]   Email messages.
[01:42:31.380 --> 01:42:33.940]   The apps, the ability to forward calls
[01:42:33.940 --> 01:42:36.380]   from the phone here to my phone here.
[01:42:36.380 --> 01:42:38.660]   It's mind-boggling.
[01:42:38.660 --> 01:42:41.780]   This is the best way to put a phone in your office.
[01:42:41.780 --> 01:42:43.740]   We didn't wanna put a traditional phone system
[01:42:43.740 --> 01:42:45.580]   in the Twit Brick House and we're so happy
[01:42:45.580 --> 01:42:46.500]   we went with RingCentral.
[01:42:46.500 --> 01:42:47.340]   I think you will be too.
[01:42:47.340 --> 01:42:51.020]   Find out more at RingCentral.com.
[01:42:51.020 --> 01:42:54.060]   And now our final moments from 2011.
[01:42:54.060 --> 01:42:55.660]   What are we gonna talk about?
[01:42:56.580 --> 01:42:58.820]   Oh, this is kind of the sad part.
[01:42:58.820 --> 01:43:00.860]   2011, a big year for Apple News,
[01:43:00.860 --> 01:43:04.620]   but also of course a very sad year for Apple fans.
[01:43:04.620 --> 01:43:07.020]   And we'll take a look at how we found out
[01:43:07.020 --> 01:43:11.380]   about Steve Jobs passing and some of the eulogizing we did.
[01:43:11.380 --> 01:43:12.900]   That's coming up next.
[01:43:12.900 --> 01:43:15.480]   (gentle music)
[01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:21.700]   - We're gonna interrupt briefly
[01:43:21.700 --> 01:43:25.700]   because we're starting to see some activity on Twitter
[01:43:25.700 --> 01:43:28.500]   about Steve Jobs and I just wanna check on this
[01:43:28.500 --> 01:43:31.260]   because we don't wanna fall for a phony story,
[01:43:31.260 --> 01:43:34.340]   but I believe AP is reporting that Steve Jobs has passed away.
[01:43:34.340 --> 01:43:36.700]   So we're gonna check this real quickly
[01:43:36.700 --> 01:43:38.180]   before we go any farther.
[01:43:38.180 --> 01:43:42.580]   And of course, there was a rumor,
[01:43:42.580 --> 01:43:45.100]   remember a couple of weeks ago that he had
[01:43:45.100 --> 01:43:51.420]   and we will check that and get as quick as we can.
[01:43:51.420 --> 01:43:53.660]   It is cross, it's one of those things
[01:43:53.660 --> 01:43:55.460]   that's all over Twitter.
[01:43:55.460 --> 01:43:59.500]   AP is saying that Steve Jobs has passed away.
[01:43:59.500 --> 01:44:01.100]   - But AP have said things that aren't true before,
[01:44:01.100 --> 01:44:02.100]   let's say. - Yeah, so we will
[01:44:02.100 --> 01:44:05.540]   absolutely check on this, but it is absolutely
[01:44:05.540 --> 01:44:06.900]   all over Twitter right now.
[01:44:06.900 --> 01:44:12.420]   And that would explain of course why Steve Jobs
[01:44:12.420 --> 01:44:14.140]   did not make an appearance yesterday.
[01:44:14.140 --> 01:44:16.940]   - If, yeah.
[01:44:16.940 --> 01:44:19.300]   - Did you work with Steve or was it after Steve's era
[01:44:19.300 --> 01:44:21.060]   when you went to Apple?
[01:44:21.060 --> 01:44:24.100]   - I actually went there just as he came back.
[01:44:24.100 --> 01:44:28.500]   So I, as I said, we've been doing these CD-ROM things
[01:44:28.500 --> 01:44:31.300]   and then the internet did for CD-ROMs.
[01:44:31.300 --> 01:44:32.900]   And so the company I was working for
[01:44:32.900 --> 01:44:34.860]   we didn't manage to jump in time,
[01:44:34.860 --> 01:44:36.980]   to pivot in time if you like.
[01:44:36.980 --> 01:44:38.900]   And we were, the engineering side of being saying,
[01:44:38.900 --> 01:44:42.180]   "Let's work on the web, let's do more web-based stuff."
[01:44:42.180 --> 01:44:44.260]   And the business side was like,
[01:44:44.260 --> 01:44:46.060]   "No, no, these CD-ROM things are obviously profitable.
[01:44:46.060 --> 01:44:48.260]   "We make a million dollars for doing one of these,
[01:44:48.260 --> 01:44:49.540]   "because you keep doing those."
[01:44:49.540 --> 01:44:51.780]   And that was true up until Christmas '96
[01:44:51.780 --> 01:44:53.380]   and suddenly that wasn't true anymore.
[01:44:53.380 --> 01:44:54.860]   And then we was trying to do
[01:44:54.860 --> 01:45:00.340]   the web development will be the same kind of production model
[01:45:00.340 --> 01:45:01.500]   that we had for the CD stuff,
[01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:04.420]   which was, which was, we didn't really have a great fit.
[01:45:04.420 --> 01:45:06.780]   And one of the things that I wanted to do
[01:45:06.780 --> 01:45:09.420]   was to build the 3D Atlas of the web,
[01:45:09.420 --> 01:45:11.820]   which was, and we had a prototype
[01:45:11.820 --> 01:45:14.060]   that was downloading tiles over the internet.
[01:45:14.060 --> 01:45:15.740]   - Yeah, Apple is now confirming this, by the way.
[01:45:15.740 --> 01:45:18.020]   Apple is confirming. - Yeah, Steve Jobs.
[01:45:18.020 --> 01:45:20.340]   - Yeah, please do a breaking list right now.
[01:45:20.340 --> 01:45:21.580]   - Oh, wow. - Yeah.
[01:45:21.580 --> 01:45:22.700]   - Actually, I'm glad you're here, Kevin.
[01:45:22.700 --> 01:45:24.420]   I can't imagine anybody better to have here
[01:45:24.420 --> 01:45:27.260]   to do a talk about. - That's pretty sad.
[01:45:27.260 --> 01:45:28.340]   - It's very sad.
[01:45:28.340 --> 01:45:29.340]   He's very young.
[01:45:29.340 --> 01:45:34.880]   And of course, MarketWatch has the story right now.
[01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:39.580]   - Wall Street Journal also reporting no details,
[01:45:39.580 --> 01:45:43.260]   just the fact that Apple has reported it.
[01:45:43.260 --> 01:45:44.100]   - Very sad.
[01:45:46.020 --> 01:45:49.220]   How much did you work with Steve at the time?
[01:45:49.220 --> 01:45:50.660]   - Not only indirectly.
[01:45:50.660 --> 01:45:52.060]   I didn't work with him directly.
[01:45:52.060 --> 01:45:57.060]   I saw him in the early '90s when he was at next,
[01:45:57.060 --> 01:46:00.700]   we went and pitched the media editing stuff to him there.
[01:46:00.700 --> 01:46:02.220]   That was when I got the sort of full force
[01:46:02.220 --> 01:46:04.100]   of the Steve demo in a small room.
[01:46:04.100 --> 01:46:05.100]   - Oh yeah.
[01:46:05.100 --> 01:46:07.100]   Tell me about that. - What is that like?
[01:46:07.100 --> 01:46:10.820]   - That was, we were visiting the developer guy there,
[01:46:10.820 --> 01:46:12.340]   talking about video editing, what was possible
[01:46:12.340 --> 01:46:13.300]   on the next step.
[01:46:13.300 --> 01:46:16.300]   And then Steve walked in with a lawyer
[01:46:16.300 --> 01:46:18.340]   he was pitching the next machine to,
[01:46:18.340 --> 01:46:22.700]   and then sat down and gave this almost a one-on-one
[01:46:22.700 --> 01:46:25.180]   full press demo of the next and what it could do
[01:46:25.180 --> 01:46:28.500]   and how you could have audio and video
[01:46:28.500 --> 01:46:31.140]   and full images in your email,
[01:46:31.140 --> 01:46:33.260]   how you could revolutionize communication in the company
[01:46:33.260 --> 01:46:35.060]   and how this would change everything.
[01:46:35.060 --> 01:46:40.060]   It was very much a net centric vision in like 1991-ish.
[01:46:41.100 --> 01:46:46.100]   So it very much, he had that insight at that time.
[01:46:46.100 --> 01:46:50.700]   And the next was what the web was built on.
[01:46:50.700 --> 01:46:54.420]   So that sort of insight early on that networking
[01:46:54.420 --> 01:46:56.580]   was the future was definitely,
[01:46:56.580 --> 01:46:58.620]   a big chunk of that was Steve's vision too.
[01:46:58.620 --> 01:47:01.660]   - Contrast that to Microsoft,
[01:47:01.660 --> 01:47:04.740]   where they didn't know for another three or four years
[01:47:04.740 --> 01:47:06.860]   that the internet was going to be anything.
[01:47:06.860 --> 01:47:08.580]   - They didn't, yeah, they didn't see that coming.
[01:47:08.580 --> 01:47:12.340]   And there's a great video of Steve Jobs
[01:47:12.340 --> 01:47:16.140]   from the developer conference in 1996-97
[01:47:16.140 --> 01:47:18.140]   where he's doing Q&A with the audience.
[01:47:18.140 --> 01:47:21.460]   This is before he'd actually been appointed CEO, I think.
[01:47:21.460 --> 01:47:22.700]   This was '97.
[01:47:22.700 --> 01:47:24.300]   And he said,
[01:47:24.300 --> 01:47:27.380]   I have this idea of things that we could do
[01:47:27.380 --> 01:47:29.060]   by connecting the computer to the network
[01:47:29.060 --> 01:47:29.940]   and there are a bunch of products
[01:47:29.940 --> 01:47:31.300]   that I really want to build here.
[01:47:31.300 --> 01:47:32.340]   And if you listen to that talk,
[01:47:32.340 --> 01:47:34.740]   you can actually see all the prefiguring
[01:47:34.740 --> 01:47:37.780]   of all the things that were built out later.
[01:47:37.780 --> 01:47:39.340]   - In 1997.
[01:47:39.340 --> 01:47:40.180]   - 1970.
[01:47:40.180 --> 01:47:43.260]   He always had this long-term view.
[01:47:43.260 --> 01:47:44.300]   - Let me play a little bit of that.
[01:47:44.300 --> 01:47:49.380]   I think I have it at the '97 closing keynote.
[01:47:49.380 --> 01:47:50.540]   I think this is it.
[01:47:50.540 --> 01:47:52.660]   ♪ I'm a privilege of forever bad ♪
[01:47:52.660 --> 01:47:54.180]   ♪ I get all this money ♪
[01:47:54.180 --> 01:47:55.660]   ♪ Like the world that I've developed ♪
[01:47:55.660 --> 01:47:56.540]   - Developers conference.
[01:47:56.540 --> 01:47:57.380]   - I'll skip.
[01:47:57.380 --> 01:48:00.260]   - Thank you and you know, you changed my life.
[01:48:00.260 --> 01:48:02.060]   And I sort of thought about Jeff for a while,
[01:48:02.060 --> 01:48:03.460]   but that's really rude.
[01:48:03.460 --> 01:48:05.580]   And it probably happens to him all the time
[01:48:05.580 --> 01:48:06.620]   and I don't want to be like that.
[01:48:06.620 --> 01:48:08.020]   So I didn't do it.
[01:48:08.020 --> 01:48:10.140]   And in a way, I'm kind of glad that I hesitated
[01:48:10.140 --> 01:48:12.140]   because it gives me an opportunity
[01:48:12.140 --> 01:48:15.420]   to thank him this morning in a public setting
[01:48:15.420 --> 01:48:18.540]   among people who probably understand that
[01:48:18.540 --> 01:48:20.860]   better than anyone else on the planet.
[01:48:20.860 --> 01:48:22.860]   So it's a special pleasure this morning
[01:48:22.860 --> 01:48:25.460]   to introduce and thank a person
[01:48:25.460 --> 01:48:27.700]   who has changed so many of our lives.
[01:48:27.700 --> 01:48:28.540]   Good job.
[01:48:28.540 --> 01:48:29.380]   (audience applauding)
[01:48:29.380 --> 01:48:33.700]   - This is from the 1997 WWDC.
[01:48:33.700 --> 01:48:35.380]   Jotch had just come back.
[01:48:35.380 --> 01:48:36.220]   - Thank you.
[01:48:36.220 --> 01:48:37.300]   - You're welcome.
[01:48:37.300 --> 01:48:41.260]   (audience applauding)
[01:48:41.260 --> 01:48:42.100]   - Thank you.
[01:48:42.100 --> 01:48:42.940]   - Thank you.
[01:48:42.940 --> 01:48:45.260]   (audience applauding)
[01:48:45.260 --> 01:48:46.100]   - Morning.
[01:48:46.100 --> 01:48:49.500]   Thank you very much.
[01:48:49.500 --> 01:48:52.420]   (audience applauding)
[01:48:52.420 --> 01:48:53.700]   - And there's a lot of developers
[01:48:53.700 --> 01:48:55.740]   happy to get Steve back, I'll tell you that.
[01:48:55.740 --> 01:48:57.020]   (audience applauding)
[01:48:57.020 --> 01:48:59.300]   - All right, people are morning beer also.
[01:48:59.300 --> 01:49:00.540]   Right here in the nation's capital
[01:49:00.540 --> 01:49:03.100]   in Washington, D.C., at the Apple Store.
[01:49:03.100 --> 01:49:05.180]   People all over the world are morning to walk.
[01:49:05.180 --> 01:49:07.140]   We have jobs, Leo LaPorte,
[01:49:07.140 --> 01:49:08.980]   who's a host of the nationally syndicated
[01:49:08.980 --> 01:49:11.860]   Tech Guy radio show, Premier Radio Networks.
[01:49:11.860 --> 01:49:15.020]   He's a founder of his own internet based technology network
[01:49:15.020 --> 01:49:15.940]   this week in tech.
[01:49:15.940 --> 01:49:18.060]   He's interviewed Steve Jobs many times.
[01:49:18.060 --> 01:49:21.460]   Leo, what goes through your mind on this sad day?
[01:49:21.460 --> 01:49:23.340]   - You know, we were so prepared for this
[01:49:23.340 --> 01:49:24.740]   that we knew it was coming,
[01:49:24.740 --> 01:49:27.100]   and yet it's still such a shock and it's so sad.
[01:49:27.100 --> 01:49:30.420]   And I'm really trying to focus on celebrating his life.
[01:49:30.420 --> 01:49:32.980]   This is a guy who lived his life
[01:49:32.980 --> 01:49:35.700]   exactly as he wanted to.
[01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:38.980]   Was said that Steve exceeded every goal
[01:49:38.980 --> 01:49:39.900]   he ever set for himself.
[01:49:39.900 --> 01:49:42.620]   He's a guy who lived his dreams
[01:49:42.620 --> 01:49:44.340]   and changed our lives as a result.
[01:49:44.340 --> 01:49:48.060]   - What made him so amazing?
[01:49:48.060 --> 01:49:50.780]   Was it his education, was it his family,
[01:49:50.780 --> 01:49:53.660]   was it his background growing up in California?
[01:49:53.660 --> 01:49:55.540]   There must have been some spark there
[01:49:55.540 --> 01:49:56.940]   that created this genius.
[01:49:56.940 --> 01:49:59.060]   - What are the ingredients that make somebody like that?
[01:49:59.060 --> 01:50:00.260]   You know, he was a college dropout,
[01:50:00.260 --> 01:50:01.740]   it wasn't his education.
[01:50:01.740 --> 01:50:03.500]   I think there was something inside him
[01:50:03.500 --> 01:50:06.500]   that drove him to exceed.
[01:50:06.500 --> 01:50:08.420]   He didn't care what other people thought.
[01:50:08.420 --> 01:50:11.180]   He cared about making great stuff.
[01:50:11.180 --> 01:50:13.980]   And he succeeded every step of the way.
[01:50:13.980 --> 01:50:15.780]   He stumbled occasionally made mistakes.
[01:50:15.780 --> 01:50:18.100]   He wanted in the wilderness after being fired at Apple,
[01:50:18.100 --> 01:50:20.180]   and yet he kept coming back.
[01:50:20.180 --> 01:50:22.420]   And I think it was his extraordinary drive
[01:50:22.420 --> 01:50:25.460]   that really made him the man he is or was.
[01:50:25.460 --> 01:50:26.900]   - In your interviews with him,
[01:50:26.900 --> 01:50:29.020]   what was he like as a person?
[01:50:29.020 --> 01:50:30.980]   Was he easy to get along with?
[01:50:30.980 --> 01:50:32.020]   Did he like to chat?
[01:50:32.020 --> 01:50:34.860]   Did he talk about sports or baseball or something?
[01:50:34.860 --> 01:50:36.860]   Or was he simply focused on technology?
[01:50:36.860 --> 01:50:37.860]   - Steve was very focused.
[01:50:37.860 --> 01:50:40.300]   There's a famous story about him coming into a conference room
[01:50:40.300 --> 01:50:42.260]   and somebody started to chat about the weekend
[01:50:42.260 --> 01:50:44.980]   and him saying, "Can we raise the tone of conversation here?"
[01:50:44.980 --> 01:50:46.500]   He was a get to work guy.
[01:50:46.500 --> 01:50:47.900]   When Steve walked in the room,
[01:50:47.900 --> 01:50:49.940]   it was really apparent immediately
[01:50:49.940 --> 01:50:51.860]   that he knew he was the smartest guy in the room.
[01:50:51.860 --> 01:50:53.860]   Usually he was absolutely right.
[01:50:53.860 --> 01:50:55.140]   He was down to earth.
[01:50:55.140 --> 01:50:57.300]   And later in the last few years,
[01:50:57.300 --> 01:50:59.260]   he really didn't do very many interviews.
[01:50:59.260 --> 01:51:00.260]   He didn't trust the press.
[01:51:00.260 --> 01:51:01.380]   He didn't like the press.
[01:51:01.380 --> 01:51:03.980]   He wanted to control, very tightly,
[01:51:03.980 --> 01:51:07.580]   control the image of Apple and his own image.
[01:51:07.580 --> 01:51:11.340]   He was a control freak in every sense of the word.
[01:51:11.340 --> 01:51:13.420]   And yet he inspired us all.
[01:51:13.420 --> 01:51:15.780]   I mean, without Steve Jobs,
[01:51:15.780 --> 01:51:17.180]   you wonder where's the excitement
[01:51:17.180 --> 01:51:19.460]   going to come from in this industry?
[01:51:19.460 --> 01:51:21.060]   - That's a good question.
[01:51:21.060 --> 01:51:23.660]   And I don't think anyone really appreciates that.
[01:51:23.660 --> 01:51:25.220]   Leo, thanks very much.
[01:51:25.220 --> 01:51:27.580]   Aaron Burnett is still with us as well.
[01:51:27.580 --> 01:51:30.540]   - Aaron, one of the things that I think is really interesting
[01:51:30.540 --> 01:51:35.540]   is I think everyone seems to be talking about this.
[01:51:35.540 --> 01:51:37.420]   Why are we so sad about this?
[01:51:37.420 --> 01:51:39.140]   'Cause I know that I have been.
[01:51:39.140 --> 01:51:40.700]   For some reason I've been listening to American Pie
[01:51:40.700 --> 01:51:44.260]   by Don McLean for the last week.
[01:51:44.260 --> 01:51:46.620]   And just feeling really,
[01:51:46.620 --> 01:51:47.700]   it just like this,
[01:51:47.700 --> 01:51:50.540]   it really does feel like the end of something.
[01:51:50.540 --> 01:51:53.100]   And it's kind of hard for me to put my finger on Andy.
[01:51:53.100 --> 01:51:55.340]   Why do so many people don't know him
[01:51:55.340 --> 01:51:57.620]   feel so sad with the passing of Steve?
[01:51:57.620 --> 01:52:02.180]   - I think that anything that ties so deeply into your childhood
[01:52:02.180 --> 01:52:04.220]   will have a really powerful mojo on you
[01:52:04.220 --> 01:52:05.540]   until the day you die.
[01:52:05.540 --> 01:52:07.220]   Whether it's a style of car,
[01:52:07.220 --> 01:52:10.220]   whether it's a movie and piece of music,
[01:52:10.220 --> 01:52:11.380]   even a computer.
[01:52:11.380 --> 01:52:14.460]   And when you have someone like Steve Jobs,
[01:52:14.460 --> 01:52:17.100]   who's in that very, very short list of geeks
[01:52:17.100 --> 01:52:20.780]   who even back in the '80s were famous geeks.
[01:52:20.780 --> 01:52:23.500]   People who you sort of imagine as a,
[01:52:23.500 --> 01:52:25.380]   not absolutely not as a surrogate father,
[01:52:25.380 --> 01:52:26.500]   but at least as well.
[01:52:26.500 --> 01:52:30.620]   Here's what you could be like in 10 or 15 years.
[01:52:30.620 --> 01:52:32.660]   Yes, you're a nerdy geeky kid
[01:52:32.660 --> 01:52:34.340]   who spends most of your time reading books
[01:52:34.340 --> 01:52:36.900]   and most of your time building things
[01:52:36.900 --> 01:52:40.700]   as opposed to trying to get a spheroid or oblate spheroid
[01:52:40.700 --> 01:52:42.260]   across some sort of chalk mark
[01:52:42.260 --> 01:52:44.780]   on some sort of piece of real estate.
[01:52:44.780 --> 01:52:46.020]   Good for you if you like that.
[01:52:46.020 --> 01:52:48.740]   But those of us who basically knew
[01:52:48.740 --> 01:52:52.620]   what the smell of solder flux and overcook circuits
[01:52:52.620 --> 01:52:54.340]   were at the age 11 thought that,
[01:52:54.340 --> 01:52:57.180]   you know what, it would be really cool to be,
[01:52:57.180 --> 01:52:59.620]   if we lived to be 27, to be 27
[01:52:59.620 --> 01:53:02.540]   and have the sort of achievements that Steve Jobs has made.
[01:53:02.540 --> 01:53:05.100]   So when that sort of element is gone,
[01:53:05.100 --> 01:53:06.220]   it sort of reminds you,
[01:53:06.220 --> 01:53:08.980]   and this guy who in some way has represented you
[01:53:08.980 --> 01:53:11.260]   10 years from now, ah, he's gone now.
[01:53:11.260 --> 01:53:15.900]   And so now there's a certain lack of steering focus,
[01:53:15.900 --> 01:53:17.460]   even if it's a very, very tiny one.
[01:53:17.460 --> 01:53:19.460]   Again, I don't think anybody rational
[01:53:19.460 --> 01:53:22.300]   was patterning their lives against,
[01:53:22.300 --> 01:53:23.620]   following Steve Jobs and trying to,
[01:53:23.620 --> 01:53:25.980]   oh, what would Steve do in this situation?
[01:53:25.980 --> 01:53:28.340]   But nonetheless, of all the different things,
[01:53:28.340 --> 01:53:30.140]   the stars that you navigate by,
[01:53:30.140 --> 01:53:32.660]   now one of those is not there anymore.
[01:53:32.660 --> 01:53:33.900]   And that's a little bit to,
[01:53:33.900 --> 01:53:35.180]   takes a bit of getting his two, I think.
[01:53:35.180 --> 01:53:36.300]   - I mean, Jason didn't he seem like
[01:53:36.300 --> 01:53:38.180]   he was like the cool kid in school.
[01:53:38.180 --> 01:53:39.940]   Like, you know, he was the kid that you were trying to fall.
[01:53:39.940 --> 01:53:42.620]   You always wanted to dress like him and be like him.
[01:53:42.620 --> 01:53:44.740]   - Yeah, I'm not sure I go for the,
[01:53:44.740 --> 01:53:46.700]   for the he was a geek like us thing.
[01:53:46.700 --> 01:53:48.940]   I think he was, he was cooler than that.
[01:53:48.940 --> 01:53:51.540]   But, you know, I think this has a lot to do
[01:53:51.540 --> 01:53:54.820]   with the products that Steve Jobs helped
[01:53:54.820 --> 01:53:56.220]   bring into being with Apple.
[01:53:56.220 --> 01:53:58.940]   Our products that people feel an emotional attachment to.
[01:53:58.940 --> 01:54:01.420]   If it's the Mac, you know, people made a choice
[01:54:01.420 --> 01:54:03.700]   to use the Mac and to be using a computer
[01:54:03.700 --> 01:54:05.340]   that wasn't the PC everybody was using.
[01:54:05.340 --> 01:54:07.660]   And more recently, people feel really attached
[01:54:07.660 --> 01:54:09.620]   to the iPod and iPhone and iPad.
[01:54:09.620 --> 01:54:13.380]   And he was seen as the person who ushered
[01:54:13.380 --> 01:54:14.980]   these products into the world.
[01:54:14.980 --> 01:54:15.940]   It was his company.
[01:54:15.940 --> 01:54:18.900]   You know, we can argue about how much of that is him.
[01:54:18.900 --> 01:54:19.820]   There's a lot of myth making.
[01:54:19.820 --> 01:54:21.900]   It's not like he was soldering things in his garage
[01:54:21.900 --> 01:54:22.820]   and then bringing them out.
[01:54:22.820 --> 01:54:25.660]   But the fact is he was the guy who brought them to us
[01:54:25.660 --> 01:54:28.020]   who introduced them, who got us excited about them.
[01:54:28.020 --> 01:54:29.980]   And I think that some aspect of this is,
[01:54:29.980 --> 01:54:32.100]   it's selfishness in a good way.
[01:54:32.100 --> 01:54:34.300]   I think we all feel like the world's a poorer place
[01:54:34.300 --> 01:54:36.020]   and without Steve Jobs in it.
[01:54:36.020 --> 01:54:38.460]   And we're all a little worried about the fact that,
[01:54:38.460 --> 01:54:40.020]   you know, he brought us all this great stuff.
[01:54:40.020 --> 01:54:41.300]   And now he's gone.
[01:54:41.300 --> 01:54:42.380]   So what happens next?
[01:54:42.380 --> 01:54:43.900]   And I think that's all understandable.
[01:54:43.900 --> 01:54:47.220]   I think, you know, anytime you see somebody
[01:54:47.220 --> 01:54:49.260]   who seems like they're so talented
[01:54:49.260 --> 01:54:51.300]   and they've created things that have had an impact
[01:54:51.300 --> 01:54:53.940]   on your life, even if you didn't know them personally,
[01:54:53.940 --> 01:54:55.940]   it's an absolutely natural reaction
[01:54:55.940 --> 01:54:58.340]   to look at their passing and say, you know,
[01:54:58.340 --> 01:55:00.700]   boy, it's not gonna be like it was ever again.
[01:55:00.700 --> 01:55:02.860]   - And I think that even though he wasn't writing the code,
[01:55:02.860 --> 01:55:05.860]   even though he wasn't soldering the boards together,
[01:55:05.860 --> 01:55:07.820]   obviously, you know, what he brought,
[01:55:07.820 --> 01:55:10.820]   that clear vision of what makes a difference
[01:55:10.820 --> 01:55:12.100]   and what doesn't make a difference
[01:55:12.100 --> 01:55:14.260]   and what needs to be removed,
[01:55:14.260 --> 01:55:16.300]   made just such a massive impact.
[01:55:16.300 --> 01:55:18.980]   And Adam, where do you think the tech world
[01:55:18.980 --> 01:55:19.820]   would be without him?
[01:55:19.820 --> 01:55:21.180]   I mean, what would have happened?
[01:55:21.180 --> 01:55:22.500]   You know, I mean, I know the big question,
[01:55:22.500 --> 01:55:24.580]   but I mean, we would still be using like,
[01:55:24.580 --> 01:55:27.700]   it feels like we would still be writing, you know, code.
[01:55:27.700 --> 01:55:30.060]   - Well, I do think there's a lot to that.
[01:55:30.060 --> 01:55:33.340]   And one of the things that we looked into
[01:55:33.340 --> 01:55:35.980]   with Tibbets in our special issue last night was
[01:55:35.980 --> 01:55:39.140]   just what would have happened if we hadn't had
[01:55:39.140 --> 01:55:42.340]   the Steve Jobs pushing the personal computer very early on?
[01:55:42.340 --> 01:55:46.340]   Because you had a bunch of really kind of weird stuff.
[01:55:46.340 --> 01:55:48.100]   You had the Commodore, you had the TRS-80,
[01:55:48.100 --> 01:55:48.940]   stuff like that.
[01:55:48.940 --> 01:55:50.420]   - It's not like you created some of that too.
[01:55:50.420 --> 01:55:52.860]   I mean, Xerox had the idea of graphical interface.
[01:55:52.860 --> 01:55:57.580]   - Oh yeah, but he's the one who really turned it
[01:55:57.580 --> 01:55:59.780]   into something that people wanted
[01:55:59.780 --> 01:56:02.060]   and that made it into a market.
[01:56:02.060 --> 01:56:06.220]   And you can't even just, you know, eliminate the fact
[01:56:06.220 --> 01:56:09.020]   that that's in large part why IBM started
[01:56:09.020 --> 01:56:11.780]   the Skunk Works project to do the IBM PC.
[01:56:11.780 --> 01:56:14.380]   So if you take Steve Jobs out of the picture,
[01:56:14.380 --> 01:56:16.660]   I think you're talking a very, very different
[01:56:16.660 --> 01:56:20.620]   personal computer world if in fact you even get one.
[01:56:20.620 --> 01:56:24.460]   And as the guy who wrote the article pointed out,
[01:56:24.460 --> 01:56:28.020]   Tim Berners-Lee eventually invented the World Wide Web
[01:56:28.020 --> 01:56:29.460]   on a next machine.
[01:56:29.460 --> 01:56:34.020]   So there's a whole, it's one of those parallel universe things
[01:56:34.020 --> 01:56:38.220]   that what if could be very, very strange without Steve Jobs?
[01:56:38.220 --> 01:56:40.500]   - That could be a very good short film there somewhere.
[01:56:40.500 --> 01:56:42.860]   You know, the world without Steve Jobs.
[01:56:42.860 --> 01:56:46.620]   It's very, yeah, but sometimes I wish that Steve Jobs
[01:56:46.620 --> 01:56:49.220]   had never been born in the Steve future.
[01:56:49.220 --> 01:56:51.300]   - No, Steve Jobs come back.
[01:56:51.300 --> 01:56:53.860]   - Yeah, it's a wonderful life without, you know,
[01:56:53.860 --> 01:56:56.060]   kind of a special films where they say,
[01:56:56.060 --> 01:56:59.300]   well, I'd be caught up if he took care of the sick outside.
[01:56:59.300 --> 01:57:01.580]   - Now, Annie, how long do you think Apple
[01:57:01.580 --> 01:57:04.340]   can continue his trajectory, like in the same vein?
[01:57:04.340 --> 01:57:06.380]   Or do you think they're gonna start pivoting quickly?
[01:57:06.380 --> 01:57:08.140]   Is it gonna be something that that trajectory
[01:57:08.140 --> 01:57:10.820]   is just gonna continue to go out for some period of time?
[01:57:10.820 --> 01:57:13.620]   - Well, it's, I think everybody pretty much knows
[01:57:13.620 --> 01:57:15.340]   that the strategy has been mapped out
[01:57:15.340 --> 01:57:17.260]   for several, a few years in advance at least.
[01:57:17.260 --> 01:57:18.500]   So it's not as though they keep,
[01:57:18.500 --> 01:57:20.900]   Apple's the least reactive company in the world.
[01:57:20.900 --> 01:57:23.460]   They just keep looking four or five years out.
[01:57:23.460 --> 01:57:25.980]   But I really hope that they are no longer following
[01:57:25.980 --> 01:57:29.300]   Steve Jobs's map or template for years from now,
[01:57:29.300 --> 01:57:31.180]   because remember that he himself was looking
[01:57:31.180 --> 01:57:32.260]   four or five years in the future.
[01:57:32.260 --> 01:57:34.540]   And now he has stopped looking into the future
[01:57:34.540 --> 01:57:36.980]   because he can't really see what's coming
[01:57:36.980 --> 01:57:38.820]   in his current state, unfortunately.
[01:57:38.820 --> 01:57:43.020]   So I would like to think that by having a set of,
[01:57:43.020 --> 01:57:45.420]   a roadmap for how to think and how to plan
[01:57:45.420 --> 01:57:46.340]   and how to run the company.
[01:57:46.340 --> 01:57:49.060]   And also a roadmap for what the company is
[01:57:49.060 --> 01:57:50.540]   by its very nature.
[01:57:50.540 --> 01:57:52.580]   We'll start to see some shifts, shifts
[01:57:52.580 --> 01:57:56.380]   in the next couple of years when a new opportunity arrives
[01:57:56.380 --> 01:57:59.180]   for, be it a new manufacturing process
[01:57:59.180 --> 01:58:02.540]   or a new way of moving data from point A to point B,
[01:58:02.540 --> 01:58:05.900]   or even just a new basic shift of noticing
[01:58:05.900 --> 01:58:09.340]   that the people in Starbucks who used to be using an iPad
[01:58:09.340 --> 01:58:12.180]   and an iPhone, next to them, are now using an iPhone
[01:58:12.180 --> 01:58:13.580]   and a laptop next to them.
[01:58:13.580 --> 01:58:16.220]   What does that tell us about how people are using computers
[01:58:16.220 --> 01:58:17.060]   these days?
[01:58:17.060 --> 01:58:18.820]   And it's those things from a large scale stuff
[01:58:18.820 --> 01:58:21.580]   to the simple things of just noticing how people are holding
[01:58:21.580 --> 01:58:24.020]   a certain phone that will really shape Apple's destiny
[01:58:24.020 --> 01:58:26.620]   and eventually have much more of an impact
[01:58:26.620 --> 01:58:28.140]   than any plans that Steve might have made.
[01:58:28.140 --> 01:58:32.140]   - Well, I mean, Jason, is it how necessary
[01:58:32.140 --> 01:58:34.740]   is it for Apple to change the direction right now?
[01:58:34.740 --> 01:58:37.500]   I mean, the question is, is they built a new industry
[01:58:37.500 --> 01:58:39.900]   and it's now expanding very, very quickly.
[01:58:39.900 --> 01:58:41.580]   I mean, I think we just saw the news this week
[01:58:41.580 --> 01:58:46.580]   that 97% of all tablet traffic is the iPad.
[01:58:46.580 --> 01:58:49.020]   Is it something that for at least the short,
[01:58:49.020 --> 01:58:51.900]   next two or three years, they almost just have to not screw up.
[01:58:51.900 --> 01:58:53.460]   It's kind of like one of those things
[01:58:53.460 --> 01:58:56.100]   where your football team is winning by 24 points
[01:58:56.100 --> 01:58:57.620]   in the end of the third quarter.
[01:58:57.620 --> 01:59:00.020]   They just have to not throw any interceptions.
[01:59:00.020 --> 01:59:02.380]   - Right, well, I think there's an aspect to that, right?
[01:59:02.380 --> 01:59:03.700]   I've read out the clock of saying,
[01:59:03.700 --> 01:59:05.220]   how do we maximize the growth?
[01:59:05.220 --> 01:59:08.020]   How do we deal with the growth and expansion
[01:59:08.020 --> 01:59:09.940]   of our products that are ascendant?
[01:59:09.940 --> 01:59:11.980]   How do we deal with the products that are kind of coming
[01:59:11.980 --> 01:59:13.160]   down the other side?
[01:59:13.160 --> 01:59:17.940]   But if that's all you do, then you'll get them in the game,
[01:59:17.940 --> 01:59:20.180]   but you won't even make the playoffs
[01:59:20.180 --> 01:59:23.500]   because to extend this metaphor way beyond it's due.
[01:59:23.500 --> 01:59:26.860]   But yeah, I think the key for Apple
[01:59:26.860 --> 01:59:30.740]   is to use the Steve Jobs playbook in terms of
[01:59:30.740 --> 01:59:32.820]   how do we do what we do?
[01:59:32.820 --> 01:59:34.340]   How do we find new products?
[01:59:34.340 --> 01:59:35.420]   How do we make judgments?
[01:59:35.420 --> 01:59:39.300]   How does everybody here make decisions about what's next?
[01:59:39.300 --> 01:59:42.220]   What they need to not do is sort of slavishly say,
[01:59:42.220 --> 01:59:45.260]   well, Steve liked this thing, so let's do that
[01:59:45.260 --> 01:59:47.580]   because Steve liked it, because at Tandy's point,
[01:59:47.580 --> 01:59:49.900]   the fact is Steve's not around anymore.
[01:59:49.900 --> 01:59:51.980]   He's gone, he can't make those judgments.
[01:59:51.980 --> 01:59:54.780]   You know Steve Jobs wouldn't sit there and say,
[01:59:54.780 --> 01:59:57.060]   "I pretty much believe what I believed five years ago,
[01:59:57.060 --> 01:59:58.220]   so let's just keep doing that."
[01:59:58.220 --> 01:59:59.900]   He would continue to adapt.
[01:59:59.900 --> 02:00:01.700]   So if they've done their jobs right,
[02:00:01.700 --> 02:00:04.780]   everybody's gonna think, we're gonna adapt like Steve.
[02:00:04.780 --> 02:00:08.580]   We're gonna always question where things are going like Steve.
[02:00:08.580 --> 02:00:10.420]   And if they can do that, they're in much better shape.
[02:00:10.420 --> 02:00:13.900]   I mean, they've had what, eight years of knowing
[02:00:13.900 --> 02:00:16.700]   that their leader had a pretty serious form of cancer
[02:00:16.700 --> 02:00:18.540]   and has spent, especially the last four years,
[02:00:18.540 --> 02:00:19.700]   he's been very sick.
[02:00:19.700 --> 02:00:22.580]   Apple has gotten itself pretty well prepared
[02:00:22.580 --> 02:00:24.740]   for this period in its life,
[02:00:24.740 --> 02:00:27.500]   better than most companies I think do.
[02:00:27.500 --> 02:00:29.060]   Whether they'll succeed or not, I don't know.
[02:00:29.060 --> 02:00:31.180]   But for me, you gotta go with the playbook
[02:00:31.180 --> 02:00:32.980]   and that means always questioning,
[02:00:32.980 --> 02:00:34.820]   always asking those questions
[02:00:34.820 --> 02:00:36.540]   and being really critical about products
[02:00:36.540 --> 02:00:40.060]   like Steve would do, not just say what it's Steve like
[02:00:40.060 --> 02:00:40.900]   when he was here.
[02:00:40.900 --> 02:00:41.740]   - And we also see that.
[02:00:41.740 --> 02:00:43.100]   We see that culture in Pixar, you know,
[02:00:43.100 --> 02:00:45.740]   where the questioning is really what makes a lot of,
[02:00:45.740 --> 02:00:46.940]   what picks our movies great,
[02:00:46.940 --> 02:00:48.340]   that everything is up for grabs.
[02:00:48.340 --> 02:00:49.900]   Everything is constantly being attacked.
[02:00:49.900 --> 02:00:51.740]   Everything is, you know, it's a, you know,
[02:00:51.740 --> 02:00:55.820]   this intense cauldron of creativity that's going on there.
[02:00:55.820 --> 02:00:57.100]   So hopefully we'll see that now.
[02:00:57.100 --> 02:00:59.020]   Now Adam, you know, Tim Cook is taking over.
[02:00:59.020 --> 02:01:01.700]   We saw a much different keynote
[02:01:01.700 --> 02:01:02.660]   than we've seen in the past,
[02:01:02.660 --> 02:01:05.380]   where he's not doing a lot of the stuff himself.
[02:01:05.380 --> 02:01:06.340]   He's handing that off.
[02:01:06.340 --> 02:01:09.420]   How else do you see Apple changing under his leadership?
[02:01:09.420 --> 02:01:14.620]   - Well, again, in the near term, not a whole lot
[02:01:14.620 --> 02:01:18.620]   because Cook has really been in charge in a lot of ways
[02:01:18.620 --> 02:01:20.620]   for frankly quite a few years.
[02:01:20.620 --> 02:01:22.540]   I mean, you know, as COO,
[02:01:22.540 --> 02:01:24.540]   he's been in charge of the day to day.
[02:01:24.540 --> 02:01:27.180]   And certainly as interim CEO,
[02:01:27.180 --> 02:01:29.660]   whenever Steve took a medical of absence
[02:01:29.660 --> 02:01:31.540]   or, you know, when he's actually stepped down,
[02:01:31.540 --> 02:01:34.300]   you know, as a CEO in June, you know,
[02:01:34.300 --> 02:01:36.660]   Cook has been able to,
[02:01:36.660 --> 02:01:39.620]   as far as we can tell, just continue along the same game.
[02:01:39.620 --> 02:01:43.700]   So I'm not seeing a whole lot changing.
[02:01:43.700 --> 02:01:46.140]   Honestly, I don't know Tim Cook very well.
[02:01:46.140 --> 02:01:49.140]   He's been one of those people sort of behind the scenes
[02:01:49.140 --> 02:01:50.900]   at Apple who has,
[02:01:50.900 --> 02:01:55.860]   they've just always gotten the job done quietly.
[02:01:55.860 --> 02:02:00.860]   And so I don't really know if he has a particular style
[02:02:01.060 --> 02:02:04.420]   that will become obvious over time
[02:02:04.420 --> 02:02:06.660]   that's radically different in terms
[02:02:06.660 --> 02:02:09.060]   of how the company will be run.
[02:02:09.060 --> 02:02:11.180]   - Do you think it's gonna be a little stressful
[02:02:11.180 --> 02:02:12.020]   working in Apple?
[02:02:12.020 --> 02:02:14.260]   I mean, I know there's a lot of stories about it.
[02:02:14.260 --> 02:02:15.580]   I know there was, there was a story in one of the things
[02:02:15.580 --> 02:02:17.020]   we were looking at about photographers,
[02:02:17.020 --> 02:02:18.380]   you know, being used to being yelled at by Steve.
[02:02:18.380 --> 02:02:19.540]   - Definitely not.
[02:02:19.540 --> 02:02:21.660]   There's already one Tim Cook story,
[02:02:21.660 --> 02:02:23.700]   which is they were talking about a problem
[02:02:23.700 --> 02:02:25.300]   on the production line in China.
[02:02:25.300 --> 02:02:27.580]   And he had this guy there who was working on it
[02:02:27.580 --> 02:02:28.580]   that they were talking this about.
[02:02:28.580 --> 02:02:29.820]   And then like two minutes later,
[02:02:29.820 --> 02:02:32.020]   they're continuing to talk and Tim Cook looks at the guy
[02:02:32.020 --> 02:02:33.820]   and says, why are you still here?
[02:02:33.820 --> 02:02:35.700]   Go to China now.
[02:02:35.700 --> 02:02:36.500]   And the guy like,
[02:02:36.500 --> 02:02:37.340]   (laughing)
[02:02:37.340 --> 02:02:39.580]   he drove to SFO, got on a plane,
[02:02:39.580 --> 02:02:40.900]   the next plane to China.
[02:02:40.900 --> 02:02:42.700]   He had nothing. - No luggage, no nothing.
[02:02:42.700 --> 02:02:44.580]   - So Tim Cook is an intense guy.
[02:02:44.580 --> 02:02:46.660]   He's a really operations focused guy,
[02:02:46.660 --> 02:02:48.420]   hence the go to China and see what the heck
[02:02:48.420 --> 02:02:49.620]   is going on over there.
[02:02:49.620 --> 02:02:51.140]   But, you know, he's an intense guy.
[02:02:51.140 --> 02:02:53.740]   And I know that all the reports say that he and Jobs,
[02:02:53.740 --> 02:02:55.580]   one of the things that they really connected
[02:02:55.580 --> 02:02:56.900]   were Jobs interviewed him and was like,
[02:02:56.900 --> 02:02:58.620]   this is the guy, this guy is great.
[02:02:58.620 --> 02:03:00.940]   He is intense in, he's got different skills
[02:03:00.940 --> 02:03:02.900]   and different interests, but he's got that.
[02:03:02.900 --> 02:03:05.900]   So I think Apple is gonna be similarly managed in that way.
[02:03:05.900 --> 02:03:06.900]   Why are you still here?
[02:03:06.900 --> 02:03:08.500]   - Yeah. (laughing)
[02:03:08.500 --> 02:03:11.020]   - Yeah, so, and I think that it'll be really interesting
[02:03:11.020 --> 02:03:14.060]   to see, I mean, I think it seems like we won't really know
[02:03:14.060 --> 02:03:16.500]   until we see another large product launch.
[02:03:16.500 --> 02:03:18.780]   You know, like, until we see something significant
[02:03:18.780 --> 02:03:20.060]   that isn't just a continuation.
[02:03:20.060 --> 02:03:22.940]   And it's hard to say, you know, what that next thing will be.
[02:03:22.940 --> 02:03:25.140]   I mean, I still, I'm still holding out hope for,
[02:03:25.140 --> 02:03:28.180]   you know, for a TV.
[02:03:28.180 --> 02:03:29.660]   - I wanna hold to you.
[02:03:29.660 --> 02:03:31.860]   I don't want to just go all the way to a car.
[02:03:31.860 --> 02:03:32.820]   I mean, we'll get to the L.
[02:03:32.820 --> 02:03:34.260]   - Yeah, you know, if Apple made a car,
[02:03:34.260 --> 02:03:36.100]   how many people here would buy an Apple car?
[02:03:36.100 --> 02:03:36.940]   - Buy it. - I'd buy it.
[02:03:36.940 --> 02:03:38.820]   - You know, it'd be electric and it'd be round
[02:03:38.820 --> 02:03:40.020]   and you'd be able to use Siri in it
[02:03:40.020 --> 02:03:40.940]   and you'd just be going,
[02:03:40.940 --> 02:03:42.900]   "Car, take me to San Francisco."
[02:03:42.900 --> 02:03:44.980]   You know, and it would just, it would just drive you there.
[02:03:44.980 --> 02:03:46.260]   You know, it would so, I'd say, okay.
[02:03:46.260 --> 02:03:47.780]   - I end up buying all the copies.
[02:03:47.780 --> 02:03:50.500]   So I have two copies of the hardcover from Amazon.
[02:03:50.500 --> 02:03:52.860]   I have iBooks version, which is quite nice, by the way.
[02:03:52.860 --> 02:03:54.580]   It's the first book I've really read on iBook.
[02:03:54.580 --> 02:03:57.060]   I thought, I should read it on the iPad, right?
[02:03:57.060 --> 02:03:59.580]   I got the Kindle version, which seems so barren,
[02:03:59.580 --> 02:04:01.980]   especially 'cause there's lots of pictures in it.
[02:04:01.980 --> 02:04:04.660]   And then the audio book version's quite good,
[02:04:04.660 --> 02:04:05.940]   although if you wanna get through
[02:04:05.940 --> 02:04:10.100]   if something fast audio is probably not the way to do it.
[02:04:10.100 --> 02:04:12.100]   Andy, have you finished the book?
[02:04:12.100 --> 02:04:13.700]   - I'm only about a quarter of the way through it.
[02:04:13.700 --> 02:04:15.460]   - Yeah, I'm about a third of it.
[02:04:15.460 --> 02:04:16.900]   - And part of it is just being slowed down
[02:04:16.900 --> 02:04:19.900]   by all the really great bits inside it.
[02:04:19.900 --> 02:04:21.940]   I mean, it really was a very open interview.
[02:04:21.940 --> 02:04:24.940]   If you think, it's a very open book.
[02:04:24.940 --> 02:04:28.420]   And when you don't get about four or five pages in before,
[02:04:28.420 --> 02:04:30.940]   you start to see a lot of the real truth behind it.
[02:04:30.940 --> 02:04:32.940]   There really is no myth-making here.
[02:04:32.940 --> 02:04:35.740]   It's all about making sure you understand exactly
[02:04:35.740 --> 02:04:37.780]   who Steve Jobs was, good and bad,
[02:04:37.780 --> 02:04:39.140]   and very bad sometimes.
[02:04:39.140 --> 02:04:41.260]   - Yeah, I mean, I would agree with that.
[02:04:41.260 --> 02:04:43.340]   Leander, did you have an advanced copy?
[02:04:43.340 --> 02:04:45.900]   Were you able to read it before we got it?
[02:04:45.900 --> 02:04:50.420]   - I got it on Amazon the night before.
[02:04:50.420 --> 02:04:52.420]   So they sent me a copy and it showed up here
[02:04:52.420 --> 02:04:54.620]   first thing yesterday morning.
[02:04:54.620 --> 02:04:57.780]   But I managed to get it through Kindle on Sunday night
[02:04:57.780 --> 02:05:01.540]   and I started reading it on my iPad in bed.
[02:05:01.540 --> 02:05:04.820]   And yeah, it's a remarkable achievement, but--
[02:05:04.820 --> 02:05:06.500]   - It's a gross read.
[02:05:06.500 --> 02:05:08.180]   - It's not a fun read?
[02:05:08.180 --> 02:05:09.100]   - I don't think so.
[02:05:09.100 --> 02:05:10.380]   No, I thought it was, you know,
[02:05:10.380 --> 02:05:12.780]   I became quite depressed yesterday, really.
[02:05:12.780 --> 02:05:15.700]   - What, I did too, and I'm just curious
[02:05:15.700 --> 02:05:17.940]   what depressed you about this.
[02:05:17.940 --> 02:05:21.740]   - Well, he was such a difficult man.
[02:05:21.740 --> 02:05:23.380]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:05:23.380 --> 02:05:28.140]   - He was so, you know, such a taskmaster.
[02:05:28.140 --> 02:05:29.660]   And it really is just sort of a catalog
[02:05:29.660 --> 02:05:32.020]   of very bad behavior.
[02:05:32.020 --> 02:05:34.540]   (laughing)
[02:05:34.540 --> 02:05:37.660]   - Although you can't gain say the results.
[02:05:37.660 --> 02:05:39.500]   - Right.
[02:05:39.500 --> 02:05:40.340]   - That's--
[02:05:40.340 --> 02:05:43.060]   - I'm up to through the Pixar part,
[02:05:43.060 --> 02:05:45.340]   but what struck me in the part I've read so far
[02:05:45.340 --> 02:05:46.180]   was the Mac team.
[02:05:46.180 --> 02:05:48.060]   We, you know, most of the stuff up to this point,
[02:05:48.060 --> 02:05:50.860]   we know pretty well that there's no real revelations
[02:05:50.860 --> 02:05:53.260]   or not any major ones anyway in the first,
[02:05:53.260 --> 02:05:54.340]   through the book.
[02:05:54.340 --> 02:05:57.740]   But you still really, I was struck by the fact
[02:05:57.740 --> 02:06:01.540]   that the Mac wouldn't exist without Steve
[02:06:01.540 --> 02:06:05.420]   just relentlessly dogging that team.
[02:06:05.420 --> 02:06:06.260]   - Right, yeah, yeah.
[02:06:06.260 --> 02:06:11.260]   As Johnny I said, and he had a great tribute to Jobs,
[02:06:11.260 --> 02:06:16.260]   at the Celebrating Steve's event at Apple last week.
[02:06:16.260 --> 02:06:20.100]   And he said, you know, that we all paid a price
[02:06:20.100 --> 02:06:23.500]   for these products, but Steve paid the highest price,
[02:06:23.500 --> 02:06:25.540]   you know, he cared the most.
[02:06:25.540 --> 02:06:26.740]   And that clearly comes through here.
[02:06:26.740 --> 02:06:30.700]   I mean, it's an enormous effort on his part.
[02:06:30.700 --> 02:06:33.100]   I mean, huge drive.
[02:06:33.100 --> 02:06:35.860]   And I don't know if it really illuminates it really though,
[02:06:35.860 --> 02:06:38.500]   you know, I don't know if I really understood
[02:06:38.500 --> 02:06:40.500]   what pushed him so hard.
[02:06:40.500 --> 02:06:42.500]   - Yeah, there's a lot of pseudo psychology
[02:06:42.500 --> 02:06:44.700]   at the beginning saying because Steve was abandoned
[02:06:44.700 --> 02:06:48.860]   by his birth parents, that that wound never healed,
[02:06:48.860 --> 02:06:51.460]   that he in fact abandoned Lisa, his first daughter
[02:06:51.460 --> 02:06:55.180]   at the same age that his father had abandoned him, 23,
[02:06:55.180 --> 02:06:58.140]   and that he was always looking for a father figure,
[02:06:58.140 --> 02:07:00.980]   hence Arthur Rock and John Scully,
[02:07:00.980 --> 02:07:04.540]   and you know, a succession of father figures.
[02:07:04.540 --> 02:07:06.980]   - That's Pop's psychology, I don't know if you can,
[02:07:06.980 --> 02:07:08.140]   and Jobs himself denied it.
[02:07:08.140 --> 02:07:10.580]   He says, that's overblown.
[02:07:10.580 --> 02:07:12.420]   - I mean, a lot of people, a lot of psychologists say,
[02:07:12.420 --> 02:07:16.100]   you know, if you want a person to be successful,
[02:07:16.100 --> 02:07:18.620]   oftentimes removing the father figure early is
[02:07:18.620 --> 02:07:21.820]   regardless of whether they give some some drive, huh?
[02:07:21.820 --> 02:07:23.660]   - Because they're basically running up against them
[02:07:23.660 --> 02:07:24.660]   and they can't compare them. - They're so well in the
[02:07:24.660 --> 02:07:25.500]   inner city.
[02:07:25.500 --> 02:07:28.780]   - Well, yeah, so the, I mean, there's a lot
[02:07:28.780 --> 02:07:30.820]   of other components to that, but there's a lot of people,
[02:07:30.820 --> 02:07:33.820]   there's a, that when they can't compare themselves
[02:07:33.820 --> 02:07:36.980]   to someone, you know, they just keep on driving.
[02:07:36.980 --> 02:07:41.180]   - And yet, you know, his adopted father, Paul Jobs,
[02:07:41.180 --> 02:07:43.300]   was very influential, clearly.
[02:07:43.300 --> 02:07:45.060]   - Or you can see the kind of stuff in the book
[02:07:45.060 --> 02:07:46.140]   where they're talking about him.
[02:07:46.140 --> 02:07:47.140]   - Perfectionism.
[02:07:47.140 --> 02:07:48.660]   - Teaching him to make the back of the fence
[02:07:48.660 --> 02:07:50.060]   as beautiful as the front of the fence,
[02:07:50.060 --> 02:07:51.780]   even though no one's gonna see it.
[02:07:51.780 --> 02:07:53.860]   You can see early on, you start adding that level.
[02:07:53.860 --> 02:07:55.980]   - Although, I gotta say, going a little farther,
[02:07:55.980 --> 02:07:58.540]   there's two anecdotes in here about painting the machinery
[02:07:58.540 --> 02:08:00.980]   in both the Macintosh and the next cube factory
[02:08:00.980 --> 02:08:05.820]   were fully automated and Jobs insisted and spent hours
[02:08:05.820 --> 02:08:09.540]   agonizing over the colors that the machinery should be painted.
[02:08:09.540 --> 02:08:11.780]   Finally said, I want white walls, Debbie Coleman,
[02:08:11.780 --> 02:08:13.300]   who is running the Macintosh factory.
[02:08:13.300 --> 02:08:15.060]   So you can't have white walls in a,
[02:08:15.060 --> 02:08:16.820]   white museum, white walls in a factory,
[02:08:16.820 --> 02:08:18.660]   he said, yes, you can, and we're gonna.
[02:08:18.660 --> 02:08:20.740]   And they painted the walls white.
[02:08:20.740 --> 02:08:23.060]   He brought his dad in, he would go in with gloves,
[02:08:23.060 --> 02:08:25.420]   military style and inspect for dust.
[02:08:25.420 --> 02:08:28.940]   They proudly brought his dad in to see all the machines.
[02:08:28.940 --> 02:08:32.780]   There's one machine that, he didn't like the shade of blue,
[02:08:32.780 --> 02:08:35.300]   it was painted, one of the robots that built the Mac.
[02:08:35.300 --> 02:08:38.500]   So he painted it a bluey against all the engineers advice,
[02:08:38.500 --> 02:08:40.180]   you can't repaint it once it started.
[02:08:40.180 --> 02:08:43.540]   It never worked right, they named it Steve's Folly.
[02:08:43.540 --> 02:08:45.660]   And not, far from learning from that,
[02:08:45.660 --> 02:08:47.260]   he did the same thing with the next factory.
[02:08:47.260 --> 02:08:48.820]   Of course, the next factory wasn't so critical
[02:08:48.820 --> 02:08:51.460]   'cause it was built to make 10,000 next cubes a month
[02:08:51.460 --> 02:08:53.700]   and only had to make 400 a month.
[02:08:53.700 --> 02:08:56.300]   So they really only had it on one day a month.
[02:08:56.300 --> 02:09:00.820]   He was obsessive about details that
[02:09:00.820 --> 02:09:02.900]   probably he didn't need to obsess about.
[02:09:02.900 --> 02:09:05.220]   You know, I mean, it's not just the back of the fence.
[02:09:05.220 --> 02:09:09.740]   - But I think that it's always the whole picture,
[02:09:09.740 --> 02:09:10.980]   being obsessive about details,
[02:09:10.980 --> 02:09:13.060]   doesn't mean you're always right about those details.
[02:09:13.060 --> 02:09:15.500]   But that obsessiveness is also what got us
[02:09:15.500 --> 02:09:16.460]   these computers and this is-
[02:09:16.460 --> 02:09:17.300]   - Well, I agree.
[02:09:17.300 --> 02:09:19.180]   - And so it spread out over everything
[02:09:19.180 --> 02:09:22.020]   and sometimes most of the time it looks like
[02:09:22.020 --> 02:09:24.340]   it hit pretty well and definitely there are a lot
[02:09:24.340 --> 02:09:26.300]   of examples in here where it didn't.
[02:09:26.300 --> 02:09:30.900]   But I think it's a state of mind that is hard to turn off.
[02:09:30.900 --> 02:09:34.420]   - Right, and luckily he had a great team to bounce ideas off
[02:09:34.420 --> 02:09:36.660]   because it's clear that the people around him,
[02:09:36.660 --> 02:09:38.100]   the people that he chose to work with
[02:09:38.100 --> 02:09:43.100]   were so important to keep in his wacko ideas in check.
[02:09:43.100 --> 02:09:44.940]   And I think he had as many wacko ideas
[02:09:44.940 --> 02:09:46.420]   as he had good ideas.
[02:09:46.420 --> 02:09:47.820]   I mean, he obviously had great instincts,
[02:09:47.820 --> 02:09:50.740]   but he would suggest some crazy stuff,
[02:09:50.740 --> 02:09:52.660]   the robot being a good example.
[02:09:52.660 --> 02:09:57.140]   And they were debate stuff a lot.
[02:09:57.140 --> 02:09:58.980]   I thought it was interesting about
[02:09:58.980 --> 02:10:01.740]   while they were trying to,
[02:10:01.740 --> 02:10:02.820]   the iPod was taken off,
[02:10:02.820 --> 02:10:05.580]   but it never really took off until they took it to Windows.
[02:10:05.580 --> 02:10:08.660]   And this is something that he sort of fought to his dying day.
[02:10:08.660 --> 02:10:12.460]   They fought about this for six months, every week,
[02:10:12.460 --> 02:10:14.820]   meeting after meeting, fighting, fighting, fighting.
[02:10:14.820 --> 02:10:17.980]   And in the end, he just said,
[02:10:17.980 --> 02:10:21.100]   okay, you girls go and do what you want.
[02:10:21.100 --> 02:10:21.940]   And-
[02:10:21.940 --> 02:10:23.020]   - In the long run it turns,
[02:10:23.020 --> 02:10:24.220]   it seems from this book that,
[02:10:24.220 --> 02:10:26.460]   and the Mac team is the one where it really seems to have worked,
[02:10:26.460 --> 02:10:28.180]   at least so far I haven't gotten to the later years,
[02:10:28.180 --> 02:10:31.820]   but he hasn't returned to Apple in the S yet.
[02:10:31.820 --> 02:10:35.300]   But the Mac team is an example of where,
[02:10:35.300 --> 02:10:40.300]   he would, if you fought back, he would respect you.
[02:10:40.300 --> 02:10:42.660]   And it was his position,
[02:10:42.660 --> 02:10:44.780]   I think this is not such an incorrect position,
[02:10:44.780 --> 02:10:46.420]   that if you wanna make a good team,
[02:10:46.420 --> 02:10:49.300]   you can't have B and C quality players.
[02:10:49.300 --> 02:10:51.060]   A players wanna work with A players.
[02:10:51.060 --> 02:10:52.660]   And he said, I'm chasing,
[02:10:52.660 --> 02:10:54.700]   by being such a jerk,
[02:10:54.700 --> 02:10:56.900]   I'm placing, I'm chasing off the B and C.
[02:10:56.900 --> 02:10:58.860]   - It was like giving that much credit,
[02:10:58.860 --> 02:11:02.100]   because, again, I too, a member of the,
[02:11:02.100 --> 02:11:04.060]   haven't made it all through the book club,
[02:11:04.060 --> 02:11:06.380]   but you get the impression that,
[02:11:06.380 --> 02:11:07.740]   I've met people like that,
[02:11:07.740 --> 02:11:10.980]   who are used that as a legitimate tactic,
[02:11:10.980 --> 02:11:12.420]   saying that look, if you're not willing to fight
[02:11:12.420 --> 02:11:13.780]   for your position,
[02:11:13.780 --> 02:11:15.580]   you must not believe it very strongly anyway,
[02:11:15.580 --> 02:11:17.340]   and so you're just not much used to.
[02:11:17.340 --> 02:11:18.740]   So there's, I believe that there was,
[02:11:18.740 --> 02:11:20.260]   from that and also stories,
[02:11:20.260 --> 02:11:23.140]   stories I've been told by people who like worked with Steve
[02:11:23.140 --> 02:11:25.380]   a lot, that there was that component to it.
[02:11:25.380 --> 02:11:26.260]   But a lot of it was just that,
[02:11:26.260 --> 02:11:27.540]   he just didn't care about your feelings.
[02:11:27.540 --> 02:11:30.300]   He just didn't, there are really good managers
[02:11:30.300 --> 02:11:31.500]   who have a way of saying,
[02:11:31.500 --> 02:11:33.300]   well, we're obviously not on the same page.
[02:11:33.300 --> 02:11:34.700]   This may not be the sort of company
[02:11:34.700 --> 02:11:37.300]   where we can work together to your fullest,
[02:11:37.300 --> 02:11:38.940]   and maybe we should start looking at things like that.
[02:11:38.940 --> 02:11:41.100]   He'd be like, okay, you're an idiot, you're an ass.
[02:11:41.100 --> 02:11:41.940]   Why are you doing here?
[02:11:41.940 --> 02:11:43.300]   Why are you wasting everybody's time?
[02:11:43.300 --> 02:11:44.860]   And that was totally unnecessary.
[02:11:44.860 --> 02:11:46.100]   - You know, the other thing that struck me on this book
[02:11:46.100 --> 02:11:47.580]   is there's a lot of tears.
[02:11:47.580 --> 02:11:50.500]   Steve cries at the drop of a hat in this book.
[02:11:50.500 --> 02:11:51.340]   And not only is Steve,
[02:11:51.340 --> 02:11:54.460]   but it's John Scully bursts into tears at one point.
[02:11:54.460 --> 02:11:56.540]   People are crying a lot in this book.
[02:11:57.180 --> 02:11:59.140]   (laughs)
[02:11:59.140 --> 02:12:02.780]   - I think one of the, to talk about what Andy was talking about,
[02:12:02.780 --> 02:12:05.500]   the, I think one of the complicated things to do great things
[02:12:05.500 --> 02:12:07.500]   is that you have to have people do things
[02:12:07.500 --> 02:12:09.140]   that are bigger than themselves,
[02:12:09.140 --> 02:12:10.900]   that are more than what they were gonna do
[02:12:10.900 --> 02:12:12.340]   without you being there.
[02:12:12.340 --> 02:12:14.740]   And I think that there's this crazy balancing act
[02:12:14.740 --> 02:12:17.500]   between having the empathy to understand
[02:12:17.500 --> 02:12:18.380]   where they're coming from,
[02:12:18.380 --> 02:12:19.380]   and where they are, you know,
[02:12:19.380 --> 02:12:22.500]   as far as they haven't slept for four days or whatever,
[02:12:22.500 --> 02:12:24.980]   and also having the lack of empathy
[02:12:24.980 --> 02:12:27.860]   to be committed to completing a mission.
[02:12:27.860 --> 02:12:30.900]   - Well, here's an example that they talk about in the book,
[02:12:30.900 --> 02:12:34.620]   Andy Hertzfeld, and all the Mac team
[02:12:34.620 --> 02:12:36.620]   in order to get the Mac software working for the demo,
[02:12:36.620 --> 02:12:37.660]   you know, the one where he says,
[02:12:37.660 --> 02:12:38.500]   he comes out of the,
[02:12:38.500 --> 02:12:41.500]   actually it was before the demos for shipping to ship day.
[02:12:41.500 --> 02:12:43.540]   They had to stay up three nights straight.
[02:12:43.540 --> 02:12:48.060]   Burrell Smith, or one of them brought a big bag
[02:12:48.060 --> 02:12:49.460]   of espresso coffee beans,
[02:12:49.460 --> 02:12:53.100]   and they just were eating chocolate espresso coffee beans
[02:12:53.100 --> 02:12:54.420]   for three days straight.
[02:12:54.420 --> 02:12:55.620]   They finally, they're done,
[02:12:55.620 --> 02:13:00.540]   Hertzfeld's like on the couch, comatose, goes home,
[02:13:00.540 --> 02:13:01.980]   they all come back a few hours later,
[02:13:01.980 --> 02:13:03.420]   they plan to spend, you know, sleep forever,
[02:13:03.420 --> 02:13:04.380]   but they come back a few days later,
[02:13:04.380 --> 02:13:06.020]   see how the thing's doing.
[02:13:06.020 --> 02:13:09.340]   Job says, oh, by the way, I need a really cool demo.
[02:13:09.340 --> 02:13:10.340]   That's the one where they write,
[02:13:10.340 --> 02:13:11.700]   where the hello, I'm Mac and Josh,
[02:13:11.700 --> 02:13:13.740]   it's good to get out of the bag.
[02:13:13.740 --> 02:13:15.860]   They had to write that demo, so they go, okay.
[02:13:15.860 --> 02:13:19.180]   So finally, Hertzfeld, it's done, he takes a leave of absence.
[02:13:19.180 --> 02:13:23.140]   Job's distributes stock options at that point,
[02:13:23.140 --> 02:13:25.460]   and doesn't give Hertzfeld any.
[02:13:25.460 --> 02:13:27.260]   And Andy comes in and says, what the hell?
[02:13:27.260 --> 02:13:29.860]   He says, well, he actually asked his boss,
[02:13:29.860 --> 02:13:32.100]   not Steve, well, what the hell?
[02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:34.700]   Boss says, oh, well, nobody who was on leave got options.
[02:13:34.700 --> 02:13:37.180]   He says, well, wait a minute, what's on on leave?
[02:13:37.180 --> 02:13:39.260]   I exhausted, I wasn't on leave.
[02:13:39.260 --> 02:13:40.260]   I mean, he had to fight for,
[02:13:40.260 --> 02:13:42.100]   it wasn't an option, it was $50,000 a bonus.
[02:13:42.100 --> 02:13:43.940]   He had to fight for his $50,000 bonus.
[02:13:43.940 --> 02:13:45.260]   He finally got it.
[02:13:45.260 --> 02:13:46.780]   But that's the kind of thing Jobs would do.
[02:13:46.780 --> 02:13:50.620]   He would push people to the edge of exhaustion and past it,
[02:13:51.460 --> 02:13:55.340]   and then move on, it's like, okay, what have you done for me lately?
[02:13:55.340 --> 02:13:59.460]   There's a really cool line from one of his first girlfriends
[02:13:59.460 --> 02:14:02.420]   who said he was an enlightened being who was cruel.
[02:14:02.420 --> 02:14:04.220]   That's a really strange combination.
[02:14:04.220 --> 02:14:05.780]   Yes.
[02:14:05.780 --> 02:14:07.900]   But Andy, you got to talk to Walter Isaacson.
[02:14:07.900 --> 02:14:09.820]   He interviewed you for the book,
[02:14:09.820 --> 02:14:12.220]   'cause you're quoted in it, right?
[02:14:12.220 --> 02:14:13.700]   Yeah, he took a quote from a book,
[02:14:13.700 --> 02:14:16.420]   and he listed inside Steve's brain in the bibliography,
[02:14:16.420 --> 02:14:17.460]   so he looked at that.
[02:14:17.460 --> 02:14:18.700]   He sent me a really nice note saying
[02:14:18.700 --> 02:14:23.700]   that he'd read the books and looked at the website,
[02:14:23.700 --> 02:14:25.060]   and they were all really useful.
[02:14:25.060 --> 02:14:27.780]   It's obviously, Isaacson did his homework here.
[02:14:27.780 --> 02:14:29.660]   He's a former editor of Time Magazine,
[02:14:29.660 --> 02:14:31.820]   and he knows what he's doing.
[02:14:31.820 --> 02:14:34.540]   He's written several very good biographies,
[02:14:34.540 --> 02:14:36.220]   including the Einstein, which is excellent.
[02:14:36.220 --> 02:14:39.100]   So, you talked to him yesterday or the day before?
[02:14:39.100 --> 02:14:42.860]   Yesterday, while he was trying to get some lunch
[02:14:42.860 --> 02:14:43.860]   and check out of his hotel,
[02:14:43.860 --> 02:14:45.940]   he's on a media tour in New York.
[02:14:45.940 --> 02:14:48.820]   So, we squeezed in a 20, 25-minute phone call.
[02:14:48.820 --> 02:14:52.660]   Well, he was clearly a bit punchy,
[02:14:52.660 --> 02:14:54.580]   'cause his blood sugar was low.
[02:14:54.580 --> 02:14:55.420]   Poor guy.
[02:14:55.420 --> 02:14:57.740]   And yeah, he's been doing, you know,
[02:14:57.740 --> 02:15:00.580]   the 60 minutes in, if you had aired just the night before,
[02:15:00.580 --> 02:15:03.980]   and you know, he's busy like crazy this week.
[02:15:03.980 --> 02:15:06.900]   So, what did you glean from your conversation yesterday?
[02:15:06.900 --> 02:15:10.900]   He wanted to tell a little more detail about jobs.
[02:15:10.900 --> 02:15:13.820]   The big thing from 60 minutes was that jobs delayed
[02:15:13.820 --> 02:15:17.060]   his cancer treatment, he delayed getting it removed anyway
[02:15:17.060 --> 02:15:18.500]   for nine months, and of course,
[02:15:18.500 --> 02:15:20.940]   this may have cost him his life,
[02:15:20.940 --> 02:15:24.820]   and instead was looking at alternative treatments.
[02:15:24.820 --> 02:15:26.380]   He didn't want his body to be violated,
[02:15:26.380 --> 02:15:27.300]   he didn't want to be opened up,
[02:15:27.300 --> 02:15:29.980]   and have part of his pancreas removed.
[02:15:29.980 --> 02:15:33.340]   So, he tried herbal remedies and dietary remedies
[02:15:33.340 --> 02:15:34.420]   and a bunch of questions.
[02:15:34.420 --> 02:15:37.060]   Even a psychic, apparently, yeah.
[02:15:37.060 --> 02:15:38.100]   And that may have killed him,
[02:15:38.100 --> 02:15:40.380]   because in fact, many doctors think that that nine months
[02:15:40.380 --> 02:15:41.740]   was enough for it to metastasize,
[02:15:41.740 --> 02:15:43.460]   and it would have been treatable
[02:15:43.460 --> 02:15:45.540]   had he gotten operated on right away.
[02:15:45.540 --> 02:15:47.660]   - Yeah, that looks to be the case.
[02:15:47.660 --> 02:15:49.940]   No one wants to say it, no one can know for sure, of course.
[02:15:49.940 --> 02:15:52.140]   You know, because they might have spread it before,
[02:15:52.140 --> 02:15:54.460]   but yeah, that, you know,
[02:15:54.460 --> 02:15:55.660]   they advise him to get it out straight away.
[02:15:55.660 --> 02:15:57.980]   And of course, his wife, Andy Grove,
[02:15:57.980 --> 02:15:59.540]   who was a good friend of jobs,
[02:15:59.540 --> 02:16:01.700]   and a cancer survivor advised him to do that.
[02:16:01.700 --> 02:16:03.340]   Larry Ellison told him to go do it.
[02:16:03.340 --> 02:16:04.940]   You know, everybody basically was saying, you know,
[02:16:04.940 --> 02:16:05.980]   get it out.
[02:16:05.980 --> 02:16:07.100]   And I asked Isaacson, you know,
[02:16:07.100 --> 02:16:09.380]   how could somebody who's so rational, you know,
[02:16:09.380 --> 02:16:13.260]   makes such what seems like such an irrational decision,
[02:16:13.260 --> 02:16:15.900]   and such a unscientific decision.
[02:16:15.900 --> 02:16:19.020]   You know, here's the guy who's one of the leading technologists.
[02:16:19.020 --> 02:16:22.620]   You know, why wouldn't he have a modern scientific-based treatment?
[02:16:22.620 --> 02:16:25.340]   Well, Isaacson said that he was, you know,
[02:16:25.340 --> 02:16:30.660]   a lot more active in exploring all the different alternatives.
[02:16:30.660 --> 02:16:33.660]   You know, obviously he was reluctant to get operated on, but.
[02:16:33.660 --> 02:16:35.660]   - I think it actually shows it.
[02:16:35.660 --> 02:16:37.380]   And Isaacson talks a lot about this,
[02:16:37.380 --> 02:16:40.820]   that jobs trusted intuition more than rationality.
[02:16:40.820 --> 02:16:42.300]   Again and again, it says in this book,
[02:16:42.300 --> 02:16:43.780]   it was about intuition for him.
[02:16:43.780 --> 02:16:47.140]   That's what he learned when he was in India for a year.
[02:16:47.140 --> 02:16:49.180]   That's what he learned in his Zen studies.
[02:16:49.180 --> 02:16:52.020]   He really trusted his intuition, his gut.
[02:16:52.020 --> 02:16:54.980]   And that's where that, you know, that sudden, you know,
[02:16:54.980 --> 02:16:56.460]   he'd do code reviews.
[02:16:56.460 --> 02:16:57.660]   The person who put the code on the table,
[02:16:57.660 --> 02:16:58.940]   he wouldn't even pick it up.
[02:16:58.940 --> 02:17:00.420]   Of course, Steve wasn't a coder,
[02:17:00.420 --> 02:17:03.020]   as Bill Gates points out kind of bitterly.
[02:17:03.020 --> 02:17:04.460]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[02:17:04.460 --> 02:17:05.660]   - But he wouldn't even pick it up.
[02:17:05.660 --> 02:17:07.100]   He'd be saying, "That's crap.
[02:17:07.100 --> 02:17:08.420]   "Make it better." - Right.
[02:17:08.420 --> 02:17:10.700]   - And so he trusted this gut.
[02:17:10.700 --> 02:17:12.660]   And this in this case has gut failed him, I think.
[02:17:12.660 --> 02:17:15.060]   - Well, one thing I will say is that we don't,
[02:17:15.060 --> 02:17:17.540]   we don't know what would have happened.
[02:17:17.540 --> 02:17:18.980]   Like his gut told him not to do it.
[02:17:18.980 --> 02:17:19.820]   - We have no idea.
[02:17:19.820 --> 02:17:20.660]   - We've got told him not to do it.
[02:17:20.660 --> 02:17:22.900]   We don't know what would have happened.
[02:17:22.900 --> 02:17:25.020]   Of course, doctors can tell us that everything would have been
[02:17:25.020 --> 02:17:26.980]   fine if they had just done the operation.
[02:17:26.980 --> 02:17:28.300]   But, you know, my great-grandfather died
[02:17:28.300 --> 02:17:29.780]   from a routine taunt selectomy.
[02:17:29.780 --> 02:17:30.620]   - Right.
[02:17:30.620 --> 02:17:32.100]   - You know, so, you know, it could have been something.
[02:17:32.100 --> 02:17:33.900]   - Although this particular kind of cancer
[02:17:33.900 --> 02:17:35.940]   is highly, apparently, and I'm not an expert,
[02:17:35.940 --> 02:17:38.020]   highly operable, and it's a shame, I feel bad.
[02:17:38.020 --> 02:17:38.860]   You know, it's interesting.
[02:17:38.860 --> 02:17:40.340]   The other thing that comes through,
[02:17:40.340 --> 02:17:41.380]   several times in the book,
[02:17:41.380 --> 02:17:43.180]   is that Jobs is fairly fatalistic.
[02:17:43.180 --> 02:17:45.340]   He said he would die young.
[02:17:45.340 --> 02:17:48.340]   He believed that he told Scully, "I'm gonna die young.
[02:17:48.340 --> 02:17:50.540]   "I need to do a lot right now.
[02:17:50.540 --> 02:17:52.340]   "I need to accomplish a lot right now
[02:17:52.340 --> 02:17:55.140]   "because I'm not gonna have many chances."
[02:17:55.140 --> 02:17:57.660]   So this might have been almost self-fulfilling prophecy.
[02:17:57.660 --> 02:18:00.820]   - Yeah, as soon as he was obsessed with death,
[02:18:00.820 --> 02:18:02.420]   he was going on about in his twenties.
[02:18:02.420 --> 02:18:04.260]   He thought he was gonna die before he was 30.
[02:18:04.260 --> 02:18:07.020]   He told Scully that he thought he was gonna die before he was 30.
[02:18:07.020 --> 02:18:08.220]   And yeah, that obviously drove him a lot.
[02:18:08.220 --> 02:18:09.860]   You know, we were talking earlier about what drove him,
[02:18:09.860 --> 02:18:13.380]   and I think that fear of death definitely did,
[02:18:13.380 --> 02:18:16.100]   definitely pushed him to try to make a mark.
[02:18:16.100 --> 02:18:19.340]   But yeah, and of course, you know,
[02:18:19.340 --> 02:18:21.340]   he died just sort of at the height of his powers.
[02:18:21.340 --> 02:18:23.260]   I mean, I think that's why we saw that huge.
[02:18:23.260 --> 02:18:25.380]   A lot of the shark, there was a lot of shark, you know,
[02:18:25.380 --> 02:18:28.180]   all the memorials that showed up at the Apple stores
[02:18:28.180 --> 02:18:29.740]   when he died, you know, a lot of people felt
[02:18:29.740 --> 02:18:30.780]   that he was just really getting going.
[02:18:30.780 --> 02:18:32.700]   He was really just starting to get some respect too.
[02:18:32.700 --> 02:18:34.260]   Most of his career, you know, people thought he was
[02:18:34.260 --> 02:18:37.660]   just a slick salesman, a marketer, a fast talker,
[02:18:37.660 --> 02:18:41.180]   you know, somebody who, who, who, whose reputation
[02:18:41.180 --> 02:18:43.860]   was built upon the work of others, like Wozniak
[02:18:43.860 --> 02:18:44.940]   and Johnny Ive.
[02:18:44.940 --> 02:18:48.340]   And it was only, you know, I mean, even up until the iPhone,
[02:18:48.340 --> 02:18:50.980]   I would say up until 2006, 2007,
[02:18:50.980 --> 02:18:52.500]   people thought he was like a one hit wonder.
[02:18:52.500 --> 02:18:55.540]   The iPod was, you know, Apple getting lucky.
[02:18:55.540 --> 02:18:58.220]   The Mac was still had a niche market share,
[02:18:58.220 --> 02:19:00.700]   you know, even though Apple was obviously on a firm footing,
[02:19:00.700 --> 02:19:04.020]   he wasn't being loaded in the, in the business mugs.
[02:19:04.020 --> 02:19:05.780]   He wasn't a CEO to emulate everyone's,
[02:19:05.780 --> 02:19:08.420]   criticized his, his management technique
[02:19:08.420 --> 02:19:10.980]   and felt that there wasn't something
[02:19:10.980 --> 02:19:12.180]   that anybody else could learn from.
[02:19:12.180 --> 02:19:13.020]   So.
[02:19:13.020 --> 02:19:15.700]   - Well, in fact, his first go around at Apple,
[02:19:15.700 --> 02:19:16.780]   he kind of was a jerk.
[02:19:16.780 --> 02:19:18.420]   (laughs)
[02:19:18.420 --> 02:19:20.860]   I mean, he did make the Mac.
[02:19:20.860 --> 02:19:22.420]   But yeah, I haven't gotten to the second yet,
[02:19:22.420 --> 02:19:24.900]   but one of the things I said is it wasn't getting fired.
[02:19:24.900 --> 02:19:25.740]   - It can't say it was.
[02:19:25.740 --> 02:19:26.580]   - It wasn't getting, is it really?
[02:19:26.580 --> 02:19:27.420]   Oh, geez.
[02:19:27.420 --> 02:19:29.660]   It wasn't getting fired that taught Steve.
[02:19:29.660 --> 02:19:31.340]   He was failing with Next.
[02:19:31.340 --> 02:19:32.660]   Of course, while he's failing with Next,
[02:19:32.660 --> 02:19:34.780]   he's taking this little company called Pixar,
[02:19:34.780 --> 02:19:36.500]   trying to convince the folks at Pixar
[02:19:36.500 --> 02:19:39.540]   that their business is selling hardware and software,
[02:19:39.540 --> 02:19:40.980]   but there's this guy, John Lasseter,
[02:19:40.980 --> 02:19:43.540]   who says, "Well, hey, let me just make some demo films
[02:19:43.540 --> 02:19:46.260]   "to show off what our software can do."
[02:19:46.260 --> 02:19:47.420]   Wins an Academy Award.
[02:19:47.420 --> 02:19:49.220]   Steve Jobs funds this, by the way,
[02:19:49.220 --> 02:19:51.180]   out of his own pocket because there's no money
[02:19:51.180 --> 02:19:53.300]   being made by Pixar at this point.
[02:19:53.300 --> 02:19:55.980]   And spends $300,000 on the tin toy.
[02:19:55.980 --> 02:19:58.740]   - And by the way, like, I think all of those shorts,
[02:19:58.740 --> 02:20:01.420]   all those early Pixar shorts are on iTunes.
[02:20:01.420 --> 02:20:03.220]   I have them all on my kids' iPad.
[02:20:03.220 --> 02:20:05.100]   - It started with little luck. - Little luck so.
[02:20:05.100 --> 02:20:05.940]   Luxo Jr.
[02:20:05.940 --> 02:20:08.540]   - And there's even, there's a lot of early ones
[02:20:08.540 --> 02:20:09.940]   that are very rough animations.
[02:20:09.940 --> 02:20:10.940]   - And they were just dead off
[02:20:10.940 --> 02:20:13.620]   of what the Pixar hardware could do.
[02:20:13.620 --> 02:20:16.380]   - Well, and it's also, it was John Lasseter testing animation.
[02:20:16.380 --> 02:20:18.340]   I mean, he of course, that's what he told Steve Jobs,
[02:20:18.340 --> 02:20:19.900]   but of course, Lasseter came from animation,
[02:20:19.900 --> 02:20:21.500]   but Lasseter's not interested in technology.
[02:20:21.500 --> 02:20:23.420]   He's interested in making movies.
[02:20:23.420 --> 02:20:26.420]   - After Tin Toy, Disney came after very hard saying,
[02:20:26.420 --> 02:20:29.700]   "We want you to make a movie about toys, intelligent toys."
[02:20:29.700 --> 02:20:31.740]   And Lasseter was so loyal to Steve at this point.
[02:20:31.740 --> 02:20:33.620]   And this is the other side of that coin.
[02:20:33.620 --> 02:20:35.420]   Lasseter loved Steve Jobs so much at that point.
[02:20:35.420 --> 02:20:37.420]   He said, "No, I'm gonna stay a Pixar."
[02:20:37.420 --> 02:20:39.100]   You know, and eventually what happened
[02:20:39.100 --> 02:20:40.580]   is Disney made a deal with Pixar and said,
[02:20:40.580 --> 02:20:42.780]   "Well, you know, let's do some movies."
[02:20:42.780 --> 02:20:44.700]   And, well, you know what happened.
[02:20:44.700 --> 02:20:47.340]   - You know, since this has come out,
[02:20:47.340 --> 02:20:49.140]   there's been actually a little bit of criticism
[02:20:49.140 --> 02:20:53.840]   of the book from people like Syracuse, Dave Weiner.
[02:20:55.180 --> 02:20:57.340]   I think on balance though, this is fascinating.
[02:20:57.340 --> 02:20:58.660]   There's a lot of information in here.
[02:20:58.660 --> 02:20:59.980]   It's not the final biography
[02:20:59.980 --> 02:21:01.740]   that'll ever be written of Steve Jobs,
[02:21:01.740 --> 02:21:04.220]   but I think it's still a great read.
[02:21:04.220 --> 02:21:05.900]   If you haven't read it yet, it's certainly
[02:21:05.900 --> 02:21:06.820]   well worth reading.
[02:21:06.820 --> 02:21:08.540]   This one's on Audible by the way.
[02:21:08.540 --> 02:21:12.660]   Be a good Audible pick for you for that free offer.
[02:21:12.660 --> 02:21:15.820]   Well, I hope you enjoyed this week's Mac Break Weekly,
[02:21:15.820 --> 02:21:18.740]   a best of, we'll be back on Tuesday, 11 a.m. Pacific,
[02:21:18.740 --> 02:21:21.300]   2 p.m. Eastern Time for a brand new year
