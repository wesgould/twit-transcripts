[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.680]   That sapphire screen that Marcus Brownlee showed us.
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.000]   Is it real? Is it a portent of things to come?
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.400]   Where is the 5.5-inch iPhone?
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.200]   And why the iWatch might not be available till next year.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.320]   It's all coming up next.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.880]   Renee Richie, Annie and Aco, and yes, I'm back.

[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.120]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show that covers
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:36.120]   your Macintosh needs and wants and desires and hopes and fears.
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.120]   Andy Inaco is here.
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.520]   He's in charge of hopes and fears from the Chicago Sun times.
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.040]   I'm really confident this is going to be a great show,
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.240]   but nonetheless, I'm staying away from the windows,
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.280]   which I've taped and boarded up because we might get some rain
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.480]   later.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.760]   Hopes and fears, ladies and gentlemen, together in one human.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.360]   It's marvelous.
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.200]   See how I pick up what you say?
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.240]   It's not like I'm trying to get out at all.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.600]   It's beautiful.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.800]   Renee Ritchie, who's in charge of desire from imore.com,
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.480]   and needs and wants.
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.200]   I'm covetously.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.200]   I want all the things.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.120]   I don't necessarily need them, but I want them.
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.040]   Hey, I missed you guys.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.080]   I thank Mike Elgin.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.360]   There was Mike that filled in last week.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:09.880]   Yeah?
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.200]   Yep.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.640]   Absolutely.
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.400]   And Sarah the Week before.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.040]   And Sarah the Week before.
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.960]   You know, I wasn't planning to be gone last week.
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.760]   I would have warned you.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.920]   But at we came to the end of our week in Hawaii,
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.160]   and Lisa and I looked at each other and go, three more days.
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.680]   So we called and we said, hey, is it OK?
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.080]   We don't come back right now.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.520]   You can't make us come back.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.640]   Yeah, see, that's not a weird thing when you're in Hawaii.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.600]   If you were in like, you know, a rubber plant in Ohio,
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.600]   you'd say, you know what?
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.880]   That's there's something else going on.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.160]   He's cooking meth.
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.160]   Hawaii.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.000]   It's lovely.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.160]   I think I went a little native.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.040]   In fact, I almost came on the show
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.640]   with a coconut bra and a grass skirt.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.000]   But then I decided I don't want to scar people for life.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.480]   I know their children watching.
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.880]   You do that for the after 11 show.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:57.880]   Wow.
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.720]   I did get up at one point during--
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.520]   we had a hotel where there was music, live music every night,
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.480]   you know, just small little group and a guy.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.400]   I got up at one point.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.680]   You're still wearing the Koa underwear, though, right?
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.280]   Well, once you go Koa, you never go back.
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.480]   There's some really nice grain in that end cap there.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.280]   Hey, something happened while I was gone,
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.720]   and I was kind of a gas, shocked, blown away.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.960]   And I'm talking about the video.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.200]   I first saw Marcus Brownlee's video of the sapphire--
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.000]   yeah, ported sapphire screen of the iPhone 6,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.400]   the 4.7 inch screen.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.920]   And then he mentioned Sunny Dixon.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:37.880]   He got it from Sunny Dixon.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.080]   And then I saw that Sunny and others had posted videos from China.
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.760]   And I think this surprised me.
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.320]   You know, typically you'll get these anonymous posts
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.960]   from Chinese sources.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:56.600]   But for somebody of Marcus's stature to come forward and say,
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.040]   I have what I believe to be the iPhone 6 bezel in sapphire.
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.560]   And he cut it with a knife, and he bent it and all this stuff.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.320]   Is he ever going to get invited to an Apple event again?
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.760]   Maybe not, but I think that those 1.2 million video views--
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.080]   I'm reminded of a photo that was posted of Leonardo DiCaprio
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.120]   like the day after he was stubbed for an Oscar nomination.
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.520]   And it shows him on a yacht with like 12 bikini models.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.760]   And I'm thinking, yeah, he's obviously really broken up
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:26.480]   about that.
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.680]   Similarly, when you get that kind of attention
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.480]   and probably that kind of ad revenue,
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.360]   and also credit for breaking a really, really cool story--
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.800]   No kidding.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.760]   I think he's OK with not getting the free coffee
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.160]   and Danish for Apple for the procedural future.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.520]   5 million almost views in five days.
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.640]   Not bad.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.800]   But the thing that I found-- and in fact, I immediately
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.120]   wanted it-- I almost called you Renee and said,
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.200]   is this possible?
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.680]   What do you think?
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.360]   Is this real?
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.160]   It'd be awfully hard to fake whatever that is.
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.080]   Now, by the way, no one knows if it is sapphire.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.760]   I don't know if there's a way to tell, I guess,
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.680]   a mass spectrometer, which Marcus apparently didn't have to hand.
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.080]   My favorite headline was when they asked experts
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.640]   if they thought it might be sapphire from looking at the video.
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.560]   And did the experts have an opinion?
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.240]   They said it's possible that it's sapphire
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.800]   by looking at the video, but they need a mass spectrometer.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.480]   Yeah, we know that Apple has a sapphire plant working
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:25.840]   at full speed somewhere in Southern California.
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.400]   And of course, they use sapphire on the fingerprint reader.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.840]   And maybe even, I've heard some say on the lens on the camera.
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.480]   On the lens, too, yeah.
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.040]   And we've seen sapphire before in watches.
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.840]   But what we've not seen is sapphire that big.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.920]   And that production capacity, too.
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:39.920]   Yeah.
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.000]   And sapphire would be pretty scratchable.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.720]   I mean, the features that he showed of this
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.200]   would be typical of sapphire, right?
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.520]   And the thing is, I mean, Sonny Dixon, he got iPhone 5S parts.
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.160]   He might have even gotten iPhone 5 parts.
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.360]   He's pretty good at it.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.040]   They only all come out of China like you said before,
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.520]   but he's been very good at actually finding the people who
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.160]   have them and getting them to send them to him.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.280]   And now he's sending them on to other people.
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.360]   Now, Gorilla Glass 3, which others are using, is similar,
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.680]   is it not?
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.960]   It's hard to know what the practical difference is going to be.
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.080]   I don't think that Gorilla Glass can stand up to the sort of
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.400]   abuse that he seems to be giving it right now.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.920]   But we're talking about this a little bit.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.560]   And I'm not--
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.120]   I think Apple will have to really convince people that here
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.800]   is why this is going to be even more scratch-proof than Gorilla
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.520]   Glass, which is pretty damn scratch-proof.
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.080]   I've got Gorilla Glass on three different phones that I carry
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.360]   unshielded in my pocket.
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.320]   And there's barely a nick on any of them.
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.320]   So I'm wondering, though, if it's less because of these
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.720]   scratch resistance and more, because this allows them to
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.960]   manufacture this phone in a brand new way, I did notice that
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.200]   the edges of that front bezel are really nicely rounded over.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.160]   And they don't look like they're rounded over to be fitted
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:46.840]   into something else.
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.840]   It looks like that is supposed to be the leading surface of
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.200]   the phone, and maybe it's possible that the reason why they
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.480]   went with this material is because it's easier to do that.
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.680]   Both of you guys have experienced vetting rumors like this.
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.960]   We should say that rumors that come out of Cupertino are
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.720]   rare and often wrong, mainly because Apple is so good at
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.280]   keeping a lid on its own employees, but that the supply
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.080]   chain in China, much harder to keep a lid on.
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.360]   So as you point out, it's not unusual to see parts come out
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.360]   of China.
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.120]   And this really is about the time when you would start to
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.440]   expect some parts to leak out.
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.440]   If this had come out four or five months ago, you'd be
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.160]   yeah, right, maybe.
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.240]   But two or three months before you were expecting a new
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.240]   iPhone release, it just seems more credible than it would be
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:27.800]   otherwise.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.800]   And Renee, this would be a hard thing to fake, I imagine.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.800]   Yeah, well, I mean, you never put anything past practical
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.520]   jokers, but it would be hard to fake.
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.680]   There's very little incentive for faking it.
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.720]   I mean, you know, Marcus can get video views by doing a lot of
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:41.920]   things.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.640]   Why would you say Marcus?
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.200]   I mean, if anything, maybe Sonny Dixon.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.080]   Yeah, he's also like, because you're only as good as your
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.120]   reputation with this stuff.
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.440]   And if you're if you're doing it consistently, you get a good
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:50.920]   reputation.
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.360]   If you try to pass one over on people, you don't.
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.560]   The thing that I thought was interesting too is that whether
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.520]   a sapphire is better not, and it would be hard to tell it
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.000]   would be good to do the exact same video with a with this
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.920]   panel and a five s panel side by side, see what the actual
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:04.720]   differences are.
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.520]   But it's the same with 64 bit.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.680]   It doesn't mean much to people, but you put it on a box and
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.120]   suddenly another phone doesn't have it.
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.960]   So the you're at the store at the Apple phone says Sapphire
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:13.280]   Glass.
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:13.880]   Does that one have it?
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:14.080]   No.
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.600]   OK, I'm getting a sapphire phone.
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.880]   Well, and who doesn't?
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.000]   I mean, my kids have spied every one of their iPhone screens
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:20.480]   ever.
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.240]   Who hasn't seen this happen a million times?
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.920]   I mean, if there's a promise that your iPhone or any phone
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:29.120]   screen is more robust and durable, that is a that is a
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.360]   genuine benefit.
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.200]   That's not merely.
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.600]   Oh, here's a checkbox on.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.240]   My five S is crashed twice right now.
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.760]   I have two fractions down in front of the screen.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.840]   But now don't they have to attach this to glass?
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.640]   Yeah, that's that's that's that was I was going to say.
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.120]   I mean, whether this actually means that you're going to crack
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.280]   your actual screen less less likely than before.
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.840]   That remains to be seen.
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.120]   If all it does is make sure that the front looks very, very
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.200]   pretty and this doesn't reduce increase the cost of the phone.
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:54.840]   That's a win.
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.440]   Also, the other one is like you were saying a minute ago that
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:01.440]   they're part of selling an iPhone is part about making it seem
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.640]   like it's at least 18% magic.
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.560]   And if you say we've got this magical new material on the front
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.240]   that absolutely nobody else has.
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.120]   And the one the reasons why no one else has it is because no
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.920]   one else can figure out how to make it work on a phone.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:13.920]   But of course we did.
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:18.200]   So we're going to remember how when the iPhone four came out
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.800]   and they made this big deal about how we're using military
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.400]   grade windshield glass for the front and now the back, which
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.080]   makes it the most durable and wonderful thing.
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.320]   And of course it took only about two weeks to realize that.
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.280]   Oh, so now I have two planes of glass that now can shatter if I drop
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.560]   it accidentally instead of just one.
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.240]   So really cool, really cool, really interesting.
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.680]   But let's get a couple hundred couple, a couple million of these
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.280]   in people's hands to see exactly what this new cover, whatever
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.840]   it is, does for the phone.
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:46.440]   I don't know how meaningful it is because.
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:52.440]   But here's here's the Chinese video with probably a similar part.
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:59.040]   And they show that they they same kind of robustness until they
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.400]   put it under the tires of what they said was a 1.6 ton
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:03.600]   vehicle.
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.800]   And then in fact, let me see if I can get to that part.
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:07.320]   Here it is.
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.720]   You got to love this whole industry of torturing clients.
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:14.000]   And then they skip then they move on and do the same thing.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.800]   Actually, those look that looks like the video from Marcus Brownlee.
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.520]   So I don't know.
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.040]   This is a porn.
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.000]   So I have in my hands, what I wear.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.400]   This is a Samsung Galaxy S3.
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.840]   Front cover.
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.600]   Let's just take this off.
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.800]   I want to get 5 million views and I have a hard sharp knife.
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:43.320]   Not a scratch.
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.000]   It's pretty hard to use a sharp knife.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.080]   Also, the panel by itself is thin and will bend when it's on.
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:49.600]   Andy said this.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.680]   Oh, it's flexible.
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:51.480]   Yeah.
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:52.320]   When it.
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.440]   Oh, please.
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.280]   I think I'm bleeding.
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.800]   Oh, damn.
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.800]   Oh, well, there you go.
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.160]   I'm a medic.
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.000]   Somebody please sweep those glass shards off of the table.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.600]   Is that glass?
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.600]   Yeah, well, there's pointy.
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.200]   Is that blood?
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.760]   Wow.
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.880]   That really, OK, don't do this at home.
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.520]   I can't drink my water coffee now.
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.200]   Exactly.
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:15.360]   Yeah.
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:19.000]   And I hope the people in the front row in the studio, I answer OK.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   And meanwhile, let's get another shot of that blood because I do want those 5 million views.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.880]   Yeah, that's that's real blood.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.600]   We'll go for his audience.
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:34.800]   Now, let's let's let's be really careful here at any put and look at that stuff you peeled off of that top.
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.800]   Did any of them say don't try to break it with your bare hands?
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.800]   Because if it doesn't, we got a lawsuit that.
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.200]   That's like money, Leo.
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.200]   Sam's on money.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.000]   I didn't really expect that.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.800]   Can you give me a bit?
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:47.600]   I think I heard.
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.600]   I've been punctured.
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:53.200]   You know that that's that's not something that I would have instinctively thought to do myself.
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.400]   Hey, but I, you know what?
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.200]   I take it.
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.200]   You're for the hits.
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.000]   We suck.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.400]   We suffer for our art.
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.000]   Our art.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:00.800]   Wow.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:04.800]   As the power of millions of smart phone trains, board strokes in those hands.
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:08.000]   So OK, so we could say this much.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.800]   It's better than the galaxy S3 front cover.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:11.800]   Yeah.
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.600]   Ladies and gentlemen, I've proven it.
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:21.600]   I get if you if you but you still can't drive your rental truck over it and really why why screw with us Apple?
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:26.000]   If you're saying we can't drive a rental truck over it, I don't know if that's glass or just shards of plastic.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.400]   If people are watching, we need a super cut now of Leo and Mark has both.
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:34.800]   Let's take a break.
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.400]   Yeah, let's.
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:37.800]   No, wait a minute.
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:41.200]   Before we do other iPhone rumors, Ming Chi Kuo.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.800]   Good or bad?
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.200]   I can't remember his Ming Chi.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:48.800]   15 50 50 says and this is convenient.
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.600]   Remember that five and a half inch?
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:55.920]   I thought we know by the way, one thing we do know from if this if this part is real and as I everybody has said, it seems
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:00.640]   likely that this sapphire part, whether it's sapphire or not, we don't know, but it does seem like it's a real part.
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.960]   If that's the case, that's 4.7 inches.
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.400]   So that does confirm a 4.7 inch iPhone.
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:11.760]   Ming Chi Kuo has among other analysts said there will be a 4.7 and a five and a half inch iPhone.
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.760]   This week said, yeah, maybe not the five and a half.
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.200]   They're having trouble making that work.
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.680]   I love it every year, Leo.
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.080]   Every year, every year iPhone is delayed.
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:20.360]   Yeah.
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:25.640]   What's funny about this is it gets reported like I was going through my RSS feed yesterday and it did not say the the honest headline,
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:29.480]   which is analyst adjusts his forecast for when Apple is going to shift.
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:32.800]   It said iPhone 5.5 inch iPhone six delayed.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.160]   The latest previous guests.
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:36.240]   Yeah, let's get rid of that.
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:36.760]   No, exactly.
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.160]   You get to get to.
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.920]   You get to hits from the same BS rumor.
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:43.480]   Yeah. Yeah.
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.200]   So that's exactly right.
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:50.160]   He said no, Apple never said he said, you know, we need is a dust buster.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.120]   You got a dust buster?
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.760]   Need a Dyson, right on the desk.
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:54.440]   I need a Dyson.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.360]   We do have a Dyson.
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.960]   She's that thing hurt.
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.040]   It was like stabbing me in the face.
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.640]   It looked it looked like it hurt, Leo.
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.880]   It looked like several jagged pieces of material spraying and all the
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.320]   I'm I'm really lucky.
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.440]   I didn't blind myself.
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.400]   I was got to say that it'd be safety goggles.
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:13.080]   Next time Burke, remind me to wear the safety.
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:13.640]   Oh, you know what?
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:17.800]   All the safety goggles are at home so that we can safely fire our mini cannon.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:21.280]   There's a there's a reason why Mythbusters has had this has an ongoing
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.120]   relationship with that Alameda bomb range.
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:26.160]   Because come on, give me no, no, we got to do this.
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.920]   I can't I can't sit here in the shards.
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:29.360]   Thank you.
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:39.880]   I got time to bleed my friends.
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.280]   Thank you.
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.000]   OK, let's look at the positive here.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.640]   If Apple really does have like a sapphire cover that's more resistant to scratching a
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:53.200]   breakage, I will bet you $18 right now that Apple uses this video in the roll out video.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:59.800]   I just want to I want to be the Adrian Kingsley Hughes of the iPhone six.
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:00.480]   That's all I want.
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.640]   I want to be Mr.
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:02.640]   Toxic Hills do.
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:04.840]   I can tell we don't want it.
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:08.360]   We don't want to test our competitors screen covers, but some of you in the media
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.880]   decided to do it on your own and well, let's see what happened.
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:13.920]   Hey, Burke, was that a genuine and Samsung replacement part?
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.280]   We don't know.
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.360]   He screamed yes from the kid.
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.000]   He said yes.
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:23.400]   Because so so we have I think for know how we were showing how to fix phones and stuff.
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.080]   So we had some replacement parts.
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.760]   That's a genuine Samsung.
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:27.680]   All right.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:33.200]   Don't try this at home kitties.
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.280]   A cappuccino monkey glass.
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:38.440]   Not quite so I'm actually disappointed because I I was looking for a five and a half inch,
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.320]   but I didn't really expect a five and a half inch.
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:44.960]   That just seems so on Apple to make a to make that leap from four inches all the way
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.160]   to five and a half inches.
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.600]   If you look at it as a continuity between phones and tablets, they'll have every
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:53.240]   they'll have something at four inches, something at close to five inches,
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:56.240]   something close to six inches, something close to seven, something close to nine,
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:56.880]   and then maybe 12.
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.040]   You think they will eventually?
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:58.760]   Yeah.
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:02.880]   So there will be at some point of five and a half or six inch something.
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:05.360]   I don't know if that's a tablet or a phone.
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.720]   I don't know.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:10.640]   I mean, that there's so much really great experimentation happening with Samsung
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:11.920]   and with HTC and others.
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:15.720]   And it seems as though every time they were they come up with a new form factor,
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:17.520]   they find a market for it somewhere.
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:18.760]   So I don't know.
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:23.440]   I I too am a little bit skeptical about a five point five inch iPhone only because
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:26.680]   it seems as though that's big enough that Apple is going to start to say,
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:29.520]   well, we have a larger iPhone is called the iPad mini.
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.920]   It runs all that software and it pairs because of this new these new iOS eight
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:33.360]   features.
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.000]   It can use the exact same.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.720]   It can receive phone calls from your iPhone.
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:37.760]   Why would you want something else?
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.360]   But who knows?
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:40.920]   Yeah.
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:44.960]   I've been I'm right now on the on the on the big review board.
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.800]   I've got three different devices that I'm kind of contemplating whether they're
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:48.560]   worth writing about.
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:52.920]   But every time I see one of these different I've got the new Galaxy tab five,
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:57.160]   which is a little bit smaller than the iPad mini, but not that much,
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:01.200]   but it's still a very compelling size and five inches.
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:04.160]   I don't know what the exact screen size is.
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:08.040]   Imagine the imagine the something that's about the same length as the iPad mini.
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:12.080]   Only it has a wide screen wide screen form factor, which is nice because it
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:16.640]   still it makes it just slim enough to be pocketable and yet given that this
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:21.560]   device has the ability to run side by side apps and also the ability to watch
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:24.480]   movies in that form factor, it's a very compelling size.
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:28.760]   So I don't I was trying to as these rumors of a 5.5 inch iPhone have been
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:30.160]   getting greater traction.
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:33.760]   I've been wondering, gee, if I were presented with that choice between a 4.7
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:36.120]   or 5.5 iPhone, which one would I go for?
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:38.520]   And I honestly don't know which one I would go for.
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.160]   Rumors are well, mink.
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.680]   Chico says it might not be till later this year or early next year.
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:48.280]   I think at this point, we're just going to stop listening to me.
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.000]   Winter is coming.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.880]   It's such a, I mean, it's you read you read through these things with a certain
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.880]   amount of expectation and those expectations are absolutely mad.
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:00.160]   It's like, OK, so he's basically doing what we're doing right now, which is
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.280]   having a conversation about what might happen.
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:03.200]   Only rest.
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.880]   We're obviously just three people having a having conversation.
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:10.520]   He's saying, oh, I'm an analyst and I, you know, if I look inside my crystal ball,
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:14.400]   and I think that, well, no, you just thought that of the many possibilities
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.480]   and the infinite worlds that exist, just adjunct to our own reality.
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:20.920]   There is a reality in which Apple is planning on a 5.5 inch iPhone and that
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:23.880]   they are going to ship it around mobile world Congress and so during the fall.
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:27.360]   And you not and say, yes, I suppose if there are an infinite number of
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:31.800]   universes disjoint from one of them, could indeed have dinosaurs evolved from man.
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:35.480]   And they're using 5.5 inch iPhones in February and not in September.
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:39.560]   I have to say, I have to say, when you come by, this is a 4.7 inch phone.
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:42.760]   It's the Moto X and Motorola made it made a big deal.
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:46.600]   Like this is the perfect size because it's one, you could still do one handed operation.
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:50.240]   And it does, I have to say it fits in the hand better than a 5 inch, but it gives you
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.480]   more screen real estate than the iPhone.
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.040]   But you put that next to a 5s.
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.520]   It doesn't look like it's that much bigger.
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:58.200]   I mean, it really doesn't appear to it's not something that people are going to go
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.240]   in the stores and go, wow, it's a lot bigger.
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.000]   5.5 inch they would.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.880]   And we, one of the things that just for being too close, he is, he is one of the
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:09.880]   more reliable analysts, his timing is often suspect.
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:12.640]   But this is one of the reasons why Apple doesn't pre announce something.
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:16.240]   They never said we're going to have a 5.5 inch phone this fall because even if they
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:20.280]   are working very hard enough, 5.5 inch phone, they have not made one before.
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.640]   So they have no idea how hard it's going to be to get the screens, what the yield
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.440]   rates are going to be, what the cost structure is going to be.
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.280]   They could be shooting for it for the fall.
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:29.720]   It could slip till spring, but they keep all that inside.
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:33.240]   They keep all the sausage making inside because they just want to be able to announce a product.
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.680]   And that's very different than a lot of other companies.
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.680]   And so you can, you can look at the parts companies and Tim Cook has said this.
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:42.160]   It's hard to, it's hard to get data from one metric, but you can look at it and say,
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.320]   oh, these screens are coming in, but you really have no idea when Apple's going to launch for
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:46.760]   because they might not know yet.
[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:49.440]   And until they do it, I mean, it's just idle speculation.
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:50.120]   Yeah.
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.400]   OK, so everybody keep that in mind.
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.720]   And we should also point out, because Irene said in the chat room, oh, if they really
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:59.560]   do have this Sapphire cover, I am definitely buying the next iPhone because I've already
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:00.400]   cracked my screens.
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.360]   This does not mean your screen won't crack.
[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:05.640]   It just won't scratch maybe, but there's still glass underneath.
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:11.080]   Yeah, not not much of your iPhone is bendy in the way that that screen cover is bendy.
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:11.840]   Keep in mind.
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:16.200]   So this would be very easy to just want to point that out.
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:18.640]   We know the bottom line.
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:21.760]   We don't know anything, but we'll find out.
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:24.960]   That's interesting, though, because I heard a rumor when iOS seven was introduced,
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:29.000]   that the next iPhone would have smoother edges because all the bevel gestures and
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.200]   things included in iOS seven made you move your hand over that area more.
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.000]   And they thought the sharper edge was not as nice.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.520]   So it'll be nice if something like that.
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:37.560]   Yeah, this has the same thing bezel ledges.
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:43.400]   And of course, you're talking about gestures that made Microsoft Windows eight famous gestures.
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:45.960]   No one else is used to this date, but this is an iOS eight.
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:51.360]   The idea that you will swipe your finger not from on the screen, but just from the edge
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:55.000]   of the screen in would give you a special gesture.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.280]   And on Windows eight, it brings in the charms menu or swipes to the next screen.
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.680]   And a lot of people find that very annoying.
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:02.520]   Yeah.
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:05.480]   Well, but I was having a universal back gesture, but there's a button
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:07.800]   as well. So if you want the button, you can use that.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:11.440]   If you're if you're going to it's like a keyboard shortcut, if you're very adept at
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:14.960]   using gestures to navigate, you can go much faster just by swiping through things.
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:20.440]   Next apologizing for giving me the amazing shattering screen.
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:21.520]   That's not your look.
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:22.800]   You were a little supposed to notice this.
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:23.320]   Sorry.
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:25.440]   It's not your fall, Burke.
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:28.360]   Who you never told me to try to break it.
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:29.960]   He did bring me a knife.
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:32.840]   FCC rules might change.
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:37.880]   Thanks to a couple of friendly senators, Deb Fisher of Nebraska, J Rockefeller of West
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:43.600]   Virginia, they introduced the e-label act, which allows companies up to now the FCC
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:48.320]   when you get an FCC approval on your device has required that you etch it into the device.
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:54.720]   That's why the iPhone has that ugly FCC, CE thing etched into it.
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.800]   Maybe with this rule, the new iPhone will not have that.
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:03.280]   Although I have to point out that is the FCC has its own etching, but there's also the
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:08.800]   European approval process and they have that etching includes the European process, probably
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:12.320]   Canadian too, on the iPhone back.
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.680]   So you can't see that, can you?
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:16.640]   No, I'm not getting your screen.
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:19.000]   Well, I was going to show you, but it doesn't matter.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.880]   It's not a it's not important.
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.680]   Not important.
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:24.760]   The CE is Europe, right?
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:25.680]   There it is.
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.040]   Looking for a CRTC, but I see nothing.
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:29.120]   No CRTC.
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.160]   I do see an X over a garbage can.
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:32.560]   That means don't throw your phone out.
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:34.640]   Good advice.
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:40.560]   You do you do wonder how to what degree does this drive Apple bananas and to what degree are they
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:45.520]   willing to fight to see us or any way we could you could let us not put all that crap on the
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:46.320]   back of our phones.
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:46.600]   Yeah.
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:50.240]   Well, apparently the senators are encouraged.
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:55.560]   It saves money to, of course, senators say, allowing them to pass the savings on to consumers.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.680]   I wouldn't hold out hope on that.
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:00.000]   But all the energy saved from that laser.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:00.840]   Because you're pocket.
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:02.520]   Here's an extra petty.
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.800]   Don't spend it all in one place.
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:05.360]   All right.
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:09.360]   Now we're going to talk a little bit about personal capital dot com.
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:11.480]   I really love the idea of personal capital.
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:16.080]   I'm not going to mention since this is a Mac show, the fact that personal capital immediately
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:21.400]   made an Android Wear app so you can see how your investments are doing on your watch.
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:24.720]   That's that's just a nice additional feature.
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:29.280]   Personal capital, the idea is it's to help you manage your money.
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:35.360]   And you you you put all your data into the personal capital website and then you get a great
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:40.920]   dashboard that shows you what your investments are, your net worth is where the market is going.
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:45.680]   But even more than that, it really helps you make sure you're investing properly for your for your
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:46.640]   financial future.
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:51.120]   This is something maybe when you're younger, you don't think about I know I didn't.
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:58.320]   But let me tell you, it really makes a big difference if you start young to pay attention to all of this stuff.
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.520]   All the apps are free.
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:03.000]   All the apps are secure, including the Android Wear app.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.520]   So that's really cool to see that on your on your wrist.
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:09.280]   They have a mutual fee fund calculator.
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:13.800]   So you make sure you're not overpaying for your mutual fees and 401k fee analyzer.
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:19.640]   If you're overpaying for advice, you know, I think there's two problems that happen when people as they
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:20.520]   start to think ahead.
[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:23.080]   And by the way, most people don't do it till they're in their 40s and 50s.
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:23.640]   That was me.
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:26.600]   If you're in your 20s to 30s, now's a good time to do this.
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:34.200]   Either they they go somewhere where you get a personal financial advisor and then they kind of pay attention to you,
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:34.840]   but not much.
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:38.640]   And you get the feeling they're recommending stuff they get a commission on and stuff like that's kind of creepy.
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:45.400]   Or you try to do it as I did because I'm a geek, you know, online, on, you know, and and and it's kind of bewildering.
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:49.280]   And I don't know if you're getting the right advice and all your cancer spread, all that personal capital really solves this.
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.640]   I started using it about a year ago and Bill Harris came in here and did triangulation.
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:53.640]   Actually, it's almost two years now.
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:54.920]   And I just love it.
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:58.840]   All of your information in one place, go to personal capital.com/macbreak.
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:00.000]   It is free.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:06.200]   You they they do if you want, you can get a financial advisor.
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.640]   These are certified financial planners.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:08.520]   They're not on commission.
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:12.280]   They will tell you what you're spending too much on.
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:17.400]   They will help you get a better idea of what you're invested in, where you're spending money.
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.640]   It's really great.
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:22.960]   Personal even if you only use it once just to get an idea of where you stand.
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:24.160]   It's great.
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:30.040]   Personal capital.com and I love it that they were so quick off the mark and did an Android Wear app.
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:38.560]   So now I get like alerts when my 401k investments are tanking or going up or whatever.
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:42.520]   It's it's like a it's like a personalized stock market widget.
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:43.400]   It's really fabulous.
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:45.880]   Personal capital.com/macbreak.
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:46.920]   And of course, that's free as well.
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:51.560]   Moving right along.
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:26:02.960]   Apple has speaking of the FCC submitted for approval to the FCC and a dedicated I beacon device.
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:08.520]   They then FCC makes these filings public.
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:14.760]   So when Apple or any company submits to FCC for FCC approval, then everybody knows something's up.
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:22.560]   The hardware is a rounded hub like device with a USB port dedicated on and off switch.
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:26.760]   There are other companies that make I beacons.
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:27.840]   Are there not?
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:38.400]   But this is and of course, as we learned, I think thanks to you, Renee, that I beacon is built into any late model Mac iPad or iPhone.
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:42.680]   But this would be you could put this in a store environment.
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:45.000]   You could put this at a museum.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:52.880]   Tell me explained to me what this device does or what why you would want this.
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:55.880]   Why this is in addition to what is being done already.
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:57.640]   So I mean, it's interesting.
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:02.080]   It's all for indoor sort of indoor navigation and for proximity based things.
[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:08.160]   So for example, if you have an I beacon in the Twit studios, think of it almost like NFC, but you walk past it.
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.280]   It can trigger things on your phone.
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:11.600]   It can trigger interactions.
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:18.040]   You can label them. So if you have a chain of restaurants, it gets a little bit complicated, but they have a large idea and a small idea.
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:19.960]   And the large one could say this is this chain of restaurants.
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:22.080]   This is this Starbucks.
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:35.040]   And as you get, sorry, interest and as you get closer to it, for example, when you're when you're in 20 feet, it can give you like a notification saying, here's information about this with your when you're 10 feet, it can push content to you and say, Oh, here's a bunch of stuff that you can do when you're near me.
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:45.200]   It raises a lot of possibilities for things like guiding people through national parks, if they need accessibility issues or helping you find products in a store or even just like home automation stuff.
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.800]   Maybe you come in and text your eye beacon.
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:51.480]   It does a bunch of things to increase your lights, turn on televisions, close garage doors, all those sort of things.
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:59.280]   So if you think about it, sort of like a network of location beacons that can then trigger actions on your device becomes very interesting.
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:03.240]   Can I think of it as something like a bad girlfriend who tells me what I can do when I'm near her?
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:06.360]   No, because it doesn't have any it doesn't have any sentience.
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:07.560]   It has no agency of its own.
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:08.240]   Sentience.
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.880]   It's it's it's nice.
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:13.400]   It's nice because it's not like other similar techniques a store uses.
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.800]   It can't actually capture your ID or that.
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.480]   It's it's it only just saying here's a location.
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:19.600]   It's just broadcast.
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:20.640]   It doesn't receive.
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:21.240]   Right.
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:21.600]   Exactly.
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:25.320]   That's that's why these things can last like months and months and months on a tiny little button cell battery.
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.440]   That's cool.
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:33.960]   So unless unless they unless they add more smarts to it, the basic eye beacon idea is that you have a low power device that just says,
[00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:39.240]   the device the receiving device can get a very, very good fix on its location exact location based on this.
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:41.240]   But it's not there to collect information from your device.
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:42.120]   Excellent.
[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:46.560]   I get it now and that will solve the privacy issue that a lot of people have with eye beacon.
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:48.520]   Thanks a couple of the chaperone said, well, that does it.
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:49.680]   I'm turning my Bluetooth off.
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:52.640]   First of all, just turning Bluetooth was disable eye beacon.
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:55.800]   It is an independent eye beacon control in iOS.
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.080]   You can go in and just turn off eye.
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:58.880]   You can say I never want to be bothered by this.
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:00.080]   It uses Bluetooth.
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:03.560]   It's a very high value Bluetooth low energy. So yeah, turning Bluetooth off will also stop it.
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:05.520]   I don't believe it does anything with Wi-Fi.
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:08.920]   So you're safe, but you don't need to deny yourself Bluetooth just to stop eye beacon.
[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:09.920]   Just turn off eye beacon.
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:10.360]   Yeah.
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:17.360]   And it also and it also should be said that if you have let's say of the Starbucks app on your phone, the star, the Starbucks app can find that beacon.
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:20.880]   And then the Starbucks app is the one who transmits to Starbucks home central.
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:23.320]   Oh, it's Andy, not that's possible of this point.
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:23.600]   Right.
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:23.800]   Right.
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.680]   But the device itself is going to be basic.
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:26.720]   That makes sense.
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:29.160]   So Starbucks beacon, you come in the store.
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:33.680]   The beacon sees you your Starbucks app sees where it is.
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:40.680]   But it could do this with or without the eye beacon and you can do it with GPS, but GPS requires much more power from a device, typically than I beacon does.
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:43.080]   Mark Gurman in nine to five.
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:46.080]   Max said this could also have applications for home automation.
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:48.040]   This could be part of the home kit.
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:52.160]   People are just experimenting with them now.
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:53.400]   A bunch of developers have bought them.
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:58.960]   I know David Barnard put them up in his local coffee shop and there's a it's a huge experimentation period right now.
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:02.600]   But it's mostly one of those technologies where Apple has a couple ideas you could use it for.
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:06.440]   But because the framework is there, people will discover a lot of amazing other opportunities.
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:12.480]   Yeah, there's one developer that I'm in touch with who wrote just for his own personal use and app that he's got.
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:16.200]   He's got a little coin powered eye beacon just inside his luggage.
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:27.480]   And so he doesn't really have to get up from the from the chair at the at the at the baggage claim terminal until his little app says, Oh, by the way, your IP, your piece of luggage is now actually on the carousel because it's not only about 20 feet away.
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.240]   So it'll be a treasure with them.
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:43.880]   Yeah, it's it's going to be it's going to be interesting what happens when this goes from something that is almost nowhere that people who know how to use them have access to them to these things are now everywhere and their signals all over the place.
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:49.360]   It's kind of like when you think about there's no need right now for regulations on how to use quadrocopters.
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:57.080]   But once they're at every every best buy has them and they cost $90 and people who are just jerks who don't care about privacy and don't care about.
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:02.400]   Crashing a whirling bladed copter in the middle of a beach start messing around with them.
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:05.360]   That's when you start to wonder, OK, is this a university?
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:07.680]   Good idea or is this just a good idea for me to have it?
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:08.480]   Nobody else.
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:16.400]   So patent and trademark office has refused apples request to register touch ID as a trademark.
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:20.480]   They base their refuse on likelihood of confusion.
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:25.400]   There's a company called Chronos, which also has a touch ID.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.040]   Also, let's go ahead and iPhone, right?
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:29.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:31.480]   Yeah, I mean, Apple has a couple of roots.
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:33.880]   They could go and try to buy the other guy.
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:35.760]   What do they do with Cisco?
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:36.680]   Give them money.
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:37.640]   Yeah, I can never check.
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:42.320]   Yeah, buy them off or you could change the name, I guess, if you really wanted a trademark.
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:45.280]   According to the patent, a trademark office quote in the identification of goods.
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:50.080]   Applicant must use the common commercial or generic names for the goods.
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:55.960]   Be as complete and specific as possible and avoid the use of indefinite words and phrases.
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:32:00.520]   Like accessories, components, devices, equipment, materials, parts, systems, or products.
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:04.720]   Such words must be followed by, namely, yeah.
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:09.400]   You have to get you if you're asking for a trademark, you have to get a trademark on the phone.
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:12.320]   You can't just simply say, I own I touch for cupcakes.
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:12.840]   Got it.
[00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:16.040]   Rather rather it's OK if you say I own I touch for cupcakes.
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:21.000]   You can't say that I own it for any products that I'm going to sell to a retail audience.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   Because that simply means that no one else can ever use this.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.080]   It trademarks only protect one specific product for one specific kind of use.
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:32.120]   And if you have plans that go beyond this one thing, you have to say specifically what you have in mind for it.
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:35.640]   And that's another area in which the trademark office said no.
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:39.640]   Got to stop using interns on these trademark applications, Apple.
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:41.480]   Well, I mean, they want to avoid confusion, right?
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:46.080]   So if you're touch ID the pants and someone else has touch ID, the phone, you're fine.
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:49.680]   But if someone else is using touch ID for a computer-like device and then you want to use it,
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:50.600]   then they think it's confusing.
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:33:01.040]   When we trademarked Twit, for instance, we trademarked it in the area of broadcast news and entertainment shows or something like that.
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:07.280]   And Twitter, which we thought was kind of a conflict, we talked with them and our lawyers and their lawyers.
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:11.920]   And Twitter has its trademark in whatever was internet, social media.
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:14.680]   And so it was decided that we don't conflict.
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:15.480]   Because we call exists.
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:16.800]   We call exists because we're in separate.
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:19.600]   There's no confusion because we're in separate areas.
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:25.200]   Although everybody apparently doesn't pay attention to that because everybody, whenever I say I own a company called Twit says,
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.400]   "Oh, Twitter."
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:27.960]   And they go, "Whoosh."
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:28.960]   No.
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:31.680]   No, that's exactly the situation that's there to help.
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:37.800]   Think about how now you can't launch a service or a company without having to make up a brand new name for it.
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:42.000]   Because every single English word that could be a domain name is now already a domain name.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.680]   And whoever has, you know, weatherapp.com, that's it for everybody.
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:47.200]   So,
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:50.200]   if you've noticed lately that the music on hold, when you call the Apple Store has gotten better.
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.200]   Every day, Leo.
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:54.200]   Yeah, that music sounds so much better.
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.200]   You can thank a Redditor.
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.200]   He posted on Reddit.com.
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:58.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:33:59.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:01.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:02.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:03.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:05.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:06.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:07.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:14.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:17.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:20.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:22.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:24.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:25.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:26.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:27.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:28.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:29.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:30.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:31.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:32.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:33.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:37.200]   Genius appointment, much to my surprise, a lady from Cupertino called me the next day,
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:44.200]   saying she'd received a concerning email from Tim about ugly distortion music on hold.
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:48.200]   Tim had tested this himself, himself, and agreed.
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:52.200]   She assured me the hold music would be tested to make sure it sounded pleasant on all
[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:53.200]   types of phones and connections.
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:54.200]   That's why they bought Beats Lea.
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:56.200]   We finally figured out the music.
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:57.200]   Finally!
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:59.200]   God, I love Apple.
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:01.200]   I don't mean that sarcastically or ironically.
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:05.200]   I mean that this is the company where someone can think that that's a bad thing.
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:06.200]   Contact the CEO of the company.
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:09.200]   The CEO will actually put himself on hold and say, "Yeah, damn it.
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:10.200]   That sounds awful.
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:11.200]   Let's fix this."
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:12.200]   And it gets fixed.
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:13.200]   Isn't that great?
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:14.200]   Love that.
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:18.200]   Cook says he reads every email he gets hundreds a day.
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:26.200]   And obviously, like most CEOs of big public companies, they have a office of the executive
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:29.200]   or an office of the chairman that responds to these.
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:31.200]   And he's got people.
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:34.200]   I'm sure he doesn't read them all alone at night.
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:36.200]   He's got people sitting there next to him.
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:37.200]   Oh, well, Tim Cook reads.
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.200]   Yeah, and he says, "Fix that."
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:43.200]   But yeah, I think that's great that they pay attention to that.
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:47.200]   Well, especially if you're on hold, you're probably not there on hold to tell Apple how
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:48.200]   happy you are with the product.
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:50.200]   It's because you've got a problem that needs to be solved.
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:55.200]   And if you have to listen to "Have in My Baby" over and over again, that like, you know,
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:58.200]   crackly, crinkly quality, that's not going to make you happy when you're feeling
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:00.200]   like you're finally caught with her.
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:05.200]   You did hear Veronica Belmont and Ryan Bloch's conversation with Comcast.
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:10.200]   The Comcast is apparently apologized.
[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:12.200]   But I don't know.
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.200]   I think--
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:16.200]   I apologize because it was Ryan, sadly, if it was Joe Schmo having that experience.
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:17.200]   Right.
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:18.200]   Comcast.
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:24.200]   So they were-- so what happened is Ryan and Veronica are moving, and they wanted to switch
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:26.200]   to a provider called Astound.
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.200]   What are we looking at?
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:28.200]   Here I have it here.
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:30.200]   Can you hear my audio?
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:32.200]   And so they called Comcast.
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:38.200]   Now, I should mention before we play this, this is 10 minutes in.
[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:42.200]   They're talking-- they were transferred, of course, as you will be when you try to cancel
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:46.200]   Comcast to a customer retention expert.
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:50.200]   And the customer retention expert immediately said, "Why are you switching?"
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:55.200]   And Ryan says, "We told him several times, but he wouldn't stop asking."
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:58.200]   Apparently, Veronica was on for 10 minutes before the recording.
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:02.200]   Yeah, Ryan said, "What's going on?" and picked up and then started recording it.
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:04.200]   Okay, we'd like to-- we'd like to disconnect.
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:05.200]   We'd like to disconnect, please.
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:08.200]   Okay, so why do you think you don't want the SaaSter's feet?
[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:10.200]   Help me understand why you don't want SaaSter internet.
[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:13.200]   Help me understand why you can't just disconnect us.
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:19.200]   Because my job is to have a conversation with you about having-- about just-- I mean, keeping
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:22.200]   your service, about finding out why it is that you're looking to cancel the service.
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:23.200]   I don't understand.
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:25.200]   I don't understand.
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:29.200]   You can definitely go into the Comcast store and just connect your service there.
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:32.200]   Okay, and you just ask him to--
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:34.200]   You're too burnt that he killed two birds with one stone.
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:36.200]   You gotta return that cable card to the store anyway.
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:40.200]   We're actually going to just mail the cable card in, but if you can just please cancel our service.
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:42.200]   It goes on for many, many minutes.
[00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:45.200]   I mean, you've been with us since-- I've been with us since-- I've been with us for about
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.200]   two thousand five, nine years.
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.200]   You've been a Comcast customer.
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:49.200]   Sounds like--
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:50.200]   Are you faffing?
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:52.200]   Is this what about the relationship?
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:54.200]   Yeah, it's not about that relationship.
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:56.200]   It's not that that guy doesn't want the cancels.
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:59.200]   He doesn't want to be the one who says that they canceled under his phone call.
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.200]   Is that what it is?
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:01.200]   So I've read a number.
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:03.200]   There's been a lot of conversation about this.
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:05.200]   Comcast is embarrassed as they ought to be.
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:13.200]   Some people have said this is probably a third-party company that was trained by some agency,
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:19.200]   not Comcast, to never give up because the guy-- it takes another ten minutes to convince the
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:20.200]   guy I really want to cancel.
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:21.200]   It's probably not training though.
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:24.200]   I mean, there was a couple people on Twitter who did retention.
[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:26.200]   They said that their paycheck is affected by the amount.
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:29.200]   Like, if you can put down a reason why they're leaving, like they're moving, then it's not
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.200]   your fault.
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:32.200]   But if they just think that you lost a customer, you don't get paid properly.
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:35.200]   Let's put that up again, Chek, because I want to read Comcast's statement.
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:36.200]   We are very--
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:37.200]   This is also in the dark.
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:43.200]   We are very embarrassed by the way our employees-- so we now know it is a Comcast representative--
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:47.200]   spoke with Mr. Block and Ms. Belmont and are contacting them to personally apologize.
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:50.200]   By the way, I've received calls from the Comcast executive office.
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:53.200]   You never want to ever get that call.
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:55.200]   They're worse than Arnie Fuffkin.
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:56.200]   They're horrible.
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:58.200]   Anyway, let me read some more.
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:59.200]   Put it up again.
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:03.200]   The way in which our representative communicated with them is unacceptable and not consistent
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:05.200]   with how we train our customer service representatives.
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.200]   We're investigating the situation.
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:08.200]   We'll take quick action.
[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:12.200]   While the overwhelming majority of our employees work very hard to do the right thing every day,
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:16.200]   we are using this very unfortunate experience to reinforce how important it is to always
[00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:18.200]   treat our customers with the utmost respect.
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:23.200]   However, I have to say that as soon as they posted this, I saw many, many people saying,
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:24.200]   "Oh, yeah.
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:25.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:26.200]   I've had this happen."
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:28.200]   And not just with Comcast.
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:29.200]   It's not a lie, though.
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.200]   They don't train you to talk the way.
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:34.200]   But if your job is you've got to stop these people from canceling their accounts,
[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:35.200]   otherwise you don't get paid.
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:39.200]   Your natural reaction is going to be to do anything you can to stop them from canceling on your call.
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:40.200]   I guess you're right.
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:41.200]   Yeah.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:42.200]   Because that's kind of what he said.
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:44.200]   Bring it to the store and cancel.
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.200]   Yeah.
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:48.200]   Because then he doesn't have to mark you as lost.
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:49.200]   And if he marks you as lost.
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:51.200]   So in some of these places, you lose your incentives.
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:54.200]   It's kind of how this whole thing is structured.
[00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:58.200]   There was this great, I forget what it was, it was this great story about how a company
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:01.200]   decided they wanted to prioritize on all the right things about customer service.
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:03.200]   Like they didn't want to make their customers wait.
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:06.200]   And they didn't want to, they guaranteed you wouldn't be transferred around.
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:08.200]   And they guaranteed all these things.
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:12.200]   And what ended up happening on the implementation side is people refused to transfer you because
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:14.200]   it was a bad mark on their record.
[00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:16.600]   And they would hang up on you if it went too long because they couldn't have a phone call
[00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:17.600]   that went too long.
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:18.600]   Oh, wow.
[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:20.800]   So the goals that you said is a company, you have to actually understand.
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:22.200]   There's unintended consequences.
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:26.200]   Like if your goal shouldn't be have a short conversation on transformers should be to make
[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:28.960]   the customer happy, then the end result is the right one.
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:32.520]   But if you put arbitrary decisions on like you can't lose as many customers, then you
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:34.280]   have this result.
[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:40.200]   Brian Roberts, the CEO of Comcast has said, we want to be just like Apple.
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:42.200]   Okay, Brian.
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:44.800]   You got a little work to do.
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:46.600]   I can't imagine that ever.
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:50.040]   And I don't think anybody ever has told a story, anything like that, having dealing
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:51.040]   with Apple.
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:54.240]   You're probably not paid on refusing to return your computers.
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:56.120]   So that's the first thing you do.
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:57.120]   Exactly.
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:00.840]   There's occasionally, I'm sure all of us have occasionally gotten emails from folks who
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:03.920]   have had a really bad experience with a genius bar.
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:08.800]   Mostly we've, I've set this exact same MacBook back time and time again over the past five
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.040]   months with the exact same problem.
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:15.160]   But those are definitely outliers and it's, it's not to defend Comcast, but that was,
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:17.160]   that was exactly the right way to respond to that.
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:19.840]   I'm glad the companies are at least getting a little bit more savvy about what they are
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:24.440]   no longer allowed to do in response to a bad press like this.
[00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:26.800]   You simply say that this was completely wrong.
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:28.600]   We are really embarrassed about this.
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:31.520]   We are going to reach out personally to solve this and we're also going to use this as a
[00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:34.040]   way to help train our people better.
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:37.880]   And then you can still leave the conversation a little bit open ended, but you know, we're
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:42.120]   all old enough to remember that those, those was in days seven or eight years ago where
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:45.200]   you get a call from someone saying, we're going to, we're going to ask you to take down
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:49.720]   that post because we have lawyers and we believe that they were under liable and you'll
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:53.200]   have to not only pay our damages, but also pay our lawyer fees.
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:56.360]   And no, that's the Barbara Streisand effect is a well known phenomenon.
[00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:57.360]   Yeah.
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:02.160]   Comcast, you know, to, to be fair, they were the first to use Twitter to respond.
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:06.680]   Com, remember the Comcast cares account and Frank Elias and then, so I mean, there are
[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:10.200]   certainly people within Comcast who are trying to make it a better company, but I think you've
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:14.680]   got to make the rules support what you're trying to do.
[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:15.680]   Yeah.
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:19.880]   Well, when I listened to that, I think, as Jenny Jardin pointed out, posted on Boing Boing
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:21.800]   and she said, trigger alert.
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:26.480]   This will cause PTSD if you listen to this and I didn't play the whole thing.
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:29.600]   You get you, you, you, I don't know how Ryan kept his cool.
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:34.480]   He, you know, because the guy got worse and worse and more and more demanding and it was
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:38.080]   really terrible, really terrible.
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:39.720]   I liked Ryan's response on Twitter too.
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:42.240]   When Comcast contacted him, he says, please don't fire this guy.
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:43.240]   Please fix your system.
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:44.240]   Yeah.
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:45.240]   The guys fall.
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:48.960]   I'm sure he's, you know, trying to keep his job or get his bonus or whatever.
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:50.760]   I do feel a bit sorry for him too.
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:51.920]   That's a terrible job to have.
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:56.040]   Just like, I don't like, I don't like being called by telemarketers, but you feel a little
[00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:59.920]   bit sorry for the person who has to be in that little cubicle for 11 hours a day, trying
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:04.440]   to make a quota, trying to sell photocopier toner to people who don't even own a photocopier.
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:07.800]   And all they have is this list that just tells him about this person.
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:08.800]   Worst job ever.
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:11.720]   Somebody in the chat room said, I don't know if this is true that Apple care representatives
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:17.000]   are paid or maybe bonest by the customer satisfaction surveys.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.160]   That's a better way to do it.
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:21.320]   Ask the customer after the experience.
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:22.320]   How was your experience?
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:26.560]   Now Ryan is not going to give them a positive customer satisfaction response.
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:31.480]   That's where you, you know, that's how you, even if the, even if people are no longer
[00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:35.680]   a customer, you want them to go away feeling good about your company.
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:36.680]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:41.200]   When I had to cancel my MyFi service with Verizon, I call them.
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:47.040]   They, they clearly, the person I talked to canceled my service within five minutes, she
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:50.920]   absolutely did walk me through what was the, is there a problem that we can solve for you?
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:52.640]   And I said, no, I just now use my phone.
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:53.640]   Okay, that's fine.
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:55.720]   So we're going to, you're already paid to the end of the month.
[00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:57.760]   We'll give you a partial refund for what you didn't use.
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:00.160]   We will also keep your account semi-active for six months.
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:03.560]   So if you want to reengage it in the next six months, you can reconnect without anymore.
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:04.800]   Is there anything else I can do for you?
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:09.080]   And I literally was like, pausing, like, is she actually doing exactly what I said?
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:12.160]   I would have being the most helpful person she could possibly be right now.
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:13.160]   You've really done it.
[00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:14.160]   Amazing to you.
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:15.160]   Exactly.
[00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:19.000]   That was the one, it was something that I, they, the, your Verizon had gotten me to pay
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:23.080]   for an extra two months of this service because I honestly was not looking forward to the phone
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:26.080]   call because I was expecting to be handed off to three different people before they would
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:27.080]   actually do it.
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:32.240]   And I almost had the script in my hand of, no, you see, I, I, it's, there is nothing you
[00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:34.680]   can do or say that we'll make me continue this.
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:35.680]   Oh, thank you.
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:36.680]   Thank you.
[00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:37.680]   Thank you.
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:38.680]   Thank you very much.
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:39.680]   Debbie was it.
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:40.680]   Okay.
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:41.680]   Well, you have a nice day too.
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:42.680]   Thank you very much.
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:44.240]   Hey, good news.
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:49.520]   If you watched Apple's presentation at WWDC over their new Swift programming language and
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:53.640]   like me and many others were intrigued and thought, gee, this would be interesting to
[00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:54.720]   play with.
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:55.920]   You can now for free.
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:58.720]   You don't have to have the $99 developer account.
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:03.080]   You go to developer.apple.com/swifts/blog.
[00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:04.080]   There's a new blog.
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:05.080]   They just started.
[00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:11.680]   They talk about Xcode six beta three and let you know that it's free as long as you're
[00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:12.920]   a registered developer.
[00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:15.040]   That means you don't have to pay.
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:17.080]   You just have to register.
[00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:18.600]   So that is, that is great.
[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:23.120]   And I'm sure that that's part of the plan for Swift frankly, because clearly Swift is
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:27.120]   the kind of things schools and others would like to use because it seems like a good teaching
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:28.120]   language.
[00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:29.480]   An official Apple blog layout.
[00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:30.800]   Did you ever think you'd see that day?
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:32.360]   Really, they don't do that, do they?
[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:33.360]   No.
[00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:34.360]   Very Microsoft of them.
[00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:35.360]   It's interesting.
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:40.200]   I wonder if part of the goal is also to bring in new developers who don't want to spend
[00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:44.520]   the 99 who are established developers either in the web or whatever, they don't necessarily
[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:48.320]   want to spend $99 to experiment with a brand new language, but they've heard enough about
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:49.320]   it that for free.
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:50.320]   Sure, they'll give it a try.
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:51.320]   Yeah.
[00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:52.320]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:53.320]   That's the way to do it.
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:54.320]   Nothing but upside here.
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:55.320]   Yeah.
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:56.320]   It's surprising.
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:46:02.720]   Like Renee says, "Oh, there are Apple employees that we all, I think that we all know who
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:07.360]   have official but not quite official blogs where their bosses know that they're doing
[00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:08.360]   it.
[00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:12.160]   They just can't acknowledge that this is an Apple employee who's doing something that
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:13.400]   benefits Apple.
[00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:17.600]   But the fact that you've got this Apple design blog is that is, that's another thing that
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:19.680]   I didn't think I would see this time last year.
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:21.120]   It's good news.
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:22.120]   It is a Tim Cookism.
[00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:24.560]   We'll call it Cook-era.
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:29.220]   By the way, it would be free anyway if you have a Mac once it comes out, once it comes
[00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:30.220]   out of beta.
[00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:31.220]   Yeah.
[00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:34.160]   You can download Xcode 5 right now and use it.
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:35.160]   Yeah.
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:38.280]   But this is the pre-release version of it and it will be free if your register is developed.
[00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:39.280]   And they are making changes.
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:43.080]   I mean, Chris Lattner is active on the Apple boards.
[00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:46.320]   If you are a registered developer, you can go to the developer forums on Apple and Lattner
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:47.320]   is in there.
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:48.320]   He's answering questions.
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:49.320]   People are submitting bugs.
[00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:50.320]   Great.
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:53.720]   They have actual changes in beta 3 and how Swift works in the syntax itself.
[00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:56.280]   And they said they do that, but it's nice to see they're actually doing that and they're
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:58.040]   doing it at a fair clip.
[00:46:58.040 --> 00:46:59.040]   And that's another thing.
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:02.360]   This allows them to dog food this brand new language on a much wider scale.
[00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:05.360]   Apple had also promised a public beta for Yosemite.
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:07.080]   That didn't happen while I was in Hawaii.
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:08.080]   Not yet.
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:09.080]   Okay.
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:10.080]   Something happened.
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:11.080]   I had to download a big thing.
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:12.080]   I thought, oh good, I got Yosemite instead.
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:14.440]   It was just 10.9.4, I guess.
[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:16.400]   Or is it five?
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:17.400]   And iTunes.
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:21.080]   iTunes extras on the Apple TV, my long nightmare is over.
[00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:23.480]   Tell me about that because I haven't looked at my Apple TV since I came back.
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:24.480]   What happens?
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:27.080]   So Apple had iTunes extras a long time ago.
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:28.800]   They were actually on the original Apple TV.
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:31.720]   And then when Apple TV became an iOS device, we lost them.
[00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:33.440]   And it sort of got kind of dark for a while.
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:36.400]   Now, last week, Apple announced a whole new kind of iTunes extras.
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:41.280]   And they released a new version of iTunes for the desktop.
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:43.400]   So Apple TV updates, they can change things on the web.
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:45.400]   So Apple TV was updated, but it wasn't enabled.
[00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:48.040]   So they enabled iTunes extras for the Apple TV.
[00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:52.440]   And they said that iTunes extras will be coming to iOS 8 this fall.
[00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:57.800]   So what that means is companies can do like DVD extras or Blu-ray extras for movies on
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:00.280]   the Apple TV, on iTunes, and on iOS.
[00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:05.160]   So if you go to Avengers right now, for example, you'll see there's a gag reel, there's bonus
[00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:06.160]   features.
[00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:08.760]   Some movies have commentary and they're doing it.
[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:12.200]   It's always been a web kit build that does all this stuff, but they're making it dynamic.
[00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:15.720]   So movie companies can add more content over time if they want to as well.
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:16.720]   So it's pretty clever.
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:22.560]   The one drawback is not all the movies that have the old iTunes extras have the new ones.
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:26.400]   So if you look on the desktop, you'll see iTunes extras or bracket original.
[00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:29.800]   If that movie has been updated yet, they'll let you keep the original version.
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:32.000]   But the new ones are much better because they stream.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.920]   Previously, you had to download like four gigs of extras.
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:37.600]   Now they all just stream and they're in HD, which is great too.
[00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:40.080]   I really miss DVD extras.
[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:44.400]   I think particularly the director commentary on DVDs was the best thing ever.
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:46.880]   I know you do a movie podcast, aren't you?
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:48.520]   Were you do your own commentary?
[00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:52.320]   But I actually hear what the director was thinking about the editors.
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:53.320]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:48:53.320 --> 00:49:00.240]   I bought the Blu-ray edition of the Godfather trilogy solely because Coppola does a narration
[00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:01.800]   of the first Godfather.
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:05.520]   Or even like what are workshops for the Lord of the Rings to see the stuff that they built?
[00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:06.520]   Oh, I love that stuff.
[00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:07.520]   It's remarkable.
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:08.520]   Yeah.
[00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:09.520]   It's the commentaries I really like though.
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:17.000]   So if you're a fan of a film to hear why something is, well, for instance, Coppola says, yeah,
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.280]   the actor ad-libbed the lead, the gun take the cannoli line.
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:25.240]   He tells the whole story behind that scene and he said, yeah, he just said that.
[00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:26.240]   We said, that's good.
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:27.240]   Keep that in.
[00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:30.680]   The Coppola commentaries are particularly interesting because if you buy the entire set
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:34.680]   and I got it home, I bought the DVD set for the commentary, like you said.
[00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:39.120]   And I think actually over one day just decided to watch the entire trilogy.
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:43.760]   And so you really do see the, and you know that Coppola recorded these sort of all at
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:44.760]   once.
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:49.240]   It's not as though he recorded one in 1970, the other in 1972, the other one in 1990,
[00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:53.280]   whatever, but you can see that as he's watching this movie, he's reliving the part of his
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:57.600]   life he had to experience while he made that movie because his tone during Godfather Part
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:02.280]   1 is, oh, well, I was the young buck and, you know, we were all experimental now.
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:06.480]   I didn't care about being fired because I knew that this was the right way to do things.
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:11.600]   And then during the Godfather Part 2, he's reliving that I was the God of this studio.
[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:12.600]   I could do no wrong.
[00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:15.000]   They gave me everything that I asked for.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:20.160]   And Godfather Part 3, it was like, well, it was a different era and we had to start shooting
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:22.240]   that day and there was no option.
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:26.160]   I mean, I asked for more time, but they said this is the third date in this.
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:27.160]   It's really funny.
[00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:30.280]   Yeah, they, he talks about having to reshoot.
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:35.320]   They didn't want Marlon Brando and the Godfather because he was young.
[00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:42.000]   He wasn't the old man and they had to reshoot the very famous scene in the olive oil factory
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   upstairs.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.920]   And boy, I just, you know, this is all stuff you don't know when you see the movie the
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:47.400]   first time and it's wonderful.
[00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:50.160]   So is that the kind of thing though that we're going to see in iTunes extras?
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:51.920]   Are they going to bring those things back?
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:54.440]   If they make it, so it's up to the studios, wherever the studios make available, some
[00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:57.800]   of them have director's commentary, some don't, some just have bonus features, feature
[00:50:57.800 --> 00:50:59.280]   ads, like the Marlon, all of the Marlon.
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:02.520]   It seems like there's not a lot of director's commentaries anymore, unfortunately.
[00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:03.520]   No, it's sad.
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:06.280]   Like the Marvel movies have 10 minute mini movies on all of them.
[00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:08.120]   So you can watch all those, those special episodes.
[00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:10.880]   So it depends on what you prefer when it comes to your extras.
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:14.920]   I think studios kind of screwed those things up because they really do expect you to come
[00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:16.400]   in for free and do this.
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:19.720]   And the best they promise you, oh, we'll send you a copy of the DVD when it comes out
[00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:20.720]   and they never do.
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:24.240]   So I think the word has kind of come out that if you want me on your commentary track,
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:25.240]   you have to pay me for it.
[00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:27.080]   Oh, and the studios won't do that.
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:28.080]   Yeah.
[00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:29.080]   That sucks.
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:31.720]   Unless you're Peter Jackson, you're filming it all anyway.
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:32.720]   Yeah.
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:33.720]   Peter's smart.
[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:36.840]   He does the behind the scenes and everything as he's going.
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:38.200]   He knows where the money is.
[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:44.120]   That way they could do 18 versions of the Hobbit DVD, which that seems like they have.
[00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:45.120]   I bought it already.
[00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:48.480]   Oh, but you want this one because it's got the star check on.
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:51.640]   This is interesting because whenever you had a question, why did JJ Abrams do that?
[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:53.880]   He would switch to somebody else for that part of the company.
[00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:54.880]   Really?
[00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:55.880]   Is it true?
[00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:58.640]   Yeah, like four people or five people on the commentary.
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:51:59.880]   JJ's not saying.
[00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:01.680]   No, he would do like the big glory.
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:02.880]   I did this scene so carefully.
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:05.720]   And then one of the crazy things would happen and you didn't hear a word from him.
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:08.360]   How funny.
[00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:12.200]   Apple is bringing in a new chip supplier.
[00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:17.040]   Of course, as many people know, Apple's chips are for the iPhone and the app.
[00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:21.080]   I think almost all made by Samsung still.
[00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:22.080]   Yes.
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:24.320]   Then now the the tie.
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:33.920]   The Wall Street Journal of Taiwan semiconductor manufacturer or TSMC is now starting to make
[00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:36.120]   chips for the iPhones and the iPads.
[00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:40.560]   I mean, it's interesting in that this happened last year and the year before.
[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:44.960]   And I think on a couple occasions, once I fix it and chip works tore it down, it's
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:46.760]   they'll turned up to be a Samsung part.
[00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:47.760]   Oh, interesting.
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:50.200]   It's really again, this is almost like reading the TV.
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:53.320]   It's really hard to tell what Apple's doing based on one supplier report.
[00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:54.320]   All right.
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:58.400]   They made a deal last year to make chips.
[00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:02.160]   According to the journal, some analysts were skeptical that the Chinese chip maker, the
[00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:10.160]   world's biggest contract chip maker by revenue could deliver Apple's complicated designs.
[00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:12.960]   It's probably good if you're, you know, I don't think it has to do with lawsuits.
[00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:16.800]   I just think it's you want to have more than one supplier for anything.
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:22.560]   And the scale that Apple now has to make these things and demands, you know, that you
[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:25.240]   have a variety of places you can get them.
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:28.800]   There was a great Samsung commercial last week that was making fun of the quality of
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:30.000]   Apple's LCD display.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:34.120]   But my favorite part is I went and looked at who made those displays and 62% of them
[00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:35.120]   were made by Samsung.
[00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:36.120]   No.
[00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:37.120]   Yeah.
[00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:38.480]   I was thinking of the wall huggers ad.
[00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:39.560]   Have you seen that one?
[00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:41.000]   Yeah, they did that one.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:45.160]   Then they did one to show how great it is to have side by side apps with a crying baby.
[00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:47.600]   And then they did the one about OLED versus LCD.
[00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:48.600]   You're never going to sell me.
[00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:51.960]   Although Apple is doing side by side apps, you're never going to sell me on the on split
[00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:53.200]   screens on a little thing.
[00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:57.000]   But I have to say, this does highlight a problem.
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:03.280]   And by the way, with all phones, you go to the airport, they're all they're all plugged
[00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:04.280]   in.
[00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:08.120]   These people love their iPhones so much, Leo, they won't give them up even if they don't
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:09.120]   charge.
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:12.840]   Well, and I, you know, one of the advantages Samsung has is removable battery.
[00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:16.520]   It's not that they have better battery life, but they have removable batteries and they
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:17.520]   don't really mention that.
[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:19.840]   Yeah, for an additional 50 bucks, you can buy an extra battery.
[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:20.840]   They do it at the very end.
[00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:25.120]   But I mean, like none of these iPhone guys have a mophie juice pack or a battery.
[00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:26.120]   Yeah.
[00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:27.120]   Yeah.
[00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:31.880]   Although that is it's that does point out that it's nice to see someone trying to make
[00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:35.000]   leverage off of these really user facing features.
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   Yes.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.600]   That we talk about subtle things in the new operating system.
[00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:42.000]   But if you have a new feature of the operating system that will extend your battery life
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:43.480]   by 25%.
[00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:48.760]   And now makers of Android phones can say, well, this phone gets one gets one day plus
[00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:52.040]   nine hours of battery life, according to an independent test.
[00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:56.000]   Same test says that the iPhone six, when it comes out, gets exactly half a day of battery
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   life.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:00.520]   That's two people to someone who's walking into the store, prepare to walk out after
[00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:03.600]   thinking about thinking about their choice for the net for only 20 minutes.
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:06.000]   That's something that really is very tangible as a feature.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:10.080]   It's I tell you number one is the complaint I hear most often.
[00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:14.680]   And that's in Google didn't talk a lot about new features of the new operating system coming
[00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:16.640]   out, a new version of Android coming out this fall.
[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:18.360]   But that was the one that they really did highlight.
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:22.240]   It said that we're totally revamping the way that these devices can deal with deal with
[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:23.440]   power consumption.
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:28.080]   So if that actually that actually pays off, that's something that's going to be something
[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:29.240]   to deal with next year.
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:37.360]   So maybe that airport is in is Heathrow because the United States has required or requested
[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:41.680]   that TSA and other officials at airports.
[00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:48.640]   And people are coming into the United States, ask them to turn on their devices to prove
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:50.240]   that they're not bombs.
[00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:56.840]   Apparently, the US has intelligence that some terrorists are starting to build bombs that
[00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:59.240]   look like laptops and phones.
[00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:01.760]   And so now they're demanding that you be able to turn on your devices.
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:02.760]   Just a word of warning.
[00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:07.320]   If you're coming into the United States from Europe and other places, make sure you catch
[00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:10.960]   your phone charged up so you can turn it on.
[00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:12.600]   Maybe that's what they're all doing.
[00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:13.600]   Proof of battery life.
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:15.640]   Oh, and the risk is they'll confiscate it.
[00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:17.360]   By the way, if you can't turn it on, they'll take it.
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:19.160]   You have an hour or something to charge it in front of them.
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:20.680]   And if you can't, they'll, yeah.
[00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:21.680]   Really?
[00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:22.680]   You have an hour to charge it?
[00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:23.680]   I think it's an hour.
[00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:24.680]   But you can't leave.
[00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:26.240]   You can't go and swap it for another device.
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:29.960]   You have to go plug it in and sit there and charge it and then show them.
[00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:32.440]   Come back when you can turn it on.
[00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:33.440]   You have one hour.
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:36.280]   Well, some reports are saying don't even come back.
[00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:40.320]   It's that we're not going to let you go to the other part of the terminal and set it off.
[00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:43.080]   If they think that this could be a bomb, they could think that, well, I'm not going to
[00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:45.600]   go through a screening, so I may as well detonate it right here.
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:46.600]   Oh, my God.
[00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:51.080]   So that's, I'm interested to see what happens the first time that somebody with money is
[00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:55.280]   asked to hand over their $1,800 computer with vital company secrets to it.
[00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:58.240]   And they simply say, well, here is the computer.
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:56:59.240]   The phone works.
[00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:01.640]   I'm going to use that to call my lawyer right now.
[00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:02.640]   I don't know.
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:05.320]   I think if he ate your name badge, there you go.
[00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:06.320]   I don't know.
[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:08.440]   Yeah, they have very different laws for.
[00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:09.440]   Yeah.
[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:11.960]   It's true for somebody coming to the US from Canada, or anything?
[00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:13.400]   No, I forget the country.
[00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:17.360]   I think Turkey was a small list of countries so far, although I haven't checked recently.
[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:18.360]   Okay.
[00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:19.360]   I think it's departure not arrival too.
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:20.360]   Yeah.
[00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:21.360]   Yeah, it's on departure.
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:26.280]   So I know Heathrow is one that is required to do or I think it's requested.
[00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:30.720]   I don't think the US can require it, but I think they're requested.
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:34.960]   I don't know if this is going to impact iPhone sales in China, but the China State television
[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:39.440]   says the iPhone's location tracking is a national security concern.
[00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:42.160]   Do you see Apple's reply to that?
[00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:46.200]   Yes, we're deeply committed to protecting the privacy of all our customers, says.
[00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:54.160]   You know, this is all just has to do with the back and forth over the NSA and so forth.
[00:57:54.160 --> 00:58:00.320]   And don't forget that the United States last year declared that phones from ZTE and Huawei
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:06.920]   shouldn't be purchased by United States companies because of the chance of industrial espionage.
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:10.040]   Those companies partially owned by the Chinese military.
[00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:16.720]   I guess if I were foreign national, I might be reluctant to buy US gear.
[00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:18.720]   I kind of understand the concern.
[00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:19.720]   Shenzhen.
[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:23.600]   Yeah, it is made in China though, isn't it?
[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:29.760]   So Apple, a fairly lengthy statement saying we've never worked with any government agency
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:33.040]   from any country to create a backdoor in any of our products or services.
[00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:34.600]   We've never allowed access to our servers.
[00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:35.600]   We never will.
[00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:39.440]   So then we feel very strongly about unlike other companies, you don't make our money
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:40.960]   off selling your information.
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:43.680]   Do they say that in the first or second paragraph?
[00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:47.960]   Yeah, a little snipe at Facebook and Google there.
[00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:49.960]   A little bit.
[00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:51.680]   A little shot across the bat, but why not?
[00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:53.240]   You know, it's a differentiator.
[00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:58.760]   That's the debt is it's as I predicted that this would actually become more and more of
[00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:02.960]   a differentiator that Apple smart to promote this notion of privacy.
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:06.720]   Yeah, but you see a lot of these letters are being signed by pretty much everybody who's
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:10.000]   a player of that punch level in the industry.
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:14.320]   Nobody's saying really that the people in Apple, Google is a company that gets all the
[00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:18.880]   fire about, you know, we see that this is a company that's that profits by selling your
[00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:20.040]   information.
[00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:24.560]   Really what people should be talking about is the phone carriers who are making every,
[00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:29.120]   they will comply with with law enforcement requests for user data, but they charge reach
[00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:30.120]   one of those requests.
[00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:34.000]   And the numbers on that are the first time you find out how much money they're making
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:38.880]   on these requests, you think you also think about how much does it actually cost for them
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:42.560]   to fulfill this request and how much profit they're making on each one of these.
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:46.320]   And you're starting to think maybe there are there's an incentive now for them to make
[00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:50.600]   this a very, very easy procedure and a very, very friendly procedure for law enforcement
[00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:51.800]   to engage in.
[00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:56.560]   So it's not it's not all about Google selling your information to people.
[00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:57.560]   Right.
[00:59:57.560 --> 00:59:59.200]   A couple of quickies.
[00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:04.800]   I watch rumors Ming Chicoa again say says that an I watch will enter mass production
[01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:07.680]   in November.
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:10.800]   Apple did hire two former Nike fuel band engineers.
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:12.040]   Yeah.
[01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:14.080]   And the take how are guy?
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:15.080]   Really.
[01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:16.080]   Yeah.
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:17.080]   Marketing guy.
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:23.920]   So tag here, however you pronounce that is a very high and beautiful watch marketed interestingly
[01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:27.000]   marketed as jewelry really to high end buyers.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000]   Yeah.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.360]   I got a really interesting email.
[01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:35.200]   I talked about I watch rumors last week of the week before on my podcast and got a really
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:40.960]   nice email from a listener who suggested that perhaps the point of this wearable is not
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:45.280]   to create technology, but literally to create fashion a fashion object.
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:48.560]   And if it has technology packed into it, that's sauce for the goose, which is not to say
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:50.440]   that Apple is just going to make an analog watch.
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:55.000]   But what if maybe it made me think that maybe this my stumbling block with a lot of what
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:59.680]   this thing could be is that I keep thinking about Apple imagining this as a package of
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:02.720]   features and then trying to figure a way to design that into something that people would
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:03.720]   wear.
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:08.400]   Maybe they not for this specific thing, given all the hires that they've been doing in luxury
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:12.200]   retail and style and retail, their thought is 50 50.
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:15.200]   This is going to be we want to design a really great watch and we want to sprinkle
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:17.480]   some Apple technology pixie dust on it.
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:20.640]   But really we want to do this is going to be a style brand as much as it's going to
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:21.840]   be a technology brand.
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:25.640]   I think that's smart because I mean at this point, this is the Android where this is the
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:26.640]   LG version.
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:29.960]   There's a Samsung version and soon a Motorola version.
[01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:32.760]   These are not fashion forward things.
[01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:36.560]   I mean, there's a certain thickness that's required for the electronics and the battery
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:37.560]   anyway.
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:39.520]   And so Apple's going to have to solve that.
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:43.560]   But you know, the one the weird things is that that that looked humongous the first time
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:44.800]   I saw it.
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:49.240]   But now when I see usually usually in gig podcasts where the hosts are the hosts are
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:52.240]   wearing these things never never once have I seen this not a while.
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:56.200]   No, no, but the more that I see this on people's wrist, the more it's not necessarily looking
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:02:00.040]   normal but it's looking like it's within the bandwidth of what you could expect people
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:01.040]   to actually wear.
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:02.040]   Like Joanna's.
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:03.040]   I wonder.
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:04.040]   Yeah.
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:07.720]   It's like, well, I mean, this this watch is is used to look absolutely huge to me when
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:11.080]   I was shopping for this, you know, like so diminutive on your wrist.
[01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:14.480]   It doesn't necessarily look tiny, but the one that I was using before that was a really
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:21.280]   small like, you know, time X with a dial that was maybe about 20% smaller than this.
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:22.720]   And of course, it didn't take very long.
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:25.240]   One of the reasons why I almost didn't buy this was because, oh my God, this is huge.
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:26.240]   Am I going to wear this on my wrist?
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:28.480]   Like every single day, it's a huge tuna can.
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:31.080]   And then like after about a week, it just seemed perfectly normal.
[01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:33.280]   Chad had a really good theory.
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:38.280]   We were talking about these yesterday and he pointed out that Google did something uncharacteristic
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:41.000]   with Android where the the specs on these are all identical.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:48.880]   Google very tightly controls the even down to the amount of RAM, the processor, the UI.
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:53.240]   There's no, you know, touch whiz interface or added interface on top of it.
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:56.880]   And Chad had a really interesting theory, which I kind of think is he's right on about.
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:03.040]   He said, Google wanted the hardware all to be identical to incent manufacturers to differentiate
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:05.280]   over design.
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:09.280]   So you don't you won't buy an Android Wear watch based on the capabilities because they're
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:10.280]   all the same.
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:14.600]   You'll buy an Android Wear watch because you like how it looks.
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:18.400]   And that might also underscore what you just said, Andy, that Apple too is thinking, these
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:20.440]   are not these are always going to be luxury items.
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:23.520]   They're not going to be a must have.
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:27.280]   It's a nice thing to have, but it's not, you know, I do like getting the alerts on my wrist
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:28.280]   and so forth.
[01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:31.560]   And you could talk to this and send their Samsung analogy and Motorola hiring fashion executives
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:34.840]   at the same rate Apple is to realize that's right.
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:35.840]   That's right.
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:42.160]   But I mean, you know what, if they had a tag, your quality, beautiful device that, as you
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:46.240]   say, had a little technology in it, I might be interested in that.
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:50.040]   And that's the market they're aiming at because most it's athletes.
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:53.720]   Athletes will buy devices to measure, you know, athletic performance.
[01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:58.400]   And then it's the people with some discretionary income who might want to buy a nice piece of
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.960]   jewelry that has some capabilities.
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:01.960]   Yeah.
[01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:06.120]   And I wonder what if Apple decided to do, we're going to start off with an analog watch.
[01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:10.160]   It is going to be a true mechanical analog watch and we're going to put some extra features
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:12.400]   in it, but we're going to design an analog watch.
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:15.960]   With that, there is an analog smartwatch.
[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:20.760]   Yeah, with a terror, I can't come up with it, but it has a terrible video that just sees
[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:25.280]   people like holding a coffee cup with the watch and like being active with the watch
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:30.280]   and swimming with the watch and literally after I swear to God, I'm a crazy person and
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:32.800]   I'm alone in my office watching this.
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:35.320]   And after 30 seconds, I'm like, but what does it do?
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:36.320]   But what does it do?
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:37.320]   A minute, well, a minute and a half.
[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:40.400]   Tell me what this thing does besides tell the time.
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:45.000]   But it's called cogato cogato.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000]   Ergo some.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.240]   Ergo some.
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:52.920]   It's a, it's a analog watch that has some smart features.
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:54.400]   There's no reason you couldn't do that, Frank.
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:56.360]   Here's, here's the video you were talking about.
[01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:58.240]   There's no reason you couldn't really do that.
[01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:02.240]   I mean, I have an analog watch face on my Android Wear because I just happen to like
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:07.320]   how that looks and the notifications still pop up at the bottom and everything.
[01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:10.400]   I think a lot of people who use pebbles and what does it do?
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:11.400]   You're right.
[01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:12.400]   You see what's on the roof?
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:14.320]   He's very happy on the roof with his girlfriend, but what does it.
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:15.320]   Connections.
[01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:19.120]   Oh, you're wearing a big stupid watch, but I love you anyway.
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:20.640]   It's Emily's birthday.
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:21.960]   So he's rolling over.
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:23.880]   Thank you, watch.
[01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:25.120]   It's got remote music control.
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:28.200]   Actually, that's something, boy, Emily is going to have a good birthday.
[01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:33.680]   Oh, wow.
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:35.840]   Notice this is a very affluent company.
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:37.720]   It's an aspirational brand, Leo.
[01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:41.640]   Yeah, it's aspirational.
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:45.600]   So so far, we can tell what people's birthdays and we can start and stop our music if we have
[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:49.760]   that special cogato brand, music player.
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:51.760]   Oh, pillow fight.
[01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:52.760]   You know what that signifies.
[01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:53.760]   She's a scam.
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:54.760]   And you're watching that.
[01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:55.760]   Not.
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:56.760]   Pillow fight.
[01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:57.760]   Pillow fight.
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:59.600]   I'm excited to death for your watch.
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:03.360]   You know, I don't know how many videos like this descend into slow motion pillow fights,
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:05.240]   but I always find it just in debt.
[01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:06.240]   Wonderful.
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:08.880]   See, this wasn't the video that I saw and I saw it like two weeks ago.
[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:14.760]   It really was like, you've seen, don't you have memories of all these different tech
[01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:16.560]   rollout videos that there is.
[01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:21.560]   There is a hand-flect, hand-cut arrow sticking out of the sand and a time-lapse video of
[01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:26.520]   the shadow getting longer and shorter and then rose petals falling off in slow motion and
[01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:28.920]   you're like, is this a brand of soup?
[01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:30.720]   Is this a rope in her?
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:31.720]   What are we getting?
[01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:34.520]   Trying to solve a blackberry passport chair is already your debt.
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:35.520]   What was that?
[01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:36.520]   What was that?
[01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:40.320]   And we showed once Chad of the ultimate technology ad.
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:41.720]   Gosh, yeah.
[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:43.520]   That was great.
[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:44.520]   Yes.
[01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:45.520]   Yes.
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:46.520]   Let me just like that.
[01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:49.320]   We have many people who work here.
[01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:50.320]   Yeah.
[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:51.320]   Yeah.
[01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:52.320]   Inspiration.
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:53.320]   Yeah.
[01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:54.320]   Quality.
[01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:58.920]   Words that signify things you want to hear.
[01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:04.480]   Speaking to that, John Louis Gesset in his most recent, I love his Monday note and this
[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:09.880]   isn't really Apple specific but I guess it is since Apple is, our tribe will used to
[01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:12.520]   be Microsoft.
[01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:19.720]   Talks about Satya Nadella's letters, very lengthy letters to the Microsoft employees
[01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:24.400]   and mentions exactly that, he says Microsoft's new CEO needs an editor.
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:31.080]   He says, as I puzzled over the public email Microsoft CEO sent to his troops, I noted that
[01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:39.040]   the 3,100 plotting words missed clarity, ease and more importantly specifics.
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:41.680]   And he said, you know, Satya is a smart guy.
[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:47.400]   He says, Gesset says the reason he wrote this email is not because he, because they're going
[01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:48.800]   to be layoffs.
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:53.000]   He didn't want to say they're going to be layoffs but he did want to be able to point
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.920]   back to the email and say, see I told you there were going to be layoffs.
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:08:05.160]   So he couched in a very soft, he said the letter really should say things like bad news.
[01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:10.440]   We're changing the company completely and some of you are going to lose your jobs.
[01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:12.560]   Including Windows Phone and tablet maybe.
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:15.160]   Yeah, devices may be gone.
[01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:16.160]   Very interesting.
[01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:18.160]   Weird world.
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:22.840]   This is changing and this is why it is tough to be a technology company and why it's so
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:27.240]   impressive that what Apple has done, their stock price is now almost to 100.
[01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:30.120]   I don't want to be living in a world where Apple and Google, the only ones making phones
[01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:31.120]   and tablets.
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:32.120]   Well, I agree with you on that.
[01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:33.120]   Apple is.
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:34.120]   Go ahead.
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:38.400]   Especially because I thought that Microsoft had some interesting ideas and now they seem
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:42.280]   to be rolling back from the idea of having a tablet that will be doing double duty for
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:43.280]   you.
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:46.800]   Now they're basically saying that, okay, anything that kind of looks like a laptop is
[01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:50.160]   just going to be a laptop and anything that looks like a tablet is going to be just a
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:51.160]   tablet.
[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:52.760]   Sorry about that, everybody.
[01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:58.080]   Hope you enjoy the $1,000 computers that you already bought.
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:04.520]   Apple has been crowned the greenest tech company according to Greenpeace.
[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:08.520]   Remember Greenpeace was against Apple for a while.
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:11.680]   Well, Apple was a big highlight that they could put in headlines for a while.
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:12.680]   Yeah.
[01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:15.000]   Now that well, they're still putting in headlines, but it's the good stuff.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.920]   Like Apple is the greenest tech company.
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:30.760]   And in fact, 100% green energy in their server farms, which is pretty impressive.
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:38.280]   Apple stores in the US, 145 US stores now using 100% renewable energy, the carbon footprint
[01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:40.640]   from Apple down 3%.
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:46.600]   It's a little too late for Miami Beach, but what the hell?
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:51.080]   At least we're making some progress.
[01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:56.440]   Only 33,800,000 metric tons of greenest gas emissions in 2013.
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:10:02.440]   But it's nice because this is something that they don't necessarily have to do.
[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:03.440]   They don't have to do it.
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:05.240]   And if everybody did it, it'd be good.
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:08.480]   I mean, even when Greenpeace was on their back about their record, it was a good record,
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:15.120]   but the Apple was able to say, OK, so Greenpeace decided to send some people outside of WWDC
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:18.280]   to be photographed carrying science and no one's going to care about that.
[01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:23.720]   So it is Admiral to see Apple and other companies of its size decide to say, you know what?
[01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:24.720]   We can do this.
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:25.720]   So let's do this.
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:27.480]   They have a VP of environment now.
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:28.480]   Ah, good.
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:29.480]   Yeah.
[01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:34.480]   I always like to end on a happy note before we get to our picks of the week.
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:42.760]   And this happy note comes from Oklahoma where a farmer, Kevin Whitney, was standing over
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:45.560]   a grain elevator, bent down.
[01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:54.320]   His iPhone fell into a pit of 280,000 pounds of wheat, never to be seen again.
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:58.880]   Whitney told the local TV station, I thought I'd never see that falling again.
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:02.800]   Nine months later, he's got the phone back.
[01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:05.520]   It ended up in Japan.
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:10.920]   The phone actually was it was a grain sorghum.
[01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:15.720]   The phone was shipped down the Arkansas River to the Mississippi River than Louisiana.
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:23.640]   From there, it was put on a cargo ship sent to Japan where a mill worker found it.
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:28.680]   The iPhone powered up just find the mill employee placed a call to Whitney said, I have your
[01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:29.680]   phone.
[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:32.000]   You got his phone back.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.000]   Like a lassi movie.
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.000]   Happy, happy.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.440]   Actually, it's it's like when those old time X commercials where they would they would
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:42.360]   every time they got a letter from a customer who said, well, I was mixing concrete and
[01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:44.320]   it fell off my wrist and it fell in there.
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:45.560]   I thought I'd never see it again.
[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:50.320]   But at the end of the work day, I was cleaning out the hopper and there was my time X still
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:51.320]   ticking.
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:52.480]   It's a lick and it keeps on ticking.
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:53.480]   Keeps on ticking.
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:54.480]   Yep.
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:58.880]   You're a Fort Green silo indicator inside the phone that would get the blow apple to deny
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:00.880]   the warranty service.
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:02.760]   The turn blue for sorghum.
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:03.760]   Sargum.
[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:04.760]   It's been dipped in sorghum.
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:07.720]   Actually, those you know what he shouldn't be bending over those grain silo.
[01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:09.200]   You could fall on those if you fell on them.
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:10.360]   You would be a problem in Japan.
[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:12.200]   It could be him in Japan.
[01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:17.000]   Well, at least he's experienced like I was impressed with the idea that he even his his
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.000]   part of it.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.520]   He's saying that I knew that that thing was gone.
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:22.000]   I was not going to reach down in there to see if I could get it back.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.000]   Yeah.
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.000]   No, he knew.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.000]   Smart man.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.000]   It costs a lot more than a new phone.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.920]   My iPhone dives in after it.
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:28.920]   No, no bad idea.
[01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:31.480]   You're out little in a deep fryer.
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:33.080]   Just let that little go, sir.
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:34.080]   Alf Watt.
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:35.080]   What a great name.
[01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:36.080]   WATT.
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:40.520]   A great name for the guy who created iStumbler and is a former Apple Wi-Fi engineer.
[01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:41.960]   His name is Alf Watt.
[01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:42.960]   Watt.
[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:43.960]   Watt.
[01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:50.880]   And he was on the Mac observers at Mac EatGab number 509 and had a few great tips.
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:56.480]   Thanks, Dave Hamilton for posting these to help your Wi-Fi work better.
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:13:01.640]   Use the same SSID for all radios on the same network.
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:08.560]   Be they 2.4 gigahertz or 5 gigahertz.
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:10.200]   I'm not sure why, but that's what he says.
[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:15.520]   Deal with congestion by adding more access points using less power.
[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:17.880]   So kind of break it up.
[01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:19.440]   Is there a way to turn down the power?
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:22.240]   Yes, there is.
[01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:25.760]   You can turn down the power apparently.
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:30.600]   The transmit power and by turning it down, I use 5 gigahertz almost exclusively at home
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:32.280]   because my Sonos is on 2.4.
[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:34.080]   I have so many things I do.
[01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:37.080]   I just use the 5 gigahertz.
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:38.080]   Some good questions.
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:40.920]   I'll point you to Dave Hamilton's article at the Mac Observer.
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:43.920]   Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to take a break when we come back.
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:50.720]   Mr. Andrew Ennaco and Renee Ritchie will have their picks of the week as will I.
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:55.760]   The first word from squarespace.com, if you're creating your first website or you maybe
[01:13:55.760 --> 01:14:03.840]   want to move from a bad hosting environment, can I recommend a better website at squarespace.com
[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:12.760]   hosting plus software tightly linked to give you the best experience and more importantly,
[01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:15.720]   your viewers, your visitors, the best experience.
[01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:18.880]   Your space sites use the latest state of the art technology.
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:23.560]   You don't have to know CSS or JavaScript or HTML because they've got the best developers
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:24.560]   doing a great job.
[01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:29.640]   If you do, by the way, want to be a developer, they have a great developer platform as well,
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:32.320]   which makes it very nice.
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:33.320]   But you don't have to.
[01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:35.920]   Everything can be done with drag and drop point and click.
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:38.280]   You start with 25 designer templates.
[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:41.800]   Each of them built in have things like mobile responsive design.
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:44.800]   So they'll look great no matter what size screen.
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:46.680]   They all have e-commerce built in.
[01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:47.840]   You can turn it on very easily.
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:52.800]   In fact, every site can sell at least one item, which means you can do donations for
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:54.280]   non-profit things like that.
[01:14:54.280 --> 01:15:03.720]   Of course, if you get the e-commerce solution, unlimited services or products or digital products.
[01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:08.000]   Plus, I got to tell you, the e-commerce solution really makes it easy.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:12.520]   They've got real-time carrier shipping built in, label printing via ship station integrated
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:17.240]   accounting from zero all built in, which is really sweet.
[01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:21.440]   When you register for a year at Squarespace.com, they'll set you up with a custom domain name
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:23.840]   for free.
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:28.320]   And it all starts as low as $8 a month, including that domain name when you sign up
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:29.760]   for a year.
[01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:33.880]   Their metric app for the iPhone and the iPad lets you check site stats like page views,
[01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:34.880]   social media follows.
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:39.840]   They've got a blog app, makes it easy to post and monitor comments on the go.
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:44.640]   The hosting is included and of course, the great 24/7 customer support right from the
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:46.560]   Squarespace offices.
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:51.160]   Knowledgeable people who will answer the phone or answer your email or do your live chat.
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:54.520]   24/7, the redesigned customer helps.
[01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:57.440]   I've got some great self-help stuff in there too.
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:15:59.600]   I want you to try Squarespace for free.
[01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:00.600]   You don't need a credit card.

[01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:07.960]   If you decide to sign up, we do invite you to use the offer code MACBRAKE to get 10%

[01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:16.560]   Squarespace really is the best place to start your new website or move your website.
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:19.720]   They have importers that make it very easy to do that as well.
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:22.000]   We really, really love them and recommend them.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000]   Squarespace.com.
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.800]   Andy and not co.
[01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:28.440]   By the way, good news.
[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:29.880]   Was it you who recommended the Martian?
[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:32.120]   Have you read the Martian on Audible yet?
[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:33.120]   No.
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:34.760]   Wasn't you?
[01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:36.960]   Maybe it was somebody who recommended the Martian.
[01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:38.560]   I've been talking about it like crazy.
[01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.040]   It's been recommended on Audible.
[01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:41.040]   Maybe Brian, it was Brian.
[01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:44.040]   There was a rush with who first started, yeah.
[01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:47.280]   Yesterday, I was really thrilled to hear Andy.
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:49.120]   We're the author on marketing Mavericks.
[01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:52.320]   And Tonya is arranged to have Andy join us for a triangulation.
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:56.920]   So the author of the Martian will be on triangulation coming up in the next couple of weeks.
[01:16:56.920 --> 01:16:58.880]   So that is an Audible pick.
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:01.600]   But what do you have for us, Andy?
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:09.760]   Two quickies, sometimes you want to talk about an article that you've seen on the web that
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:15.040]   you don't approve of, don't like you think this person is a troll or he's spreading, he
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:19.360]   or she is spreading misinformation to get page views or whatever.
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:22.440]   Whatever reason you don't, you want to talk about this and you want to link to it so people
[01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:27.320]   can see it, but you don't want this person to get more Google rankings because of this
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:31.360]   because every time someone links to it, then that increases its visibility on Google and
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:33.080]   makes that article more profitable.
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:36.840]   Someone created this really nice service called do not link.com.
[01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:43.520]   That is a URL shortener that will take that original webpage URL and turn it into a different
[01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:47.640]   kind of URL that will absolutely be invisible to Google page rankings.
[01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:52.960]   So you can write your 800 word blog post about this thing, link to it and let people read
[01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:56.560]   it without securing the fashion that you're not going to be helping this person make money
[01:17:56.560 --> 01:17:58.640]   off of their ads by doing it.
[01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:01.320]   So I think you should use it judiciously.
[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:06.880]   I would not use it on articles that you simply disagree with because I would only use it
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:11.240]   for people who are just, it will make you slightly sick to your stomach to think that
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:16.240]   you are helping this person popularize their site, but it's a nice solution for that.
[01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:21.160]   The other one is a Cortex camera, which is not a very, very new app.
[01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:24.440]   It's been around for a couple of years, but particularly being outside, trying to take
[01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:28.520]   pictures in the absolute darkness reminds you that one of the few things that the
[01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:33.000]   iPhone does not do well is it doesn't do well in low light because other cameras have lots
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.240]   of solutions for that.
[01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:38.600]   All the iPhone can do is crank up the ISO and introduces lots and lots and lots of noise.
[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:44.400]   What Cortex camera does is it actually takes a long sequence of images and averages them
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:50.400]   all out so that because ISO noise is random noise, anything that is not the same from
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:53.920]   frame to frame to frame must just be noise and not actual image detail.
[01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:58.040]   So over the course of three to 10 seconds, you basically just keep this thing running,
[01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:03.920]   hold it as well as you can, and the result will be a low light image that is almost devoid
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:05.280]   of any noise whatsoever.
[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:10.600]   It's not for every shooting situation, but as with most iPhone camera apps, it's a good
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:15.560]   thing to have right there in your tool belt waiting for that time when you take a picture.
[01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:16.600]   It looks like crap.
[01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:20.080]   You definitely want to come away from the Sagrata Famillion Barcelona with a good picture
[01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:24.880]   and you realize, oh, wait a minute, I have an app that's specifically good for low noise
[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:29.880]   pictures in low light.
[01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:36.240]   No camera phone has kind of the bulb setting or a long exposure setting, right?
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:38.560]   I mean, you couldn't do that because you can't.
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:43.960]   Well, Nokia, the Lumia 1020 is as always the champ of pretty much everything.
[01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:47.520]   It does have a long bulb setting, so you can get star trails from it.
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:50.720]   It also has not been tried by something obviously has to be still.
[01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:51.720]   Yeah.
[01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:54.040]   And it also has that it's got it.
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:57.800]   I just love this phone so much because if you'd like to take good pictures, it really
[01:19:57.800 --> 01:19:59.960]   is and you know how to take good pictures.
[01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:01.040]   It's the one that's going to help you out the most.
[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:03.600]   It does have a manual bulb setting if you want to use it.
[01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:08.160]   It also has an optically stabilized lens, which means that you won't necessarily have
[01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:14.480]   to put it on a tripod to get those long exposures that low ISO's and all the manual controls
[01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:18.280]   today already built in so that if you want to override whatever automatic settings and
[01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:23.360]   say, no, no, no, ISO 200, do whatever you have to do to keep that ISO is where it is.
[01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:28.240]   So that's it's it's I'm that's just another opportunity to say how excited I am about
[01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:31.160]   the new photo APIs in iOS 8.
[01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:35.800]   I can't wait to see what happens when users and developers have access to every single
[01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:38.200]   camera setting that the hardware is capable of.
[01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:40.240]   We're going to see a new renaissance and iPhone photography.
[01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:44.720]   Presumably the next generation cortex camera could do a long exposure, for instance, a
[01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:45.720]   single long.
[01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:48.120]   Yeah, it's it's not it's not just what what Apple can do with this.
[01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:53.440]   That every time I see one of these favorite apps of mine, I see that I really see where
[01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:56.160]   developers are hitting their head bang their heads against the wall.
[01:20:56.160 --> 01:21:00.000]   Things that would be so simple if they could simply allow to they could simply select a
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:03.080]   shutter speed, but they can't so they have to do a workaround.
[01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:07.280]   The things they could do for deep for artificial deep focus, which they could do very easily,
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:09.160]   but they can't do because they don't have access to it.
[01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:13.160]   That's why a lot of the really interesting photo apps are available for Android and not
[01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:17.960]   for iOS, not for I mean, it's it's kind of it's kind of interesting that the
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:24.360]   iPhone has a much better camera system than almost all Android phones on the market, but
[01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:28.800]   some apps can do a lot more wizardry sort of things than any developer can do on iOS
[01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:29.800]   right now.
[01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:31.000]   But that'll change soon enough.
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:38.200]   This is pretty amazing cortex camera, 299 from whimsical productions on the app store.
[01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:39.960]   Mr Renee Richie, your pick of the week.
[01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:42.840]   So I'm going to go to from photography to music.
[01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:46.720]   Now I know very little about music, whatever the opposite of talent is is what I have in
[01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:47.720]   the world.
[01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:51.120]   But there's this amazing Mac app called capo has been around for a long time, and it's
[01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:53.360]   just gone to iOS at launch last Thursday.
[01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:55.680]   And this is capo touch for iOS.
[01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:59.680]   It's done by Chris Leachio, who's you know, fine Canadian developer, really brilliant
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:00.680]   guy.
[01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:03.840]   He got to start writing graphic drivers for BOS when he was in high school.
[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:06.600]   So it gives you an example of where his head is at.
[01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:12.280]   And it basically if you're an aspiring musician, if you are someone who is a working musician
[01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:16.800]   and might get the call to replace a guitarist, for example, who's been injured or not available,
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:20.600]   or you need to change your set on the way to a show, capo just ingests music.
[01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:25.200]   It goes to your iTunes library, it pulls it in, and then it just completely takes it apart
[01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:26.200]   for you.
[01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:27.200]   It shows you what the chords are.
[01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:28.200]   It shows you every bit about it.
[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:33.640]   So it makes learning songs by ear for string instruments, guitars and string instruments incredibly
[01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:34.640]   easy.
[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:37.560]   It's also great if you're a musician and you write by ear, you just write a song and then
[01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:41.920]   later, whether it's for legal reasons or for institution reasons, it'll help you write
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:45.240]   it all down so you don't have to go there and laboriously figure it out.
[01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:51.240]   I've rarely seen Apple engineers as blown away by apps as I've seen them blown away
[01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:52.240]   by capo.
[01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:57.440]   This can literally turn something in your iTunes library into a tab, for instance,
[01:22:57.440 --> 01:22:59.280]   tablature for guitar.
[01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:00.840]   Yeah, it is.
[01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:04.560]   And it's the kind of thing that people like Keith Richards would like sit and listen to
[01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:07.880]   a song over and over and over and over and over trying to get it.
[01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:12.880]   So how did they play that?
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:14.880]   In fact, it was Keith Richards who did a weird tuning and nobody ever could figure out how
[01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:16.640]   he played it because his tuning was weird.
[01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:18.560]   This does it all automatically.
[01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:19.560]   That is cool.
[01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:20.560]   And it's super smart.
[01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:23.400]   Like you can slow it down to make it easier for you to listen along and play along with
[01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:24.840]   and it keeps the same pitch.
[01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:26.240]   So you don't lose any of that.
[01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:28.800]   You can change a chord and it'll automatically do all that for you.
[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:31.480]   There is so many layers of cleverness built into this.
[01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:35.400]   I was amazed that he managed to squeeze it all into an iPhone or iPad app.
[01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:38.200]   And the great thing is you can carry with you, you can literally use this on a bus, you
[01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:39.800]   know, going to a gig.
[01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:41.360]   Wow.
[01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:43.000]   Burke says it's a music decompiler.
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.480]   It really is.
[01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:48.440]   And his company is called Supermega Ultra Groovy, just awesome.
[01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:52.840]   SupermegaUltraGroovy.com and you can get it on the app store, both app stores, the desktop
[01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:55.000]   and now the iOS app store.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:58.000]   And I believe it's on sale for half off right now if you want to grab it.
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.000]   49 normally 999.
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.400]   I know because I just spotted it.
[01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:03.400]   That's awesome.
[01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:09.720]   Even just as a $4.99 to watch a magic trick, I think that's worth $4.99 to watch it work.
[01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:12.280]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:14.280]   Here's one that's free for a couple of days.
[01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:17.000]   Chad found this one.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:22.240]   One of the things, you know, we've always talked about is the iPad for content consumption
[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:23.520]   or can you actually create?
[01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:25.920]   And there are certainly things you can create with the iPad.
[01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:29.880]   You can take pictures, edit and post them, video edit and post it.
[01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:31.480]   You can write with the iPad.
[01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:36.200]   One of the things the iPad was never any good at, that a desktop computer was good at, was
[01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:38.520]   programming, computer programming.
[01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:46.360]   Well somebody has put Python on the iPad, IPython, including all the SciPy libraries.
[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:54.880]   So if you're a scientist who uses the Python programming language to analyze, you know,
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:25:04.800]   data, this has NumPy, SciPy, SimPy, Pandas, Matplotlib built in, you can access it right
[01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:07.880]   through a Python interpreter on the iPad.
[01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:10.720]   That's first time I've ever seen anything like this.
[01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:12.320]   And did you find this Chad?
[01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:13.320]   Because this is very cool.
[01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:18.040]   Yeah, this is one of the bigger posts on Reddit.
[01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:19.800]   So yeah, that's how I discovered it.
[01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:21.800]   Like Kapo kind of what?
[01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:24.880]   You can do that.
[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:27.240]   And it's free for the next three days.
[01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:31.360]   So if you are somebody who's interested in Python, Python is a great language for beginners.
[01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:33.160]   It's used by scientists.
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:34.160]   NASA uses it.
[01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:36.320]   Google, of course, does a lot of stuff in Python.
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:40.400]   Scientists particularly love Python because of the very powerful science libraries.
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:42.960]   And they're built into computable.
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:44.720]   It's called computable.
[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:48.800]   It is available for free for the next three days.
[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:52.840]   I think maybe not the next three days because it came out June, July 10th.
[01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:53.840]   And this is the 13th.
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:56.080]   This might be the last day you can get it for free.
[01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:57.080]   I don't know.
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:25:58.080]   It's still free.
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:25:59.080]   Let's put it that way.
[01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:00.080]   Act now.
[01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:00.920]   Act quickly.
[01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:07.080]   It looks like they have pretty good documentation built in and everything.
[01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:13.880]   This could be a super duper scientific calculator or more depending on how you use Python.
[01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:19.680]   If you're a Pythonista, computable from Carl Tounmüller.
[01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:22.120]   I shall be downloading it immediately.
[01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:28.560]   Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this edition of iPad a day.
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:31.320]   Thank you so much, Renee Ritchie from iMore.com.
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:32.560]   Anything you want to plug?
[01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:34.760]   You always have such great podcasts there.
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:40.240]   If you're interested in Swift, we managed to get Don Melton, Brent Simmons, and Natalia
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:45.320]   Birdis, who gave a fantastic talk at WWC on a roundtable with Guy English and myself
[01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:46.320]   on Swift.
[01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:47.920]   That's going to be up tomorrow.
[01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:48.920]   That's exciting.
[01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:51.880]   That'll be part of the debug podcast or?
[01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:52.880]   Yes.
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:53.880]   Okay.
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:55.200]   So iMore.com/debug.
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:56.200]   Yeah.
[01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:58.040]   And it will be tomorrow.
[01:26:58.040 --> 01:26:59.040]   Yeah.
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:00.040]   Yeah.
[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:01.440]   It's the next one coming soon.
[01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:03.040]   Yeah, there are very clever group of people.
[01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:09.040]   If you are a developer, you like the inside guts of what's going on in Macintosh.
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:11.240]   This is a great podcast to listen to.
[01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:12.240]   Thank you.
[01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:13.240]   Yeah.
[01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:14.240]   I can't wait.
[01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:15.240]   That'll be good.
[01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:16.240]   iMore.com/debug.
[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:17.800]   iMore.com for those articles and congratulations.
[01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:24.320]   I saw that you've just crossed 30 million uniques for the Mobile Nations websites as a whole.
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:25.800]   Yeah, it's humbling.
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:26.800]   It's amazing.
[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:28.320]   It's to thank all those readers.
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:30.320]   30 million uniques a month.
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:31.320]   Yeah.
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:36.720]   For iMore Mobile, Android Central, Crackberry, WP Central, and Connectedly.
[01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:37.720]   Yes.
[01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:38.720]   The Mobile Nations sites.
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:39.720]   Well done.
[01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:41.760]   Do you get like a bonus for that?
[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:42.760]   No.
[01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:46.200]   I get to work harder trying to get the 40.
[01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:47.200]   Great to have you.
[01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:48.760]   Thank you so much Renee Ritchie.
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:50.440]   Andy Inako is at the Chicago Sun-Time.
[01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:52.040]   Did you take that super moon picture?
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:53.040]   No.
[01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:54.040]   Yes, it did.
[01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:55.040]   You did.
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:56.040]   Tell us how.
[01:27:56.040 --> 01:28:05.480]   Uh, OMPUS OMD EM1 on a tripod with a cheap as hell, a Panasonic micro four third zoom lens
[01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:11.400]   looked really, really hard for my old Nikon zoom lens with a two X adapter with the micro
[01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:12.400]   four thirds adapter.
[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:14.400]   Cannot find it inside the house.
[01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:20.080]   But the fun thing about shooting the moon is that it doesn't take very, it's not like
[01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:24.680]   I'm going to shoot airplanes at the air show and hope I get what I can get.
[01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:25.760]   It's like, no, there's the moon.
[01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:27.600]   It's going to be there in the sky all night.
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:29.200]   Put it on the tripod.
[01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:30.200]   Wow.
[01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:34.120]   Take one exposure or bracket it seven times and then okay, is that in focus?
[01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:35.120]   Yes.
[01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:36.120]   The exposure's look good.
[01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:37.120]   Yes.
[01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:38.440]   All right, then let's go back inside.
[01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:39.440]   That's hard to do.
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:40.440]   And you did it beautifully.
[01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:42.680]   It's a gorgeous picture.
[01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:43.680]   It's a good subject.
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:44.680]   Nice.
[01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:46.800]   By the way, I'm sorry.
[01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:49.520]   I know the charm is going crazy because I call it the wrong name.
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:50.520]   What?
[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:51.520]   It's Mac break weekly.
[01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:52.520]   What did I say?
[01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:53.520]   I've had week two.
[01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:54.520]   I've had today.
[01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:55.520]   I've had today.
[01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:56.520]   Well, I was doing an iPad app and I was thinking I should have.
[01:28:56.520 --> 01:28:58.360]   It's a compliment Leo.
[01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:00.360]   All of our shows are good.
[01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:05.760]   But I wanted to thank Anthony because he already has our video up on YouTube.
[01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:09.120]   So here's this is Marcus trying to break.
[01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:13.160]   This is us early on the show, but I want to show you what he did.
[01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:14.960]   And a five s panel side by side.
[01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:16.840]   See what the actual differences are.
[01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:21.080]   So I have in my hands, this is a Samsung Galaxy S3.
[01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:23.920]   Remember this earlier on in the show?
[01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:30.200]   I want to get five million views and I have a hard sharp knife.
[01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:34.560]   Not a scratch.
[01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:37.060]   It's pretty hard to use a sharp knife.
[01:29:37.060 --> 01:29:41.040]   Also, the panel by itself is thin and will bend when it's on and you said this.
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:42.040]   Oh, it's flexible.
[01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:43.040]   Yeah.
[01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:44.040]   Absolutely.
[01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:45.040]   Wow.
[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:48.040]   A helium balloon.
[01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:49.680]   Oh, please.
[01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:53.540]   I think I'm bleeding.
[01:29:53.540 --> 01:29:57.920]   Well, here you go.
[01:29:57.920 --> 01:30:01.320]   Somebody please sweep those glass shards off of the table.
[01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:02.320]   Is that glass?
[01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:05.640]   Yeah, well, there's pointy is anyway.
[01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:08.880]   Just wanted to thank Anthony for getting that out so fast.
[01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:13.120]   Anthony Nielsen, our brilliant editor, but that was fast.
[01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:14.560]   That was not an aftermarket screen.
[01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:17.760]   That was an official Samsung Galaxy S3 replacement part.
[01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:19.920]   Can we watch ourselves watching ourselves?
[01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:23.040]   Let me put that on YouTube real fast.
[01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:24.520]   The whole thing.
[01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:26.240]   And I am wearing a Band-Aid now.
[01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:29.680]   Thank you for providing the first aid.
[01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:31.600]   Jeez.
[01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:33.120]   Purple heart right there, Leo.
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:34.120]   Yeah.
[01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:37.120]   Yeah, I got wounded in the production of this podcast.
[01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:41.640]   We can no longer say that no hosts were injured in the making of Mac Break Weekly.
[01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:45.920]   Ladies and gentlemen, we do Mac Break Weekly at 11 a.m. Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern Time 1800

[01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:23.400]   many places.
[01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:24.400]   I think we have a page.
[01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:25.400]   What was the name of that page again?
[01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:30.040]   That you can see all the different ways you can watch, uh, Twitter TV / apps.
[01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:33.720]   Apps, Twit.tv /apps.

[01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:37.880]   Break time.
[01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:38.880]   So good.
[01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:38.880]   [Music]
