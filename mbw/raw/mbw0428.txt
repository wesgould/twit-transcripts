[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show where we cover the latest Apple news, of which there is little, but we'll find a way. We'll always find a way.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   That's because we have some of the best Gab Fest mongers in the biz. Starting with Andy Inocco. Andy, I have no idea, Inocco.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Don't know if you just called me a Gab Fest mongrel, but it is accurate and I will embrace it.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Great to have you. What is that picture behind you? It says "Note."
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Oh, that's from the research library in the Boston Public Library. It is like a very, very old call slip box. And if I zoomed out on it, it's just this beautiful, it's been there since like 1963.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   It looks like it's done by a 1930s cartoonist, that exclamation mark particularly.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   It's like we used to know how to do good handwriting back then. And if you were a librarian who likes to have things in numerical order, like 80,000 objects in precise numerical order, line spacing, kerning, these are important to you.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   And so I didn't go to the library to photograph that, but I was looking up some stuff like, "Oh, that's just a beautiful object."
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   And I wonder if I could, I wonder if I hear one complaint about, "Oh, geez, those old filthy boxes. I'm just terrified." I'll go to Amazon, I'll buy us new boxes if I can take one of those.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   You've been getting some great pictures in Boston Public Buildings of late.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   It is. I could, I gave a talk at Mac Tech for about an hour about some of the stuff in the Boston Public Library. It is just a real palace and the best thing, whenever people ask me, "Hey, I've got one afternoon in Boston," I always say, "Boston Public Library, what should you do?"
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Fenway Park is nice, Museum of Science is nice, but I think you want to go to the Boston Public Library.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Unless you're in Montreal, in which case you'd probably want to go see the Montreal Expos, Renee Richie.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   No, Leo, we lost the Kansas, we lost the Royals to Kansas City, we lost the Expos to Washington. We have no more of the baseball. We even lost the Nordiques to Colorado. We're not doing too well.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   That's kind of cruel.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   That's kind of cruel of me. I'm sorry.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   They even took the hockey.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Yeah, they even took our hockey. But you know what? They didn't take Renee Richie. He's still there. Imor.com. Great to have you, Renee.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Great to be here, Leo, even if it is already going dark outside as we speak.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   No, really?
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   I mean, I can see the sun setting. It's abysmal.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   It's 222 in Montreal in the afternoon.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   It'll be dark by 430. It'll just, yeah.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Vampires love it, but the rest of us are kind of bummed.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Wow.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   As a matter of fact, I can probably, normally I have these like blackout curtains, like next to here, to keep out the sunlight. Now I just remembered that with daylight savings, I could actually probably open these up because, you're right, it's not sunset yet, but the sun has decided, yeah, I'm out of here. You guys have fun. I'm going elsewhere.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Back from his jaunts around the world, Mr. Alex Lindsay of the Pixelcore. Great to have you in studio with us.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Good to be back.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Yeah. You've been doing some interesting things of late. I don't know how much I could talk about.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   I'm actually allowed to talk about it.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   You were at the Air and Space Museum.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Yes, last week.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Last week for a hangout for a movie.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Interstellar.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   I watched it.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   How did it look?
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   It looked stunning. Is that the first time they've done, it must be the first time they've done a hangout there, but do they ever do any TV there?
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   They do. Actually, it's kind of cool. The Air and Space Museum, this was in the Beyond Earth, I think, area, and they have actually this little stage and they have cameras that come down from these big risers.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Our cameras were a little different than theirs, and so we figured we'd use ours. But we added lights and cameras and actors and all kinds of other stuff. But yeah, you should definitely check it out. It's the Interstellar.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   I think you should go to YouTube and just search Interstellar hangout. Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain. Really great.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   I thought it was a really fun conversation. It was a really good one. Matthew McConaughey is pretty intense.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Crazy.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   He pays very good attention. I bet you, I don't know if he was always like that.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Very focused.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Some people think he's a pessimist, but he prefers to think himself a realist.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   It's definitely worth checking out.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   And a good movie. Did you guys see Interstellar yet?
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   No.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   No, not yet.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Bring a lunch. Bring a lunch. It's long.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   It's Chris Nolan, and he's on my list of, "Okay, I've got to see that movie." I'm also now encouraged to see it by all the bellyaching I've been hearing about.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Science isn't accurate. That's not nearly safe. That astronaut suit isn't nearly warm enough to protect so-and-so.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   This is a little different because they had, there it is. Look how good that looks. And you can see the Air and Space Museum kind of behind whoever that woman is.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Someone got a tuxedo for this?
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   My imaginary audience.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Good idea.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Actually...
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   They were all YouTube stars. So Cheryl Lazar was on.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   Yeah. You had great, great hangout members, including...
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Astronauts.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Yeah, astronauts, physicists, some people who could really talk about the science.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   The guy who worked on this with the Nolans, because it was Christopher Nolan, but I think is that his brother? The co-author?
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   He's a Nolan.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Yep.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Nathan Nolan worked with Kip Thorne, a physicist. In fact, the movie was inspired by Kip Thorne's work on black holes, and Thorne himself did a lot of the calculations for how black holes...
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   It's a spinning black hole, which is apparently very unusual, and the physics and the calculations involved are much more complex.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   But you were telling me... Was it you who told me that Kip Thorne was saying, "I learned stuff... Seeing the visualizations made for the movie, the CGI visualizations for the movie actually taught me... There was some science that I learned from that."
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   And I'm not surprised. I mean, I think a lot of times... I hadn't heard that, but I think Neil deGrasse said that this was the most accurate space film he'd ever seen.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   And none of them are perfect, because as everybody says, story comes first in a movie.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Absolutely. But I think that Christopher Nolan is probably more committed to that kind of... He's just a geek, so he really wants it to be as right as possible.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   But I think that... And when you ground it as much in science as you can, of course it just feels more real when you're watching it.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   But I think that one of the things that's really important is that visualization. I know that there's a lot of things around data that you learn very, very quickly when you can see in real time or just see what your ideas are visualized.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   And I think a lot of these physicists don't usually have access to hundreds of millions or tens of millions of dollars to visualize their ideas. And so they don't get to see what that is. And I think that that's...
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Here's a little clip from the movie. I think you'll enjoy this.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Amazing for me. Absolutely. Very good for everybody. And you know that they are all waiting.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   This is not a clip from the movie. This is actually the live footage from the European Space Agency. The comet landing is coming up momentarily.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   I'm always like the paranoid, like, what could possibly go wrong? You knock the comet off of its orbit. Next thing you know it destroys Earth.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   Not that I'm a Luddite. Totally dissimilar to the first act of many movies.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Yeah, the problem is I watch too many like deep impact.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   I think you'll enjoy it when you're stellar. I enjoyed it a lot. I think it's going to be a science fiction classic.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Yeah, a lot. 2001.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   Here's an interesting story. Let's move right into the Macintosh and the Apple News.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   You know that yesterday's Singles Day in China, apparently their version of a Hallmark holiday, because there has always been Children's Day and Grandparents Day, but there was never a single...
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   Is there a Valentine's Day or just a Singles Day? Like, we don't care once you get married.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   You know, the Chinese New Year is February 19th, so I'm wondering maybe this is in lieu of a Valentine's Day.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   So they have Singles Day and Alibaba recorded huge sales, partly because of this guy.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   He bought 99 iPhone 6s to form a heart in which he proposed to his girlfriend.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   That's why there's a shortage.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   She is surrounded by... I'm telling you, in China, 99 iPhone 6s... well, anywhere. That's a lot of money.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   By the way, the number may mean something, but the bottom line is that you've got to be lucky if you can afford 99 iPhones.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   I'm sorry. I call BS.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   Well, it seems like such a natural stunt for promoting iPhone sales.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   Maybe that was it.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   Let's set the scene where you're this person's girlfriend, you've gotten to the scene, and he's inviting you to step inside this big wall of heart-shaped iPhones.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   I don't think that any woman has ever been surprised by a wedding proposal.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   Would she walk in, let him get through the entire thing, and then say no?
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   Or would she just say, "Tell you what, why don't you step out with me and let's face away from the cameras and let's have a talk?"
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Because she did. She said no.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   I don't buy it. That's how you make this into a viral sensation.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   Oh, you are just ruining my day.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   I'm here to drill holes in your rowboat, Leo.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   The next thing you're going to tell me is the Rosetta landing is just being staged.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   Not staged. They're using mostly digital effects now, so they don't need to actually do a sound stage.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   I don't think they're doing a lot of green screen stuff. It's mostly wire work.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   That looks real. Come on.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   I'm sorry. I should have said spoiler alert.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   Now that you've mentioned it, this is a little too perfect. It's two years' salary for this Chinese programmer to buy 99 iPhones.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   That's a good salary in China.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   What does he do with them afterwards? What's the plan here? You have 99 of them, and then does she get them? Does he give them away?
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   Is there a 10-Bs?
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   China has the relationship with the United States where people come here to buy iPhones to sell them at markup.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   Is there a place that's even more China than China where they can take those 99 and make even more money off of them?
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Japan.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   My suspicion now that you say it is this does seem like a promotional vehicle, not necessarily for iPhones, but more for Singles Day and go out and spend heavily.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   Singles Day is only a few years old and I think created by Alibaba.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   Be a good consumer.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   Alibaba getting 99 iPhones seems realistic.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   Yeah. All right. I thought I'd mention that.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   We're terrible people.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Terrible people. I'm going to tell you how Interstellar ends, Andy, and you'll be sorry.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   Big Hero 6 is a lovely movie. I'm going to see that tonight.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   It's a very heavily like Pro Max shop there at Disney Animation.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   You're going to be speaking of Pro Max shops, you're going to be so jealous when you see what I've done to my keyboard here.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   Killer Duck decals. These are all comic book characters. Oh, wait a minute. I showed you that last week.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Never mind. There was no Andy last week. I wasn't here last week. You're all like one week smarter than I am.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   Okay. Okay. I already had to get...
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   Jim Cook still gay? I don't know because I wasn't on the show last week.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   We don't know. We had to get Renee go through these to tell me who they all are.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   Some of them are obvious Batman and Green Lantern, but I didn't know Punisher for instance.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   All right. Let's take a break. When we come back, there is some news.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   Finally, a solution for those folks who move from iPhone to Android and can no longer get messages.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   But first a word from audible.com. I like starting the show with audible because we are big audible fans.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   We listen to a lot of audiobooks on audible and goodness knows there are plenty to listen to.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   If you go to audible.com, you'll notice 150,000 plus titles.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   The newest stuff. Look, they've got the new Stephen King. It just came out yesterday.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   A terrifying masterpiece revival.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   In a small New England town over a half a century ago, a shadow falls over a small boy playing with his toy soldiers.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   Jamie Morton looks up. This seems like I've read this before. To see a striking man, the new minister.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   Anyway, if you're a Stephen King fan, you know this is a big event when there's a new Stephen King novel.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   This one is 13 hours and 24 minutes and I'm going to tell you how you can get it free in just a moment.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   Audible is a great place to go to find the latest stuff. I just started listening to it and I'm really enjoying it.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   David Byrne, the lead man on Talking Heads has written a book about music.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   Isn't it great? You really listen to that, Jason? Yeah, I listened to it a while back.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   I've listened to the first chapter and already my eyes are popping.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   Yeah, because it's kind of half autobiography, half just like his random usings on what it takes to be creative musician.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   It's fascinating. I bet as a musician, Jason, you really got a lot out of it.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   I love it. That's pretty much exclusively what I listen to on Audible are all music related audio.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   Me too. Graham Nash's book is awesome. I'm listening to that Beatles book you recommended some time ago, Andy.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   Here's All Quiet. This is good for Veterans Day. All Quiet on the Western Front, a classic anti-war movie.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   But also the novel that it's based on by Eric Maria Remarque. Helmet for My Pillow by Robert Leckie.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   The Things They Carried. If you haven't read this, this is an amazing novel of soldiers in Vietnam that I think anybody who's ever read this will just agree is a must read.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   And Bryan Cranston narrates it. So you know this is going to be very beautiful.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   Cranston, of course, we all know, is the father on No, as Breaking Bad guy.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   He is a father in Breaking Bad. He's also the father in, what is the show that he...
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   Oh, right. Malcolm in the Middle. I got a little audio. Are you hearing it?
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   It says Bryan Cranston reading The Things They Carried by Tim O'Brien.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   In the accompanying letter, Martha wrote that she had found the pebble on the Jersey shoreline, precisely where the land touched the water at high tide.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   Oh, I want to listen to this. I want to reread this. I read it as a book, but I'd love to get it as audio.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   That's what's great about audiobooks from audible.com. They come to life.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   You're hearing them and you're really seeing them on the movie screen in your brain. It's so powerful.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   So here's the deal. You can get a free audiobook right now if you go to audible.com/macbreak.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   One audiobook you might consider The Stephen King or Perhaps The Things They Carried or one of the classics.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   They have lots of classics. Science fiction. I just got the newest Peter Hamilton novel.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   I'm a big fan of Hamilton's. Just a fabulous place. If you love reading or if you wish you could get back to reading but you just don't have the time,
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   get in the car, hook up the iPhone or the Android device or the Windows phone and start listening.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   And I think you might drive around the block a few extra times just to hear another chapter or two.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   What are you listening to these days, Andy?
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   Well, I finally got around to reading The Martian.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   Oh, you loved that, didn't you?
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   Just as you say, now I've got to get the audiobook because that was also heavily recommended.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   But we've been plugging that book for months and months.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   I would like to say that most of my books are lofty novels that you'd have to be in postgraduate English theory in order to read and understand.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   A lot of them though are just show business memoirs and Martin Short has a new one that came out last week.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   And it's really, really funny. And what really attracted me to it was that in the audible edition he actually narrates the thing himself.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   And so when you have a comedian who has 30 years for the stage performance telling stories about his own life,
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   goodness gracious, that's like, you know what, maybe I won't fly to Philadelphia, maybe I'll just drive the whole way because that seems like a good way to spend four to eight hours.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   After questioning both candidates, the interviewer declares, "Your credentials are so darn equal and I don't know how to decide. I can't make up my mind."
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   The male candidate proposes that the matter be settled by arm wrestling.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   I must say my life has a humble comedy legend written and narrated by Marty Short. That is nice.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   Good stuff. I was really, because you've seen him on talk shows enough that you feel like you've heard at least 20% of his life.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   But there's stories about, if you're a fan of comedy, there are new stories about Second City and not the TV show and the stage performance about the '70s, about the early SNL. It's just really terrific stuff.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   See, and this is, and then, okay, as always with Audible, it says, "People who bought this also bought."
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   And then you see all these other books you want to listen to like Dick Cavett's memoirs, read by Dick Cavett, Sofia Loren's memoirs, "Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow, My Life,"
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   Neil Patrick Harris's autobiography, read by Neil, Bob Hope. I mean, I could go on and on and on.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   That's a really interesting one. That is actually next up, the next one I'm going to use my credits for, the Bob Hope autobiography, excuse me, the Bob Hope biography.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   Because enough time has passed by that it's possible to do like a scholarly biography of a very, very major figure who has had an incredible career and also touched a lot, had a lot of experiences, a lot of lives.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   And now it's okay with 20 years worth of perspective to say, "Okay, but he did cheat around a lot and his politics were like this and he was nice, but he wasn't all that nice."
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   Right, right. I can't wait. And this is the problem with Audible. A lot more time to listen.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   In the car, at the gym, walking the dog, doing the dishes, audible.com/macbreak. There's definitely a book for you. Get that first one free.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   First week, you get the first month free in our gold plan, which means a book a month and you can cancel any time in that first month and you get to keep that book forever.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   But I don't think you'll cancel. Audible.com/macbreak. We thank them for their support. And I thank you, Andy, because you always have great Audible recommendations.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   Now there's eight more books on my list. You know, I've been going through my Audible list and there's books that I haven't listened to going back five years.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   You know, I'll buy it and then I don't get around to it. And so I can't wait till I retire. I'm just going to listen to Audible all day.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   Time, time, time. There's time enough at last. There's so many good books in the world. Don't you wish you could just read and read and read and read?
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   That's been actually, because now I live in Pittsburgh and I go back and forth to DC a lot. You're right on the edge of does it better than that.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   Do you take the train or plane? I have to. There's no train from Pittsburgh, only from Philadelphia.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   So I have to decide whether I'm going to drive or fly. And it's been, I'm halfway, but I'm now leaning towards more and more driving just because I get to listen to books.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   You listen to the book? Yep, exactly. You don't have to sit in the airport. I hate sitting in the airport. Plus you get to keep your knife.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   And I get to keep my knife. But I don't even like to relax. I don't even like to relax and put a knife in there because you know I'll forget it. I've gone through like, I don't know how many.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   This is I just I got I lost my last knife on the last trip last week. Yeah, because I was in such a rush to get out of the guy.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   I didn't know if I was going to make my shuttle. And so I had a bite. You just never feel so dumb as when TSA holds up a knife.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   Is this yours, sir? Yes, it is. No, I was going to. No, it is no longer. I suppose. Thank you very much.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   I had I had one in Zimbabwe where I had little mini Leatherman and they and I got I was in a domestic trip just to Victoria Falls and the guys is, oh, you can't get on the phone.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   I can't get on. I said, can you keep it here? I'm going to be back in the evening. Just keep it here.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   And I was like, I was like, I had, you know, I had gotten caught without it. Yeah, I'm caught with it.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   And I was like, and he's like, oh, I can't do that. And I said, I said, but it's you know, this was a gift. I can't.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   You know, I don't want to give it up. And he goes, he looked at me and he goes, here, you can have it, but don't do anything bad with it.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   That's encouraging. I'm really happy to get my knife. But it makes me very worried. It was a very tiny knife.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   It was. Let me tell you about the time where I was at the I was at the the park and ride for the show.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   It's like the twenty dollars shuttles from like satellite parking and then the half hour drive ride into into Logan.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   And I'd forgotten to like leave my Leatherman like my eighty dollar like leather Leatherman wave like at home.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   Yeah. It was in my pocket. And I'm waiting for the bus going to leave in about 20 minutes.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   I got damn it. There's no way out because I'm just going to it's just going to be lost. I thought, well, if it's going to be taken away from me at the TSA anyway, I have nothing to lose.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   And so I waited to see like everyone else was like about to like leaving the place to go to the board the bus, got on my hands and knees and hit it behind one of the vending machines and then walked away and said, OK, in a week's time, it's either going to be still there or it's not going to be still there.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   And a week later, yes, it was still there. That's great. And it was at the entire place wasn't shut down because the suspicious man hid something, a possible explosive device in a waiting area.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   Oh, boy. Yeah. You hope you weren't any cameras on you doing that.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   I'm a shift. I'm a shifty person. I've had that said to me about me a lot. I'm very shifty person. Shifty fellow. We saw that in Notco.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   So trouble in paradise. The end of the line for no, it's not. But the verge said the end of the line for iPhone and iOS users in the days of maddening. Yeah, it was so bad.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   Reuters was terrible yesterday. Reuters was just abysmal yesterday.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   So what was Reuters headline? Do you remember?
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   It was it was about mask attack.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   Mask attack. Right. Yeah. But all of them, the headline, they care so much about getting people to click that they don't care at all about scaring people needlessly about malware attacks that are both not new and also do not target 90 percent of the people who are reading their site.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   Yeah. New malware, mask attack targets iOS replaces apps to steal data. So there have been lately a number of exploits exposed. There's that that exploit that you get if somebody can get to your computer, he can escalate to administrator.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   What is it? Root, root, root pipe, root pipe.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   But somebody has to be sitting at your computer to root pipe you.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   Or they have to have exploited you previously and gotten remote access. Yeah. So it's a secondary attack. Yeah.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   Mask attack.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   Mask short for masquerade.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   FireEye discovered this. They say hackers exploited a flaw. It's like two years old. Oh, never mind.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   They claim they discovered it. I Jonathan Zdarsky wrote about it months ago and people have been writing about it for months longer. And it's not an exploit. They're using enterprise certificates, which is functionality Apple provides for enterprise to deploy apps to masquerade as other apps.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   So they have to first get you to download an enterprise app outside the app store and then click all the war click through all the warnings and be really trust this developer.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   And then you install it on your device. And then they also have to make sure the app they're emulating hasn't done any encryption on their end. Otherwise, the information is still not available to them.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   But but but the verge said that the iPhone has lost its perfect security record.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   It's terrible. It's it's it's.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   That is the worst. I can't figure out what it never had a perfect record. Yeah, there is a difficult to hit that it was just no point in even trying.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   There's so many things wrong with this. First of all, it doesn't have a perfect security record. There's been malware on in the app store for a long time. Of course, Apple removes it immediately.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   But but we know about it. So what you get here is, well, as we know, the verge kind of is a is a fan of iOS.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   And so you get here like a fanboy suddenly realizing and then saying it's lost its perfect.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   None of there's nothing in this headline is accurate.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   No link bait nor the Reuters one nor most of the other blog. What about wire lurker wire lurker is all the same thing.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   It also uses enterprise.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   But what it does is if you go to a certain pirated app site in China, if you want to get wares and then you download a pirated app and they usually make it like a very popular, expensive game or something, you download it.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   And then you again, you blow past all this. Do you want to trust this app because it's not from a signed developer?
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   And then you install it. If you're jailbroken, they can then it's sorry. After you install it on your Mac, it waits for you to connect an iOS device.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   And if the iOS device is jailbroken, it can start taking things off the device because you've removed all the security Apple puts on the device during the jailbreak process.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   If not, it can try to copy some information off depending on how secure individual apps and things are.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   And in this case, you would get it mostly because you're using a third party app store in China.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   So it's the same thing when we used to put viruses and slide movie downloads on using it.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   So the real world analogy would be if you leave your keys in the car and the window down and you drive into a bad part of town, someone may you know, you're you may actually have your car stolen.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   But I should point out the verge isn't completely wrong.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   This is, in fact, only the second known time a malware attack on iOS has come through OS 10 using USB. So they're close.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   And Apple can revoke the permission for any enterprise and they have to be abusive.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   Yes, they have. So so bottom line this for us. Is there anything to worry about, Renee?
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   If you if you do go to that specific Chinese pirate app site, download apps and install them, especially if you are jailbroken, you should worry and you should take all the steps that we detail in the article about how to find out if you're infected and how to remove the infection.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   If you're just a regular person using the app store, you have absolutely nothing to worry about.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   Glory days are still with you. You know, what's interesting to me is that mobile devices in general seem like they'd be right pickings for bad guys because there's so many ways you can make money on a mobile device, you know, sending text messages to paid text message sites in the Bahamas and getting 25 bucks or just all the data that's on.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   I mean, it's just it just seems like right pickings for years. We really expected that all these devices would be just compromised like crazy.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   And they've both and I have to say this is true of Android as well and BlackBerry and Windows Phone. They've all proven much more robust than one would expect, given how right the target.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   Well, and I think that there's but there's a but there's an obvious reason for that is because that because the functions that you try to attempt on these devices are so limited, the operating the OS developers can create so many such aggressive firewalls and such aggressive sandboxes to make it a really, really hard thing to do.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   If you were to try to sandbox the desktop OS that way, it would just be absolutely useless as a productivity tool. Well, and I think also that these operating systems are much more recent than desktop operating systems.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   And as a result, they have been designed with security much more in the forefront. Have they not? I definitely.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   But imagine an operating machine, a computer where you can't plug anything into it and imagine a computer in which all software you try. You can't extend anything. You can't add capabilities to anything because every app is designed to be just absolutely walled off from everything else.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   Even getting getting information from one app to another is going to be a hellacious trial. So that is a reason why. But for a lot of people, that really doesn't bother them at all. Doesn't it interfere with their ability to do email, to write the to write a term paper, to do all that sort of stuff.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   So it's really a pointer to how great the future is for mobile devices. If you want to switch from a laptop to to an iPad, say.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   Yeah, and I think we're going to see more and more security as we do more and more biometrics. I mean, I think that the thumb, you know, the little thumbprint is touch ID is the beginning of that. But I think, you know, we're not that far away.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   Point out something. Touch ID is no more secure than a four digit pen. It's just more convenient. I wouldn't say that. You can't copy it. You can't copy a fingerprint. All right. You can't shoulder.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   So somebody over. OK. So for instance, if I do a four, if I do an ATM, there are people with infrared cameras. And if I do my my pin on at the supermarket, they can see the heat marks, which is why I tend to do more. I stand corrected.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   If you're a spy to pawn, you're right. You could see somebody's pin. You can't you can't see somebody's fingerprints. Do you like the other cool thing is that people are not going to choose a fingerprint that's easy to remember.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   Well, it's so funny because Apple doesn't let you choose a pin that's, quote, highly crackable, like two, two, two, two, two, except by doing so reduces the 10000 possible choices significantly.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   So in a way, it's kind of not exactly what you want, because now hackers don't have to try one, one, one, one and two, two, two, two. Right. Because Apple won't let you use them.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   So I think there's an open question about whether that's a good practice or not. People should be allowed to choose anything to a password. Right. Or make it a password.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   So but barring looking over your shoulder, I don't think a four digit pin is less secure than its fingerprint. But the over the shoulder attack is genuine.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   The print was one in 80000 and the passcode was one in 10 or 20000 or something.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   But again, if someone is a dedicated, if someone was a dedicated CSI, they could come and make a mold of your fingerprint and put it on plastic. I mean, it depends on how much valuable you are as a target.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   Yeah. I mean, and and and you can always and should set your password attempts to 10 and then erase after that. And I think at that point, you have young kids.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   So so yes, you're I agree with you. Fingerprints is more secure because of that scenario. But I think these are secure. I mean, these devices are secure.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   Yeah, no, they're very secure. And I but I think that we're going to only see more security.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   I mean, I think that there are a lot of things that have been floating around and a lot of other places for a long time, whether it's facial recognition as well as voice recognition.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   And it's not that any one of those is accurate or any one of those is more secure.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   But if you start adding those things up for things that really need to be a high security, like I have a four digit code and I have my thumb and I have a voice for and for enterprise, I think that becomes that becomes very useful.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   And we should point out, I guess, that a judge has ruled, as we expected, that the fingerprint is not protected by the Fifth Amendment.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   It is not in the same way that it is. Yeah.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   So you can be compelled to offer your fingerprint by law enforcement because that's something you have.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   Fifth Amendment, according to this judge. And I think many people have thought this all along.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   This just confirms it. The fingerprint is like a DNA test or which you cannot refuse or a blood test, which you cannot refuse.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   And the password is something in your head. And you can be you can plead the fifth and say, I reserve the right not to self-incriminate.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   And that is a right that you have. So on that in that regard, I guess, if you're worried about law enforcement, a pin code would be better.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   And you can choose in iOS whether you want the touch ID to unlock your phone or not. You can just turn that off and leave it on for purchase.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   That's a good idea. So you can still use touch ID for Apple Pay and everything else. Just not to unlock.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   Who's going to do that? It's so nice just to hold the phone.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   No, but the thing is, is that the other the other. But the other question is, if you think you're in a situation where you're in trouble, turn it off.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   Or get your attorney to stall for two days, because if you don't use the touch ID within 48 hours, it requires a pin code.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   Right. Or you like literally in seconds you can have it. You can just turn it off. You know, someone asked for your phone.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   Yeah, well, that's the other that's what some people have said.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   But I think that that's not quite fair. But to say, well, just, you know, say, oh, yeah, here. Oh, I guess it doesn't work anymore.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   No, it's because it was this thing. Never mind. All right.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   We've in any event, it's clear that despite these overblown stories about exploits and malware, the mobile devices, not just the iPhone, but generally mobile devices are safer.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   More so that one thing to Leo where they said that, you know, if you have a significant other who's maybe curious about your activities, they can't get a password from you.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   But when you fall asleep, they can still put your finger on it.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   If you are sleeping with somebody who would do that, might be time to move out.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   I'm just saying there is there has been for years a complaint by people who move from iOS to Android that I messaged is that.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   I messaged is too dumb to figure that out and continues to your friends who use iPhones will continue to send you messages that you can no longer read.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   Apple has finally responded to this. I wish they'd done this sooner.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   It's they've always registered it as a known bug, but it's not a known bug. Here's how you do it.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   You can deregister I messaged there now is a page itself.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   Self solve. I didn't even know Apple had this self solve dot apple dot com. And this is what you can do.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   If you have your iPhone, you can do it within the iPhone.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   The issue is more people who, you know, abandon the iPhone and are now on Android and they're missing messages because because their iPhone using friends have them entered into their iPhone as iPhone users.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   So it uses messages to send the SMS instead of SMS. Now Apple will give you a way to deregister your phone number and say, look, I have to have had people that I've sent lots of messages to.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   And I'm like, wow, they don't like me anymore. And it turns out they weren't getting any. Yeah, they weren't getting them.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   Yeah, you can pop the blue bubbles. I'm so I'm so terribly confused by messages for all these years.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   I don't know what rules apply that will make sure that we'll get a message from one person or not another person.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   Whenever I register a new device to what is it in my best interest to register new email addresses and phone numbers to it or is it my best interest to say no, no, no, only use this con put a contact for stuff.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   And it's whenever people ask me about it, even when I'm using it myself, I have to go to reference sources to confirm that what I'm guessing is actually true.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   And what I guess is usually not true. Is it OK? Well, let's try. Let's have a little.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   This may be a game show. I messages. Does it do this true or false? I have now because of continuity, I feel like this is a little bit better than it used to be.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   I do love it that I can now use messages on my Mac to send what looks like text messages to my iPhone wielding friends.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   That's nice. But I think the winners are I mean, I think the two winners for me are Messenger and Hangouts because I can go to any web browser.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   Hangouts is the same thing, but Hangouts is cross platform. And so is Messenger. Messenger. Facebook Messenger and Google Hangouts are the two that I use probably the most.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   Because they're cross platform. And because I can go to any web page, I can go to any phone, I can go to any, you know, like, you know, it's anything.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   And I'm like having something tied up in one OS or one phone number is I'm kind of kind of over that. But those are the two for me that.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   So I always know maybe I'm wrong. But I always when I register when I use new iOS or OS 10 device, say yes, add that to the messages pool, add that email address, add that phone number.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   It's very long pool now of phone numbers and email addresses that it's supported. There doesn't seem to be, by the way, any good way to remove it.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   I guess maybe I can now use this tool to remove old phone numbers.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   But that seems OK, because now when my phone rings or I get a message, all my devices go, and I can use any one of them to respond. Is that right?
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   Or all of them. It's a little overwhelming at times.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   So that seems that seems. Yeah, but that seems OK.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   And isn't it better now in the age of continuity?
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   I'd say so, but I still don't have I still don't have that sort of absolute blind trust that I have in like, let's say text messaging, which is why I just will not.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   I've always used that as my preferred method of contact for everything else, because I know that it's a system that everybody has access to.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   There's one pipe and I don't it won't necessarily go to every single device that I have, but it will definitely work with this one device if I keep it handy with me.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   As Alex was saying, the most terrifying thing is when you open you've been using like computer Mac Mac a for like two days and then your laptop has been in your bag since you got back from wherever.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   And then finally you pop it out and recharge it and suddenly lights up with like 100 messages over the past two days that did not route to the copy of messages on the other machine.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   So, OK, make sure you get here by three o'clock because remember George Lucas has given you 20 minutes. He wants to talk to you about some important stuff like.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   It's like nothing terrifies you as much as people want to get in touch with you, but messages are not getting to you.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   Right. And it's hard because, you know, that there's also just like little things both with messages and for some reason I do a lot of tech all over the world.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   I use all of these messages things like WhatsApp is better at than Hangout Messenger or messages because it sends as you're typing, it's sending everything to the other side.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   And then when you hit done, it just pops it up. And so it's while you're typing messages to the other side.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   No, WhatsApp is sending to when you're WhatsApp someone to someone else.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   It's the message is being sent as you type it. And then when you say that's when you say send, it actually makes it available to them.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   That's why it's so fast compared to clever. So when Hangouts and iMessages do it, it hits it and then they start talking.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   You know, then they start figuring it out. Which is very clever. So it's WhatsApp is a little bit more efficient.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   That's why they got 19 billion dollars. Yeah. I think it turned out to be more right because it was different.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   It was twenty two billion dollars by the time all was said and done because the Facebook stock went up.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   Blackberry is still crying. That's more than Blackberry is worth right now.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   Right. I mean, like six times more than six.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   But I do feel like Apple's missing a little bit of a bet. Wouldn't it be good?
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   And maybe this is a first step because I tell you, this is not a Steve Jobs type of tool.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   What Steve would never admit that anybody is leaving the iOS universe and going to some other phone.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   So the fact that I mean, this is an admission that you use, it says no longer have your iPhone, then you can do this.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   That seems something that is part of the new Apple, which I appreciate.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   And let's take the next step. Can't we make messages cross platform?
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   Cross platform and services are two thing Apple does not do well. So putting those two together.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   I guess you're right. They try. They use for Windows is pretty god awful.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   They use the support like Apple, AOL, Messenger or whatever. It never really worked.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   Oh, that's right. Yeah, it never really worked. Web interface would be nice though.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   And I think a web interface. There you go. Web interface would be great. I could use that on anything on my phone.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   That would be great. Yes. At least it would give me access to those messages on if I don't have an iPhone.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   I think that's fair or not a Mac device. At least for two weeks because after that they destroy them.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   If you get in there any time in two weeks. Well, that's interesting.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   So if you do register, you're never going to get those messages that you missed back.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   Because that's it. Yeah, it tries to deliver them for two weeks and then they're gone, which is why if you ever wipe your phone and put them back,
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   you can download your entire message history. It just starts sort of from that date. Yeah.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   Interesting because Apple is getting into enterprise. That's another big story of the week.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   We'll talk about that in just a moment. But first a word from Squarespace. I love Squarespace.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   It is I should explain kind of a little bit what Squarespace is and we'll talk about some of its benefits.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   It's hosting. The best hosting in the world never goes down. Plus software on top of the hosting to give you the best possible web experience.

[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   The place to make your next website. Apple has said it's going enterprise. Remember they did a deal with IBM.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   Again, the new Apple. I think we could, there's so many things you could point to.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   And I think this is great. It has to happen with any company.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   But I think Tim Cook has really taken Apple to new areas that are very exciting.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   And enterprise is a very interesting place to go.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   And it almost seems like Apple had seeded enterprise for a long time to Microsoft.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   It was really good in enterprise, but it was never really focused on it. This is new for them.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   I think part of this also is that with sales of the iPad lagging a little bit, this is an opportunity to find a new market.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   You've got China. They're going toward China, but they also go to enterprise.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   They've done deals with a lot of companies now.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   They're working with startups like ServiceMax, PlanGrid. These are specifically for enterprise.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   There's a mobile app. PlanGrid is a mobile app for construction workers to share and view blue-pink.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   They got China Mobile was the big thing everyone wanted.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   And then how do you keep adding address to the market?
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   They were broad in enterprise, but they were never deep.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   And IBM is trying to get, instead of just having 99% of people trying it or having enterprise,
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   they want to have every department in every enterprise having many of their devices deployed.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   ServiceMax is a CRM. They say about 95% of their customers already use Apple devices.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   ServiceMax is field service, so it's field repair service, that kind of thing.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   Since their customers are already using Apple devices, it only makes sense to get apps on those devices and go deep.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   IBM apps, how many IBM apps? There's quite a few.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   The SDK for Apple is really good. The frameworks are really good. They make it easy to deploy things.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   We were talking about the enterprise certificates before,
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   but part of their power is that an enterprise can just make these apps and distribute it to their workforce.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   It's a good system.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   They're going after HP, they're going after Dell, when it comes to desktops.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   We buy Dell for the business side of the business. All of our hosts use Apple,
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   but everybody in our business side of our office, it's just a small enterprise, but it's an enterprise.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   They want to use Windows, they want to use Dell.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   They want to use the webcams.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   Yeah, the webcams.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   It's horrible.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   The Apple built-in webcams aren't great either.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   They're not, but I've got to tell you, we test probably 30 or 40 people a week for online stuff.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   You can literally, someone just pops up and goes, "So, are you using a Dell?"
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   It just looks like 1950s television.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   The good news is you go out and buy a Logitech and instantly you're much better.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   It's not expensive.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   I have to say the same thing. I have three cameras on me at all times at home because I get lonely.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   I just can't live without multiple cameras pointing at me at all times.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   I also have the chat room going at all times.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   But I can switch from camera to camera, and the built-in display cameras on the Thunderbolt display
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   and the Cinema LED display are terrible compared to the Logitech in the middle.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   I have to say, there's just no, you know immediately.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   Well, yesterday, last week when I was in DC, that was a Logitech C920.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   Looks great.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   And I think Andy's is a 920, right?
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   I mean, these look so good.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   People were saying to me last week, "Why don't you do whatever Alex is doing for the whole network?"
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   Right.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   Not just me. They said, "You looked better than me."
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   Boy, thank you. I spend a lot of money on this. I only use it once a month.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   Unbelievable. Unbelievable.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   You look better last week than this week, Alex.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   You know who's going to, I think, who's going to give Apple the biggest challenges?
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   Not HP. It's not Dell. It's not Oracle. It's not SAP. I think it's Microsoft.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   And maybe Samsung. Samsung is kind of at a par with Apple, kind of trying to get, move from that mobile space into the enterprise.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   But, and they have Knox. They have some stuff that enterprise really likes a lot.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   But I got to think that it's Microsoft that's really got to be the people you've got to be.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   Well, there's still the inside. And we can talk about Apple making inroads into enterprise, but Microsoft is still 80, 90% of the market.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   So it's, you know, it's a load.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   Why do we buy Dell's? Excel.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   As I'm as I'm fond of saying they're like the water and electric company.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   It's like they don't make products that are that are incredibly sexy.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   They don't make products that let you go in front of a white backdrop and talk about design.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   But they're the that they were keep the lights on and keep people healthy day after day after day.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   And now, boy, they seem to have over the past five years, they seem to have found the car keys to the to something good after rummaging through the sofa for about 10 years.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   Now, because now they're making consumer products are actually quite nice.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   I don't know if you've tried the Microsoft band, the shackle that came out with the tracking company.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   But it's nicely designed. It's not designed to do 100,000 different things.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   It's designed to be just a really awesome fitness band that also enhances some stuff on your phone.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   But it's nicely made. It works really great.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   I know a couple of people who are actually fit individuals who are using it and enjoying it a lot.
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   I've just started using their new mobile keyboard.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   Another very nicely engineered, very nicely put together thing.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   And these are not things that these are not things that and this is the same company that came up with the Zune player within living memory.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   And so you you're not was good at associating Microsoft making really good consumer electronics, but they're becoming a pretty decent consumer electronics company.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   The Zune was good. It just was way too late. It had no shop.
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   It was still a good they make good consumer products. They just they never time them right.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   Or they were it wasn't. Well, it's it wasn't good because I still remember trying to get it to work.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   We'll get it working on an actual like Windows notebook.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   And it was like an all day affair. And even then it just barely sort of worked.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   It was just OK. The Zune HD was good. Maybe not the original Zune.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   Yeah. The last the last generation by the last generation that came out with a device that if they had kept it around for another couple of generations,
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   it might have competed very, very well with what Apple was doing at the same price point.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   That was the first time they'd rolled out their new mobile interface design, which even at the time I thought, oh, this is really nice.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   This is a very well. There's a very good way to articulate a very complicated set of functions through a very simple screen.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   So they figured some stuff out.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   Ben Thompson had a good piece on this, though, saying that, you know, you you you make a really good product.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   You're still even if it's 80 percent as good, even if it's better, you're not guaranteed of that percentage of the market share.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   And that seems to be their problem is they make wonderful stuff, but they just can't get the market share for it.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   Well, latest results from Good Technologies Mobility Index report.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   These are enterprise numbers. Apple made up 69 percent of enterprise device activations in Q3.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   That's up two points. Android activation share dropped two points to 29 percent.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   Windows Phone one percent. So while Microsoft may own the desktop, Apple absolutely owns mobile.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   And this is the only way that does not include Blackberry because Good doesn't support Blackberry.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   And I think a lot of this also cuts through, you know, consumers buying low end androids as you know, as those kind of fill up a lot of those numbers.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   And you really see what you know, when companies are making a decision.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   And I'm kind of curious what I mean right now, that's just kind of a raw data, but I'm curious why they.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   You know, pick iOS because for a long time, I think enterprise was a little bit resistant to that unit to the iOS.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   Do you think the story I forget what company was, but they ran out and bought when they saw the data briefs, they ran out and bought iPhones and MacBooks for all their executives and called them their secure implementation.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   Well, you know, I guess I guess they said right about the same time the Home Depot had that huge hack that turned out to be some kind of Windows flaw that that they they went out and bought a bottle.
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   Like all the executives at Home Depot had ended up with with iOS and Mac like within a week.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   You know, they were it was Apple Care Enterprise is online now and it has on site support, which is what enterprises demand.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   We're not going to pick up our computers and bring them into the Apple Store.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   So this is Apple Care for Enterprise.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   There's a website enterprise, great Apple Care for IBM Enterprise customers.
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   You get an Apple Care account manager, personal liaison with Apple Care, one hour response time for urgent issues, IT level support available 24/7.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   Apple Care for Enterprise customers can also replace 10 percent of damaged iOS devices.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   So one in 10 get to be damaged and we'll replace them.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   They're actually really good at that.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   I mean, we work with Apple Enterprise.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   Do you?
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   Yeah, we I guess you would.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   And and and they the service is amazing.
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   I mean, you know, just what we get from almost any Apple Store that we walk into as soon as they, you know, they look down and I'm in Pixelcorp and we get a lot of attention because we buy a lot of machines.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   But you're in enterprise and you're moving into the enterprise model.
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   So they're definitely it's something that is a huge priority for them to make sure the enterprise customers are.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   And if you have a company, by the way, and you're buying lots of Macs, don't you don't have to just go in and talk to retail.
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   You can say I'm a business customer.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   We have a business rep.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   Exactly. You have a rep.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   You have and they're and they're you know, when you want to make a discount, but we do like we have big lease agreements.
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   So we don't buy all our machines.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   We lease them all.
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   And so they're all, you know, we rev them and everything else.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   But it's not that you get huge discounts.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   You get little discounts.
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   But you also but you get great service.
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   You can make phone calls and get things sorted out.
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   And you're not just a customer, you know, that's walking in.
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   I mean, everyone gets treated well, but definitely as a business customer, you get a little bit of a little bit extra.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   You know, it's almost just he feels like sales.
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   You know, you know, you get your own salesman.
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   It's nice.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   But they but they but they do a lot of leg work for us.
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000]   You know, like we want to do, you know, X, Y and Z.
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   We had to have tens of computers show up at one time and the Apple Store in Santa Rosa lifted heaven and earth to get them to us on time.
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   Let's talk about big boy pants.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   Put them on.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:56.000]   I sense I sense a title. Put on the big boy pants.
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   The squiller memorandum, which is not like the born identity.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   It's something different is although it feels like this should be a novel by David by Grisham.
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   The squiller man memorandum was revealed on Friday.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   The judge did against Apple's wishes unseal it and gives us a little bit of an insight, a little bit of a picture into the agreements Apple makes with its suppliers.
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   You remember the story is GT Advanced, which is a they were a sapphire furnace maker.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   They sold sapphire furnaces.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   Apple lent them almost half a billion dollars to build a plant in Mesa, Arizona, with GT's furnaces, but with GT running it to make sapphire for a as yet.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   These guys hadn't been they hadn't been making sapphire.
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   They had never done it.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   They made the machines that made sapphire.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   Right.
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   And of course, remember most of Apple suppliers are probably not in the US, I would guess.
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   They're in mostly in Asia.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   But they I guess the same template is applied to them.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   A squiller in the memorandum says Apple never really entered into negotiations, telling instead the managers should not waste their time negotiating because Apple doesn't negotiate with suppliers.
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   We don't negotiate with terrorists, and we don't negotiate with suppliers.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   According to a GT after the company said, Well, wait a minute, we got it.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   Apple said, Look, these are our terms for other Apple suppliers, and you should quote, put on your big boy pants and accept the agreement.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   And by the way, we've worked with we work with a lot of Fortune 100 companies, and that's a pretty standard thing for I mean, we want to talk about Apple being that way.
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   But most agreements that we get, we have the choice of either doing work with them and signing that contract, or we're not going to work with them.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   Yeah, you know, that's that's a pretty good thing.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   What are they wearing Darth Vader suits when they negotiate?
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   No, no, they just just really mean emails about why.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   At the closing meeting, we're going to have to ask that each person bring in one tire from their car and give it to us.
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   I know we don't we don't need it as a part of the deal. We just want to make you know that we can make you do whatever you want. Right.
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   And yeah, I mean, I think that most people would be so happy to get an Apple deal that they go.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   Yeah, there's a lot of company. There's a lot of carcasses along the road that have made big deals with like these companies.
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   And this is one of them. This is a cautionary.
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   You know, we've almost been killed by big contracts, you know, and it's it is a I guess you can't expect Apple.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   I mean, should should Apple be a kinder, gentler Apple? No, no, but it's OK.
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:42.000]   You couldn't make the Sapphire. But if you're if you're a little company, but no, no, no, not at all.
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:50.000]   You're doing you're doing a deal with the devil. You're saying, all right, I'm putting the I mean, that's where Squiller really does need to put on his big boy pants and say, look, Squiller, you're the CEO.
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   He's the chief operating officer. You made this deal.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   You if you didn't think you could do it, you shouldn't have made it. And it's like going to Vegas. I'm going to I'm all in.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   Yeah. And the thing is, is that you yeah, you definitely have to accept when you when you sign these contracts.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   And the reason we're so particular about our contracts is that if you when we sign that contract, we assume that they mean everything.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   Like they'll tell you, oh, well, we're not going to ever do that. Well, they might.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   You know, you don't you're talking to one person. You don't know how it's going to turn out sometime later.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:27.000]   And so and if you think that there's a problem, you need to, you know, as a CEO, it's your job to to make the decision that we're.
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:30.000]   And we walk away from business because the contracts don't work.
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.000]   I can't I can't do that. I can't.
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   So we're just seeing the car wreck that sometimes happens when a company bites off.
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:43.000]   I mean, they're offering you half a billion dollars. And as a little company, I'm I'm I'm it's very clear why they did that.
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   Let me tell you what went wrong, because we know from the memorandum and we know the first thing we already knew was a 50 million dollar penalty if you breach confidentiality per occurrence.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:58.000]   We knew that that has been out already. This is maybe you should look twice at this, Mr.
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   Squiller. No manufacturing process can be modified by GT without Apple's prior consent, but GT must immediately implement any of Apple's suggestions.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:12.000]   That's kind of giving up your company. You're like wondering why Apple doesn't just buy you and build the stuff themselves at that point.
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   I mean, that's worse. GT must fulfill any purchase order placed by Apple on the date Apple picks or you have to buy substitute goods at your own expense.
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:26.000]   Yes. So if you don't have the sapphire of the day we want it, you better give us some.
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:30.000]   In addition, the plant was built without input from GT.
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:38.000]   That I don't understand. I mean, like this. Here's the thing is that I get that Apple pushes a hard bargain, but this was not a smart.
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   This is a really hard bargain. The plant was built, for instance, without backup power generators because Apple deemed them too expensive.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   But now remember if GT can't deliver on date and time, then you know, so if the power goes out, they're screwed.
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:59:04.000]   Apple also embedded its own employees at the Mesa plant who, quote, assumed a level of authority and, quote, had to be reminded not to order GT employees around.
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:10.000]   So you're right. They should have just bought the thing. If you're going to have that much control, you know, nobody has enough control to make it actually work.
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:18.000]   Squiller said Apple initially wanted to purchase the sapphire furnaces from GT, but ended up offering this different deal, a new structure where GT borrowed money from Apple.
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:25.000]   Remember, this isn't a gift. Borrowed money from Apple to purchase the furnace components in order to supply Apple with the sapphire crystal.
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:32.000]   Apple also prohibited GT from doing business with other manufacturers or suppliers working in consumer electronics. They have an exclusive.
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:42.000]   Squiller called Apple's tactics a classic bait and switch strategy and described the final agreement as onerous and massively one sided.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:46.000]   On the other hand, you signed the deal, Squiller. Yeah, that's exactly it.
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:58.000]   Making things worse for GT, if Apple decided not to use sapphire crystal in its upcoming products, which they in fact did, GT would be required to repay the loan fully in cash.
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   And so this is all unsealed as part of a settlement in which Apple agreed that GT could sell the furnaces and whatever they got would be sufficient to settle the debt with Apple.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:17.000]   In other words, Apple said, all right, we're not going to get all our money back. So in fact, I think Apple, you could you could make the argument that Apple did the right thing.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000]   I mean, both of them were throwing a long bomb. Both of them wanted a cutting edge technology.
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:31.000]   But, you know, GT wanted the big contract. Apple wanted to have this new thing that nobody else has. You know, and they both took a big risk and, you know, really, they should put their big boy pants on.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   Not Apple, but GT. Look, you guys made a long bet and you lost. Right. And it's there's no time.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:46.000]   This is not the time to start saying, well, it was an unfair deal. I didn't like the music, Leo. Play the Kenny Loggins music. Which one? Kenny Rogers. Kenny Rogers.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:56.000]   Oh, you got to know and hold them. But you can see how now saying all of that, you can see that the tactical thing to do is exactly what GT did, which is declare bankruptcy.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:04.000]   I mean, there was no way they're going to do anything else. And so so while, you know, while it sounds like they're complaining now, I think more of it is they're just making the legal argument that says we can't pay.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:10.000]   I think Apple could reasonably complain, saying, look, but I mean, we're getting pennies back on our investment.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   But I'm saying we can all complain. But what we're watching here is legal. This is how it happened. This is legal. You're saying that as the son of a litigator.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.000]   I'm just saying that when you're not going to be able to make all the bills, you're going to have to claim bankruptcy.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.000]   And in that you're going to say these are the things that happened and these are the things whether you were right or wrong.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:36.000]   The bottom line is you're in a position where and the only way for them to leverage themselves out of it was, you know, and it's a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which is essentially reorganization, saying to creditors, right?
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:42.000]   We've got to we can't give you all the money. Yeah, it was essentially a stock sale that was interesting before.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:54.000]   Yeah. OK. So the CEO of GT, the day before Apple's iPhone announcement, it's a day before the Apple and months before the bankruptcy announcement sold like one hundred million dollars of stock.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:00.000]   So I can't remember. Why should I look at 160,000 CEO stock sale?
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:07.000]   I think it was one hundred sixty thousand dollars of stock. He sold you're right. One hundred sixty thousand dollars in stock.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:14.000]   He said it was part of an ongoing stock dump. I've been dumping the stock for years.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:21.000]   But the fact that it was the day before the announcement and the announcement at this point he knew was not going to include sapphire screens.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   Hopefully he did. He was doing that regularly because otherwise that's a well, I'm sure if it if there's any irregularities here that the SEC will end up in jail, we'll investigate.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   Or the big fine. He says it was part of a prearranged plan that was established in March.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   Probably a lot of CEOs do that. I mean, most of CEOs of that size, a lot of CEOs will set up a payment like every month or every week or even every day.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:53.000]   You know, if you thought that the day after the Apple. Yeah, I would say the most cases you would sell after a big announcement involving your product unless you knew.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:03:01.000]   And again, a lot of a lot of CEOs will do it regularly all the time, specifically not to show any irregularities.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   We were talking about Apple's enterprise ambitions, but of course, Microsoft has some as well.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:16.000]   And I think this is no surprise. They've announced that they're going to make office for iPad and iPhone free Android to in the past.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:23.000]   You've had to have an Office 365 subscription to use office. You can always use it as a read only tool.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:29.000]   Excel Word and PowerPoint. Now you can edit with them. You can effectively use almost all of their features for free.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.000]   They also simple stuff. All the simple stuff. Yeah, you can.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.000]   Not interestingly, some of the high end enterprise stuff they did.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:51.000]   They also announced a strategic partnership with the Dropbox so that you don't just have to use one box or one drive. You can use a Dropbox to store your documents without paying Microsoft anything at all.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.000]   Is this Microsoft's way a shot across the bow to Apple? No, Apple.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:12.000]   Apple would love to think that they're a threat to anybody's office suite. This really is a way to blunt Google Docs because remember that there I think there are two advantages to having like students and early professionals using your product.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:17.000]   One is that if you can get them to buy it for ninety nine dollars, OK, this ninety nine bucks you didn't have.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:23.000]   But you really want is for them to really learn how to use this product and for them for that to be the tool that they want to use for the rest of their careers.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:36.000]   And I think that I think that Microsoft is a little bit more concerned that with more people who are using Google Docs that makes it a lot easier for the next generation of IT people in the next generation of people who are setting up the infrastructure for a company to say, you know what?
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.000]   We're going to standardize on Google Docs and not on Microsoft Office.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:47.000]   And given that they give the amount of money they make off of enterprise versus the amount of money they make off of students and off of off of just casual users.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:59.000]   This is just like easy money. It seemed like an easy decision to say let's give up a small amount of money with the idea that is going to pay off big time long term by making our entire ecosystem a lot more valuable.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:08.000]   As we start getting new people into the company, it is far more likely that they're going to know Google Docs at this point than than Microsoft or pages.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:13.000]   You know, we have to usually make them make them use numbers. Does anybody use pages? Yeah.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:19.000]   There is no bigger fan in any group of people than of Apple than me.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:25.000]   The only Apple I work doc app that I use is keynote. Yeah, keynote is awesome.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:30.000]   And yeah, because and you use it specifically as an antidote to PowerPoint.
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:41.000]   Yeah. But the thing about the the complication there is that I've been trying to use less of the flashier features as it seems as though the more content I actually have, the less I need to say.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:46.000]   What if I do a magic move to have these this tech swap positions and then more from one picture to another?
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.000]   It would not be that difficult for me to switch to PowerPoint.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:56.000]   And if I worked in an office where I had to collaborate with other people and they said, oh, it's OK if you want to develop something in keynote.
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000]   But at some point you're going to have to convert this to PowerPoint.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:03.000]   I would gripe for maybe 20 minutes, but I don't think I'd have a big trouble making that position that transition.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:09.000]   We work in a lot of where we're either running presentations for folks in big halls or we're working with people.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:19.000]   And pretty much the thing that you see in every professional, like, you know, high end presentation company, you know, that's doing the PowerPoint type stuff is keynote.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:33.000]   I mean, you know, everybody like if they're really doing a presentation and they're serious about it, the next step after keynote for most presentation companies, most like corporate presentation companies is what's called a spider or an encore system, which is an eighty thousand dollar piece of hardware.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:55.000]   So but but before that, they're using, you know, that when you get used to really pushing keynote, I think that when you go back to PowerPoint, then definitely whatever that thing is that the presentation thing that Google does, you know, they're just very rough compared to, you know, as far as the speed at which you can put things together and how quickly you can put something together that looks nice.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000]   You know, I think keynote is definitely the best thing that they have.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:12.000]   I think that numbers. So numbers is not actually good at heavy duty spreadsheets, but when it comes to organizing stuff, doing basic budgets, that kind of thing, I'd much rather I can much. It's just much faster, I think, than than and I worked in Excel for a long time and I don't use the Google one at all.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:18.000]   I mean, I do like, we save it out to it like at the last step to hand it off to a client, but it's horrible.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:25.000]   I cut and paste into Google Docs a lot, but I use keynote and numbers. I don't use pages. I use BB mostly, but I'll cut and paste into Google Docs when I have to.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:35.000]   And we're in Google Docs every day. I mean, the presentation, you know, the, the, the, I don't even know how we could run our business without it at this point, you know, without without Google Docs. So it's just certain apps that I don't like.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:39.000]   So, Microsoft isn't really threatened then by the alternatives. This is just.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:49.000]   Well, I think they're definitely threatened by Google. I mean, except Google. Yeah, I think they understand that you need to have a really superlative free product. Yeah. And so I thought I think this was an easy decision for them to make.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:59.000]   I think it's not just Google. I think there's so many smaller apps now. If you look at iOS as AI writer and rightly, there's just tons of apps that can do basic presentations. It can do basic writing and it's not.
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:04.000]   It's the sum of all those things. And I use this analogy before and it's terrible, but I still think it's apt.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:12.000]   Like if you're in a mixed martial arts fight and you're being overwhelmed, you can just cover up and try and weather it or you can cover up and drop down and try to take the person down and change the fight.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:23.000]   And it's not clear which one Microsoft is doing, but they're definitely sort of reacting to the market and covering up a little bit. This is Microsoft is a company that Bill Gates stood up there and proudly says we, you know, you're stealing my software.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:30.000]   They made their billions selling software and now they're giving away office for free. And that is enormous. See change. I agree.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:42.000]   But they're not giving away office for free. They're giving away a mobile version of office that doesn't have the full fighting power of this fully armed and operational battle station. Notice Microsoft office.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:47.000]   But it would be different if they had as much as Google Docs does, doesn't it?
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:57.000]   I would say it's certainly competitive with it's certainly competitive with Google Docs. I think you're not going to give away more or maybe not much more at capability anyway than the competitor.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:08.000]   I think that I think that what what this must say is that they've looked at how availability of Microsoft Office for iOS has affected upticks of Office 365 subscriptions.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:13.000]   They figured out that people are not subscribing to Office 365 specifically to get this product.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:25.000]   So therefore we may as well use this to our advantage differently. I guess Renee says I'll hijack your analogy to change the fight that we will now use this as a promotional thing to to enhance the value of office 365.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.000]   The thing that we really, really do want to sell on other platforms.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:36.000]   But it does get put people's minds that office is free. I guess not always free. It's not free on the desktop. It's not free enterprise. But it does start putting that idea out there.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:43.000]   And as someone who wants to pay money to get great mobile software, it's just one more arrow in the heart of paid mobile software.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:10:05.000]   But that ship already sailed on. Apple already torpedoed third party development of really good productivity software by giving away iWork for free. They also kind of cut off the legs of that beast by making it really, really difficult to do a superlative text editor with actual inline editing and stuff like that if you're not an Apple brand word processor.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:10.000]   So I feel I feel so that ship had already sailed. I don't think it's as significant as it might be on other platforms.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:23.000]   Google Drive, not to be left behind, is off letting you open and save files using other apps, gets touch ID and video downloading. Big upgrades for Google Drive as well. I think this is a great battle for consumers.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:37.000]   And it's heating up. I mean, I think all of these companies are spending. I mean, I think Apple, Microsoft, and we're seeing behind the scenes, we're seeing this huge push on all three for all three companies to go after this market.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:49.000]   And so it's they're all fighting. This is definitely not anything that they're just kind of doodling with it. None of these are hobbies for any of these companies as a sanity check. Are they all making software for iOS now? And none of them are making software for Windows.
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:55.000]   Isn't that funny? This year, Microsoft, but you can't get Microsoft Office on Windows.
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:24.000]   Google, Google, Google just has some sort of thing against Microsoft. It's not even a thing where they vote. Does this make sense for us month to month? It is they have taken the stand that it does not make it. We are never we're not going to support Windows Phone when they don't have like their two most important products available for products that would be very, very simple to adapt to Windows Phone. It's like, yeah, they've got something. There's there's something here on some whiteboard that says this is the third world. Do not even do not even talk to Sergey about Sergey about this.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:41.000]   Microsoft burned his daddy's farm to the ground when he was a little kid. And now this is why he's talks justice by night as a caped crusader. Yeah, it's kind of it's interesting because they is one of the things that keeps me off Windows Phone because I'm so invested in the Google universe that the lack of Google apps kills me.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:56.000]   YouTube YouTube was that was the bellwether if they and the fight that Microsoft and Google had over the YouTube app. YouTube got mad at Microsoft because they allowed you to download videos from YouTube and Microsoft said, are well you do it and Google said, well, no.
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:14.000]   And then finally, really the YouTube app on Windows Phone, which I think Microsoft created is basically the web page. Right. Yeah. And Google has never done a YouTube app. I mean, you don't do a YouTube app on a phone. You're pretty much saying we there's something going on there. We don't like you has a YouTube app now. I know.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:43.000]   Well, but I also I mean, I think that the you know, Microsoft right now is 1% to have the market. So it's it's a but they're paid by eyeball. That's 1% of the eyeballs. They're just given away. Yeah, I think I think Google can. Yeah, you could say that for a lot of companies. Okay, we're not going to do a Windows Phone version. Google has enough engineers. They can do a Windows Phone. They could but it's 1% is with a company that has been not following the rules. You think it's a purely economic decision. I think it's more than that. I think it's a combination. Yeah, they're struggling families.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:13:12.760]   Yeah, you know, if Microsoft was 50% they might do it exactly. They would definitely do it at 15 or 20% at 1% exactly at 1% of the market. They need it's Microsoft doesn't have the leverage. They need to be nice. Right. You know, that's then that's what they didn't quite. I think I think you're right. But let's also acknowledge the fact that when it when one of their own comes up with this idea of what if we had independently flying hot air balloons that simply fly over the landscape and provide free Wi Fi. Yes, they got they got money to build those.
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:15.680]   No, it's not that they don't have the money but Microsoft doesn't have any leverage.
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:30.720]   But when it comes to when it comes down to we could extend the usefulness of Google Apps and services to Windows Phone doesn't matter. That's not that we're talking about a few million users as opposed to hundreds of millions of users. They don't have time or priority for that. I think that's a significant data point.
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:14:00.600]   That's all I'm saying. But I think that it's it's it's it's not that they don't have the economic that they would make more money with it. It's just that Microsoft doesn't have any leverage. I'm saying I'm saying that Google has the ability to pursue any project they want to do. They have the time, they have the money, they have the resources. I think the most important thing is they just do not have the interest in supporting Windows Phone, not even the time that they had. I wonder if I wonder if someone said I want to make this my I want to make this my my my my personal project. You know, you say you let me take time off to do any project.
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:05.520]   I want to port YouTube to Windows Phone. I wonder what kind of meetings there would be as a result of that.
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:22.840]   But I think Microsoft part of this was is that Microsoft decided they wanted theirs to do all a bunch of things that that that Google doesn't want it to do. And so the thing is, is that Microsoft obviously didn't read the you know, art of war, which has never fight a battle uphill. You know, you know, you know, you wait until you're up in the top of the hill before you start fighting those battles and they just fought
[01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:51.920]   through the wind. You can lead a pundit to surface but you can't make them click. CNN made made a deal with Microsoft to use surface tablets for its midterm election coverage. But at least for some of the pundits, they really merely were used as an iPad stand. Here's one pundit thanks to Adam UCF who got this grab. She looks happy. That's because she's not using a surface. She's using an iPad. Here's another analyst.
[01:14:52.360 --> 01:15:09.240]   I'm talking about you're talking about people on a live on a live broadcast in front of millions of people and asking them to learn how to learn how to do something new. That was nuts. And Microsoft got the same problem on the NFL where they kept on handing people. They kept on handing all these coaches, you know, all of their their tablets and the coaches still want to just use their iPads.
[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:09.600]   Right.
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:12.880]   It's not it's not smart.
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:32.800]   What you paid what Microsoft paid for was exactly what it got, which was a bunch of surfaces lined up on the table. Right. What happens behind the surface stays behind the surface. And I think I feel like anything that they thought that they were going to buy into this got lost with these behind the scenes photos. Well, now for the Apple, the Apple fanboys, we all knew but I don't think anybody else. Right.
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:16:02.240]   What do you know most of America thought they were using it is all of America. What are they using? Right. I think I think more to the point most of the most of the people who are not like in the fan community were saying, well, of course, I mean, I often have a computer in front of me and a phone in front of me as well. This is how I do things. It's only like the those of us in the bank. Oh, oh, total fail losers. You see, they couldn't make them make that use the records off surface. Woo. It's like, but what do you mean talk about? I'm doing a podcast. I've got two computers in front of me right now. And one of them is not one of them is not my MacBook.
[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:10.940]   What is it a fail for my MacBook that I happen to have an Android device next to me right now to do to keep up on something else. Right. No, it's exactly the case.
[01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:25.360]   We're very small, petty people. It's not good. It doesn't look natural the way they're doing it. It would be good to have someone who's good at doing sort of set decoration going in there. Right. It was judiciously placing surfaces so you can see them. But they're not obnoxiously in your face.
[01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:50.880]   I think they should have put a logo on them because they I mean, I don't I think the only people who knew those are surfaces are the same people who would note that the people are using iPads behind. Yeah. The other difficulty is that they should have if they were really being smart about this, they would have made them different colors. They would have put cases on some of them. They really look like the set designer broke out a box of these that were shipped from Microsoft and put them out there like place settings. Yep. Without much commitment to the whole.
[01:16:50.920 --> 01:17:15.200]   And it's funny on CBS, they always use these Microsoft computers that I've never seen. They have like windows in the back instead of the Mac logo and they shine through them. There has never been a Microsoft or Windows computer with the Windows logo where the Apple logo is on Apple computers. But that's what you'll see almost always on TV. And that's why because then you know what it is otherwise. And you can always tell if you see one that looks exactly like a Mac, but it's perfectly silver. You're like somebody didn't pay for that. Yeah.
[01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:30.040]   Or there's a Windows logo over it. I wonder why the Big Bang Theory, Raj has put a round sticker exactly on the cutout portion of the Apple logo. So it's still an Apple logo, but you can't see the little leaf on it. I wonder why he decided to put it exactly there.
[01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:31.720]   Raj wants to get paid.
[01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:34.920]   Same thing happened in the NFL.
[01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:42.960]   Finally Fitbit has been dropped from the Apple online store. Another indicator that Apple may someday release a watch.
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:46.000]   Crazy. That's never gonna happen.
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:46.600]   Oh wait.
[01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:54.760]   They kept all the other fitness bands though. I mean that's why I wish these people would look into these stories more. I mean if it was just because they had a band they could drop Java and they could drop everyone else.
[01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:59.120]   Here's why. Fitbit has already said it has no plans to integrate with HealthKit.
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:17:59.960]   There you go.
[01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:02.320]   Fitbit has its own software, which is quite good.
[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:09.760]   Yeah. And it makes perfect sense because Apple doesn't want these customers coming back and saying, "Hey, I can't make this work with the health app on my iPhone."
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:10.040]   Right.
[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:20.000]   So yeah, it's easy to think that they're trying to be strategic here, but in fact it's like how much stress do we want to invite into our lives and how can we avoid it?
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.880]   Yeah. Both the Jawbone Up and the new Up24 support HealthKit.
[01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:26.440]   Nike FuelBand does.
[01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:30.960]   WhyThings. I use WhyThings stuff. They're HealthKit compatible as well.
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:38.760]   In fact, WhyThings tweeted, "We believe your data is your own and that you can do what you want with it. Welcome to the free world. Enjoy #HealthKit."
[01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:45.520]   Which is a little hard to understand, but I think with some explanation it makes sense.
[01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:48.880]   So yeah, I think that's probably why it doesn't work with HealthKit.
[01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:49.920]   Well, we're not going to carry it.
[01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:52.520]   They don't have to carry everything.
[01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:53.840]   You know, Walmart doesn't carry everything.
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:56.080]   It's the store's decision.
[01:18:56.080 --> 01:19:08.680]   Right. Fitbit CEO said, "As the number one selling connected device with 69% year to date market share, Fitbit is sold in 46 countries, 37,000 retail stores, blah, blah, blah.
[01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:11.080]   You can always go to Amazon to get it."
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:12.640]   I like Fitbits.
[01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:18.840]   I'm actually very interested in the Jawbone Up, but I'm not buying anything new until I see the iWatch, the Apple Watch.
[01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:19.880]   Which is why they announced it.
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:21.600]   Way ahead of time.
[01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:22.320]   Way ahead of time.
[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:25.120]   Let's take a break then we'll come back with your picks of the week.
[01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:25.800]   Are you ready, gentlemen?
[01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:26.480]   Ready.
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:31.320]   Our show today brought to you by Personal Capital.
[01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:33.760]   Personal Capital is such a great choice.
[01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:39.920]   I am sure, you know, when the Android Wear came out, Personal Capital immediately made its software available on the Android Wear.
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:43.000]   I would be shocked if they don't do exactly the same with the Apple Watch.
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:44.600]   What is Personal Capital?
[01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:51.480]   It is a great place to go to find out what's going on with your money, to plan for your future, your investments.
[01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:53.520]   Personal Capital is free.
[01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:54.480]   It's secure.
[01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:57.680]   It'll just take you a minute to get in your accounts and your assets.
[01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:02.760]   You'll see them on a single screen on your computer, your phone, your tablet, real time intuitive graphs.
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:09.440]   It'll tell you what you're overpaying in fees, how to reduce those fees, how to rebalance your 401k.
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:11.120]   If you don't know what that means, you need it.
[01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:15.600]   You can even get tailored advice on optimizing your investment.
[01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:16.760]   Personal Capital.
[01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:19.720]   Bring Wall Street to your street.
[01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:21.280]   It'll just take a minute.
[01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:24.240]   And as I said, absolutely free.
[01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:26.040]   I've been using it for two years now.
[01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:28.680]   I'm very glad you could do budgeting with it and lots of stuff.
[01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:35.600]   But really the main focus, I think, at least for me, I guess because I'm getting on, is planning for your future so that you have enough money to retire on.
[01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:43.440]   If you're waiting, if you're hoping that the government will give, I can almost, can't even say this with a straight face, will take care of you in your old age.
[01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:44.680]   You better get Personal Capital.
[01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:48.520]   Personal Capital dot com slash Mac break.
[01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:50.040]   Make better investment decisions.
[01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:52.680]   Free, secure, easy.
[01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:55.240]   Personal Capital dot com slash Mac break.
[01:20:55.240 --> 01:20:56.840]   Time for our picks of the week.
[01:20:56.840 --> 01:20:59.560]   Let's try Renee Richie, your pick today.
[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:06.000]   My pick is TapBots makes these cute little apps for, I call them cute as maybe doing them to service, but they are cute.
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.960]   So they make TweetBot most famously for iOS.
[01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:09.800]   Love it. Must use.
[01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:14.120]   And they use, they made Calcbot for iOS for a while.
[01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:18.440]   They haven't, they haven't done much work on it lately, but they have just released Calcbot for the Mac.
[01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:23.040]   It's just as you'd imagine a TapBots app would be.
[01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:25.320]   It's got great sound, great animation.
[01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:26.760]   It's very simple.
[01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:32.320]   It does just calculations and currency conversions, but it does it very, very well.
[01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:33.840]   It has some interesting concepts.
[01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:38.800]   For example, instead of memory, it has favoriting and cause everyone's used to social networks now and favoriting things.
[01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:42.280]   So you can favorite results of your calculations or roles of your conversions.
[01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:43.560]   And it just sits there.
[01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:47.800]   It's not a widget because they don't believe that widget space is a good place to put a calculator even on the Mac.
[01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:52.000]   So it is an actual full OS 10 application, but it's small.
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:52.640]   It's compact.
[01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:55.040]   You can hide the, the tape.
[01:21:55.040 --> 01:22:00.360]   You can turn it into a scientific calculator and it just, it sort of sits there and just does its job when you want it to.
[01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:02.960]   And it does it very, very elegantly and very well.
[01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:06.920]   You can also see, and I, this is to me very useful.
[01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:09.920]   You could see the whole expression that generated the number.
[01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:16.440]   Cause you know, when you're entering a long list of numbers, even just adding them, did I get that one to be able to see the whole process?
[01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:21.000]   And then the result is really, I think hard to believe, but that's really useful.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.440]   Why should you pay five bucks for a calculator when you already got one?
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:24.360]   That's why.
[01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:26.440]   Because it's a, it's a good experience.
[01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:28.000]   And you know, that comes up over and over again.
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:31.640]   It's the same reason I pay for Tweetbot because I'm sitting there eight hours a day using it every day.
[01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:34.400]   And it's, it's fractions of a penny.
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:35.800]   And I was on the beta test for this.
[01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:36.920]   I've been using it for a while.
[01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:43.280]   Uh, it's just a really, if you don't need one of those really fancy full blown RPN or something calculators, this will suit you very, very well.
[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:43.520]   Yeah.
[01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:47.560]   PCALC would be the one if you need RPN or you need scientific PCALC is a great choice.
[01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:50.840]   So you get two choices, Calcbot or PCALC.
[01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:53.440]   And some people like the Solver, which does it really differently.
[01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:55.040]   They try to read and it's not really a calculator.
[01:22:55.040 --> 01:23:01.680]   It does it sort of like a, because some people don't believe that you should take a Cal like a regular calculator and just extrapolate that digital native.
[01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:02.440]   Yeah.
[01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:05.560]   So Solver does it differently if you're looking for something totally, totally different.
[01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:08.680]   That's spelled S O L S O U L V E R.
[01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:09.720]   Like Solver.
[01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:11.800]   Solver.
[01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:12.480]   Yeah.
[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:13.400]   Yeah.
[01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:15.000]   I bought that that that's expensive though.
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:18.680]   It's like 12 bucks, but it, it does kind of make more sense.
[01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:21.840]   It's like a notebook where you would write your calculations.
[01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:22.880]   Yeah.
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:24.680]   It's almost like we're processing your calculation.
[01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:25.240]   Yeah.
[01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:25.960]   Yeah.
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:28.120]   It does make sense because we don't need, we don't have buttons.
[01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:29.560]   It's a screen.
[01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:30.480]   Yeah.
[01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:32.120]   Alex Lindsay, your pick.
[01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:33.680]   I have one pick and one unpick.
[01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:35.000]   Okay.
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:38.600]   So my first pick is, is a Wirecast 6.0 just came out.
[01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:39.840]   A lot of great new features.
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:46.640]   If you haven't used Wirecast, it's pretty much the, in my opinion, like we do a lot of live streaming and there is, and this is for live streaming.
[01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:51.640]   And if you're a corporate education, that type of thing, this is really a great, a great tool for you.
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:55.920]   There's really like, you can start with a hangout on air and do a, do a live stream pretty easily.
[01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:57.760]   After that, you start moving to Wirecast.
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:02.000]   This gives you the ability to playback videos, do lower thirds.
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.720]   Now they've added social media feeds.
[01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:08.440]   So you can literally be pulling in tweets, you know, into your little, into your show that you're putting together.
[01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:09.240]   That's weird.
[01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:10.040]   Really?
[01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:10.320]   Yeah.
[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:10.400]   Yeah.
[01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:13.720]   Which is a big part of like when you're doing live shows, like, Hey, use this hashtag.
[01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:17.360]   Well, you can now be searching that hashtag and then putting it into the, you know, directly into it.
[01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:19.000]   It's now 64 bit.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.160]   It's and it's just a great, it's that next step up.
[01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:26.880]   Um, you know, 995 for the pro version, 495 for the, for the base version.
[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:31.880]   And so it's, it's not, you know, it's not a $50 app or $10 app, but it does a lot of stuff.
[01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:33.320]   And this is where, this is where we started.
[01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:38.320]   I mean, this is really, we did, we've, and we still do, um, some of this is what I use at home.
[01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:41.000]   So like I have elementals that we use for a lot of our big stuff.
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:52.120]   Um, but what I use when I'm doing my own personal, you know, little live streams, ask Alex's and all the other stuff is actually, um, is actually Wirecast because it's just got a whole bunch of things.
[01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:55.680]   That I can do on my own, um, really quickly, cause I can edit between shots.
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:57.720]   You can, the one thing is it's kind of virtual.
[01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:05.880]   You can actually, um, if you can get four, four cameras into your Mac through a, you know, a breakout box or whatever, you got four cameras, you can get eight in it'll see eight.
[01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:11.040]   Um, yeah, I mean, it'll just, so you can do a lot of like a TriCaster in software really.
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:11.800]   It can be.
[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:12.000]   Yeah.
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:12.600]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:13.520]   It's not as dedicated.
[01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:17.440]   I mean, cause you're using a typically a computer that you're doing a lot of other things with.
[01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:20.720]   It doesn't have a control surface the way that the, that, that the TriCaster has.
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:22.600]   For, for beginning video podcast.
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:23.040]   Absolutely.
[01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:32.280]   I think that, you know, when you're, when you're, when you want more than the HOA and you want to start adding a lot of stuff and, and, and, and adding your lower thirds and your graphics, playback bugs.
[01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:38.680]   Um, you can do, you can do like the picture in picture where you have one picture that's kind of turned in 3d and another picture down below.
[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:44.400]   And you can use your iPhone or your iPad as a source over wifi, over wifi.
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:49.080]   That is why I think this is how I'm going to do my show when I retire.
[01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:51.440]   It's a great little, it's out of my house.
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:51.560]   Yeah.
[01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:56.800]   It's a, it's a really, really great, um, you know, um, uh, really great application.
[01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:58.360]   Not cheap 500 bucks.
[01:25:58.360 --> 01:25:58.680]   Yeah.
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:02.160]   Or, or a thousand and, um, or more or more of you.
[01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:04.760]   If you really want to, you know, $495.
[01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:05.200]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:05.960]   The pro version.
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:11.800]   Um, so, uh, so anyway, but that it's, you know, if you're, if you're thinking about how do I go next, I highly recommend it.
[01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:15.160]   And, and, um, then the next step after that is looking at a TriCaster.
[01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:19.760]   And then after that, it's like, you know, elementary, elementary and big stuff.
[01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:23.440]   But, but the, um, black magic has some switchers that are probably pretty affordable.
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:24.520]   I got a couple of those.
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:28.160]   Well, but black magic has the switcher, but you're still going to have to stream it with something.
[01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:28.400]   Right.
[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:31.120]   You know, so the thing is streaming and it does the graphics.
[01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:37.320]   So like, if you want to play back a video or do a replay or do all those other things that, you know, those are things that the black magic won't do.
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:47.680]   Are there any like solo video podcasters like just sitting in their house using this kind of thing and doing like amazing shows out of their basement?
[01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:49.960]   We used it for our stuff for a long time.
[01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:54.360]   The only reason we stopped is because whenever it crashed, we lost the video, which is hard.
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:57.800]   Which now I think they, they, because you were using it to record it as well.
[01:26:57.800 --> 01:26:58.760]   Yes.
[01:26:58.760 --> 01:26:59.280]   Right.
[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:01.400]   $495.
[01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:01.800]   Sorry.
[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:03.360]   $4.95.
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:05.560]   It's a two thirds of an Alex.
[01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:06.040]   Exactly.
[01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:06.600]   Exactly.
[01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:12.800]   So, um, also nine 95, $995 for the pro version, but then there's the add-ins that can add up as well.
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:13.960]   I mean, you could spend a lot of money.
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:19.880]   And when you think about like a Teradeck cube, being able to see it in Wirecast means that you can put it, you can have it anywhere on your corporate network.
[01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:25.480]   Cause you know, going back to the receiver or not even going to see where you have a transmitter and it will see that, that feed.
[01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:29.080]   Um, so there's a lot of brush would use, has always used wirecast.
[01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:30.880]   Is it, is it, or does he, I thought he used vid blaster.
[01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:31.680]   No, he uses vid blaster.
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:32.200]   Vid blaster.
[01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:32.440]   Yeah.
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:33.360]   Brian brush would use it.
[01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:34.320]   But we, what do we use?
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:37.760]   Cause we also use the software on top of what we're doing.
[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:38.600]   Is it Wirecast?
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:41.120]   Before we had the elemental, we were streaming with wirecast.
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:43.360]   Now we're doing, uh, now we're doing it with the hardware.
[01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:44.080]   Yeah.
[01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:44.480]   All right.
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:46.200]   I see crane cam.
[01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:46.480]   Thank you.
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:46.880]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:48.080]   You had a dis recommendation.
[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:51.560]   I'm getting rid of my six plus your phone, the giant phone.
[01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:52.200]   You don't like it.
[01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:53.960]   No, I can't, I can't deal with it.
[01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:56.120]   So I'm just letting people keep on asking me what I got.
[01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:57.040]   So what'd you get instead?
[01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:58.080]   I'm going to get the six.
[01:27:58.080 --> 01:27:58.760]   I'm going to get the six.
[01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:01.600]   So I can't, I, the problem is that it doesn't fit in my pockets.
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:02.640]   It's not that for me.
[01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:05.400]   It's that there's not enough that takes advantage of the real estate.
[01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:10.280]   And I just feel like I, I love, I love my workout to have a bigger screen when I'm watching little movies or whatever.
[01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:13.920]   But at the same time, I was just like, I'd rather just go back to my iPad mini and go back to the six.
[01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:18.000]   The six plus is just what happened was it was changing my behavior because it wasn't fitting my, some of my pockets.
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:21.040]   So I was putting in my outer pocket and then I wasn't getting calls because it never rings.
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:24.400]   And, um, let me, cause I don't let my phones ring cause I'm on air all the time.
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:26.800]   And so, um, you weren't feeling the vibe.
[01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:32.040]   Um, what I was not feeling the vibe because it was in the wrong pocket.
[01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:34.080]   I'm not feeling the vibe, dude.
[01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:34.400]   Yeah.
[01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:38.280]   So, so if someone asks, you know, people have been asking them, I'm going back to six.
[01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:40.240]   I'm going to go, I'm going to get a six and figure out what to do.
[01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:40.680]   Interesting.
[01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:41.400]   Someone else in the company.
[01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:45.480]   Renee, are more apps now taking advantage of the real estate or is it just big?
[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:48.080]   It's a two pronged problem.
[01:28:48.080 --> 01:29:03.120]   And I still don't understand fully why, but the more, the smaller, more independent apps are updating much faster and they're doing the split view controllers and they're doing the, the, uh, the special views, the large apps, the apps that you think that from the big companies, they're not, uh, adding that stuff at all very quickly.
[01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:07.120]   So then it's just, to me, it looks like you don't get more real estate.
[01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:09.400]   You just get a bigger things.
[01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:14.720]   You get a bigger, yeah, you get more accessible apps, which to me is not the reason for a big screen.
[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:16.920]   I want to get more stuff on that screen.
[01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:17.240]   Right.
[01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:21.160]   And the other problem is that Apple doesn't let developers individually target specific devices.
[01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:22.920]   So they want to do something completely outlandish.
[01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:29.720]   Like, for example, I would love to see paper by 53 on the iPhone six plus, but they can't not do it for the other iPhones then.
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:34.760]   So, I mean, it's, it's a little bit of a, yeah, there's, there's some policy and some problems there.
[01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:36.240]   Any, okay.
[01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:43.320]   So a dis recommendation, we've gone back to the iPhone six and a recommendation, tell us streams wirecast six point out now out.
[01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:48.280]   Now let's go over to crane cam 3000, the future of video podcasting.
[01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:49.320]   Thank you very much.
[01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:50.600]   Actually have two recommendations.
[01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:54.960]   Uh, for, for a second there, I thought that Renee was going to scoop my calculator recommendation.
[01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:58.920]   My recommendation is the Craig four 54, a digital calculator.
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:01.640]   They've stuck with the button metaphor.
[01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:02.160]   I see.
[01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:14.600]   It's a, it's a, it's a little bit, you know, really, really, but, but the, the, it is sort of a fake leather sort of a tough year, but it's got four functions, count them one, two, three, four and floating point arithmetic.
[01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:25.320]   Uh, and also it can take notes so long as the note you want him to take is the word boobies or shell oil or anything else that can be done by holding the display upside down.
[01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:31.520]   So the little bit hard to come by there, you know, also it's a bit of a handful.
[01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:40.080]   Uh, so, you know, if you don't like the six plus, you're probably not going to be, but, you know, if the six plus came with like a carrying strap, you know, maybe, you know, it'd be a little bit more useful.
[01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:47.760]   Uh, it's also hysterically funny because there's actually a metal plate on the back of it that explains like how to use all of the registers.
[01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:50.000]   That's what you want.
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:55.560]   And this is the sort of thing that I happened to have in a, in, on a shelf in the office somewhere.
[01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:57.520]   Got the manual built in.
[01:30:57.520 --> 01:30:58.360]   Exactly.
[01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:05.760]   Um, so here's, but here's the, here's the actual pick of the week, uh, which is Logitech's, uh, keys to go ultra portable standalone keyboard.
[01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:10.960]   I really have been doing like deep dive into pretty much every kind of keyboard that you can get out there.
[01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:20.440]   Uh, and this is, I, I'm starting to get attracted to the ones that just have one really interesting and useful, uh, uh, ability about it.
[01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:31.120]   And the thing about this is that you think that it's a chiclet keyboard, but what it is is it's a ultra ultra ultra thin mechanical keyboard that's covered in like its own rubberized skin.
[01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:34.920]   So you could like conceivably, you know, like spill seltzer all over it.
[01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:36.320]   No, like that.
[01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:38.960]   And, you know, it's like a Ronco ad.
[01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:39.920]   Exactly.
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:41.360]   And unfortunately, I can't believe he's doing that.
[01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:42.400]   How much do we pay for it now?
[01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:42.600]   Yeah.
[01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:50.640]   And because, and because you drink it from the cable, the keyboard, drinking for the keyboard of a $500 a night, uh, Bluetooth.
[01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:50.960]   Device.
[01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:54.400]   Um, so that's, that's not going to create any problems for you whatsoever.
[01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:56.320]   Uh, can you eat sushi off of it?
[01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:57.320]   Exactly.
[01:31:57.320 --> 01:32:03.440]   Well, it's also, you see there, there's just like Alton Brown says, you want to get things that could be like multitaskers.
[01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:10.280]   And so this will not only like be the keyboard you travel with, but like you're in the hotel room, like you need something to set your drink down.
[01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:12.040]   So it doesn't create like a ring on whatever.
[01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:14.520]   This will also work as a work as a coaster.
[01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:17.800]   Uh, but, and when I just wipe it off on my, there you go.
[01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:19.440]   I fortunately I wore a flannel shirt.
[01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:26.480]   So now I, but it, but it is, but the, the idea is that it's super, super thin.
[01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:28.800]   The battery lasts for like months on a single charge.
[01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:32.640]   It has all the function keys for a iPad and iOS sort of stuff.
[01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:39.080]   And it's so thin and it's so like flexible that you wouldn't necessarily attach it to like an iPad.
[01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:46.120]   But if you wanted to carry it around, like in a, like under your arm, you can easily put it inside here, close the cover over it.
[01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:53.440]   And you have like one nice little compact package. I'm not sure if that's the ideal way to carry this around.
[01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:59.840]   If you're kind of worried about, you know, if you, if you're over stuffing a bag, I don't think you'd want this crushing into the screen.
[01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:03.640]   But as one like little compact thing to carry around, this works just fine.
[01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:07.400]   Uh, plus remember you have that easel stand here, so you don't have to worry about propping it up on anything.
[01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:15.920]   Uh, it's not too expensive, but we talk a lot about this sort of stuff as relevant to like iPads, but let's also not forget that we also,
[01:33:15.960 --> 01:33:18.320]   you also have the Apple TV that could use Bluetooth.
[01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:23.080]   You have other, you have, you might have even your Mac mini some places being used as a server.
[01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:25.240]   You want something that you can have in the living room.
[01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:30.880]   It doesn't, doesn't matter if you're, if you're eating pizza and you just need to like do a search for YouTube to find something you want.
[01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:32.960]   And you've got like pizza sauce, like all over this thing.
[01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:33.360]   That's okay.
[01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:34.320]   It just hose it down.
[01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:35.160]   It'll work just fine.
[01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:40.320]   Uh, so it's, is it the absolutely the greatest mobile keyboard in the world?
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:42.400]   Uh, I certainly wouldn't be using it.
[01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:55.560]   I certainly wouldn't be recommending it as the keyboard you should get, uh, if you're looking, if you need to travel a lot and do a lot of writing on your phone or on your, uh, or on your iPad, because the keyboard is certainly very useful, but you can't get the full, your full speed out of it.
[01:33:55.560 --> 01:34:05.320]   But as something that you need to be able to kick around, you need something, let's say you need something that can be, uh, uh, damaged that can get greased up and, and, and wet and all that sort of stuff.
[01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:11.160]   Not only that, but you want to have some, you want to always have a keyboard inside your laptop bag or inside your accessory bag.
[01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:14.560]   Uh, this is a good thing to toss in there because it's just going to stay there forever.
[01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:17.520]   And it's, it's perfectly useful for the, for its intended use.
[01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:24.160]   Uh, it's 70 bucks, which is not a whole lot of money to spend on a keyboard like that and available in an array of fashionable colors.
[01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:25.920]   You guys are always so expensive for me.
[01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:27.520]   This looks good.
[01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:31.040]   I have no use for it, but I'm going to buy it anyway, because I can eat sushi off of it.
[01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:31.480]   Exactly.
[01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:33.520]   You guys live like frat brothers.
[01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:35.600]   You still got pizza and sushi on your coffee table.
[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:37.160]   We're living the dream.
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:46.520]   Seltzer party and I got a third of a tub of hummus dip that I'm going to get into right after this show.
[01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:49.200]   Uh, do you want to do your other pick?
[01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:51.760]   The, uh, the, they might be giants fan club.
[01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:53.400]   Yeah, I want to make this quick.
[01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:56.000]   If you're, I, I, I, I'm a, they might be giants fan.
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:09.880]   I love the way for 98 bucks for next year, you get to join the instant fan club, but I want you to enjoy the experience of like the, the, the, the, the, it's just like, it is just like a really good infomercial because you scroll down and you see, you start seeing for
[01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:12.000]   98 bucks, you get, okay, 52 songs.
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:13.960]   They're going to release a song every single week.
[01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:14.680]   Well, that's interesting.
[01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:15.080]   That'd be cool.
[01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:16.280]   Like every Tuesday I get a song.
[01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:16.960]   Let's keep scrolling.
[01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:19.280]   Oh, and two tickets to an upcoming concert.
[01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:19.960]   Well, that's good.
[01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:20.720]   Cause I would like to see it.
[01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:21.960]   And a CD.
[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:22.280]   Wow.
[01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:23.000]   I'd like to get that.
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:24.000]   Oh, and another CD.
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:25.280]   Oh, and a third CD.
[01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:25.680]   Yeah.
[01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:25.920]   You know what?
[01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:27.080]   I really think I should buy this.
[01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:29.960]   Oh, and I get a t-shirt and I also get a DVD of a car.
[01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:35.320]   Oh, and I get free airplanes and you know, somewhere, somewhere like one third of the way through this.
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:37.920]   It's like, I think I want to spend $98.
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:41.720]   This seems like a very, very attractive package of things to get for $98.
[01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:46.840]   And if you keep on going, you can get it on vinyl, a flood on vinyl.
[01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:49.520]   You can even spend less money for only $40.
[01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:51.560]   I think you can get just the song a week.
[01:35:51.560 --> 01:36:02.920]   Uh, this is, you know, it's great when you feel as though your lifelong fandom of a band is repaid in the form of that band continuing to be awesome in brand new ways as you age alongside with them.
[01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:12.360]   So they, they, they, they, they're not the sort of band that would say, you know what, we're going to try to make you buy a $500 music player just so we can sell you $30 copies of our albums again.
[01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:13.720]   They want to give back.
[01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:14.960]   See, that's what, that's what I'm getting at.
[01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:16.120]   That's awesome.
[01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:22.000]   I don't know if that's relevant, but love those guys back in the screensavers days.
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:27.240]   They wanted to remember they've always had dial a song, but it was used to be on a dumb old answering machine.
[01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:32.600]   They had, they said, we wish we could put it on a computer and it would put, we could change the MP3s and stuff.
[01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:37.640]   And I coded up for them on a Linux box, cheap Linux box.
[01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:42.520]   I wrote a bash script that would, they could just insert a CD and it would add it to the dial a song playlist.
[01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:45.720]   And I don't know if they're still using it, but it was kind of nice.
[01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:49.440]   Answered the phone had like a us robotics voice modem on it.
[01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:50.560]   So it would pick up the phone.
[01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:52.960]   Uh, I doubt they're still using it.
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:59.960]   I remember asking, we interviewed them, um, 1991, I think, and asked them when flood came out and asked them why their lyrics were so absurd.
[01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:00.920]   And they're like, well, they're not absurd.
[01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:02.000]   If you understand what we're saying.
[01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:04.400]   I was like, okay, nevermind.
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:06.240]   They are not absurd.
[01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:06.760]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:08.240]   We had them on the screens every, it's quite a few times.
[01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:09.240]   Flood's one of the best albums ever.
[01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:10.080]   Flood's the one.
[01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:11.280]   That's my favorite album.
[01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:13.680]   My favorite, my favorite, they might be giants album.
[01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:14.840]   I should give them a hundred bucks.
[01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:15.320]   Cause that's it.
[01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:16.880]   That is a lot of great stuff for them.
[01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:19.320]   That's a lot of entertainment for $98.
[01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:25.960]   That's what really attracts me is the idea of like every Tuesday morning, I will get an email with a brand new, they might be giant song.
[01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:28.440]   That seems like a great way to spend 2015.
[01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:33.600]   My pick, uh, you know, you've, you know that I have misgivings about Kickstarter.
[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:38.600]   I've bought so many things, never received them, but, uh, there's one thing from Kickstarter that I was very excited.
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:39.640]   In fact, it was on this show.
[01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:43.400]   I think somebody, maybe you told me, oh, the Pono player is now on Kickstarter.
[01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:44.360]   A very same day.
[01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:48.960]   I immediately went over and lay plunked down my donation, my contribution.
[01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:50.960]   They raised with 30 days.
[01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:52.840]   They, they were looking for $800,000.
[01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:54.160]   They raised 6.2 million.
[01:37:54.480 --> 01:38:08.080]   This is Neil Young's project to make a portable player, not exactly an iPod, but a portable player that could play back high res music in high quality using very high end digital to analog converters and so forth.
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:14.280]   Uh, April 15th of this year, they funded and here lo and behold, we are November 11th.
[01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:15.560]   They're only a few weeks late.
[01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:16.800]   They said they'd have it by October.
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:19.120]   My Pono player has arrived.
[01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:27.160]   I haven't listened to it, so I'm not giving you a review yet, but, uh, maybe the review is it's a little bigger than I expected.
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:33.320]   Uh, it's that's you don't want to put that in a back pocket because if you fall down, that's going to hurt a lot.
[01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:35.240]   This is more for the desk and look, it's got Neil Young.
[01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:38.680]   In fact, if I put it on my desk facing out, it might look like I'm Neil Young.
[01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:39.360]   Yeah.
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:41.880]   Everybody's Neil Young now.
[01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:49.600]   Uh, so, uh, the Pono player is out and actually my pick is something you can get right now, which is the Pono software player.
[01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:54.160]   I'm kind of impressed with this is maybe what iTunes should have been.
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:58.560]   Um, as soon as you install it and you can get it for free right now, it does expire.
[01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:00.320]   Like these are beta versions.
[01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:10.640]   So you're getting an early version of it and yes, it does have quite a few, uh, weird bugs, but one of the things I really liked about it will of course on your, on your Mac, play back high res music just fine.
[01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:15.440]   Um, but more than that, uh, and it has, I think a very nice interface.
[01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:19.440]   It will also play to DLNA players, including your Sonos.
[01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:26.320]   So I've been able to pick Sonos playback music from high res music from my Mac to my Sonos.
[01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:28.680]   Uh, that is pretty sweet.
[01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:32.200]   Uh, it will import all kinds of music, not just high res music.
[01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:34.440]   It'll let you see only the high res music if you want.
[01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:38.160]   And of course it does, it is what you need to export out to the Pono.
[01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:40.800]   Well, it actually is not what you need because the Pono player has an SD card.
[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:46.480]   So you could just put it into the little micro SD, you can put it into your computer and copy that way.
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:51.440]   But, uh, this is pretty cool. The Pono, it's called Pono Music World.
[01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:55.000]   It is free right now, uh, from ponomusic.com.
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:40:02.280]   And, uh, you know, as we keep looking at iTunes and keep saying, saying, when is Apple going to redo this?
[01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:07.600]   And most people are not, you know, going to make a music player for the Mac because there's iTunes.
[01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:10.360]   Um, so I'm glad to see a new music player.
[01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:14.800]   I imagine this will work on windows as well, which does some really interesting new things,
[01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:16.640]   including playback high res music.
[01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:21.400]   Um, and I'm glad, really glad to see it available, uh, on Macintosh.
[01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:28.880]   So I also kind of dig the idea of a music company that's really underscoring the importance of the value of the entire album.
[01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:29.320]   Right.
[01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:40.120]   Because I'm sort of kicking myself because only in the past couple of weeks, I realized, boy, when was the last time you actually just sat down and listened to an entire album from start to finish instead of just cherry picking the two, three inside a playlist.
[01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:44.080]   And actually just yesterday I listened to Sergeant Pepper start to finish.
[01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:46.840]   That has to be years and years and years.
[01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:48.400]   It's like, okay, there's a lot of songs.
[01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:50.200]   There's a lot more to this than the three hits.
[01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:51.960]   Excellent playlist creation.
[01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:54.040]   It will import your iTunes music automatically.
[01:40:54.040 --> 01:41:00.600]   When you first install it, it has a lot of interesting advanced tools, some of which are not completely implemented yet.
[01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:02.240]   It does rip CDs.
[01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:08.200]   It does playback flack as well as, uh, uh, the other standard formats.
[01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:10.920]   Uh, I feel like it's, it's, it's pretty exciting.
[01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:14.720]   Um, and we'll see if you want to go out and get a good pair of headphones.
[01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:15.200]   And I will.
[01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:15.520]   Yeah.
[01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:18.840]   Well, that's the other thing I will have a review for you of the, uh, of the Pono player.
[01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:27.360]   I in preparation for this, I've been buying high res music from HD tracks, but now there's the Pono music world, uh, store as well.
[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:29.160]   What headphones are you going to use Leo?
[01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:31.640]   That's a good question.
[01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:33.840]   I mean, I have animatics, good quality animatics.
[01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:35.240]   It'd probably be fine for this.
[01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:46.720]   Um, I, I've been using a very, my, you know, my, my home stereo headphones, the high five man, uh, headphones are, you know, $900 headphones are really nice.
[01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:49.120]   We expect to hear some comparisons on those.
[01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:52.080]   Yeah, I'll probably, I mean, I guess I'll listen on those.
[01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:55.440]   I have to use an adapter because it's got a mini jack doesn't have a, a phone unplug.
[01:41:55.440 --> 01:41:57.680]   But, uh, I don't know.
[01:41:57.680 --> 01:41:59.120]   That's a good, that's a good question.
[01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:01.200]   We'll see if there's a difference between that and the animatics.
[01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:03.520]   I also have some, uh, sure high insurers.
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:06.760]   I have a variety of small headphones, but I'm just excited.
[01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:09.240]   I mean, you know, this is a great story.
[01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:14.920]   Um, there's still a lot of argument whether high res music is going to make any difference at all.
[01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:18.120]   Um, but, uh, it's here.
[01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:19.440]   He's got to have the whole chain.
[01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:20.280]   That's the, that's the challenge.
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:21.920]   Well, and that's why they did the store, right?
[01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:29.040]   And presumably Neil Young is able to go to, it's obvious he's able to go to artists and say, Hey, I want to put out your music as high res.
[01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:30.720]   We've got a player, we've got an ecosystem.
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:33.120]   And so they've got a lot of albums.
[01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:35.720]   They're going back in the time too, with older albums.
[01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:42.040]   So this seems to be very similar to the selection at HD tracks, which is where I've been getting my, uh, high resin.
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:48.600]   By the way, what, what high res means is a standard CD is 44.1 kilohertz sampling rate.
[01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:53.080]   That's 44, one, one 44,100 times per second at 16 bit.
[01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:56.960]   Uh, all of the high res stuff here is at least 24 bit.
[01:42:56.960 --> 01:43:03.360]   And the sample rate usually is, is higher, whether it's 92 kilobit, a kilohertz or 192 kilohertz.
[01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:11.760]   I don't know about the higher sample rates, but certainly a higher, um, bit higher bit rate makes it, makes a significant difference.
[01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:21.000]   And, and, you know, I asked me, I asked Joe Walsh for instance, do you record when you record or, you know, I'm sure most, most artists now record in PCM, uncompressed PCM.
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.680]   Um, but I say, what bit rate do you use?
[01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:25.160]   He said, well, we always use 24 bit.
[01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:27.880]   We may not use that higher sampling rate.
[01:43:27.880 --> 01:43:28.880]   We might do 16.
[01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:35.400]   I've accidentally recorded in 192, 24 bit on sound devices, uh, 788.
[01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:36.560]   And, and I was funny.
[01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:40.520]   I screwed up the volume on a podcast tonight and a, and, uh, it was way low.
[01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:41.960]   You know, I had, you know, it was a long time ago.
[01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:42.720]   There's no hisses there.
[01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:46.920]   And I, and I, and I had to pull it up from like negative 40, 40 or 50 DB.
[01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:48.400]   I just pulled it up and it was all still there.
[01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:49.640]   It was like, it sounded just fine.
[01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:52.200]   You know, I, I, I am old.
[01:43:52.200 --> 01:43:53.120]   I admit it.
[01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:56.520]   And I probably don't hear the difference.
[01:43:56.520 --> 01:43:57.320]   But I think I do.
[01:43:57.320 --> 01:43:57.720]   Right.
[01:43:57.720 --> 01:43:59.960]   It makes me feel better.
[01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:04.200]   And you know, these men, most of these albums are not much more expensive than
[01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:06.000]   they'd be, uh, we were talking about.
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:09.600]   Some are Kenny Rogers, the gambler for some reason, it was like 30 bucks.
[01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:14.920]   Uh, but Taylor Smith's Taylor Swift's 1989 is $20 and it's flack.
[01:44:14.920 --> 01:44:16.000]   So it's high res flack.
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:19.560]   So actually this is a 44, one 24 bits.
[01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:20.960]   So I bet you that's how it was recorded.
[01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:21.920]   This is a brand new album.
[01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:26.840]   Uh, some of the older analog albums are actually in much higher bit rates, uh,
[01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:29.960]   much higher sample rates because they're sampling from analog.
[01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:32.600]   So they decide to go a little higher.
[01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:36.760]   Anyway, my pick, uh, at least something to pay attention to for sure.
[01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:40.400]   Get the Pono player and point of music player, Pono music.com.
[01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:41.520]   Download that onto your Mac.
[01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:45.480]   Uh, and I'll give you a refer the review later down the road after I've played
[01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:47.720]   with the Pono, the giant Pono player.
[01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:48.720]   You putting that in your pocket?
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:51.600]   You think your iPhone six plus is hard, but in your pocket.
[01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:53.520]   That's a, that's a big pocket.
[01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:53.840]   Yeah.
[01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:56.360]   It won't bend, but it'll be used as a defense mechanism.
[01:44:56.360 --> 01:45:00.320]   They tell me the reason it's so big is that they're using high quality
[01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:01.640]   decks and headphone amps in here.
[01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:02.920]   And they wanted the space for it.
[01:45:02.920 --> 01:45:03.680]   Tubes.
[01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:05.520]   And it's there's no tube.
[01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:06.360]   Too sorry.
[01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:10.600]   Listen to flack and shoot and Ross has run with scissors.
[01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:11.720]   That's kind of my motto.
[01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:15.120]   Thank you, Andy and I go from the Chicago sun times.
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:15.800]   Always a pleasure.
[01:45:15.800 --> 01:45:18.160]   Always a slice of heaven here.
[01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:18.760]   Thank you very much.
[01:45:18.760 --> 01:45:22.120]   Catch if you want more Andy and who doesn't, uh, he does two more podcasts
[01:45:22.120 --> 01:45:25.760]   on the five by five network, five by five dot TV, including a Knuckles
[01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:30.240]   Almanac, which he talks about anything he damn well pleases.
[01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:31.480]   Exactly.
[01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:34.920]   Whatever, whatever, whatever noises with my mouth that I have not used
[01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:39.320]   during these two hours, I then roll over noises with my mouth.
[01:45:39.320 --> 01:45:40.960]   Uh, set up with that other podcast.
[01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:43.200]   Uh, we also thank Renee Richie for being here.
[01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:48.200]   I'm more.com is the place to go a great place for a Mac news, but he also does
[01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:52.080]   some fabulous podcasts, I'm more.com/debug for the debug podcast.
[01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:53.480]   There's a must listen every week.
[01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:54.760]   Thank you, Renee.
[01:45:54.760 --> 01:45:55.680]   Always a pleasure.
[01:45:55.680 --> 01:46:00.240]   Alex Lindsay shows up when he is not doing more important things, which is
[01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:02.280]   most of the time, but we're glad you're here when you're not here.
[01:46:02.280 --> 01:46:03.000]   I get it pretty often.
[01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:03.720]   I love it.
[01:46:03.720 --> 01:46:10.080]   I'm literally walking off this set 20 feet, 30 feet away and walking right
[01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:12.040]   into the, the final cut virtual user group.
[01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:13.320]   So if, oh good.
[01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:14.240]   So how do we get in there?
[01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:17.120]   Bitly slash FCP virtual four.
[01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:23.440]   So it's FCP final cut pro virtual cause it's virtual for, so you have to pay to
[01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:25.320]   get in there and you can ask questions.
[01:46:25.320 --> 01:46:26.200]   You can vote on questions.
[01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:26.840]   We'll answer them.
[01:46:26.840 --> 01:46:31.040]   And basically it's the what, who I think are the world experts in final cut.
[01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:31.520]   That's awesome.
[01:46:31.520 --> 01:46:33.960]   Sitting on a round table that we built and you're already late.
[01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:35.000]   So get in there late.
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.600]   So, um, but, but come, come, uh, come check it out.
[01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:38.320]   It's going on now.
[01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:38.560]   I know.
[01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:38.800]   Right.
[01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:41.440]   I had them slip the clock, so I'm sorry.
[01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:42.760]   I wish you'd told me.
[01:46:42.760 --> 01:46:43.640]   Well, all right.
[01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:46.120]   For those of you want to know about security, Steve Gibson is next on this
[01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:51.160]   network, but those of you who want to know about final cut bitly slash FCP

[01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:13.320]   will always be available at twit.tv/mbw or wherever you get your favorite stuff.
[01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:17.200]   A couple of extra little plugs for you, uh, Jason reminds me we are doing the
[01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:21.480]   best of this year, as we do every year for the holiday week, and we'd love to
[01:47:21.480 --> 01:47:25.120]   know what you think were some of the best moments this year in Mac break weekly.
[01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:33.120]   Twit.tv slash best of twit.tv slash best of as much information as you can give us.
[01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:34.360]   We, it says time code and stuff.
[01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:36.560]   You don't have to know the time code, whatever you can give us, even if it's
[01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:41.800]   just, I remember in January, something cool happened, Jason will do his best.
[01:47:42.520 --> 01:47:45.760]   Help make my job a little bit easier, please do this for Jason.
[01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:48.800]   Twitter.tv/bestof another place to go.
[01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:50.280]   We've got some brand new shirts.
[01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:51.400]   These would be great holiday gifts.
[01:47:51.400 --> 01:47:55.280]   In fact, we were looking for something that we could, uh, that we could sell
[01:47:55.280 --> 01:47:58.680]   that you would might want to give the twit fan and your family.
[01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:02.160]   Now, if you're watching this, you are already the twit fan.
[01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:06.160]   So what you do is you drop a hint to tell your, tell your loved ones
[01:48:06.160 --> 01:48:08.920]   to go to teespring.com/twit.
[01:48:08.920 --> 01:48:10.640]   We have two different choices.
[01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:14.360]   We have a, a button down shirt, you know, a standard dress shirt,
[01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:15.480]   and we have a polo shirt.
[01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:19.280]   So you can choose a variety of colors and styles.
[01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:22.840]   And, uh, we haven't been publicizing this and that's been my bad.
[01:48:22.840 --> 01:48:28.760]   You have till November 30th, but we promise to get them in your hands in time
[01:48:28.760 --> 01:48:35.120]   for the last day of Hanukkah or the first day of Christmas, whichever comes last.
[01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:38.440]   Are black helicopters flying over right now?
[01:48:38.440 --> 01:48:39.000]   I think they are.
[01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:41.080]   The NSA has arrived.
[01:48:41.080 --> 01:48:42.240]   It's a good shirt to wear.
[01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:44.920]   Like if we were ever to do a twit infomercial, it looks good.
[01:48:44.920 --> 01:48:45.440]   Doesn't it?
[01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:50.680]   Let your information professionals that logo right about your investment plan

[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:01.440]   Thank you, Jason, for reminding me about that.
[01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:05.600]   Uh, we are out of time security now up next.
[01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:06.560]   Thanks for joining us now.
[01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:09.920]   Get back to work because break time is over.
[01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:11.240]   Is over.
