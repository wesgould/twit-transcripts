[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, Andy Anaco, Renee Richie, Lori Gill, and a special guest
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.360]   join us, Rich Siegel of Bearbone Software, the creator of BBEd, is here.
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.560]   We're going to ask Rich a lot of questions, including why BBEd had left the App Store
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.720]   and now is back.
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:21.720]   We'll talk about that weird notarization thing, what to expect at WWDC and a post mortem on
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.560]   the Apple Qualcomm settlement.
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.640]   That and a whole lot more coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.200]   Renee, Richie in the flood zone, but he's still doing the show.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.680]   You are a trooper, Renee.
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.040]   You couldn't keep me away, Leo.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.240]   I just, all the chaos outside goes away because of the order.
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.240]   It's nice.
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.240]   And glory in here.
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.720]   And you didn't even do vectors.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.120]   So, I mean, that's saying a lot.
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.840]   No, it's just that there's sirens that keep going off and they keep telling us that we
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.120]   had to move our cars to a civil parking lot across the street and now a high school two
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.200]   blocks away.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.760]   And then they, it just, there's just things just keep happening and I have enough time
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.760]   to do it.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.440]   But the good news is your place is safe.
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.440]   It's above the flood.
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.080]   Yes, the neighbors on the left and the writers screwed.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.080]   It's so hard.
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.320]   And the other good news is vector hit 100,000 subscribers.
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.320]   Yes.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.320]   Congratulations.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.320]   Yeah.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.480]   And so many of them were Mac break listeners.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.480]   I really appreciate it.
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.480]   It's phenomenal.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.480]   Yay.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.080]   Andy and Akko is also here from the WGBH Boston Public Radio.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.080]   Nice to have you there, Andrew.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.680]   I'm only, I'm only trapped in the flood of my own self pity.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.920]   I can't, I can't read or tears one of the other.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.360]   And Lori Gill is here.
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.360]   Great to have you.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.440]   We actually have a big audience today, managing editor at iMore.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.440]   Hi, Lori.
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.440]   Hi.
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.120]   Am I allowed to complain about the weather here because the tree allergies are really bothering
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.120]   my...
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.120]   It's so hot and sunny.
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.520]   It never changes.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.160]   The weather is so great.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.320]   The allergies are bad.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.560]   We are in the height of the allergies season because we had a very wet winter and as a result
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.560]   all the grass is everything and everything is blooming and it is bad.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.960]   I basically feel like I have ants crawling inside my nose and my throat.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:10.960]   I'm like, no.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.560]   I'm so glad I don't have allergies.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.040]   I don't know how I avoided that.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.240]   I think it's just my body has no resistance.
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.240]   It's just says, come on in.
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.600]   And they have no funds.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.840]   They leave you alone.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.440]   Come on, pollen.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.440]   Let's all have a party in Leo's nose.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.680]   Yeah, someday you're just going to cough in a big wad of pollen.
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.680]   Oh, God.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.480]   No, I'm going to wear a GZ or a GZ or a GZ.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.280]   And a special guest today, Rich Siegel is here from Bearbone Software, the creator of
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.280]   BB Ed.
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.280]   Hello, Rich.
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.280]   Hello.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.280]   Good afternoon, everybody.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.280]   Good to see you.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.600]   Lovely day out here in Southern New England.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.120]   Stop raining for about five minutes and all the buds on all the trees have exploded.
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.400]   So is that a pan till zoom camera over your left shoulder there?
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.640]   What is that?
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.640]   It is.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.280]   That's a Foscam birdie cam that I use.
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.280]   Oh, it's a bird cam.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.280]   I should have known.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.000]   It's actually focused on the bird cages.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.360]   But you can look around and see where they've gone if they move.
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.880]   Yes, I can do that.
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.480]   I can also check in on them when I'm out of the house.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.480]   Nice.
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.160]   And make sure they're not in trouble.
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.800]   Well, they're never not in trouble, but make sure they're at least temporarily behaving
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.800]   themselves.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.880]   I think to take on.
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.880]   So later in the show, I want to talk to you a little bit about BB Ed, which is now I'm
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.880]   thrilled available on the App Store.
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.920]   And I'm sure there's limits about what you can talk about.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.320]   But I'd love to know the process of all that because it took from the time Apple said
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.640]   it was going to happen to now quite a while.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:51.480]   Yeah, the announcement was made at the developers conference last year ago, June.
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.040]   Yeah.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.640]   So yeah, we've been working on a pretty steadily since then.
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:01.600]   I'd say it's about as much work as went into any major upgrade of the application.
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:08.520]   So yeah, there are certainly things that I'm not at liberty to say, but I'll be happy
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.000]   to talk about whatever I can.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Good.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.640]   I think that you should just stall toward the entire conversation that you're not at liberty
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.640]   to say anything.
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.320]   I don't recall the advice of that question.
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.160]   I'm inclined to answer the question on the grounds that maintain and permeate.
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.160]   There you go.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.160]   Plead the fifth.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.960]   Let's start though in the courtroom, which was something that broke the like during the
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.320]   show last week.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.440]   And so now we've had a week to to chew it over.
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:42.560]   Apple and Qualcomm buried the hatchet the day after jury was in paneled.
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.120]   The trial had actually begun.
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.400]   Apple had made its opening statements and then boom.
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.440]   And then very shortly thereafter Intel said, Oh, by the way, we're getting out of the
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.440]   five-g modem business coincidence correlation causation.
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:03.080]   Well, one somebody asked a question on to it, which was reasonable was when did Intel make
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.600]   that determination?
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.240]   After the Qualcomm settlement or before?
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.000]   And did it in other words, did it precipitate the Qualcomm settlement?
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.920]   Did Apple say, did Mr. Intel call Mr. Apple and say, yeah, we're not.
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:15.920]   This isn't going to work.
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.040]   And Mr. Apple said in the thing, we could still make them if we wanted to.
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.920]   But we don't want to.
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:27.840]   Well, Qualcomm is the one you got to beat and they are entrenched and they have really,
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.840]   really great technology there.
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.120]   And Intel was always going to have an uphill battle and that battle was going to be helped
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:42.440]   if Apple became a major buyer and or if Qualcomm had a major defeat that allowed other lawsuits
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.920]   or anti-trust suits that got against them to become stronger and stronger.
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:51.480]   And once they saw the cards on the table, they decided that none of this looks very good.
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.040]   Let's get out while they're getting good.
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.760]   They have to have had some indication either eyes in the courtroom or some or but some
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.920]   back channel thing that they knew this was not going to go well for Apple one way or
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:02.920]   another.
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:08.320]   Also, the fact that they folded in one day also in a case that they knew that either
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.520]   later the game or earlier that this was not going to go their way.
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:16.800]   The arguments, the opening arguments were strange.
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.560]   They brought up Kentucky fried chicken and whether you get the potatoes and the chicken
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.120]   of what your expectation is.
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.360]   And they were all sorts of really like folksy analogies that-
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.360]   Yeah.
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.360]   So that's the lawyers.
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.360]   That's the lawyers.
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.840]   That's the Apple lawyers saying, Oh God, this truth.
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:33.840]   I'm not sure he's not going to understand the word.
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:34.840]   Wait, it was a Qualcomm.
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:35.840]   No, the KFC was a Qualcomm.
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:36.840]   It was a Qualcomm.
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:37.840]   It was a Qualcomm.
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.360]   Apple had an equally absurd analogy though.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.760]   It was just on both sides.
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:47.680]   My feeling in all of this is that they've known no one's really going to win this for
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:48.680]   a long time.
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:53.440]   And Qualcomm has to be careful too because most regulators hate a monopoly.
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.320]   It's why Intel licensed it, licensed it to AMD.
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.280]   It's why Microsoft gave money to Apple.
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.440]   You never want to be alone in the market.
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:03.720]   You always want some level of competition or some level of a detachment that shows that
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.960]   you're being a good corporate citizen.
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.840]   And Apple wanted really, really low rates.
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.360]   Qualcomm did not want to give them those rates.
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.520]   They didn't want to threaten their business model.
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.560]   Apple wanted Intel as sort of a hedge against Qualcomm, but Apple ended up having to do so
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.560]   much of the engineering on their own that they might have not, I guess, had an Intel
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.560]   to begin with.
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.200]   And I think it just got to a point where Apple made a calculation.
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.600]   Enough decisions didn't go their way, but sort of the FTC looked like it might, but that
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.040]   was a ways out.
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.520]   And they really needed to get their phones in order to ship.
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.680]   And so Qualcomm gave them a couple points off, nowhere nearly as much as they wanted
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.480]   to, probably a couple more than Qualcomm wanted to.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.160]   And they decided to get the deal done.
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:44.360]   And it saves every one of their executives having to go up on those stands and say things
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.120]   that nobody wants those executives.
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.840]   Tim Cook would have had to testify.
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.360]   That's one reason Apple didn't probably want to go on.
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:54.760]   Although, what's weird is everything that you just described was known long before the
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.000]   jury was in-paneled.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.080]   What was the sudden timing of this?
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:05.480]   That's why I think Intel saying maybe negotiations continued this old time or it was all signed
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.440]   on April 1st was when the agreements are all ratified for.
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.760]   And it could have just been they didn't get everything.
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:11.960]   Ah, okay.
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:12.960]   Okay.
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:17.880]   So in other words, almost two weeks before the trial began, they had a still like agreement.
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.120]   So like I said, Intel could have had a back channel to know that this was in place, but
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.080]   also the Washington Post had a reporter in the room.
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:28.760]   I don't think that the presentations of the first day have been unsealed yet.
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:33.120]   But again, they had a reporter in the room and they have a really good piece showing what
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.480]   Apple's legal strategy was.
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:40.680]   The Qualcomm, they're trying to make the point that to the jury, again, maybe trying to be
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.560]   the folksy country lawyer.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.720]   Well, I don't know much about no base managers.
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:50.600]   What I do know was that in an open marketplace, they're going to be showing off that, hey,
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:55.200]   there's a huge, huge pile of patents that we bought that are similar to Qualcomm's,
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:00.920]   but they even though it's a gajillion patents and they're costing about a fraction of what
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.480]   we were paying for Qualcomm's patent, few patents.
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.840]   And is that fair?
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:09.960]   And the reporters that was able to look at this and say, yeah, but they Apple was strategically
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:14.800]   buying super, super, super cheap patents that have absolutely no relevance to Qualcomm
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.440]   to make that argument.
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:22.960]   They also got Qualcomm got access to internal discussions and internal presentations of Apple
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:23.960]   about their strategy.
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:29.280]   I'm going to quote, I had to highlight this one because the purpose of their product was
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:34.200]   spelled out clearly, quote, goal, reduce Apple's net royalty to Qualcomm.
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.840]   Apple said in the document, it planned to accomplish this in several ways, including
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:43.520]   quote, hurt Qualcomm financially, unquote, and quote, put Qualcomm's licensing model at
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.160]   risk, unquote.
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.600]   So as a smoking gun.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:53.160]   Well, yeah, I mean, also admissions internally, Apple's own emissions internally, the Qualcomm
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:57.120]   technology was superior while in public, they were saying, oh, it's inferior.
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.320]   Oh, I found it.
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.800]   Apple said that you should, when you buy Coke, you shouldn't have to give 10% to Pepsi.
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.040]   That was their big analogy against that.
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:07.480]   And Qualcomm was when you buy chicken, you should all you should have to pay separately
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:08.480]   for the potatoes.
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.160]   You don't get the potatoes for free.
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:15.960]   It seems to me that this is a damning indictment of the jury system when it comes to high tech
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:16.960]   losses.
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:22.120]   Like if we have to dumb it down that far, we need better juries.
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.120]   Yeah.
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.120]   Yeah.
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:28.240]   There's no such thing as the tech jury that you have to be, you know, like well versed
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:33.040]   in in 5G modems in order to be able to sit on the jury so that you can understand what
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.280]   they're talking about.
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:40.120]   I have to wonder though, if the agreements are April 1st, I mean, why be so?
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:47.000]   Blistering in your arguments initially, if you know you're about to settle, it seems
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.160]   to me that these attorneys in the courtroom did not know that a settlement was in a minute.
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.360]   No, they didn't apparently only have a very, very small amount of people in all those companies
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:58.560]   new and a tiny subset of those, and you're the full extent to the deal.
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:11:59.560]   Oh, interesting.
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:03.080]   Well, why did they delay it?
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:08.000]   Like it probably is as simple as negotiating all the thing, like because they came to very
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.440]   specific, Apple is paying less, nowhere nearly as less as they want to pay, but they did
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.920]   get a slightly better rate.
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:20.320]   And I saw a bunch of analysis from Ben Behren and just the usual people on what this costs.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.480]   And there was disagreement, like some people thought they wanted $5 per product, but ended
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:26.520]   up closer to $7, and other thought they wanted $6, end up closer to $8.
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:28.560]   So I think we're going to have to wait till a lot more comes out.
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:33.400]   But it's a better, in one sense, absolutely everybody won here.
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:37.120]   And the nice thing from just from an Apple users point of view is that we'll be getting
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:41.160]   Qualcomm modems again, which is way better in many areas than Intel modems.
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.160]   If you're just dripping in signal, it won't matter to you.
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:47.000]   But if you're in any area that has any problems whatsoever, it's great news for you.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.360]   And Apple got a license.
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.360]   Apple didn't just get the chips.
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:53.000]   They got the license, which was part of the bickering here is, why do we have to buy the
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.200]   license if we're buying the chips?
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.960]   But in Apple's case, if you look at what they did with ARM, which was to license the designs
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:02.720]   until they were making their own designs and then just license the IP, that could be
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.360]   very similar with Qualcomm.
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:09.400]   They're licensing the chips for now as Apple's own modem efforts increase.
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:13.360]   And then in two years, three years, they switched to the Apple, whatever M series modem, and
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:18.920]   it's using all of Qualcomm's IP for the technology.
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.360]   Reed Albert Gotti of the Washington Post was in the room road.
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:26.280]   At Tuesday's trial, Apple argued that it was like paying twice and likened it to buying
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:31.520]   Kentucky fried chicken and being charged an extra license extra for a license for all
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.800]   the methods and spices that went into cooking the chicken.
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.280]   Qualcomm argued that neither of these is apt.
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:42.080]   Qualcomm argued that the bundle of technology patents includes not just the chip technology,
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.600]   but myriad wireless tech that Apple needs in its iPhones.
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:50.400]   Apple was asking to pay for its chicken and get a side of potatoes for free, which I believe
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.400]   does happen.
[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:52.400]   Yeah, that's the whole thing.
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:55.360]   I hope it's hard because you usually do get the size of it.
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.360]   I don't usually pay separate.
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:59.040]   But they still charge you for an extra thing of dipping sauce.
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.040]   How is that right?
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.040]   That's wrong.
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:05.480]   Yeah, if the trial had gone on, we might have heard arguments about dipping sauce.
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:09.360]   Rich is so happy he's in bits and not atoms.
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.360]   Wow.
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:14.160]   Yeah, the harder business is really pretty nasty.
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:18.600]   Yeah, but I have to say, I mean, software gets patented and cumbered all the time.
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:24.320]   And remember Microsoft is demifying Linux users saying, well, we have all the Linux patents,
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:29.400]   but if you promise to give us money, we won't sue you.
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.760]   I mean, software has the same problem, doesn't it, Rich?
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.240]   It sometimes it can.
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:41.040]   Yes, it's not uncommon for specific pieces of software technology to have patents applied
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.520]   for or granted.
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:48.160]   Do you pay licenses for any of your technologies?
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.160]   We don't.
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.520]   Do it all homegrown.
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.040]   It's almost all homegrown.
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:57.760]   There's a couple of little things here and there which are open sourced and they're either
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:04.600]   MIT licensed or BSD licensed or GNU licensed with a linking exemption.
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:11.160]   If you look in our about box, there's a list of anything that we're using that is under
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.880]   license.
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:19.320]   We have used commercially licensed libraries in the past.
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:25.440]   I think most software developers will tell you they prefer to avoid royalties.
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.440]   And we do too.
[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.280]   Yeah, of course.
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:33.200]   But on the other hand, almost all software is developed using libraries from other sources.
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:38.680]   That's why open source is such a boon really to innovation.
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:39.720]   It is in some ways.
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:47.080]   In other ways, it's turning out to have significant downsides in the form of dependencies unpredictable
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:52.040]   changes, lifetime concerns, that sort of thing.
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:57.080]   You start using a piece of code and then the developer or maintainer loses interest in
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:02.640]   supporting it and all of a sudden you're stuck with something that is not just static
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:06.160]   but also not fit for purpose anymore and you're back where you started.
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.200]   It happens all the time.
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:12.080]   It's kind of a nightmare.
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:17.960]   You develop with Xcode and Apple's either Objective C or Swift.
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:21.680]   Yeah, we're using Apple's tools.
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:28.320]   It's Objective C, C++, some old school basic C code in there as well.
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:33.680]   But yeah, if you're targeting Mac OS or any of Apple's platforms, you're almost certainly
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:35.520]   using Apple's tools.
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:36.520]   You sort of have to.
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:42.920]   Apple does a good job, I think, with its tools of not introducing new versions that break
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:43.920]   old code.
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.320]   Although Swift is still kind of in development, I think.
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:49.360]   Swift is very much a moving target.
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:54.640]   Apple's put a tremendous amount of effort into maintaining source compatibility.
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:59.280]   ABI compatibility was very important for them as well.
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:00.280]   What's that?
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:01.640]   And they've done a job there.
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:11.920]   So ABI refers to application binary interface and it is sort of loosely speaking the runtime
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.880]   environment in which the software runs.
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:22.640]   So ABI has to do with how function calls work and it's very important for library compatibility.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:26.920]   So if you're using libraries, it's built against the same ABI, no problem.
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:32.800]   But if you're using libraries built against differing ABIs, you have a big problem.
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:40.560]   And so Apple has done a lot of work to maintain stability there and it's to their credit.
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:47.840]   Swift has been rapidly growing a real moving target.
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:55.320]   The word from Apple last year, WWDC, that was that Swift 5 is coming and if I recall
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:18:02.840]   correctly, they were going to be putting the Swift standard libraries into the CoreOS.
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:03.840]   That's a public announcement.
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.920]   I'm not giving up any secrets here.
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:13.160]   And when that happens, that's a huge step forward for stability.
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:18.600]   It's a very strong message from Apple saying, yes, the standard libraries are in the OS.
[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:19.600]   They are stable.
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:20.600]   They're not moving.
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:21.600]   You can count on them.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:22.600]   You can count on them.
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:23.600]   Yeah.
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:28.080]   You know, it's something you guys think about all the time, but we don't as users think
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:29.080]   about.
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:34.760]   But it's the same problem in Microsoft Windows where they call it DLLL, where you have multiple
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:39.720]   C library DLLs, different versions, different apps use different versions.
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.680]   It can really become a nightmare.
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:45.320]   Yeah, it sure can, especially where third party libraries are involved.
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:50.880]   And that's one of the reasons that everything we use, even if it is open source, we build
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.160]   from source.
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.240]   That makes sense.
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:56.080]   So that way you know the version and you know what's in there.
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:57.080]   Yeah.
[00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:59.720]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:05.240]   Is the big loser in this Apple Qualcomm thing Intel?
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.120]   I was saying before the settlement.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:09.280]   Go ahead, Renee, and then Netlory.
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:12.600]   They were saying before the settlement that, you know, this was not a financially viable
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.200]   enterprise for them.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.760]   And they were Apple kind of strong.
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:16.760]   Yeah.
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:17.760]   Yeah.
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.080]   To prioritize it and to give them low prices on it.
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:24.200]   And the new CEO, the brand new CEO was saying that, you know, it probably wasn't an area
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.360]   they wanted to focus on.
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:31.400]   So they did hedge by saying they want to keep making 5G for Internet of Things and for enterprise.
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.520]   But it seemed like this was an Albatross off their neck.
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:35.520]   Lori, go ahead.
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:41.120]   That was pretty much what I was going to say that they had said that it was a little too
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.560]   much for them to handle that.
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.360]   They felt a little pressure from Apple.
[00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:50.040]   I think if I recall Intel's stock also skyrocketed right after this announcement too.
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:55.480]   So I think there was a lot of speculation that the 5G modem business was really going
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:59.600]   to be a burden on Intel and now that they don't have it, they're free to do a lot of
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:02.480]   other things and kind of push forward with their other projects.
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.480]   Yeah.
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:07.680]   Somebody in the chatroom, Gardner, is saying the big loser is the customer long-term because
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.320]   of lack of competition.
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.880]   I don't know.
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:15.640]   How many brands of salt do you need to have on the shelf of a grocery store?
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:20.040]   The thing is that the reason why Qualcomm is the king here is not necessarily because
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:24.480]   of their anti-competitive practices, whatever they are, but the fact that it's just a damn
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:25.640]   good base band.
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:27.200]   They know how to do this.
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:32.080]   They've had enough experience with it that if you put a Qualcomm chip inside your device,
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:36.360]   you know that it's going to work, as Renee said, not just where you have wonderful coverage,
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:40.280]   but also when you have spotty coverage and also where you have networks that aren't really
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:43.080]   terribly modern and are still using old technologies.
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:47.760]   Or if you're living in a valley with Godzilla on the other side of the mountain, a Qualcomm
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:53.040]   chip will probably be able to find you a signal and give you good bit rates.
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:59.480]   Other companies have looked at that crocodile infested swamp and said, "We don't want to
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:00.480]   get in there.
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:05.160]   We would much rather have the crocodile hunter give us the thing we need from that swamp."
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:12.880]   So I would be more concerned about the lack of choice, whatever that is to consumers.
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:16.760]   If I saw something that said that here's something that Qualcomm could be doing that
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:21.960]   they aren't doing, right now the only place where it's hurting consumers is the $7.50
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:22.960]   per handset.
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:27.840]   They're charging Apple for use of their technology.
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:34.200]   And it's not as though Apple has ever been terribly concerned about saving consumers $7.50
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.200]   anywhere.
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:38.880]   Well, when you save consumers $7.50, you lower the price of the phone.
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.560]   I know Apple's concerned about it.
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:41.560]   Apple would keep that.
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.560]   Apple would just put it right in their pocket.
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:45.160]   They're not going to lose the price.
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.160]   Okay.
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.880]   So it doesn't save consumers any money.
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:49.880]   It's interesting.
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:54.200]   It does sort of relate to the library software library conversation.
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.560]   Essentially, these chips are like software libraries.
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:02.280]   They're components that Apple has to use to make the iPhone.
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:03.280]   Are they going to...
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.280]   So here's the question.
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:10.040]   In the next generation iPhone coming out this fall, will they continue to have Intel...
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.040]   Yes.
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.640]   LTE modems, they will.
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:13.640]   Yes.
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:14.640]   Yeah.
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:18.520]   But now they can get Qualcomm parts.
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.160]   I think they're going to start that next year with the 5G phones.
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:24.280]   I mean, presuming that 5G actually rolls out the way I want to expect it to do.
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:28.040]   Because Qualcomm was withholding their parts from Apple.
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:30.840]   Yeah, but Huawei kindly offered to sell Apple.
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:31.840]   Yeah.
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:38.280]   Well, now Huawei, it's interesting because now, according to some sources, the CIA is telling
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:43.040]   people, "Wawway is actually taking money from the Chinese government and is as close to
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:46.480]   the Chinese government as you can get."
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:53.920]   They've been this kind of noise from the US administration and intelligence that, "Well,
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.160]   you shouldn't be using Huawei.
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:59.560]   We won't use Huawei and trying to tell our allies not to use Huawei, but they finally
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:03.040]   are going around saying, "Look, here's what's really happening.
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:06.320]   This is a Chinese government enterprise in effect."
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.400]   And the Huawei's out too.
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.400]   Yeah.
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:12.000]   And they were often used to the Chinese market anyway.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.800]   They would have to do work to optimize for the extra Chinese market.
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:15.840]   No, we're not going to get.
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.800]   Apple's never been the first to do anything.
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:19.360]   They're not going to do 5G in the fall.
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:20.360]   We've already.
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:21.360]   No.
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.360]   Next year.
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:23.560]   You think as soon as next year?
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:30.440]   Well, so the thunderbolt, the HTC Thunderbolt hit a January of 2011 if memory serves.
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:35.440]   It wasn't until September of 2012 that Apple did the iPhone 5, which was their first LTE
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.440]   phone.
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:37.680]   So they were about 18 months behind.
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:40.720]   And we just had the 5G Galaxy S10 hit.
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:43.400]   It's who we're sitting around about now.
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:49.840]   So if you look out, end of next year will probably be the same amount of time.
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:52.800]   And they typically just want to get the second generation parts because the first generation
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:57.440]   parts, you lose a lot of efficiency because the 5G parts actually a separate chip.
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:00.840]   Qualcomm makes a lot of their money by just offering the Snapdragon SOC with everything
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:01.840]   nicely packaged in.
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.480]   But the 5G radios are big.
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:07.520]   You have to have four different sides of RF transparency to get the signal because it's
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.280]   all those millimeter signals going in there.
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:13.280]   And that means that area of space can't be used by batteries.
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:16.920]   We end up having slightly smaller battery capacity unless you make the phone bigger.
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:20.680]   It's all the same things that the HTC Thunderbolt had that made it the first LTE phone with
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:22.560]   a battery that lasted an hour and a half.
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:26.840]   And now the one cooler chips, next generation chips that are smaller, more efficient, all
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:27.840]   those things.
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:29.400]   And they should have those by the end of next year.
[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:31.360]   We speculated last week.
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:35.320]   And of course, it was a rushed thing because we just heard about the settlement that Apple,
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:41.400]   the deal that Apple made with Qualcomm was for five years with an option for two more.
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:46.160]   So we speculated that really is telling you the timeframe for Apple's own house designs
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.160]   chips to replace.
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:48.160]   Yeah.
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:49.160]   Yeah.
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:51.400]   If they thought they could get this up and running in less than six years, they wouldn't
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:57.240]   have made a deal like that unless they wanted to keep some irons in the fire.
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:02.180]   There might be the first year that they do 5G with their own, they want to use their
[00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:03.180]   own chips.
[00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:06.800]   They might decide to make it sort of like how you could buy a phone, but you don't know
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:09.760]   whether you're going to get the Qualcomm or the Intel chip.
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.800]   It could be that there's going to be some people are not going to be aware that they
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:19.000]   are sort of beta testing Apple's new chip fab for baseband and we'll see how well that
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   works.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.360]   But yeah, that's clearly a sign of how difficult the problem is going to be for Apple to get
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:25.360]   this done.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:32.040]   And everything that Renee said absolutely spot on and Apple Apple, unlike Android phone makers
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:37.280]   is in a really great position where they really don't have any need to rush because no one's
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:41.560]   going to be making a competing iPhone that has 5G before Apple makes one.
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:46.200]   And to the top off all of that 5G is going to take a couple of years to get built up
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:51.960]   to the point where the major the major airport hub cities are all going to be covered by
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:52.960]   5G.
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:26:00.000]   And for at least until 2020, I think, where something where people with a 5G phone will
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.560]   notice that, hey, I'm getting a 5G signal, not the phony baloney Fisher price.
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:08.120]   But she signals off my AT&T phone.
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:14.000]   The it's funny because according to the mobile economy report, which was released at Mobile
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:21.040]   World Congress, in the next six years by 2025, only 15% of the global mobile industry will
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.160]   run on 5G technology.
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:27.160]   In the US, it'll be a little bit higher, maybe 30%.
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:28.480]   But that's six years from now.
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:30.440]   It's not like 5G is imminent.
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:31.440]   Yeah.
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:35.520]   No, it's a premium technology that when an Apple works in the premium space and if the
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.680]   if and when they do make their own modems, they would almost certainly have to license
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:41.880]   from Qualcomm anyway or face the mother of all lawsuits.
[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:44.400]   So it's just kind of neatly packages up everything together.
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:48.400]   What do you bet though that in somewhere in that long document that just agreed to, there's
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.000]   something about that?
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   I think it's exactly like arm.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.680]   Like they're going to license a design until they can license the IP and make their own
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:56.680]   design.
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.320]   Yeah, but I'm sure Apple made as part of this made an agreement.
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.320]   Yeah.
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:00.320]   Okay, this is what you're going to charge is what it's going to be.
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:01.320]   Well, they got both.
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:02.320]   Yeah.
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:03.320]   Yeah.
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:04.320]   They got both.
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:05.320]   They got the technology license and the chip license.
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:06.320]   Right.
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:07.320]   Right.
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:08.320]   Yeah.
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:13.480]   And it's really for 5G really is about San Francisco, Chicago, Seattle, Boston, Atlanta.
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:18.680]   Basically, if you get 10 hub cities in the United States, that's not as good as having
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:23.280]   the entire country covered, but in terms of the people who are spending $800 to $1000,
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:27.240]   maybe $2,000 for folding phone, which might actually work in two years.
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.240]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.640]   That's really what you have to do to make those people happy.
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:33.840]   Although Apple's never, I mean, the first iPhone was 2G.
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:34.840]   Yeah.
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:35.840]   Yeah.
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.480]   And they have apps and they have cut face.
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:42.280]   And as I remember, I may be wrong, but in 2007, everybody had access to 3G.
[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:46.600]   I mean, it was globally available, right?
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:47.600]   I think so.
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:51.200]   I had 3G phones.
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.440]   So 3G was good enough for my grandparents.
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:55.920]   I don't see what the problem is.
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.840]   They were on GPS and they liked it.
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:27:59.840]   One RX, what was it?
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:00.840]   One RX TT?
[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:02.400]   Well, I forgot what the Verizon version was.
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:08.240]   I sprint his end of this lawsuit against AT&T for the use of 5G enhanced.
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.240]   It's too bad.
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.920]   They should keep that going.
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:11.920]   Yeah.
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:12.920]   I wonder why.
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:16.560]   Maybe they just said, oh, this is what are we doing here and AT&T will get to continue
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:21.200]   to use the 5G enhanced label in that settlement.
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.200]   So I think it's really--
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.200]   That's a proud day.
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.200]   Yeah.
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:25.200]   Proud day.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.200]   Proud day for a proud day.
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:30.120]   We get to continue to fool consumers.
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:33.240]   They're going to be up there in the Hall of Fame right next to the first guy I said.
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:34.640]   But if we spell it, CHEZ.
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.560]   It doesn't matter.
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:40.280]   There's no real cheese in this.
[00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:41.280]   Let's take a break.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:43.040]   WWDC is coming up.
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:48.240]   It's just around the corner, which we have a tame developer in house.
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:54.360]   So we'll ask Rich Segal what he expects to see at WWDC lots more too.
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:55.360]   Great panel.
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:56.360]   It's nice.
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:58.320]   It's fun to have a big panel.
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:01.000]   Really appreciate all of you being here today.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:07.680]   Our show brought to you by CAP, Terra, if you're in business, it's notorious line of
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:13.320]   business software for being out of date, old, janky, written by somebody who wasn't employee
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:17.600]   years ago and has disappeared, undocumented.
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:18.760]   It happens all the time.
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:24.760]   That's why people still use Windows XP and Internet Explorer 8 because they have business
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:26.840]   software that requires it.
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:30.440]   Maybe it's time to move on and start using modern software.
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:35.640]   There's great software for almost every business, for almost every need, and CAP, Terra is the
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.240]   place to find it.
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:44.240]   They have 700 categories of business software, CRM, IT, project management, e-commerce, link
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:51.040]   management tools, web conferencing, but even that basic line of business software like dog
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:56.960]   groomer management software or parrot camera software, that kind of thing.
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:02.360]   If you're in business and you're using old funky software, go to cap, terra.com/macbreak.
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:06.600]   Finally, what you find all the software, it's designed, it's so easy.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:10.040]   You pick a category, go ahead and pick anything there.
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:12.160]   How about auto dealer software?
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:18.480]   And then you can say there's a whole checklist of pricing options.
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:19.480]   You have different filters.
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:20.880]   Are you a new car dealer?
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:21.880]   Use car dealer.
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:24.800]   Do you want to keep track of documents, financing?
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:25.960]   You want to do lease?
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:30.360]   You check the features you want and you're going to build a list.
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:35.880]   You're going to filter it down and build a list of programs that match your exact needs.
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:39.680]   And then you can set up a comparison chart and look side by side.
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:42.560]   But the best part is CAP, Terra has.
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:48.560]   And this number goes up all the time, over 850,000 verified reviews of those products.
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:51.720]   There are 30,000 new reviews every month.
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:55.560]   So you're going to, not only do you get to compare these for yourself, but you could
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:59.600]   see what people, actual people using the software say about it.
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:01.560]   This is so huge.
[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:06.680]   You could filter by product rating, the number of users, deployment, all the features, compare
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:08.960]   them side by side up to forward at time.
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:12.840]   You even get a list of related categories for further options.
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:16.800]   No matter what kind of software you use in your business.
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:21.080]   There's no need to use that old stuff that runs on Vista.
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:24.000]   CAPTARA makes it easy to discover the right solution fast.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.160]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:28.920]   You have to be using a power PC processor, run our program.
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:33.200]   Oh, once you find that perfect software, leave a review, share your knowledge with other
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:36.360]   buyers, knowledge is power, and that's what CAPTARA is all about.
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:39.200]   Now when I tell people about CAPTARA, they say, "Oh, that's great.
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:40.200]   How much is it?
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:41.440]   I pay 50 bucks a month for that.
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:42.440]   It's fantastic."
[00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:43.520]   No, it's free.
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:44.520]   Free free.
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.560]   Like it's never going to cost you anything.
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:48.400]   It's a free website.
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:50.640]   Millions of people use it every month.
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:52.480]   I just want everybody to know about it.
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:32:17.520]   Thank you.
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:38.360]   Thank you.
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:42.840]   I am an Eclipse user.
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:46.480]   The user, that's really the right term.
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:47.480]   Yeah.
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:53.960]   Although there is a shameful secret that Eclipse and AutoCrad are now produced by the same outfit.
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:57.080]   So I was talking to Mom earlier on iOS today.
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:02.200]   She's from Providence, and we were talking about Eclipse and AutoCrad and Coffee Milk.
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:04.720]   She says, "My milkman delivers it."
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.880]   So, hey, she's got a milkman.
[00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:08.880]   What?
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:10.880]   And B, they deliver coffee milk.
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:14.040]   That's Providence, Rhode Island, ladies and gentlemen, in a nutshell.
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:15.800]   That is modern civilization right there.
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:16.800]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:19.840]   When they start delivering podcasts, when the milkman starts coming with a packet of
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:22.320]   podcasts, then...
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:23.320]   Then...
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:26.840]   I got your packet of Twitch shows right here.
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:29.520]   Yeah, I'm sorry I don't have a podcast.
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:36.160]   I sort of feel like occasionally I guest on other's podcasts and that seems to stretch
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:37.160]   the limits of audience.
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:39.160]   No, he's got a dozen.
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.160]   Yeah.
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:41.160]   Yeah.
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:42.160]   Yeah.
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:43.160]   Yeah.
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:44.160]   Yeah.
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:45.160]   Rich, you're an underachiever here.
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:46.160]   I'm a slacker, a loser.
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:50.080]   Actually, those of us who use BB Editor are very grateful that you spend your energies in
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:54.800]   an appropriate arena making BB Edit better all the time.
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:34:00.080]   What I ask is there's a new...and I'm curious, because everybody else on this panel is a
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:07.120]   podcaster in one form or fashion, about this new program, Luminary, which is a podcast
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:12.040]   app, $100 million in venture funding.
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:14.640]   Oh, that'll end well.
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:17.040]   It launches today.
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:22.040]   The New York Times has kept the daily off Luminary.
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:27.600]   Gillet has kept reply off Luminary.
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:33.360]   Not because Luminary isn't a standard podcast app, it is, but because they're going to also
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:42.520]   have a paid category and they foolishly tweeted a bunny saying podcasts don't need ads.
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:47.640]   That's not good for ad-based podcasting.
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:51.040]   We're not going to take that step of saying, oh, we don't want to be on Luminary.
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:57.000]   We want to be anywhere you want to be, but nor are we going to do paid exclusives with
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.680]   any company either.
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:03.680]   All you need is a deal with a $100 million startup.
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:04.680]   That's all you need.
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:06.080]   That's the dream.
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:08.160]   What about the Leo Song and Dance Hour?
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.520]   We've been waiting.
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:10.600]   So here's the question.
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:16.160]   Would you pay $8 a month to get...so one of the things they're going to do, and I think
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:19.920]   Spotify is going to do this too, I would guess now that they bought Gimlet for a huge
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:24.480]   amount of money, is they'll have podcasts that you can't get on any other player and
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:27.160]   they'll be ad-free.
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:29.080]   Trevor Noah is going to do a show.
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:30.920]   Oh, he's a podcast plus Leo.
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:36.680]   But would you...I don't...will people pay $8 a month for exclusive access to Lena Dunham's
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:39.680]   podcast or Trevor Noah's podcast?
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:40.840]   I think it will.
[00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:46.000]   I think that there are a lot of people out there who are very passionate about podcasts
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.840]   and are probably pretty excited about the idea of getting some special exclusives with
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:53.280]   some big celebrities.
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:56.600]   It seems weird since we've been getting our podcast for free for so long, but there's
[00:35:56.600 --> 00:36:04.200]   lots of podcasts that you can pay to get access to their old stuff or something like that.
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:08.800]   So this is just a bigger version that's broader spectrum.
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:14.040]   So I think there's definitely going to be a lot of people excited to pay for especially
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:19.440]   when they can get exclusive content or backend content that maybe isn't available through
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:23.880]   the other podcast platforms that they're just not uploaded anymore.
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:25.200]   I think that's probably really good.
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:29.520]   So a lot of it will depend on the features available, but if they're providing good features,
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:30.520]   people will pay for that.
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:32.840]   There's some real passionate podcast listeners out there.
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:36.800]   Yeah, and fans of particular people and if the only way you can hear them.
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:38.160]   I think of Howard Stern.
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:44.000]   People pay a lot of money to SiriusXM so they can hear the Howard Stern show.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.680]   But keep in mind that he built this huge, huge worldwide audience off of free radio.
[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:49.680]   That's true.
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:52.280]   He was already a super, super star when he got there.
[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:54.880]   I wonder what that's going to do for discovery.
[00:36:54.880 --> 00:37:01.240]   Like how there's so many podcasts where I don't become a fan until I've sampled maybe
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:04.000]   eight or nine episodes over the course of a few months.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.120]   And then suddenly it's one of these shows that I don't want to miss.
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:12.360]   I'm not sure if I would pay in advance, even if it's just a monthly fee for everything,
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:17.080]   to see, well, I want to at least hear what Trevor Noah's new podcast sounds like.
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:19.600]   And then find out that, well, it's okay.
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:23.280]   But if I'm also watching his nightly show, I don't really need, I don't feel like there's
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:24.640]   anything new there.
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:28.000]   And plus there's going to be 10 other shows from people I've never heard of who don't
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:33.320]   have a national platform already that are going to be as fun for me that I might have
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:34.600]   through that other show.
[00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:36.800]   So I don't know how it's going to work.
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:37.800]   Yeah.
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:39.840]   If it keeps some people afloat, I think that's a good thing.
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:43.080]   But I don't know how this can help discovery.
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:45.720]   Are they offering any kind of free?
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:46.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:48.000]   So one month for free.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:55.560]   So I mean, really it sounds a lot like like Apple Apple's TV plus or Netflix, right?
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:57.160]   It's going to be interesting to you.
[00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:59.680]   Well, even Netflix is things that have stuff we've heard of.
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:03.000]   I think Apple TV plus is probably a perfect example.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.040]   It's TV shows we've never seen before.
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:09.000]   And we're going to buy into something that we don't know whether or not we're going
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   to like.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.040]   So it's more like that of, you know, am I, is this really going to worth be worth it?
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:17.360]   But trying it for a month, I think you could probably get an idea about whether or not
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:20.640]   you like it and decide from there.
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:23.880]   It's also like subscription is not a universal fix for things.
[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:26.920]   In some industries, it does really, really well.
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:28.160]   In other industries, not so well.
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:32.280]   I think Ben Thompson had a really good article a couple days or a week or so ago where he
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:34.800]   talked about how you have to fit the content type to the need.
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:38.440]   And you have real time programming like sports and news that has traditionally done well
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:42.560]   one way and you have other content like entertainment that's traditionally done well another way.
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:47.720]   But as pay way more than subscription for many mediums, like there's just no competition
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:52.280]   between what an advertiser will pay and what a subscription service will pay.
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:58.280]   And especially in podcasts and to some extent video, the ads are non, they're not non-intrusive,
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:01.920]   but they're also not terribly, they're not like punch the monkey annoyingly or anywhere
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:04.440]   nearly as bad as a lot of the web ads are.
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:08.920]   And we found a very good equilibrium between sponsorships and audience and sort of like
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.800]   everyone's needs gets met.
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:14.320]   And will people, will just the creators of these shows make anywhere nearly as much that
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:19.200]   they would, like would lean a durna more or travel no one make as much as if they didn't
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:20.200]   want to spawn.
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:22.920]   Because the whole thing with Howard Stern is that companies wanted to pay to hear Howard
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:24.680]   Stern say their name.
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:25.680]   That was the big thing for them.
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:27.200]   I think it's similar for Leo.
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:30.640]   It's like there are all sorts of people out there who just want to be on the Leo LePorte
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:31.640]   Show.
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:34.600]   And that's something that you don't get with subscription and so it'll be like Andy said,
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:37.880]   it's going to be interesting to see how well those two models mesh together.
[00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:43.080]   >> There was also the cache for Howard Stern of, but what if there were no FCC controlling
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:46.840]   what he could say or what he could do on his show.
[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:50.920]   And I don't know about this new service if they're going to say, we don't want anyone
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:52.880]   saying anything naughty.
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:58.640]   I don't care how upset you may be with whatever the government may or may not have done, but
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:01.160]   we are not going to politicize this service.
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:04.240]   >> I would hope Luminary wouldn't do that.
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:05.240]   >> Yeah, I know.
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:08.760]   But it's like the podcasting is the ultimate freedom.
[00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:13.560]   Like anybody who, some people are not really necessarily motivated by making a profit on
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:14.560]   a podcast.
[00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:19.080]   They just have a point of view that they want to share or they just have conversations with
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:24.520]   their friends that the fifth time in a row someone says, wow, this should be, we should
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:25.640]   be recording this.
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:26.640]   It turns into a podcast.
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:29.400]   >> That's exactly how all the Twitch shows started by the way.
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:35.160]   It was just a bunch of guys sitting around talking and ladies sitting around talking and
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:37.240]   we thought, oh, this is good.
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:38.760]   Maybe somebody want to hear this.
[00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:39.760]   >> But I did.
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:40.760]   >> I'm not referring to one.
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:43.920]   >> For a couple of years, we didn't even want to do ads because we just wanted, it was
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:44.920]   a hobby.
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:48.360]   Eventually, you have to kind of figure out a way to monetize, I guess.
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:52.560]   I just think there's also, people are getting kind of burned out at these subscriptions.
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:57.200]   >> Yeah, I think Renee can talk about that more.
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:01.240]   Probably subscription burnout is definitely something we're kind of talking about right
[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:02.680]   now.
[00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:08.960]   A lot of ways that you can get exclusive content, you can get your niche things fed to you the
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:10.400]   perfect way that you like it.
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:13.400]   But we're starting to spend more and more on that.
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:17.440]   Is that becoming a burden on us to have to go through that?
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:21.360]   >> I think there's like two very different models right now and one is way better for
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:25.360]   consumers and one is way better for companies.
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:29.080]   There's no real subscription fatigue because you used to have to choose which magazines
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:30.080]   you subscribe to.
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:34.440]   There's never been a time when you could just get everything that you wanted.
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:36.800]   >> In a way, news plus is a better way.
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:42.200]   >> Well, you have Apple Music, which gives you or Spotify or a bunch of other services
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:43.720]   that give you all the music.
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:48.240]   And then you have news plus, which is texture, which gives you almost all the magazines.
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:52.640]   But what's happening with podcast and is what's happened with video, where every company wants
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:56.240]   their own service and you have to pay separately for Disney, separately for Warner, if you
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:58.960]   want the comic books done separately for Warner if you want.
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:41:59.960]   >> That's where you get it.
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:00.960]   >> Yeah, it's where the crowd wants.
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:01.960]   >> Yeah, and it feels like they're nickel and diming you.
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:02.960]   >> Yeah.
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:05.240]   >> Because you can't pay, so you can get all the music from anybody.
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:06.240]   >> Yes.
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:10.120]   >> But you can't get all the podcasts from somebody or all the TV shows from somebody.
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:15.120]   That would be the, then nobody would complain and say, well, I pay for music, TV shows,
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:16.400]   you know, podcasts, whatever.
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.800]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:20.560]   I don't have an opinion on it one way or the other.
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:23.600]   I mean, there's like three dozen you're going to have to get just to get like the videos
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:24.600]   that you want to watch now.
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:28.000]   And who knows how many, and you just said like there's going to be there's going to be Spotify
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.400]   with their podcast, there's Luminary with their podcast, What If I Want One For Me?
[00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:33.320]   Now I'm paying two subscriptions.
[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:34.320]   >> Somebody must believe in it.
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:36.240]   They raised $200 million.
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:37.240]   That's pretty impressive.
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:38.240]   >> All right.
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:39.240]   >> I thought it correlates though, right?
[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:43.000]   Is what we always call really, really between VC money raised and success adventure.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   >> No, no.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   >> No.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.960]   >> That's what happens in three years when it tanks or if sorry, if it tanks.
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:54.280]   >> VCs, you really have to realize the money comes from very fabulously rich people who
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:59.520]   are no longer content just to invest in the stock market and have, you know, oh, they're
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:00.880]   money double every four years.
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:02.840]   They want bigger returns.
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:07.160]   So they go to somebody who's got a fund and they say, look, here's, you know, here's my
[00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:08.160]   money.
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:11.320]   You know, I know you're going to have a bunch of bombs, but if you might have one hit that
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:15.320]   really they can triple my money that then I'm going to trust you to do that.
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:16.320]   >> They want the Google.
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:18.360]   >> They want the Google, the next Google, exactly.
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:19.360]   >> Yeah.
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:20.360]   >> Yeah.
[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:23.360]   So that doesn't, it's really, it's not dumb money, but it's not necessarily an indicator
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:25.360]   of the way it's going.
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:26.360]   >> No, it's investment banking.
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:29.960]   It's like they want one out of 50 to pay off and it's one of the other 49.
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:30.960]   They don't care about you.
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:31.960]   >> That's right.
[00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:35.240]   There's a reason why Google has an entire category simply called other bets and they
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:36.240]   call them bets.
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:37.240]   >> Right.
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:39.000]   They are bets, right.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.480]   Here comes Dub Dub DC.
[00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:44.720]   June 3rd.
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:46.040]   I'm excited.
[00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:48.320]   >> I'm sure, Rich, do you go to this every year?
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:50.880]   Is it important for you to go?
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:52.080]   >> I don't go every year.
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:55.640]   It is a very important.
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:59.280]   There will be some years that I will just go.
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:02.360]   This year is not one of them, unfortunately, but that's okay.
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:04.520]   >> Is it because you can learn everything online?
[00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:08.520]   I mean, Apple pretty much puts all the talks online eventually and stuff like that, right?
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:15.640]   >> Well, it's certainly handy that the most of the sessions go up online, not long after
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:17.040]   the conference.
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:23.280]   The thing that I always miss is what's called the hallway track, where you sort of randomly
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:24.920]   meet up with people.
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:34.320]   I miss the labs, but it is a decision that I have to consider pretty carefully every year.
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:37.720]   It's a week of work, in fact, that sort of stretches longer because of travel time and
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:38.720]   recovery.
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:40.960]   >> And not to mention the expense.
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:43.880]   >> Not to mention the expense, but I think it's a great event.
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:48.960]   If you signed up and won the lottery, then more power to go enjoy it, get something out
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:49.960]   of it.
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:54.440]   >> Do you look at what the new things you're going to be talking about are and judge it
[00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:55.440]   based on that?
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:56.920]   Do I need to know about Marzupan?
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:58.200]   Well, if I do, I'm going to go.
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:01.560]   If I don't, I don't go.
[00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:04.480]   >> I try not to.
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:06.120]   The rumors are the rumors.
[00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:11.440]   And of course, there are varying reliability and accuracy.
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:17.680]   We won't really know how accurate they were until the actual event.
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:22.480]   It's more for me a matter of, can I spare the time and expense to go?
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:28.160]   I don't usually think too much about what they might or might not be announcing because
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:30.160]   they're going to do what they're going to do with.
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:31.160]   >> You don't.
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:32.160]   Yeah, you can't judge.
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:38.160]   It does look like based on nine to five Macs, rundown, and this is Guillermo Rambo.
[00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:41.840]   >> Before you start that, I just say that when you show up at Dub Dub and you see Rich
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:44.960]   and Hawkenberry in the front row, you know it's going to be an exciting keynote.
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:45.960]   >> Yeah.
[00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:46.960]   >> Yeah.
[00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:49.280]   In the front row is an important seat.
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:50.280]   And that was last year.
[00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:52.080]   >> You were at least very loud.
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:54.840]   >> That was last year.
[00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:58.200]   This year looks like a lot of iOS stuff.
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:00.720]   Maybe that's just nine to five Macs bias.
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:05.120]   But they're talking about new Siri, intense Marzupan improvements, augmented reality,
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:08.840]   haptic engine, NFC, all of this is iOS stuff.
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:10.520]   >> I think they're doing them separately.
[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:13.880]   They seem to be releasing, like, trickling it out to us over the last couple, like every
[00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:16.160]   day you get a new little bite.
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:17.160]   >> Yeah.
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:20.400]   Will there be, I mean, Mac OS is pretty mature.
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:21.400]   I don't know.
[00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:22.400]   >> They had.
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:25.920]   I think a couple of days ago it was Siri shortcuts for Mac.
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:26.920]   >> Screen time.
[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:27.920]   >> And then was it a three or four?
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:28.920]   >> Yeah.
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:29.920]   >> Yeah, it's a screen time.
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:30.920]   >> And Marzupan is, I guess, a Mac technology.
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:32.520]   It's bringing iOS apps to Mac.
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:39.800]   So, once again, next time I'm more curious when they talk about new Mac apps as opposed
[00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:42.600]   to, "Hey, this thing from iOS, we're bringing it to the Mac."
[00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:43.880]   And that counts as a new Mac feature.
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:45.400]   We haven't totally abandoned it.
[00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:46.400]   >> Yeah.
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:49.200]   >> But shortcuts coming to the Mac is a good thing.
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:51.000]   That's a very good thing, yes.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.760]   Although, I think it's going to be interesting to see, because like, you just follow Steve
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:47:01.800]   Troughton Smith's excitement level over UIKit on the Mac and what a sort of, not only what
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:05.640]   it's going to enable for developers who are, because there's so many iOS developers,
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:09.760]   for them getting into the Mac market, but sort of how it's going to force a level of
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:13.760]   maturity and some of the technologies like split view and some parity between things
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:18.800]   like dark modes and Apple's own apps don't have future parity right now and sort of the
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:20.600]   discipline that might invest.
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:24.360]   I think there is a certain level of excitement around it.
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:29.720]   >> I just remember a day when we didn't celebrate the fact that the Mac has the same features
[00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:32.400]   as an iOS device.
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:36.920]   And we didn't necessarily, as a Mac user, I didn't necessarily celebrate that my iPad
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:38.840]   was getting the same features as my Mac.
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:43.400]   I used to celebrate that there is a really wonderful new discovery feature for Wi-Fi
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:45.520]   in the Mac.
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:49.800]   It's, again, I want to see the same enthusiasm for the Mac from Apple.
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:53.920]   >> You're kind of speaking to an older time though.
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:58.720]   The iPhone is the most popular thing and you have to kind of consider the fact that Apple
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:05.320]   has definitely hit that mark with the iPhone and now they're bringing people into the fold
[00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:06.720]   with Mac.
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:10.080]   They're saying now that you have an iPhone, when you love to have a Mac that works with
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:12.520]   your iPhone so you can do all these great things with it.
[00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:16.880]   So I think the idea that they're sort of, they're not merging the two, they're not making
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:19.520]   iOS the new platform for Mac.
[00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:25.040]   But I think the ability to merge the two is to make it more seamless user experience
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:26.080]   is a really good thing.
[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:30.760]   If you, especially if you come from iPhone first, which there are a lot of people that
[00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:32.720]   I've met that do that.
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:37.000]   They were on iOS, they were on an iPhone for years and they finally bit the bullet and
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.840]   went and got a Mac computer, a laptop usually.
[00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:45.600]   And if your user experience is as familiar to you as it is on iOS, then that's good for
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:46.600]   you.
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:47.840]   You appreciate it and you enjoy it more.
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:51.920]   And I think having these apps that kind of use that Mars, a pan idea of bringing them
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:56.160]   together in a more uniform way is a benefit to a lot of people.
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:49:03.400]   And I get that there's the old schoolers who, I want it like it used to be, but it's not.
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:08.440]   And I think bringing new people into the Mac sphere is a good thing.
[00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:14.960]   And it's not harming the Mac OS operating system to have a more seamless user interface
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:16.360]   between the two devices.
[00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:17.360]   Yeah.
[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:22.560]   I have to say that my disappointment is not that the Mac isn't like it used to be.
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:25.800]   My disappointment is that it's exactly like it used to be.
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:29.960]   It's like it used to be for the past two, three, four, five, six years almost.
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:35.360]   That the innovation that I'm seeing in pretty much every other operating system that's designed
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:40.520]   to be used for the keyboard and a trackpad, I'm not seeing that same movement in the Mac.
[00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:46.880]   The least exciting desktop in my office today is probably my Mac.
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:52.920]   I love my Mac the most, but really even my Raspberry Pi is more interesting in so many
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:55.440]   ways than the Mac desktop is.
[00:49:55.440 --> 00:50:00.280]   I really would like to see some sign from Apple that they really do care about it that
[00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:03.480]   I know there are people who are big fans of the Mac at Apple.
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:08.000]   I'm sure I know there are people who work very hard on it and who innovate as much as
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.440]   they possibly can.
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:15.840]   But I just don't see from that's from the other side of the keynote screen in the audience
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:19.600]   looking at what they choose to present and what they choose to actually ship.
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:24.520]   I'm not seeing any level of corporate interest in continuing the Mac.
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:25.920]   I think you're spot on.
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:32.280]   I think that Apple does think that the Mac is a we've our passion is in iOS devices.
[00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:35.280]   However, we have a tradition in desktops.
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:39.160]   We're not going to let that die because that's like giving away free money.
[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:45.040]   But we feel that it's most useful as a platform for people to develop things for iOS on or
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:51.080]   as a alternative to cheap or alternative to Windows notebooks and Chromebooks for people
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:53.720]   who own iPads and iPhones.
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:58.680]   I just don't see them take the I don't see them ever doing an ad that says here is a
[00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:02.240]   Macintosh boom here is a competing Windows device.
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:03.240]   Boom.
[00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:05.080]   Look how much better the Mac is than this other thing.
[00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:08.400]   I just don't see them ever taking that as a point of pride anymore.
[00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:11.640]   And I just don't know how that's going to feed.
[00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:15.440]   I don't I don't know how not making the Mac better and better and better is going to
[00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:20.560]   make better consumer Macs because you start off making high performance, you know, rockets
[00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:25.560]   and then two or three years later you figure out how to scale that down for actual users.
[00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:30.400]   They're just not developing the really, really good juicy bits that we really, really need
[00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:33.440]   as to keep the Mac as a viable thing.
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:37.400]   Rich Segal, you've been developing for the Mac for 25 years.
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:39.560]   You're a Mac stalwart.
[00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:43.720]   Do you worry about the future of the Mac at all?
[00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:46.360]   I see a lot of merit in Andy's points.
[00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:57.200]   I think that I would like to see Apple staying close as close as they can to the enthusiast
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:59.120]   audience for desktop hardware.
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:05.360]   I think that's important because the enthusiasts are what drives innovation.
[00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:11.320]   If you look and I'm going to apologize in advance because analogies to cars in the car
[00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:14.080]   industry are just so tired.
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:18.640]   But sometimes it works.
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:24.120]   The best vehicles come from manufacturers who build cars for the enthusiasts because
[00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:30.080]   those technologies end up making the rest of the product line better and more interesting.
[00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:40.200]   I would love to see Apple back when they were doomed and they built the fastest hardware
[00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:41.200]   on the planet.
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:48.360]   They had a compelling argument that PowerPC Macs were faster than Intel.
[00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:56.160]   Of course, now it is all Intel, but Apple's not using the fastest Intel hardware available,
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:59.960]   but all the commodity Windows boxes are.
[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:03.160]   I feel like there's a disconnect there.
[00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:09.840]   I feel like Apple could really benefit from taking a good hard look at the enthusiast
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:14.960]   audience and saying, "Okay, what are the people who are gaming need?
[00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:19.840]   What are people who are doing high-end, high-performance scientific computing?
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:22.000]   What do they need?
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:29.560]   What sort of big iron-use software developers really want to be more productive on the hardware
[00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:32.440]   side of things?"
[00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:38.840]   I have a 2018 MacBook Pro here that I just got a few months ago because the battery on
[00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:44.280]   my 2013 machine failed and I didn't want to wait a week for it to be repaired.
[00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:48.960]   I'm sure I had to swap a little battery.
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:54.520]   It's a swappable keyboard.
[00:53:54.520 --> 00:54:03.120]   I feel as though in some ways Apple has gotten away from things that were really beneficial
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:08.200]   to the audience, really beneficial to the platform for a variety of reasons which are
[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:12.600]   perfectly valid to an ongoing business.
[00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:15.800]   Replacable batteries are more expensive.
[00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:18.520]   They require a slightly larger enclosure.
[00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:22.680]   They're less space efficient.
[00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:27.320]   Upgradeable hardware has many of the same complaints, but there's a great deal to be
[00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:34.760]   said for anyone who has enough motivation to be able to replace a failed component in
[00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:40.200]   the field to upgrade to a newer version of some device which makes their computer better
[00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:43.320]   like a hard drive.
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:52.920]   The Mac hardware almost seems as though it has become more appliance-like in the same
[00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:58.680]   sense that iOS devices are.
[00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:02.920]   I don't love that.
[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:07.480]   So I take it, we're not going to see a marzipan version of yourself at any point.
[00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:09.800]   We need to reverse.
[00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:16.120]   Listening to the discussions about marzipan, I realized that if I had written bb edit for
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:20.440]   iOS first, it would be similar.
[00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:21.720]   How hard was it to put it?
[00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:24.760]   So bb edit was in the Mac App Store originally?
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:32.120]   Yeah, so bb edit was, I don't know if it was the first, but it was one of the very earliest
[00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:34.600]   third-party apps to be in the Mac App Store.
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:35.600]   Interesting.
[00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:41.120]   In 2011, and it was there for three and three quarters years.
[00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:51.840]   October 2014 was when we stopped offering bb edit in the Mac App Store.
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:58.040]   And a lot of time passed, there were a lot of conversations, a lot of evolution of both
[00:55:58.040 --> 00:56:01.680]   bb edit and the OS and the App Store.
[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:05.360]   And now here we are again.
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:10.520]   The reason you pulled out in the first place was that apps in the App Store were limited
[00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:11.880]   in the kinds of things it could do.
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:16.160]   And you felt like bb edit needed to have those capabilities.
[00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:24.480]   Yeah, there were a lot of limitations that we sort of had to live with at the time, certain
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:31.800]   features that couldn't be made to work, certain features that were simply not allowed because
[00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:34.800]   of the App Store rules and regulations.
[00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:35.800]   Yeah.
[00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:40.040]   And did they loosen up on those?
[00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:42.720]   Or did you find new ways to accomplish what you wanted to do?
[00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:45.000]   Or did you give up on those features?
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.960]   So the third question is easy to answer.
[00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:49.480]   We haven't given up on anything.
[00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:51.200]   Okay, good.
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:58.000]   What we found was that beginning with macOS Mojave, there were facilities added to the
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:02.640]   OS that made it possible to do the things that we needed to do.
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:08.560]   So that is actually why bb edit in the Mac App Store requires macOS Mojave, whereas the
[00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:14.320]   direct versions can run on older versions of the OS because their facilities new to Mojave
[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:16.720]   that let the App Store version do these things.
[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:19.560]   Can you say what some of those things were?
[00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:29.200]   Yeah, so one of bb edits, two bb edits, more technical features but very widely used, rely
[00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:38.160]   on the ability to escalate privileges that is you get prompted for an administrator password
[00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:46.320]   so that in bb edit you can install the command line tools and then tie it to Unix workflows.
[00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:52.560]   You also have the ability in bb edit to make changes to files that you don't own under
[00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:59.880]   Unix's permissions and that sort of privilege escalation is something that was not ever
[00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:09.480]   supported by the OS directly and the workarounds, the solutions that we and other similar developers
[00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:14.520]   used were not allowed in the App Store.
[00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:22.280]   So the OS has a facility to support this now for specific operations, which just happened
[00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:23.280]   to be the ones we need to use.
[00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:25.440]   I mean it's clear why Apple would do that.
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:30.120]   They don't want, I mean privilege escalation is a really big issue when it comes to malware
[00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:35.520]   and so they wanted to protect users against malicious applications and so that makes a
[00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:39.960]   lot of sense but also I think the compromised solution seems to make a lot of sense.
[00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:41.400]   You know what else makes a lot of sense?
[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:47.840]   The rebus on the back of my back.
[00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:52.480]   I'm wearing that.
[00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:57.320]   This is the bb edit 2015 anniversary t-shirt.
[00:58:57.320 --> 00:58:58.320]   That is so cute.
[00:58:58.320 --> 00:58:59.320]   Isn't that nice?
[00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:00.320]   That's awesome.
[00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:01.320]   Yes.
[00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:04.880]   I have to thank Rich for sending me a couple of those because I love them.
[00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:10.440]   And I also thank Rich for bb edit which I've used for years and is probably one of the
[00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:13.920]   very first apps I install on any new Macintosh.
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:19.520]   Now I have a license obviously I have since bb edit 5 but how do I get the app store version?
[00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:22.560]   What happens to me there?
[00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:27.000]   So the world is, in the licensing sense the world is kind of split.
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:33.480]   One of the other evolutions that took place was that the subscription model came to the
[00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:35.880]   Mac App Store.
[00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:45.480]   And so what we ended up having to do here was what we wanted to do was to give our customers
[00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:51.800]   a choice because subscriptions even though in one sense they've been around for a long
[00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:57.840]   time and everybody sort of accepts the notion of paying on an ongoing basis for product
[00:59:57.840 --> 00:59:59.440]   or service.
[00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:05.960]   In some parts of the audience, some parts of the market, they're still a very new thing.
[01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:13.040]   I don't remember when it was that Adobe started charging a subscription fee for Creative Suite.
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:16.960]   It was very controversial but now we all kind of settle down.
[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:22.440]   Yeah, it was extremely controversial at the time and a lot of folks had to go through
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:28.160]   the five stages of subscription grief.
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:35.080]   And so we're seeing a little bit of that now but to get back on topic, what we're doing
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:41.960]   is for our current customers, if you're not in the Mac App Store and you want what we call
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:47.680]   the perpetual license where you buy a license to the version you have, we're still doing
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:49.000]   that.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:56.440]   That's outside of the Mac App Store because the rules and mechanics sort of require it.
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:00.480]   Inside of the Mac App Store, the way we're able to make a viable business out of it is
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:03.800]   to offer a subscription.
[01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:09.680]   So in either case, you've got 30 days to use BBEdit.
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:12.800]   You get all the features, everything's there.
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:18.200]   After the evaluation period is over, there is what we call free mode.
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:22.720]   And free mode sort of fulfills a lot of needs.
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:25.120]   For most people, it's everything you need.
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:27.720]   Is it text Wrangler basically?
[01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:33.080]   It's sort of text Wrangler plus and you sort of beat me to it here because one of the things
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:37.840]   that free mode does is it gives us the transition from text Wrangler.
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:43.240]   So if you're using text Wrangler now and you're running macOS 10, 12 or later, go get BBEdit
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:44.240]   from our website.
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:46.920]   It's a better product anyway.
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:47.920]   It's 64-bit.
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:52.440]   It's got a lot of refinements and polish over the text Wrangler you've been using.
[01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:57.560]   And also the OS won't bark at you about running a 32-bit application.
[01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:05.560]   So BBEdit in free mode is text Wrangler plus a whole plus five years worth of refinement
[01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:09.040]   and a few additional features.
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:11.840]   And in the App Store, it is the same.
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:17.880]   If you keep using BBEdit after those first 30 days are up, you get free mode.
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:22.040]   The difference is inside of the App Store, you can sign up for a subscription.
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:25.920]   You have monthly or annual.
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:29.640]   And outside of the App Store, you can buy a license from us.
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:31.320]   Other than that, the products are identical.
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:32.640]   They do the same things.
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:37.440]   There's no compromises, which was very important to us.
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:42.760]   We had, back in the past, we had a lot of confusion because customers would say, "Oh,
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:45.200]   I'm using BBEdit, but it doesn't do this."
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:49.520]   Well, sorry, you got it from the App Store and we can't do that.
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:51.680]   And those days are over.
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:53.960]   Now both products function identically.
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:03:00.160]   They look identical except for the small differences because of the licensing model.
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:05.000]   And so we're very happy about that, about being able to do that.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:13.160]   Also either way, whether you get BBEdit from us directly or from the Mac App Store, you
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:16.360]   get our customer service and tech support.
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:18.880]   And that's the kind of thing.
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:24.160]   Excuse me, that's the kind of customer service you can't really get anywhere anymore.
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:27.320]   It's so expensive to offer it.
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:32.480]   And if somebody that's built or sent you an app, I completely sympathize with the need
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:33.480]   to do this.
[01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:35.760]   It actually makes sense.
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:39.080]   But we've been spoiled over the years by paying a flat fee.
[01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:44.920]   But if you get $50 from somebody and they haven't paid you in 10 years, and I know I
[01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:54.440]   still find Mac apps like I think of one of my favorite Mac apps, SuperDuber, which I
[01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:58.360]   when I look at the licenses like 10 years, more than 10 years old.
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:00.680]   And I feel kind of bad using it.
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:04.240]   I almost want to send the guy more money.
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:09.280]   And if you then put tech support on top of that, which is hugely expensive, you're not
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:10.600]   going to have any profit at all.
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:13.960]   So I understand why you need to do that.
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:19.600]   Yeah, it's really, I mean, there are a lot of issues sort of tied up in there.
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:25.240]   Providing tech support is a direct cost.
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:28.040]   It's funny you mentioned SuperDuber Dave Nanyan is a good man.
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:29.240]   He's a friend of mine.
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:32.400]   He's a fellow Rhode Islander.
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:34.000]   And so that sort of keeps it all in the family.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000]   I know a guy.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.800]   I know a guy.
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:43.840]   And honestly, I don't know how he does it except that I think he, I think he, I think
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:47.600]   he probably sells a new license every time somebody buys a new Mac.
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:48.600]   I think so.
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:54.320]   I tell, I pay, I pay him by telling everybody, if you have a Mac, you have to have SuperDuber.
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:57.080]   And that's kind of what I tell, tell all my friends to.
[01:04:57.080 --> 01:05:00.080]   And be the edit.
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:07.680]   And, and, and also it's tough because a long time ago, the Mac app store, and this is definitely
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:08.680]   in the past.
[01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:16.040]   Talking about current, current operations, but a long time ago, the Mac, the app store sort
[01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:20.800]   of created this expectation that you can pay once for an app and never have to pay for
[01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:21.800]   it again.
[01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:22.800]   Right.
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:24.800]   And that is literally true.
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:25.800]   Right.
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:27.400]   You, you could do that.
[01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:32.240]   But there's nobody who does that and is able to build a sustainable business on it.
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:33.240]   Excuse me.
[01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:37.880]   Either they lose interest and move on to something else and abandon the app that you paid for.
[01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:41.480]   Or they go out of business.
[01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:42.480]   Yeah.
[01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:47.560]   Or they put out a, you know, another version and then people acting or digging it because
[01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:50.280]   they have to have paid for another version.
[01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:55.680]   I can, I completely agree that the subscription model, especially for certain kinds of apps
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:06:00.120]   that need a cloud service and, and tech support and things like that, the subscription model
[01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:04.040]   is the best way to help support that, that developer.
[01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:09.000]   And because just like you're, like you're saying that people got used to either free
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:15.920]   or 99 cent apps or you pay once and you get it forever, that there's this expectation
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:18.760]   that that is just not sustainable.
[01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:23.880]   Rich, if you had your druthers, if there was no, if you could have it your way, would you
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:29.360]   prefer users subscribe or buy a license?
[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:35.320]   I think I would still prefer the perpetual license model where you buy a license and
[01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:37.360]   we can offer you discounted upgrades.
[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:38.360]   Yeah.
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:40.280]   Because you do upgrades every few years.
[01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:43.240]   So you do have a steady revenue stream that way.
[01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:44.240]   Yeah.
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:48.080]   That's, that's historically how we've, how we've done it is to sell upgrades.
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:53.400]   I would love to be able to do that in the Mac App Store.
[01:06:53.400 --> 01:07:00.360]   And I also have to work with the reality of what's there.
[01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:06.760]   And so the, you know, the goal for me and my colleagues is build a sustainable business
[01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:09.560]   selling BB at it.
[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:16.240]   And the mechanics for doing that inside the App Store today involve subscriptions.
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:23.380]   Outside of the App Store, we can keep doing what we're doing and sell licenses and upgrades.
[01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:24.380]   And as I said, sorry.
[01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:25.380]   Oh, no, go ahead.
[01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:27.380]   French, you thought I'm sorry.
[01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:29.140]   I was going to ask a question.
[01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:35.260]   So as I said before, historically we've worked very hard at making sure that our customers
[01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:36.620]   have a choice.
[01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:39.300]   So we're not forcing anybody into subscriptions.
[01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:43.260]   We're not forcing anybody into perpetual licenses.
[01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:44.700]   The choice is there.
[01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:49.180]   And I said, we have, I don't think anybody's asked you a question yet that has forced you
[01:07:49.180 --> 01:07:52.180]   to, to plead the Fifth Amendment yet.
[01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:58.620]   So I'll, I'll, I'll dive in and ask you if there's one aspect of having an app in the
[01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:02.140]   App Store, you could magically wish into the cornfield.
[01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:03.620]   What would it be?
[01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:19.340]   As a developer, I think what I would really like to be able to do is connect with my customers.
[01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:27.460]   The rules of the App Store, Apple's, Apple's own privacy rules, make it verboten for developers
[01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:30.580]   to request personal information from their customers.
[01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:35.540]   So there's, there's no way unless the customer writes to us and says, I got BB edit from
[01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:39.980]   the App Store.
[01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:43.580]   Absent that, we have no way of knowing who our customers are.
[01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:47.180]   And I would love a better way to connect with our customers.
[01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:52.780]   I'm glad you're going to ask them for Avengers Endgame spoilers and I was about to just cover
[01:08:52.780 --> 01:08:53.780]   them.
[01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:59.020]   I know you haven't watched it yet.
[01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:00.020]   Isn't there?
[01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:01.340]   Some people already watching that.
[01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:02.940]   I wasn't on the red carpet.
[01:09:02.940 --> 01:09:07.900]   Sadly, Chris Evans and Scarlett invited me, but I just couldn't make it in time.
[01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:08.900]   I'm actually glad.
[01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:09.900]   It's because you were flooded.
[01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:14.660]   I'm glad I mentioned Superduper because Gardner and a chatroom pointed out that Dave also wrote
[01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:17.380]   a brief, which kind of blows me away.
[01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:24.380]   I mean, that is a legendary text editor, DOS based text editor.
[01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:30.580]   And frankly, I think Steve Gibson still uses brief to code in Mazem.
[01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:34.220]   So he's got at least still got one user out there.
[01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:36.620]   The factual license didn't pay off tonight.
[01:09:36.620 --> 01:09:37.620]   Yeah, really.
[01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:39.060]   Wow, that was a great way.
[01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:40.060]   That's amazing.
[01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:42.980]   That's the thing about text editors.
[01:09:42.980 --> 01:09:51.300]   The thing is, the usefulness, the utility of a text file has not gone away.
[01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:56.700]   Asking is going to turn out to be one of the most important standards ever created for
[01:09:56.700 --> 01:09:57.700]   the community.
[01:09:57.700 --> 01:09:59.220]   It's papyrus for the computer world.
[01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:02.020]   I mean, it's, you know, it's, yeah.
[01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:08.340]   It's like, it's not like an Adobe product where if you stop paying your license fee,
[01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:11.060]   oh no, I can't open these text files anymore.
[01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:13.580]   Oh, you're not, that lock in is not a problem.
[01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:14.580]   Yeah.
[01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:15.580]   Right.
[01:10:15.580 --> 01:10:19.020]   I love my favorite, and I've mentioned this before, my favorite BB edit feature is that
[01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:24.260]   I can use the command line in BB edit and have an editable record of everything I've
[01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:25.260]   typed in.
[01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:26.260]   I just love that.
[01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:29.380]   And I don't know if you got that from the Mac programmers workshop, MPW way back when,
[01:10:29.380 --> 01:10:32.020]   but it was also my favorite feature in MPW.
[01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:34.180]   So I'm really glad to still have that capability.
[01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:35.180]   I think it's.
[01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:41.020]   Yeah, MPW worksheets were definitely the inspiration for, for, for shell worksheets.
[01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:48.380]   And BB edit, but we couldn't do them without the Mac or as having accessible Unix infrastructure.
[01:10:48.380 --> 01:10:52.340]   The main reason I still use a Mac.
[01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:54.140]   Honestly.
[01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:55.140]   Yeah.
[01:10:55.140 --> 01:10:56.140]   Go ahead.
[01:10:56.140 --> 01:11:00.580]   No, it's just like, I don't just, just the grip feature alone.
[01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:01.580]   Oh, the gravity.
[01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:02.580]   The BB edit is absolutely.
[01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:07.580]   It's like the ability to simply say that the number of times when I was like, when I
[01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:14.300]   was still like working in computer labs, where like I would solve a problem in 18 minutes,
[01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:18.300]   when someone had given me two days to bash a text file and I would have like two days
[01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:23.580]   to go play mini golf just because I knew I'm just enough rep to do a massive search
[01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:26.820]   and replace conditionally in, in BB edit.
[01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:29.940]   It's like I still can't count the number of lunches that I owe rich in the rest of the
[01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:30.940]   team.
[01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:32.780]   Rich has written in a full grab into a BB edit.
[01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:33.780]   I really good one.
[01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:35.900]   Very, very powerful.
[01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:37.420]   There is time.
[01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:38.980]   There's a tagline in there somewhere.
[01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:41.700]   Like now you've got time for mini golf.
[01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:42.700]   Yep.
[01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:46.980]   Find Galaxy Fold release date replaced with TV.
[01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:50.140]   Hey, we should mention that.
[01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:51.140]   Yeah.
[01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:53.660]   The Galaxy Fold was slated to come out on Friday.
[01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:59.460]   I was ready to go to the T-Mobile store on Thursday and get one because I missed out on
[01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:00.460]   the pre-order.
[01:12:00.460 --> 01:12:02.460]   I guess I'm lucky.
[01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:04.900]   They shipped thousands and singles.
[01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:05.900]   Yeah.
[01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:07.140]   One thousand nine or eight bucks.
[01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:08.860]   I mean, it's not cheap.
[01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:14.220]   They shipped out review units to mark his Brownlee, Joanna Stern.
[01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:15.380]   We have two or three of them.
[01:12:15.380 --> 01:12:16.540]   They're fine, by the way.
[01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:17.540]   Oh, interesting.
[01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:19.860]   I'm more has some.
[01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:22.500]   I'm thinking of the people who's broke.
[01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:23.860]   Mark Germans broke.
[01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:26.220]   All the three people I've mentioned so far broke.
[01:12:26.220 --> 01:12:29.220]   Dieter Bones, Steve Kovac.
[01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:30.220]   Yeah.
[01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:34.460]   And there was a fifth one in Europe who got the same bumps that Dieter got, but he figures
[01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:36.260]   his debris, fell out the opposite way.
[01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:37.260]   So he was fine.
[01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:43.220]   Dieter says that the verge that in the photo shoot, they use this putty to hold the phone
[01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:45.500]   up and he thinks the putty got into the hinge.
[01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:47.380]   And that's what bulged up his phone.
[01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:51.780]   Joanna Stern did what a lot of people did because when you get, when I got the Galaxy
[01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:54.380]   S10, there's a screen protector on it.
[01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:55.540]   I don't like screen protectors.
[01:12:55.540 --> 01:12:58.260]   So she thought, oh, there's a screen, but she started to peel it.
[01:12:58.260 --> 01:12:59.940]   So little corner's coming up.
[01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:02.300]   And then she realized, maybe I shouldn't.
[01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:03.300]   But Steve Kovac.
[01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:07.180]   It shows how tenacious Germans is because he got that whole thing off.
[01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:08.180]   German broke that off.
[01:13:08.180 --> 01:13:09.900]   He got the whole thing off.
[01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:14.620]   Samsung neglected to mention apparently, there's some dispute of that, that you shouldn't
[01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:15.620]   peel that off.
[01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:16.620]   It's integral to the screen.
[01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:18.940]   And if you do, you will break the screen.
[01:13:18.940 --> 01:13:26.540]   But all of those reviewers we mentioned have broken folds, which is not a good sign two
[01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:27.540]   days in.
[01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:28.540]   Yeah.
[01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:33.260]   Samsung announced yesterday that they are not going to release it on Friday after all.
[01:13:33.260 --> 01:13:37.980]   I really want to, I really wish there was someone recording that meeting.
[01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:40.020]   I want to see what that PowerPoint looked like.
[01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:47.020]   Say, ladies and gentlemen of the board, we have boxes of angry wasps already to send
[01:13:47.020 --> 01:13:49.140]   to the stores all across the world.
[01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:53.780]   Now, do we send the boxes of angry wasps or we decide that maybe that would cause some
[01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:59.100]   problems for us that could be abdicated if we simply didn't willingly send boxes that
[01:13:59.100 --> 01:14:03.660]   we know are filled with angry wasps to our customers who have just given us to that.
[01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:08.540]   Would that affect the buzz, so to speak, of our product?
[01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:13.740]   It's, yeah, it's actually the actual press release is not far off any.
[01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:19.340]   While many reviewers shared with us the vast potential they see, some also showed us how
[01:14:19.340 --> 01:14:24.620]   the device needs further improvements that can ensure the best possible user experience.
[01:14:24.620 --> 01:14:29.220]   Yeah, not break in the first two days would be a good start to fully evaluate this feedback
[01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:31.180]   and run further internal tests.
[01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:34.540]   We have decided to delay the release of the galaxy fold.
[01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:39.580]   Initial findings from the inspection of reported issues on the display showed they could be
[01:14:39.580 --> 01:14:44.740]   associated with impact on the top and bottom exposed areas of the hinge.
[01:14:44.740 --> 01:14:49.700]   There was an also an instance where substances found inside the device, affected the display
[01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:50.700]   performance.
[01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:55.900]   We will take measures to strengthen the display protection will also enhance the guidance on
[01:14:55.900 --> 01:15:00.940]   care and use of the display, including a big message on the box when you open a thing.
[01:15:00.940 --> 01:15:04.780]   Don't take off the protective layer, whatever you do.
[01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:06.780]   Warning live bees inside.
[01:15:06.780 --> 01:15:10.140]   It's the ingress though, because they didn't provide any ingress rating, which they do
[01:15:10.140 --> 01:15:11.140]   on all their other phones.
[01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:14.580]   And when you look at Deeter's video, you can see the gaps when he's opening and closing
[01:15:14.580 --> 01:15:15.580]   it.
[01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:17.780]   It's opening and closing and humans are filthy creatures.
[01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:20.980]   I would really like one of these phones.
[01:15:20.980 --> 01:15:24.060]   I like the principle of it.
[01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:28.820]   But I guess I was going to go down and buy one, even though it's so expensive.
[01:15:28.820 --> 01:15:33.020]   In fact, even after we started hearing of these issues, but now I can't.
[01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:35.940]   So I'm not sure how long it'll be postponed.
[01:15:35.940 --> 01:15:37.540]   Some are saying a month.
[01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:40.660]   I wouldn't be surprised if Samsung scraps the whole project.
[01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:42.900]   Leo, eventually you'll fold and get one.
[01:15:42.900 --> 01:15:43.900]   I will fold.
[01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:44.900]   Hey.
[01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:46.900]   You'll become money hinged.
[01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:49.220]   I will fold and become unhinged.
[01:15:49.220 --> 01:15:52.780]   Yeah, another question I wanted to ask Rich, but I'm going to take a break and we'll do
[01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:55.180]   it after the break.
[01:15:55.180 --> 01:15:59.100]   This was the thing I brought up at the very last minute last week about notarizing your
[01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:10.500]   app and the text in the Apple note that said that beginning 10, 14, 5 Mac OS, all software
[01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:15.540]   -- or actually some future version of Mac OS, notarization will be required.
[01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:20.660]   And I wanted to ask Rich what his reading is on that because it scared me, but maybe
[01:16:20.660 --> 01:16:22.140]   I shouldn't be scared.
[01:16:22.140 --> 01:16:25.940]   Before we do, though, let me tell you where you can sell your Galaxy Fold.
[01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:26.940]   No.
[01:16:26.940 --> 01:16:33.740]   But I will tell you about Gazelle, the place to buy and sell your gadgets.
[01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:39.020]   Gazelle is a great online marketplace for buying certified pre-owned devices.
[01:16:39.020 --> 01:16:46.340]   If you had the money set aside to buy a Galaxy Fold, maybe you should instead go to Gazelle,
[01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:51.660]   take a few hundred of those 2000s and get a device in great condition.
[01:16:51.660 --> 01:16:56.260]   Actually, you could choose fair, good, or excellent condition, but in every case, great
[01:16:56.260 --> 01:16:57.260]   prices.
[01:16:57.260 --> 01:17:03.140]   Everything from the iPhone 6 through the iPhone 10, a variety of Samsung Galaxy phones, MacBooks,
[01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:06.220]   Air and Pro and iPad, standard Air and Pro.
[01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:08.900]   Here's the reason I like buying from Gazelle.
[01:17:08.900 --> 01:17:13.100]   Every device goes through a thorough 30-point inspection.
[01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:18.580]   They're backed also by a 30-day return policy without there's no restocking fee and shipping
[01:17:18.580 --> 01:17:19.580]   is free.
[01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:24.420]   So really, there's no risk, but you're going to get a great product, but should anything
[01:17:24.420 --> 01:17:30.020]   not be up to snuff from your point of view, it costs you nothing to return it.
[01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:33.100]   All of their products are sold without carrier contract.
[01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:34.740]   I like that too.
[01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:37.780]   And they all work with major carriers or unlocked.
[01:17:37.780 --> 01:17:41.140]   Plus, they have financing at checkout with a firm.
[01:17:41.140 --> 01:17:45.420]   You can get instantly improved, pay it off in three, six or 12 months, and that's right
[01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:46.420]   at checkout.
[01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:47.620]   It's very easy to do.
[01:17:47.620 --> 01:17:51.980]   With Gazelle's incredible selection of quality pre-owned devices, they're a great choice
[01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:57.660]   for students, parents who have to buy phones for their kids, parents who broke their phones
[01:17:57.660 --> 01:17:59.980]   and now have to buy a new one.
[01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:03.340]   If you don't know what to do with your old devices, check out Gazelle for great offers
[01:18:03.340 --> 01:18:05.740]   on your used phones, tablets and computers.
[01:18:05.740 --> 01:18:09.220]   But don't forget, you can also buy certified pre-owned devices.
[01:18:09.220 --> 01:18:14.140]   And right now, if you go to Gazelle.com/twit, you'll get 10% off your purchase.
[01:18:14.140 --> 01:18:17.380]   Gazelle, G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com/twit.
[01:18:17.380 --> 01:18:21.340]   It is a good way to save Mother Earth.
[01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:24.740]   You know, why send that old phone to landfill?
[01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:28.700]   You could find a good home at Gazelle.
[01:18:28.700 --> 01:18:37.300]   So I probably went off half-cocked, but I did note that Apple has said that at some point,
[01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:41.460]   notarization will be required by default for all software.
[01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:48.100]   Notarization, as Laurie explained to me last week, is really just kind of like using certificates.
[01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:49.780]   It's just an extra step.
[01:18:49.780 --> 01:18:54.300]   Does this mean in your opinion rich that a developer will have to send all of their
[01:18:54.300 --> 01:19:01.020]   apps to Apple for notarization before they can be released and run?
[01:19:01.020 --> 01:19:10.220]   My reading of and understanding of the news based on Apple's own notes is that the current
[01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:19.820]   10, 14, 5 notarization is for developers whose certificates have been issued after a certain
[01:19:19.820 --> 01:19:20.820]   date.
[01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:22.820]   Or if they're new to developers.
[01:19:22.820 --> 01:19:23.820]   Yeah.
[01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:31.380]   If your new developer beginning with 10, 14, 5, you will have to notarize your app in order
[01:19:31.380 --> 01:19:35.020]   for it to run on macOS 10, 14, 5.
[01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:41.020]   Could I as a user defeat Gatekeeper and say, "No, no, no, run it anyway?"
[01:19:41.020 --> 01:19:43.940]   You can tell Gatekeeper to open anything.
[01:19:43.940 --> 01:19:44.940]   Okay.
[01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:48.820]   There are certain explicit gestures that you have to do.
[01:19:48.820 --> 01:19:50.060]   That was my only real concern.
[01:19:50.060 --> 01:19:51.300]   I don't want to have...
[01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:56.860]   I don't want to only be able to get apps that Apple has approved, like on the iPhone.
[01:19:56.860 --> 01:20:05.380]   You have to right click on the application and choose open and you make it a warning
[01:20:05.380 --> 01:20:10.460]   from the OS and you click open anyway and it goes ahead and opens it.
[01:20:10.460 --> 01:20:17.140]   So I don't think that there's going to be a problem for users who want to run anything.
[01:20:17.140 --> 01:20:18.660]   Good.
[01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:26.900]   But it appears going forward from context in that note that the next major version of
[01:20:26.900 --> 01:20:33.340]   macOS will require notarization for an app to run signed with a developer ID certificate.
[01:20:33.340 --> 01:20:39.540]   Again, that may have to do with when the cert was issued or when the application was
[01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:40.900]   notarized.
[01:20:40.900 --> 01:20:42.980]   That's a little too soon to tell.
[01:20:42.980 --> 01:20:49.700]   But I suspect you'll be able to continue to override that in Gatekeeper.
[01:20:49.700 --> 01:20:51.900]   You suspect, but don't, aren't you?
[01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:58.660]   I suspect, but you won't know more about that until WWDC and Apple makes their developer
[01:20:58.660 --> 01:20:59.660]   announcements.
[01:20:59.660 --> 01:21:00.660]   Okay.
[01:21:00.660 --> 01:21:02.620]   I understand the need for code signing.
[01:21:02.620 --> 01:21:05.300]   I think it's a great thing and I encourage that.
[01:21:05.300 --> 01:21:09.580]   I also think it's really important for me to be able to write an app that I can run on
[01:21:09.580 --> 01:21:13.460]   my own machine and for me to get apps from other people that aren't necessarily Apple
[01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:19.540]   developers or aren't necessarily notarized by Apple with, you know, at my own risk, but
[01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:21.540]   there's plenty of cases for that.
[01:21:21.540 --> 01:21:22.540]   Yeah.
[01:21:22.540 --> 01:21:29.420]   Notarization is there to sort of solve a general case of developer signed applications outside
[01:21:29.420 --> 01:21:33.300]   of the app store that haven't gone through Apple's review processes.
[01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:38.020]   It's pretty clear that user security and privacy are extremely important to Apple and they
[01:21:38.020 --> 01:21:42.620]   want to be able to cover that ground as thoroughly as possible.
[01:21:42.620 --> 01:21:43.620]   So I get it.
[01:21:43.620 --> 01:21:46.700]   I don't have any problem with Notarization.
[01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:51.980]   When they announced it last year, we just started doing it.
[01:21:51.980 --> 01:21:57.220]   It was easy enough to do and we were very happy to work with some of the technical folks
[01:21:57.220 --> 01:22:02.940]   inside to kind of smooth out the developer workflows and come up with some ways to make
[01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:03.940]   it work for us.
[01:22:03.940 --> 01:22:04.940]   Yeah, that's the other question.
[01:22:04.940 --> 01:22:05.940]   It's not an approval.
[01:22:05.940 --> 01:22:07.700]   It's not like an app store approval process.
[01:22:07.700 --> 01:22:08.700]   Or not.
[01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:12.300]   It's pretty automated, right?
[01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:15.300]   As far as I know it is completely automated.
[01:22:15.300 --> 01:22:21.420]   They look for certain malware patterns, characteristic bit patterns inside of your application.
[01:22:21.420 --> 01:22:27.020]   They do thoroughly check to make sure that the application is correctly signed with a
[01:22:27.020 --> 01:22:31.180]   valid certificate, which actually worked pretty well for us.
[01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:37.620]   It was a we were able to sort out a couple of signing glitches when we started notarizing.
[01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:39.140]   That would have affected anybody.
[01:22:39.140 --> 01:22:44.660]   But of course, it's good to get this stuff right.
[01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:49.860]   And so when an app is notarized, that doesn't say anything about its quality or what it does
[01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:52.700]   necessarily.
[01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:57.740]   But there are certain restrictions that come along with being notarized.
[01:22:57.740 --> 01:23:02.820]   In order to be notarized, you have to sign the application to use something called the
[01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:05.420]   hardened runtime.
[01:23:05.420 --> 01:23:13.380]   And you can think of it as a very limited set of restrictions in which an application has
[01:23:13.380 --> 01:23:18.340]   to declare what it's going to do if it wants to do anything sensitive.
[01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:24.220]   So if it's going to access your address book, it has to declare in various static signed
[01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:26.140]   ways that it's going to do this.
[01:23:26.140 --> 01:23:32.700]   If it's going to send events to other applications, Apple events, it has to declare that it's
[01:23:32.700 --> 01:23:33.700]   going to do this.
[01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:39.340]   If you don't declare intention and then try to do something that requires it, the OS will
[01:23:39.340 --> 01:23:40.980]   actually shut your app down.
[01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:41.980]   >> Nice.
[01:23:41.980 --> 01:23:42.980]   >> It's so in order--
[01:23:42.980 --> 01:23:44.940]   >> That's like iOS intents, right?
[01:23:44.940 --> 01:23:47.220]   >> Yeah, in some ways, yeah.
[01:23:47.220 --> 01:23:52.340]   So in order to be notarized, you have to be using the hardened runtime.
[01:23:52.340 --> 01:23:58.580]   And so there is that extra measure of security and user assurance that goes along with it.
[01:23:58.580 --> 01:24:02.060]   >> Any other questions?
[01:24:02.060 --> 01:24:03.620]   >> Sure, we'll move on.
[01:24:03.620 --> 01:24:07.820]   I also owe an Apple another apology because I mocked Liam.
[01:24:07.820 --> 01:24:08.820]   I did.
[01:24:08.820 --> 01:24:09.820]   >> You did.
[01:24:09.820 --> 01:24:11.820]   >> I mocked Liam the disassembling robot.
[01:24:11.820 --> 01:24:13.940]   And of course, Liam has been replaced by Daisy.
[01:24:13.940 --> 01:24:17.300]   And I said, what, they got one robot?
[01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:20.060]   How many iPhones could that possibly disassemble?
[01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:21.060]   Well, Apple has--
[01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:22.060]   >> Because it mocks a robot.
[01:24:22.060 --> 01:24:26.060]   >> I mocked many robots, much to my peril.
[01:24:26.060 --> 01:24:27.060]   But I'm an old man.
[01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:30.940]   I don't expect to live into the era of robots, so I'll be all right.
[01:24:30.940 --> 01:24:35.860]   As long as the robots don't hold my children and held it against my children, I'm okay.
[01:24:35.860 --> 01:24:40.380]   Turns out Daisy can disassemble 1.2 million phones a year.
[01:24:40.380 --> 01:24:45.460]   Now, Apple sells a lot more than that, but still, that's pretty darn impressive.
[01:24:45.460 --> 01:24:47.820]   Nice job, Daisy.
[01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:51.620]   And Daisy is going to start disassembling and recycling iPhones.
[01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:52.860]   Select used iPhones.
[01:24:52.860 --> 01:25:00.860]   Return to Best Buy stores throughout the US and retailers in the Netherlands at KPN.
[01:25:00.860 --> 01:25:03.580]   Or if you recycle it through the Apple store.
[01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:07.460]   So Daisy's keeping pretty busy.
[01:25:07.460 --> 01:25:11.500]   Apple's received nearly 1 million devices in the years they've been doing this recycling
[01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:12.500]   program.
[01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:18.620]   In 2018, Apple refurbished more than 7.8 million Apple devices.
[01:25:18.620 --> 01:25:21.060]   One of the things they do is they get the cobalt out of there.
[01:25:21.060 --> 01:25:27.020]   And that, of course, is a very controversial part of lithium ion batteries.
[01:25:27.020 --> 01:25:30.860]   Everything it means, fewer children in mines and things like that.
[01:25:30.860 --> 01:25:33.340]   So I apologize.
[01:25:33.340 --> 01:25:35.940]   200 iPhones an hour, Daisy can do.
[01:25:35.940 --> 01:25:37.940]   That'd be nice.
[01:25:37.940 --> 01:25:39.740]   Maybe they can make some more daisies.
[01:25:39.740 --> 01:25:45.380]   Yeah, did you hear that for the Japan Olympics, they're going to be making the metals out of
[01:25:45.380 --> 01:25:46.380]   recycled electronics?
[01:25:46.380 --> 01:25:47.580]   Isn't that awesome?
[01:25:47.580 --> 01:25:54.380]   So a new iPhone will either cost you $1,000 or eight years of training starting at age
[01:25:54.380 --> 01:25:55.380]   nine.
[01:25:55.380 --> 01:26:01.020]   So if you're not going to Gazelle and bringing your iPhones to Gazelle, I would encourage
[01:26:01.020 --> 01:26:04.100]   you if you're going to get a new iPhone to recycle it through Apple.
[01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:08.820]   Because that way, Daisy, Daisy will get her claws on it.
[01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:10.900]   That's got to be painful to watch.
[01:26:10.900 --> 01:26:12.700]   Just seeing all those.
[01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:13.700]   Disassembled.
[01:26:13.700 --> 01:26:14.700]   Perfectly good.
[01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:18.140]   I used to work in a department store.
[01:26:18.140 --> 01:26:23.020]   And I still have nightmares about the time where I think Polaroid or somebody had this
[01:26:23.020 --> 01:26:27.900]   deal where bring in any camera and we'll give you like $50 off like a new Polaroid
[01:26:27.900 --> 01:26:30.500]   SX-70 or whatever it was.
[01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:37.340]   And they just had this big bin in the warehouse filled with like beautiful old Nikon's and
[01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:43.660]   beautiful old cameras that like, can I just like give you $50 cash?
[01:26:43.660 --> 01:26:49.260]   And I just wanted to save all these cameras for being destroyed.
[01:26:49.260 --> 01:26:51.260]   I know how you feel.
[01:26:51.260 --> 01:26:52.260]   Yeah.
[01:26:52.260 --> 01:26:56.700]   This is Brave of Apple because in the one of the pictures that distributed in the press
[01:26:56.700 --> 01:27:01.460]   release about this, this is the conveyor belt, I guess, into the guts of Daisy.
[01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:04.860]   They do show a bent iPhone.
[01:27:04.860 --> 01:27:08.660]   So maybe the sensors didn't get ahold of that one.
[01:27:08.660 --> 01:27:10.780]   But there you go.
[01:27:10.780 --> 01:27:12.300]   If you bend your eyes.
[01:27:12.300 --> 01:27:16.020]   It never shipped to customers because it failed to pass Apple's rigorous.
[01:27:16.020 --> 01:27:17.020]   There you go.
[01:27:17.020 --> 01:27:18.020]   Wait a minute.
[01:27:18.020 --> 01:27:20.260]   Does that say Lewin Ontario on that one?
[01:27:20.260 --> 01:27:23.060]   Oh, you know that phone.
[01:27:23.060 --> 01:27:27.300]   I think it was unboxed aggressively.
[01:27:27.300 --> 01:27:34.780]   There was the CNET article that kind of went into this a little bit deeper by Ian Sheer.
[01:27:34.780 --> 01:27:35.780]   Yes.
[01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:40.300]   Where he interviewed Lisa Jackson and actually like went to the facility.
[01:27:40.300 --> 01:27:44.620]   And there was one thing that I remember I thought was very interesting was Apple is
[01:27:44.620 --> 01:27:50.940]   actually sort of recommending that you don't just leave your phone in a drawer, but bring
[01:27:50.940 --> 01:27:53.460]   it in, bring it in for recycling.
[01:27:53.460 --> 01:28:00.140]   And in my mind, I'm thinking, you know, holding onto it just in case I need to pass it down
[01:28:00.140 --> 01:28:05.980]   to somebody seems like the better method for, you know, not getting all these things into
[01:28:05.980 --> 01:28:06.980]   our landfill.
[01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:12.020]   But I think Apple is saying, no, no, no, we can actually, if it's new enough, we can
[01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:15.300]   fix it up and polish it up and send it out to somebody else.
[01:28:15.300 --> 01:28:19.900]   And if you let it sit in your drawer for too long, then it does become, you know, 30%
[01:28:19.900 --> 01:28:22.060]   waste or whatever before it gets recycled.
[01:28:22.060 --> 01:28:27.860]   So that was actually the one, the one call out to me that that meant the most was if you
[01:28:27.860 --> 01:28:32.020]   don't, if you have an iPhone that you're not using, take it in and get it recycled, get
[01:28:32.020 --> 01:28:33.780]   some money back off it, then newer the phone.
[01:28:33.780 --> 01:28:34.780]   That's a good point.
[01:28:34.780 --> 01:28:36.580]   The more likely it is, you'll get back out into the world again.
[01:28:36.580 --> 01:28:37.940]   That's a really good point.
[01:28:37.940 --> 01:28:38.940]   Yeah.
[01:28:38.940 --> 01:28:42.060]   I do have a drawer of phones, but then my daughter breaks her phone every three months.
[01:28:42.060 --> 01:28:44.860]   So I kind of need to have those there.
[01:28:44.860 --> 01:28:45.860]   It's not going to stay there.
[01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:46.860]   You want dispenser, right?
[01:28:46.860 --> 01:28:47.860]   Leo, you pull one out.
[01:28:47.860 --> 01:28:49.020]   Basically, here you go, honey.
[01:28:49.020 --> 01:28:50.420]   It's like tissues.
[01:28:50.420 --> 01:28:52.100]   Here is Daisy, which is a series.
[01:28:52.100 --> 01:28:55.580]   This is from the CNET article you're talking about, which is a series of robotic arms.
[01:28:55.580 --> 01:28:59.060]   This is Daisy's bigger than she looks.
[01:28:59.060 --> 01:29:04.460]   And so this is kind of an amazing thing that they're able to do.
[01:29:04.460 --> 01:29:09.060]   I mean, if you can't get work putting Iron Man's suit on and off, he excuses an anti-tune.
[01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:10.860]   You've got to get into the phone business.
[01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:11.860]   Yeah.
[01:29:11.860 --> 01:29:14.340]   And good on Apple for doing that.
[01:29:14.340 --> 01:29:19.140]   I'm sure it was not an inexpensive thing to do, although those materials are quite valuable.
[01:29:19.140 --> 01:29:21.140]   And eventually you're going to get scarce, right?
[01:29:21.140 --> 01:29:23.460]   And so it's a good idea to reuse them if you can.
[01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:24.460]   Yeah.
[01:29:24.460 --> 01:29:27.980]   At some point, we're going to run out of the materials that we use for our phones and then
[01:29:27.980 --> 01:29:28.980]   what?
[01:29:28.980 --> 01:29:29.980]   Oh, my God.
[01:29:29.980 --> 01:29:30.980]   Then what?
[01:29:30.980 --> 01:29:31.980]   The Asteroids.
[01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:32.980]   The Asteroid miners.
[01:29:32.980 --> 01:29:33.980]   Yeah.
[01:29:33.980 --> 01:29:34.980]   By it.
[01:29:34.980 --> 01:29:35.980]   Yeah.
[01:29:35.980 --> 01:29:38.660]   By then the phones will come in aerosol form.
[01:29:38.660 --> 01:29:41.940]   Got a hot ear.
[01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:48.340]   Reuters, big scoop Apple, and talks with potential suppliers of sensors for self-driving
[01:29:48.340 --> 01:29:49.340]   cars.
[01:29:49.340 --> 01:29:54.660]   They're looking for LIDAR, which of course, and I don't know if it's related to this,
[01:29:54.660 --> 01:29:59.500]   but Elon Musk said yesterday, only idiots use LIDAR in their self-driving cars.
[01:29:59.500 --> 01:30:00.500]   Okay, fine.
[01:30:00.500 --> 01:30:03.300]   We were in the middle of the self-driving camera wars.
[01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:06.100]   It's like cameras are LIDAR, Leo, which side are you on?
[01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:07.100]   It tastes great.
[01:30:07.100 --> 01:30:08.100]   Less filling.
[01:30:08.100 --> 01:30:13.540]   Apple is looking for less expensive LIDAR units, smaller, cheaper, and more easily mass-produced
[01:30:13.540 --> 01:30:15.980]   than the current technology.
[01:30:15.980 --> 01:30:21.500]   They want, and it says this in the RFC, revolutionary design, please.
[01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:24.900]   Maybe they're listening to Horace Deggio, and they're going to make self-driving bikes
[01:30:24.900 --> 01:30:25.900]   because it's more efficient.
[01:30:25.900 --> 01:30:26.900]   Oh, I like that.
[01:30:26.900 --> 01:30:28.900]   You know, I love my e-bike.
[01:30:28.900 --> 01:30:37.940]   But instead of driving to visit the in-laws for Easter, we bicycled, and it was a 15-minute
[01:30:37.940 --> 01:30:38.940]   bicycle ride.
[01:30:38.940 --> 01:30:40.420]   It would have been a 10-minute car ride.
[01:30:40.420 --> 01:30:45.580]   It wasn't that different, and it was so much more fun, except for the swarm of gnats that
[01:30:45.580 --> 01:30:46.580]   we flew through.
[01:30:46.580 --> 01:30:48.940]   I think I got them off my teeth.
[01:30:48.940 --> 01:30:49.940]   But other than that...
[01:30:49.940 --> 01:30:53.580]   That was a box of wasps that he was talking about.
[01:30:53.580 --> 01:30:58.500]   So Apple clearly is still interested in self-driving vehicles.
[01:30:58.500 --> 01:31:01.020]   There's no doubt about that.
[01:31:01.020 --> 01:31:05.140]   And not just designing the software thereof, but actually making them.
[01:31:05.140 --> 01:31:07.180]   Yeah, they were never not interested.
[01:31:07.180 --> 01:31:09.820]   That was a whole really weird new cycle.
[01:31:09.820 --> 01:31:10.820]   Yeah.
[01:31:10.820 --> 01:31:17.780]   Well, it's still so up in the air, and how soon can this be regulated so that they'll
[01:31:17.780 --> 01:31:22.860]   be allowed on the streets to begin with, and then who's actually going to buy them?
[01:31:22.860 --> 01:31:29.500]   I'm a lot more bullish on the idea of adding autonomous-like features to existing cars,
[01:31:29.500 --> 01:31:35.580]   like automated lane merge, automatic getting on and off highways, and sort of a smarter
[01:31:35.580 --> 01:31:39.420]   version of cruise control for accident avoidance.
[01:31:39.420 --> 01:31:45.620]   But the idea of autonomous driving, as we keep hearing it predicted, it's not available
[01:31:45.620 --> 01:31:46.620]   now.
[01:31:46.620 --> 01:31:48.940]   Look forward in the year 2000.
[01:31:48.940 --> 01:31:54.780]   I don't see that coming anytime soon, because the systems just aren't reliable enough.
[01:31:54.780 --> 01:32:00.860]   But as a people mover in controlled places like Disney World, inside campuses, stuff
[01:32:00.860 --> 01:32:08.660]   like that may be that I'm so totally given up having any sort of a valid opinion on when
[01:32:08.660 --> 01:32:12.100]   this thing is going to arrive the way that we think it's going to arrive.
[01:32:12.100 --> 01:32:15.540]   I love the footage yesterday where Elon showed off the self-driving car, and everyone on
[01:32:15.540 --> 01:32:18.760]   Twitter is like, "This is amazing, except for the people who drive on the 208-inch
[01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:21.340]   of a weighty, but no, I'm on that road, and that is never going to work.
[01:32:21.340 --> 01:32:23.900]   I'm terrified right now."
[01:32:23.900 --> 01:32:29.860]   He actually, the so much funny things, it was a demonstration of the new next-level autonomous
[01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:33.140]   modes basically as an investor sort of pitch.
[01:32:33.140 --> 01:32:38.360]   And part of it was saying, I think, Rene, you were talking about that person who's asking
[01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:44.220]   about how poorly it, people see that I've got a Tesla, and they know that the self-driving
[01:32:44.220 --> 01:32:48.920]   technology isn't very aggressive, so they'll cut in front of me knowing that the self-driving
[01:32:48.920 --> 01:32:52.640]   software, and asking, "Can we make the software more aggressive?"
[01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:58.240]   And I think Elon was talking about how, "Well, yeah, we're looking at new driving modes,
[01:32:58.240 --> 01:33:01.680]   including a mode that says, basically, go ahead and risk a fender bender if you have
[01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:02.680]   to."
[01:33:02.680 --> 01:33:03.680]   And like, what?
[01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:10.160]   And thinking, "Okay, so will the system say, only hit cars that seem to be worth a
[01:33:10.160 --> 01:33:18.540]   lot less than the Tesla, or make sure that look for average than the other than?"
[01:33:18.540 --> 01:33:23.480]   Do a license plate check, see how good their insurance is and how much money they made
[01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:26.100]   last year, if they're worth suing, then ram them.
[01:33:26.100 --> 01:33:29.840]   I feel bad, because my Tesla is only two and a half years old, and it doesn't have any
[01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:34.460]   of this technology in it, so it's like, "Oh, man, that's obsolete already.
[01:33:34.460 --> 01:33:36.300]   Aren't you getting it?"
[01:33:36.300 --> 01:33:44.140]   I'm a little nervous about the future of Tesla, so my least friend's out into July.
[01:33:44.140 --> 01:33:45.140]   What do you think?
[01:33:45.140 --> 01:33:47.500]   Should I get a Model 3 with this new technology?
[01:33:47.500 --> 01:33:48.500]   Or should I...
[01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:49.500]   I don't know, there's so many...
[01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:51.660]   If you're not going to get it, who is?
[01:33:51.660 --> 01:33:54.420]   You got to go for it.
[01:33:54.420 --> 01:33:56.380]   You have to be our test subject.
[01:33:56.380 --> 01:34:00.380]   Okay, well, you talk me, and I don't know.
[01:34:00.380 --> 01:34:01.380]   Well, I'll see.
[01:34:01.380 --> 01:34:05.580]   Also, I'm really encouraging people to invest in this technology, because already I have
[01:34:05.580 --> 01:34:10.220]   people who drive manual transmissions that lord it over me, that I don't know how to
[01:34:10.220 --> 01:34:11.220]   drive stick.
[01:34:11.220 --> 01:34:15.180]   I like to be able to lord it over people who, again, don't know how to merge into a highway
[01:34:15.180 --> 01:34:16.820]   without having software take over.
[01:34:16.820 --> 01:34:18.620]   I can parallel park, man.
[01:34:18.620 --> 01:34:19.620]   Okay?
[01:34:19.620 --> 01:34:20.620]   You did say...
[01:34:20.620 --> 01:34:21.620]   I can parallel park like a...
[01:34:21.620 --> 01:34:22.620]   You did say...
[01:34:22.620 --> 01:34:25.380]   And this worried me a lot that there's three different autonomy modes, including an aggressive
[01:34:25.380 --> 01:34:28.940]   autonomy mode, if you don't mind the occasional fender bender.
[01:34:28.940 --> 01:34:29.940]   Yeah.
[01:34:29.940 --> 01:34:30.940]   What?
[01:34:30.940 --> 01:34:35.420]   That doesn't seem like a good switch to have.
[01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:42.980]   Yeah, I would rather be able to say that I traded paint willfully, and I administered
[01:34:42.980 --> 01:34:44.300]   some street justice.
[01:34:44.300 --> 01:34:49.140]   I don't want my car deciding for me that, let's say, there's a...
[01:34:49.140 --> 01:34:51.700]   I see a couple of different infancy to the backseat.
[01:34:51.700 --> 01:34:53.740]   Yeah, let's just, you know, pump over it.
[01:34:53.740 --> 01:34:54.900]   I encourage them to go.
[01:34:54.900 --> 01:34:55.900]   No, no, no, no.
[01:34:55.900 --> 01:34:56.900]   Anyway.
[01:34:56.900 --> 01:34:58.700]   Flip that switch and your insurance rates go up.
[01:34:58.700 --> 01:34:59.700]   Yeah.
[01:34:59.700 --> 01:35:01.540]   What are the consequences of that?
[01:35:01.540 --> 01:35:05.140]   Do they test that car and say, "Oh, you had aggressive mode on, so therefore..."
[01:35:05.140 --> 01:35:06.140]   Oh, good point.
[01:35:06.140 --> 01:35:08.780]   You're partially a fault for this or something like that.
[01:35:08.780 --> 01:35:09.780]   Good point.
[01:35:09.780 --> 01:35:10.780]   Yeah.
[01:35:10.780 --> 01:35:11.780]   That's an interesting point.
[01:35:11.780 --> 01:35:15.500]   Apple got FCC approval yesterday for the PowerBeats Pro.
[01:35:15.500 --> 01:35:20.700]   Now your decision, "Hmm, do I get AirPods or PowerBeats Pro?
[01:35:20.700 --> 01:35:24.420]   These use the H1 chip, the same one in the AirPods."
[01:35:24.420 --> 01:35:26.660]   I like the form factor a little better.
[01:35:26.660 --> 01:35:30.380]   They've got an over the ear loop.
[01:35:30.380 --> 01:35:31.380]   Does it sound better?
[01:35:31.380 --> 01:35:32.380]   I don't know.
[01:35:32.380 --> 01:35:33.380]   It sounds the same.
[01:35:33.380 --> 01:35:34.380]   I think...
[01:35:34.380 --> 01:35:35.860]   I think they got the beats, right?
[01:35:35.860 --> 01:35:36.860]   They got the beats.
[01:35:36.860 --> 01:35:38.260]   They got the beats.
[01:35:38.260 --> 01:35:39.260]   Yeah.
[01:35:39.260 --> 01:35:45.940]   I think we have to wait on that though because I think that we need to make sure that presumably
[01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:53.100]   PowerBeats Pro are going to have the same quality and sort of base heavy sound as the
[01:35:53.100 --> 01:35:56.020]   other PowerBeats or the BeatsX or something like that.
[01:35:56.020 --> 01:35:58.620]   Maybe they're going to adjust that.
[01:35:58.620 --> 01:36:00.020]   Maybe it's not going to be.
[01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:03.860]   Well, they've seen that for 100 bucks more.
[01:36:03.860 --> 01:36:07.460]   I think CNET tried them and said they sounded better than the AirPods but did have that
[01:36:07.460 --> 01:36:08.460]   classic Beats and Pro-Pods.
[01:36:08.460 --> 01:36:10.340]   Yeah, I don't like the heavy bass.
[01:36:10.340 --> 01:36:11.860]   Which is a big deal for some people.
[01:36:11.860 --> 01:36:15.300]   It's really important when you're making that decision that you understand ahead of
[01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:18.300]   time what it means to have a bass heavy.
[01:36:18.300 --> 01:36:19.500]   They're also sweat proof.
[01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:24.700]   They're a little better for working out because of the ear hooks and the sweat proof thing.
[01:36:24.700 --> 01:36:31.740]   So sweat and water resistant design for optimal performance under such conditions.
[01:36:31.740 --> 01:36:33.540]   For some people, it might be a way...
[01:36:33.540 --> 01:36:38.140]   Better battery life too, five hour battery life on AirPods, nine hour battery life on
[01:36:38.140 --> 01:36:39.140]   PowerBeats.
[01:36:39.140 --> 01:36:40.140]   Yeah.
[01:36:40.140 --> 01:36:43.300]   I was going to say exactly what Renee said that for some people they just don't find
[01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:45.060]   the existing AirPods comfortable.
[01:36:45.060 --> 01:36:49.540]   So if these are just a better fit for some people who've been sort of lessening after
[01:36:49.540 --> 01:36:53.340]   truly wireless and easily paired headphones, it's a win.
[01:36:53.340 --> 01:36:57.820]   Yeah, that's what I'm looking forward to the most on that one.
[01:36:57.820 --> 01:37:04.460]   Having that pain in my ear after half an hour of using the AirPods, I'll be looking forward
[01:37:04.460 --> 01:37:06.780]   to something that's a little softer.
[01:37:06.780 --> 01:37:09.780]   They're not as cute though.
[01:37:09.780 --> 01:37:14.060]   I'm not a big fan of those big things chunked into your ear like that.
[01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:18.940]   It reminds me of those old Bluetooth connectors that people would wear in their ears so that
[01:37:18.940 --> 01:37:22.020]   they could wirelessly talk on their phones.
[01:37:22.020 --> 01:37:24.180]   So you're too young.
[01:37:24.180 --> 01:37:27.980]   You didn't grow up lusting after those big ear phones that had the FM radio on the side
[01:37:27.980 --> 01:37:28.980]   of it.
[01:37:28.980 --> 01:37:29.980]   Oh, God, yes.
[01:37:29.980 --> 01:37:30.980]   Definitely.
[01:37:30.980 --> 01:37:37.300]   Everyone on roller skates of the park were absolutely the bomb.
[01:37:37.300 --> 01:37:44.140]   Definitely a teenager is suing Apple for I have to put the pinky up to my mouth here
[01:37:44.140 --> 01:37:53.300]   one billion dollars claiming that Apple was using face recognition in its stores and it
[01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:58.420]   led to his false arrest.
[01:37:58.420 --> 01:38:00.660]   It's not exactly what happened.
[01:38:00.660 --> 01:38:07.420]   He was arrested in November by the NYPD linked to a series of Apple store thefts in Boston,
[01:38:07.420 --> 01:38:09.820]   New Jersey, Delaware and Manhattan.
[01:38:09.820 --> 01:38:17.620]   But the reason he was arrested is because the bad guys had found his driving permit.
[01:38:17.620 --> 01:38:22.860]   It didn't have a photo, but it has name address and other personal information.
[01:38:22.860 --> 01:38:28.260]   The lawsuit claims Apple programmed its stores face recognition system to associate the real
[01:38:28.260 --> 01:38:33.780]   thieves face with the plaintiff's details.
[01:38:33.780 --> 01:38:38.180]   But Apple says, well, we don't use face recognition in our store.
[01:38:38.180 --> 01:38:41.900]   Does that remind you of that old West Wing thing where they said they caught the terrorists
[01:38:41.900 --> 01:38:45.700]   because of a broken tail light and the guy said, sir, we've discovered over the years
[01:38:45.700 --> 01:38:49.900]   that no amount of manpower or money equals the criminals being stupid.
[01:38:49.900 --> 01:38:51.820]   This is valid to it.
[01:38:51.820 --> 01:38:57.220]   Well, and the NYPD may be jumping the gun because they found that ID they arrested the
[01:38:57.220 --> 01:38:58.220]   kid.
[01:38:58.220 --> 01:39:01.140]   And then it's according to the story in Engadget.
[01:39:01.140 --> 01:39:05.860]   The detective that eventually examined Apple surveillance footage old fashioned face ID
[01:39:05.860 --> 01:39:10.300]   noticed that the guy they'd arrested didn't look anything like the guy that was making
[01:39:10.300 --> 01:39:11.740]   doing the robbery.
[01:39:11.740 --> 01:39:17.780]   Plus, turns out the kid was attending his senior prom when the Boston theft happened.
[01:39:17.780 --> 01:39:20.100]   So sounds like he's got an alibi.
[01:39:20.100 --> 01:39:22.740]   I don't know if he's got a billion dollar case against Apple.
[01:39:22.740 --> 01:39:23.740]   Yeah.
[01:39:23.740 --> 01:39:27.740]   But they're going to be more problems like this, especially since the EU just voted to
[01:39:27.740 --> 01:39:32.980]   vote it to move forward on a new regulation that would basically unify the entire biometric
[01:39:32.980 --> 01:39:35.900]   database for law enforcement for everybody in the EU.
[01:39:35.900 --> 01:39:36.900]   Yes.
[01:39:36.900 --> 01:39:37.900]   So and considering that.
[01:39:37.900 --> 01:39:42.060]   So basically, if one of these databases has a false match, everybody's going to have
[01:39:42.060 --> 01:39:43.580]   a false match on you.
[01:39:43.580 --> 01:39:48.660]   And given that we've already demonstrated that not all face recognition systems are half
[01:39:48.660 --> 01:39:53.300]   as good as they are in the movies and that if you are not white, you might have a problem
[01:39:53.300 --> 01:39:57.260]   being matched with somebody else because the it was a lot of these systems were trained
[01:39:57.260 --> 01:40:00.460]   on white faces and not enough non white faces.
[01:40:00.460 --> 01:40:01.460]   This is going to be a problem.
[01:40:01.460 --> 01:40:05.820]   And we're going to see more people who are not whose lives are turned upside down by a
[01:40:05.820 --> 01:40:14.860]   mismatch and then quite quite quite with with with absolute with absolute good reason
[01:40:14.860 --> 01:40:16.260]   are looking for somebody to sue.
[01:40:16.260 --> 01:40:17.260]   Yeah.
[01:40:17.260 --> 01:40:20.820]   It was hilarious to me because like we saw the whole controversy with JetBlue using face
[01:40:20.820 --> 01:40:21.820]   instead of passports.
[01:40:21.820 --> 01:40:25.660]   Wasn't that interesting when you get on the plane, they're going to do is face ID face
[01:40:25.660 --> 01:40:26.660]   recognition.
[01:40:26.660 --> 01:40:28.780]   So I had this weird experience where I because I have Nexus.
[01:40:28.780 --> 01:40:31.740]   So I literally went up to the Nexus machine and scanned my irises.
[01:40:31.740 --> 01:40:33.460]   I went to the customs guy.
[01:40:33.460 --> 01:40:34.460]   He said, where are you going?
[01:40:34.460 --> 01:40:37.140]   I said Apple, he goes, oh, their face ID is horrible.
[01:40:37.140 --> 01:40:39.220]   It's going to be an end to privacy for all of us.
[01:40:39.220 --> 01:40:40.220]   Oh my God.
[01:40:40.220 --> 01:40:42.300]   I didn't say it because I didn't want to be apart from the country.
[01:40:42.300 --> 01:40:46.860]   But I'm like, you just saw me take a retina scan that I'm sure is being stored on one of
[01:40:46.860 --> 01:40:51.100]   the one of the databases of one of the companies that had a massive breach last year.
[01:40:51.100 --> 01:40:55.340]   And you're concerned about face ID.
[01:40:55.340 --> 01:40:57.860]   I think I don't I wonder.
[01:40:57.860 --> 01:41:03.660]   So this all came from a social media thread in which a traveler said that when she boarded
[01:41:03.660 --> 01:41:07.700]   an international JetBlue flight, instead of scanning my boarding pass or handing over
[01:41:07.700 --> 01:41:13.580]   my passport, I looked into a camera before being allowed down the jet bridge.
[01:41:13.580 --> 01:41:17.500]   She asks, does facial recognition replace boarding passes unknowns to me?
[01:41:17.500 --> 01:41:19.300]   Did I consent to this?
[01:41:19.300 --> 01:41:20.300]   Yeah.
[01:41:20.300 --> 01:41:25.620]   JetBlue says, yeah, but you can opt out of it if it makes you feel uncomfortable.
[01:41:25.620 --> 01:41:27.620]   So I think that's interesting.
[01:41:27.620 --> 01:41:31.100]   I don't I don't know if I have a problem with that.
[01:41:31.100 --> 01:41:35.580]   I do worry about these big databases with our biometric information.
[01:41:35.580 --> 01:41:36.580]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:41:36.580 --> 01:41:42.420]   Oh, the problem is that the problem is that they collect that data.
[01:41:42.420 --> 01:41:45.700]   If you opt out of it, well, they still already have that data.
[01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:51.460]   So whatever they can do to monetize that by by selling it to a person who's providing
[01:41:51.460 --> 01:41:56.420]   a biometric data to law enforcement or to governments, you're still kind of hosed there.
[01:41:56.420 --> 01:42:01.860]   There's you have so little control over this that this is this is fly the red banner of
[01:42:01.860 --> 01:42:03.300]   revolution problems.
[01:42:03.300 --> 01:42:04.300]   Yeah.
[01:42:04.300 --> 01:42:09.060]   How does opt out like what does opt out mean if you're walking past a camera to get on
[01:42:09.060 --> 01:42:11.540]   the plane and walking past a camera to get on the plane?
[01:42:11.540 --> 01:42:12.540]   How do you know?
[01:42:12.540 --> 01:42:17.740]   You're turning the camera off as you walk past or yeah, that's that's very true that like
[01:42:17.740 --> 01:42:22.620]   opting out doesn't necessarily mean anything if they're still collecting that data.
[01:42:22.620 --> 01:42:25.820]   And instead, you're just handing your boarding pass over.
[01:42:25.820 --> 01:42:26.820]   Yeah.
[01:42:26.820 --> 01:42:27.820]   Camera's still there.
[01:42:27.820 --> 01:42:28.820]   It's still taking your picture.
[01:42:28.820 --> 01:42:34.460]   Well, what's interesting is she asked JetBlue, where did you get the face information anyway?
[01:42:34.460 --> 01:42:38.380]   And on Twitter, JetBlue said the information is provided by the US Department of Homeland
[01:42:38.380 --> 01:42:39.380]   Security.
[01:42:39.380 --> 01:42:40.380]   Yeah.
[01:42:40.380 --> 01:42:41.380]   What?
[01:42:41.380 --> 01:42:42.380]   What?
[01:42:42.380 --> 01:42:44.540]   There's secure.
[01:42:44.540 --> 01:42:48.140]   We should clarify these photos aren't provided to us, but are securely transmitted to the
[01:42:48.140 --> 01:42:50.780]   customs and border protection database.
[01:42:50.780 --> 01:42:53.940]   So JetBlue doesn't have access to the photos and doesn't store them.
[01:42:53.940 --> 01:42:56.740]   So basically you walk past this camera and it goes ding.
[01:42:56.740 --> 01:43:00.580]   Yeah, that's Mackenzie.
[01:43:00.580 --> 01:43:08.100]   And then here's the link to JetBlue explaining this new, your face is your boarding pass.
[01:43:08.100 --> 01:43:09.260]   And it's at JFK.
[01:43:09.260 --> 01:43:10.260]   It's in it.
[01:43:10.260 --> 01:43:11.340]   I don't have a problem with it.
[01:43:11.340 --> 01:43:15.700]   It's been going on apparently since November of 2018.
[01:43:15.700 --> 01:43:19.060]   How does the border patrol have my picture?
[01:43:19.060 --> 01:43:21.900]   I guess they know my, they have my passport image.
[01:43:21.900 --> 01:43:22.900]   I don't know.
[01:43:22.900 --> 01:43:23.900]   They take mine every time we go.
[01:43:23.900 --> 01:43:24.900]   They have all these kiosks.
[01:43:24.900 --> 01:43:25.900]   You I know.
[01:43:25.900 --> 01:43:26.900]   Yeah, you get your picture.
[01:43:26.900 --> 01:43:27.900]   Yeah.
[01:43:27.900 --> 01:43:28.900]   Yeah.
[01:43:28.900 --> 01:43:29.900]   Yeah.
[01:43:29.900 --> 01:43:30.900]   Because you're a ferner.
[01:43:30.900 --> 01:43:34.380]   And you can be a threat.
[01:43:34.380 --> 01:43:36.340]   You're not from Rhode Island.
[01:43:36.340 --> 01:43:37.340]   No.
[01:43:37.340 --> 01:43:39.580]   Like the rest of us.
[01:43:39.580 --> 01:43:42.940]   What are they using?
[01:43:42.940 --> 01:43:46.740]   What, what images of us are they using?
[01:43:46.740 --> 01:43:51.380]   And in that case, there, then you do come up with that question of spoofing because face
[01:43:51.380 --> 01:43:56.300]   ID, facial recognition ID is a lot different than just matching pictures.
[01:43:56.300 --> 01:43:57.300]   Yeah.
[01:43:57.300 --> 01:44:04.780]   That I, you know, there are like, I have pictures in my photos app on my Mac that, that originally
[01:44:04.780 --> 01:44:07.180]   the Mac thought serenity was me.
[01:44:07.180 --> 01:44:08.180]   Right.
[01:44:08.180 --> 01:44:09.180]   Serenity called.
[01:44:09.180 --> 01:44:10.820]   Well, we don't really look anything alike.
[01:44:10.820 --> 01:44:12.460]   What both of our eyes are kind of big.
[01:44:12.460 --> 01:44:14.580]   And maybe that's why it recognized that.
[01:44:14.580 --> 01:44:19.460]   But so then you kind of get, you get a little bit mixed up in that spoofing thing because,
[01:44:19.460 --> 01:44:26.140]   you know, just the iPhone 10 and 10s and 10s Max are a perfect example of it's using
[01:44:26.140 --> 01:44:30.060]   a bunch of different references to decide what your face looks like.
[01:44:30.060 --> 01:44:34.540]   So yeah, remember when you set up face ID, you are rotating the camera around.
[01:44:34.540 --> 01:44:36.220]   You're changing your angle.
[01:44:36.220 --> 01:44:39.780]   One of that data is available in this Homeland Security database.
[01:44:39.780 --> 01:44:40.780]   Right.
[01:44:40.780 --> 01:44:46.180]   So what, what exactly are they using and how is that a secure way to, to assume your,
[01:44:46.180 --> 01:44:47.180]   your face is there?
[01:44:47.180 --> 01:44:51.820]   I mean, I can imagine that a lot of issues will come up and I certainly wouldn't want
[01:44:51.820 --> 01:44:52.820]   this to happen.
[01:44:52.820 --> 01:44:57.020]   But if there was a plane accident, somebody else took the flight because it was their
[01:44:57.020 --> 01:44:59.260]   sister or something like that.
[01:44:59.260 --> 01:45:00.260]   Right.
[01:45:00.260 --> 01:45:03.460]   And then someone's missing and they assume that it's one person when it's another person.
[01:45:03.460 --> 01:45:04.460]   Well, that's a great point.
[01:45:04.460 --> 01:45:05.460]   Could be a.
[01:45:05.460 --> 01:45:11.460]   Could go wrong with that kind of just like face matching instead of a facial ID recognition.
[01:45:11.460 --> 01:45:12.460]   Yeah.
[01:45:12.460 --> 01:45:16.380]   And even when people, even when long force from sometimes says, well, we use it for initial
[01:45:16.380 --> 01:45:21.900]   match and to basically identify a suspect, for instance, but then we verify things on
[01:45:21.900 --> 01:45:26.300]   our own after we go that that basically gives a lead on a suspect, but they don't, that
[01:45:26.300 --> 01:45:30.260]   doesn't address the problem that if you have been brought, if you, if you have an interaction
[01:45:30.260 --> 01:45:33.980]   with the police officer who says that we would like to bring you in for questioning here
[01:45:33.980 --> 01:45:37.460]   and there, if you're smart, you lawyer up and the lawyer is going to cost you how many
[01:45:37.460 --> 01:45:38.460]   thousands of dollars.
[01:45:38.460 --> 01:45:42.020]   And if someone just at your workplace or in your, at your home or in your neighborhood
[01:45:42.020 --> 01:45:46.260]   or somewhere saw that, Hey, you had to go into the police station, we talked about a crime.
[01:45:46.260 --> 01:45:47.980]   How is that going to affect your job?
[01:45:47.980 --> 01:45:49.820]   How's it's going to affect your life?
[01:45:49.820 --> 01:45:54.260]   And if it turns out that it became, that it all, it all turned out because you, because
[01:45:54.260 --> 01:45:59.940]   a local police department decided to use their Nintendo to do the police work for them and
[01:45:59.940 --> 01:46:06.100]   say, give us 500 people who might have possibly matched somewhat this, this picture that we
[01:46:06.100 --> 01:46:09.380]   got off of a blurry 711 security camera.
[01:46:09.380 --> 01:46:10.380]   That's not good enough.
[01:46:10.380 --> 01:46:14.780]   I mean, like, like, like, like, Laurie said, I mean, I have, I've, I've once or twice,
[01:46:14.780 --> 01:46:20.180]   the last time I got a facial mismatch was on Instagram when they showed me it say, so
[01:46:20.180 --> 01:46:23.700]   and so has tagged you in this photo, or you've been tagged in this photo.
[01:46:23.700 --> 01:46:28.060]   And it's like, no, that's an actually a rather attractive young woman wearing a hat, not
[01:46:28.060 --> 01:46:32.700]   entirely dissimilar from one of the hats I normally wear, but anybody would see that
[01:46:32.700 --> 01:46:37.740]   this is absolutely not, I would, but do I have to now prove to somebody that actually
[01:46:37.740 --> 01:46:44.060]   I was, I can prove because of my Netflix and YouTube browsing history that I was actually
[01:46:44.060 --> 01:46:47.540]   alone in my house and not 20 miles away.
[01:46:47.540 --> 01:46:51.140]   Well, there's also the need legislation.
[01:46:51.140 --> 01:46:57.340]   The nightmare scenario, because we know face recognition is not as effective with people
[01:46:57.340 --> 01:47:04.700]   with darker skin of all the white people getting through and all the, all the brown
[01:47:04.700 --> 01:47:08.220]   people getting stopped saying, well, let's now we have to see your papers, please.
[01:47:08.220 --> 01:47:09.220]   Yeah.
[01:47:09.220 --> 01:47:11.900]   Or all the people with beards getting stopped.
[01:47:11.900 --> 01:47:17.500]   It's like, that's not, that's not what that's not a good look for any airline.
[01:47:17.500 --> 01:47:22.620]   You know, I would also say, and I'm not joking about this, that it bothers me that the only
[01:47:22.620 --> 01:47:27.300]   way to get out of being tagged with facial recognition is, okay, I'm going to be this
[01:47:27.300 --> 01:47:29.180]   I'm going to be this stalwart about this.
[01:47:29.180 --> 01:47:33.260]   I'm actually going to be wearing a mask of some sort, something that covers my face wherever
[01:47:33.260 --> 01:47:36.940]   I go out, but you're probably not going to be allowed to go out in public.
[01:47:36.940 --> 01:47:40.140]   You're probably to wearing something that covers your face because that will make you
[01:47:40.140 --> 01:47:41.140]   a suspicious person.
[01:47:41.140 --> 01:47:43.820]   And why does he not want to be recognized in public?
[01:47:43.820 --> 01:47:51.620]   Well, I remember our engineer Colleen was designing a, a collar with ultraviolet, invisible
[01:47:51.620 --> 01:47:54.420]   ultraviolet lights that you could wear.
[01:47:54.420 --> 01:47:58.020]   And I think this could easily be productized that blinded cameras.
[01:47:58.020 --> 01:48:01.580]   So you would just look like a glowing ball of light walking down the street.
[01:48:01.580 --> 01:48:04.740]   I think there's going to be a brisk market in those.
[01:48:04.740 --> 01:48:05.740]   I'm not kidding.
[01:48:05.740 --> 01:48:11.380]   I think in time you're going to be able to buy these camera defeating objects.
[01:48:11.380 --> 01:48:14.780]   She's totally greedy until it becomes illegal to own one.
[01:48:14.780 --> 01:48:15.780]   Yeah, right.
[01:48:15.780 --> 01:48:19.900]   And of course you're immediately suspicious because you want to be private.
[01:48:19.900 --> 01:48:21.700]   What?
[01:48:21.700 --> 01:48:25.300]   But get your prepare your picks of the week because we are going to get to that right
[01:48:25.300 --> 01:48:30.940]   after I tell you about our sponsor, FreshBooks.
[01:48:30.940 --> 01:48:33.140]   It's accounting software.
[01:48:33.140 --> 01:48:37.860]   And I almost hate to say that because it doesn't present as accounting software.
[01:48:37.860 --> 01:48:42.660]   Presents is a easy way to make invoices to keep track of who you've invoiced to send them
[01:48:42.660 --> 01:48:46.500]   notices if they don't pay right away to make it easy for them to pay right in the invoice
[01:48:46.500 --> 01:48:50.660]   because you can accept online payments as a FreshBooks customer.
[01:48:50.660 --> 01:48:54.460]   It doesn't feel like accounting software, but it is.
[01:48:54.460 --> 01:48:59.780]   It's actually an amazing thing because in the process of all of that, sending and receiving,
[01:48:59.780 --> 01:49:03.780]   sending invoices, receiving payments, keeping track of expenses, whether you put them in
[01:49:03.780 --> 01:49:10.020]   the invoices or not, you're actually doing your accounting, which gives you the ability
[01:49:10.020 --> 01:49:15.100]   to become a better business person because you can make informed decisions.
[01:49:15.100 --> 01:49:18.500]   You'll know at any given time whether you're making money or not.
[01:49:18.500 --> 01:49:22.020]   And that's something as a freelancer, I never knew till tax time.

[01:49:38.460 --> 01:49:40.100]   That's how I used it.
[01:49:40.100 --> 01:49:43.260]   Log every hour if you build for time with time tracking.
[01:49:43.260 --> 01:49:47.260]   They have a great app too, which you'll also do it, iOS or Android.
[01:49:47.260 --> 01:49:51.300]   You can get easy to understand reports, but also full accounting reports, the kind your
[01:49:51.300 --> 01:49:56.460]   account, your tax prepare will very much appreciate.
[01:49:56.460 --> 01:49:58.900]   You can schedule payments.
[01:49:58.900 --> 01:50:00.980]   Your clients can schedule payments.
[01:50:00.980 --> 01:50:03.140]   You can have automated invoicing, automated payment.
[01:50:03.140 --> 01:50:07.740]   If you really want to make it easy, it automatically categorizes expenses.
[01:50:07.740 --> 01:50:10.460]   So filing taxes is simple.
[01:50:10.460 --> 01:50:14.220]   And FreshBooks is always evolving, always getting better.
[01:50:14.220 --> 01:50:19.700]   In fact, now you can use ACH payments, bank transfers to get paid twice as fast.
[01:50:19.700 --> 01:50:21.140]   It's great for large invoices.
[01:50:21.140 --> 01:50:23.620]   There's a low transaction fee.

[01:50:26.780 --> 01:50:27.780]   mobile app.

[01:51:20.460 --> 01:51:23.780]   Let me start with Lori Gill.
[01:51:23.780 --> 01:51:24.780]   That's me.
[01:51:24.780 --> 01:51:26.740]   Are you sure you want this because you're probably going to end up buying one?
[01:51:26.740 --> 01:51:27.740]   Oh, I know.
[01:51:27.740 --> 01:51:28.740]   I bought everything.
[01:51:28.740 --> 01:51:30.780]   I buy everything you tell me to buy.
[01:51:30.780 --> 01:51:36.740]   Actually, this one is for a wooden case by the company called Kerf, K-E-R-F.
[01:51:36.740 --> 01:51:38.740]   I like wooden cases.
[01:51:38.740 --> 01:51:39.740]   I like wooden cases.
[01:51:39.740 --> 01:51:40.740]   Yeah.
[01:51:40.740 --> 01:51:41.740]   But everything they do.
[01:51:41.740 --> 01:51:43.940]   They make iPhone cases and Android cases.
[01:51:43.940 --> 01:51:44.940]   Oh, look at that.
[01:51:44.940 --> 01:51:49.500]   They make skins and they also have a charging block, which I've got my charging block plugged
[01:51:49.500 --> 01:51:52.100]   in around the corner.
[01:51:52.100 --> 01:51:55.780]   But they use sustainable wood and recycled materials.
[01:51:55.780 --> 01:52:02.780]   And even the phone case they sent me, it's cardboard and a cloth bag.
[01:52:02.780 --> 01:52:03.780]   That's all it comes in.
[01:52:03.780 --> 01:52:04.780]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:52:04.780 --> 01:52:05.780]   There's no plastic.
[01:52:05.780 --> 01:52:10.180]   So they really, I really want to tell people about this company because they make a really
[01:52:10.180 --> 01:52:15.580]   nice case, by the way, my favorite thing about this case, because cases are cases, right?
[01:52:15.580 --> 01:52:21.340]   But the buttons on these are just nice and big and puffy and they stick out and you can
[01:52:21.340 --> 01:52:23.180]   press them really easily.
[01:52:23.180 --> 01:52:26.060]   And that's a really nice thing to have on a case.
[01:52:26.060 --> 01:52:27.060]   And it feels good.
[01:52:27.060 --> 01:52:30.060]   This natural wood that it's made out of this one is made out of walnut.
[01:52:30.060 --> 01:52:37.220]   They use a variety of different styles of wood, but it's all sourced locally or with
[01:52:37.220 --> 01:52:44.140]   organizations that go out of their way to reclaim felled trees in the forest and then
[01:52:44.140 --> 01:52:46.260]   dry the mountain, send them to places.
[01:52:46.260 --> 01:52:50.900]   So they're not just cutting down trees to make these cases and charging pads.
[01:52:50.900 --> 01:52:54.300]   They're actually using the environment as it exists.
[01:52:54.300 --> 01:52:55.860]   So it's pretty great.
[01:52:55.860 --> 01:52:57.220]   The company is great.
[01:52:57.220 --> 01:52:58.220]   Yeah.
[01:52:58.220 --> 01:53:00.620]   I like the Qi charger, the wood Qi charger.
[01:53:00.620 --> 01:53:01.620]   That's pretty cool.
[01:53:01.620 --> 01:53:02.620]   Yeah.
[01:53:02.620 --> 01:53:03.620]   I have the charging block.
[01:53:03.620 --> 01:53:04.900]   It works fantastic.
[01:53:04.900 --> 01:53:09.140]   You can, it's the charging coils inside there are nice and big.
[01:53:09.140 --> 01:53:13.620]   So I can like just toss my phone down and you know, it's, you know, only on a quarter
[01:53:13.620 --> 01:53:15.300]   of it, but it'll still catch it.
[01:53:15.300 --> 01:53:17.300]   So and it looks really good.
[01:53:17.300 --> 01:53:23.020]   They're clearly wood workers because you can get finishes with all kinds of crazy wood
[01:53:23.020 --> 01:53:31.340]   figured walnut, a book coat, Purple Heart African mahogany, ambrosia maple, canarywood,
[01:53:31.340 --> 01:53:34.380]   spalted maple that is really neat.
[01:53:34.380 --> 01:53:35.940]   Yeah, really good.
[01:53:35.940 --> 01:53:36.940]   Yeah.
[01:53:36.940 --> 01:53:41.860]   And even if you don't need a new iPhone case or you're not a fan of the thickness of the
[01:53:41.860 --> 01:53:46.220]   case, like some people are real minimalist and want a real thin case.
[01:53:46.220 --> 01:53:47.740]   Just what the company does is great.
[01:53:47.740 --> 01:53:49.900]   And the, you know, check it out and see if there's something else you want.
[01:53:49.900 --> 01:53:52.500]   I think they also do a MacBook skin if I'm not mistaken.
[01:53:52.500 --> 01:53:54.100]   Oh, I got to get that.
[01:53:54.100 --> 01:53:55.300]   That would be nice.
[01:53:55.300 --> 01:53:56.300]   Yeah.
[01:53:56.300 --> 01:53:57.300]   Yeah.
[01:53:57.300 --> 01:53:58.300]   Nice.
[01:53:58.300 --> 01:53:59.300]   Good.
[01:53:59.300 --> 01:54:00.300]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:54:00.300 --> 01:54:01.300]   It's not too loud.
[01:54:01.300 --> 01:54:02.300]   They're from Pittsburgh.
[01:54:02.300 --> 01:54:03.300]   Yeah.
[01:54:03.300 --> 01:54:04.620]   Oh, and the Apple pencil wood skin.
[01:54:04.620 --> 01:54:08.220]   I don't know if you've, if you've clicked over to the wood skin section, but they make
[01:54:08.220 --> 01:54:11.780]   a pencil cover for your Apple pencil, which is pretty clever.
[01:54:11.780 --> 01:54:19.700]   And if you've got a little extra money, you can spend a few hundred bucks on rare woods,
[01:54:19.700 --> 01:54:21.180]   black Gabon Ebony.
[01:54:21.180 --> 01:54:26.460]   That's only $639 Australian red malley burl.
[01:54:26.460 --> 01:54:27.900]   It's $569.
[01:54:27.900 --> 01:54:29.260]   Figured rosewood.
[01:54:29.260 --> 01:54:32.340]   So that's cocoa, Bolo, my favorite, 309 bucks.
[01:54:32.340 --> 01:54:33.340]   Yeah.
[01:54:33.340 --> 01:54:34.340]   Yeah.
[01:54:34.340 --> 01:54:36.780]   We'll have to buy John Gruber in his spare time.
[01:54:36.780 --> 01:54:37.780]   Yeah.
[01:54:37.780 --> 01:54:41.140]   I mean, it feels like there, yeah, there's some woodworker here going, you know, we could
[01:54:41.140 --> 01:54:43.620]   make a cocoa, Bolo, cheat structure.
[01:54:43.620 --> 01:54:45.660]   We have the technology.
[01:54:45.660 --> 01:54:47.660]   Wow.
[01:54:47.660 --> 01:54:48.820]   That's really neat.
[01:54:48.820 --> 01:54:49.820]   Thank you.
[01:54:49.820 --> 01:54:50.820]   Thank you.
[01:54:50.820 --> 01:54:51.820]   Lori Gill, everybody.
[01:54:51.820 --> 01:54:53.820]   I'm more.com.
[01:54:53.820 --> 01:54:55.180]   We didn't rich.
[01:54:55.180 --> 01:54:59.140]   We didn't probably mention the pick, but do you have something you'd like to pick besides
[01:54:59.140 --> 01:55:01.380]   of course, the fabulous BB edit?
[01:55:01.380 --> 01:55:03.380]   It doesn't suck.
[01:55:03.380 --> 01:55:05.180]   Yes.
[01:55:05.180 --> 01:55:12.020]   So recently, my wife and I got a flash forge 3D printer.
[01:55:12.020 --> 01:55:15.340]   Ooh, I'm jealous.
[01:55:15.340 --> 01:55:18.700]   It's our second one.
[01:55:18.700 --> 01:55:21.580]   The original one was a printer bot.
[01:55:21.580 --> 01:55:32.980]   And it's remarkable to see how far the usability and features of these things have advanced.
[01:55:32.980 --> 01:55:39.380]   It's got assisted leveling, which for 3D printing is just huge because it takes 99% of the
[01:55:39.380 --> 01:55:43.100]   pain out of getting the print surface level.
[01:55:43.100 --> 01:55:44.860]   Which one did you get?
[01:55:44.860 --> 01:55:48.620]   So we got the Geider 2.
[01:55:48.620 --> 01:55:50.940]   It's got a nice big print volume.
[01:55:50.940 --> 01:55:56.180]   So you can do things like print cylinders for sock knitting machines.
[01:55:56.180 --> 01:56:04.340]   So yeah, it's a thing that makes things that makes things.
[01:56:04.340 --> 01:56:07.380]   So you make sock knitting parts?
[01:56:07.380 --> 01:56:13.780]   So mostly as an experiment, she's printed out a circular sock knitting machine.
[01:56:13.780 --> 01:56:14.780]   Nice.
[01:56:14.780 --> 01:56:15.780]   Wow.
[01:56:15.780 --> 01:56:17.860]   It's pretty remarkable.
[01:56:17.860 --> 01:56:19.820]   Wow.
[01:56:19.820 --> 01:56:21.260]   And yeah, it's fast.
[01:56:21.260 --> 01:56:23.140]   It works with a variety of materials.
[01:56:23.140 --> 01:56:26.060]   It's super easy to set up and print to.
[01:56:26.060 --> 01:56:29.540]   The max software is a little eh, but it works.
[01:56:29.540 --> 01:56:33.580]   Well, it's too bad you don't know somebody who could improve it.
[01:56:33.580 --> 01:56:36.020]   Yeah, you know, if only.
[01:56:36.020 --> 01:56:39.380]   If only, yeah, the few minutes a day.
[01:56:39.380 --> 01:56:40.980]   Just a few extra minutes.
[01:56:40.980 --> 01:56:44.100]   It's only your, it's only your, it's more industrious.
[01:56:44.100 --> 01:56:49.020]   Are you ever tempted to like just write your own program?
[01:56:49.020 --> 01:56:50.020]   All the time.
[01:56:50.020 --> 01:56:51.020]   Yeah.
[01:56:51.020 --> 01:56:53.740]   You know, I'll look at something and I'll say, oh my goodness, I wish I had the time to
[01:56:53.740 --> 01:56:54.740]   write this.
[01:56:54.740 --> 01:56:56.260]   I could do that so much better.
[01:56:56.260 --> 01:56:57.820]   I know exactly what I would do.
[01:56:57.820 --> 01:56:59.540]   Well, better is relative, right?
[01:56:59.540 --> 01:57:04.300]   It's like I would do it the way I would want it to work, which might be better.
[01:57:04.300 --> 01:57:05.300]   Right.
[01:57:05.300 --> 01:57:06.300]   Or might not.
[01:57:06.300 --> 01:57:11.620]   I want to learn a really good scripting language because I want to just automate all
[01:57:11.620 --> 01:57:12.620]   the things.
[01:57:12.620 --> 01:57:15.020]   Automate all the things.
[01:57:15.020 --> 01:57:16.020]   Yeah.
[01:57:16.020 --> 01:57:19.540]   You know, there's, you hear these stories all the time about programmers.
[01:57:19.540 --> 01:57:23.180]   I just read one on Reddit where a guy left work and they had found all his scripts and
[01:57:23.180 --> 01:57:30.860]   he had scripts like, if I, he pushes a button, it counts down 29 seconds and then connects
[01:57:30.860 --> 01:57:36.460]   to the coffee machine, which they had no idea had a wireless connection, network connection.
[01:57:36.460 --> 01:57:42.740]   And it starts making his coffee because it takes exactly 17 seconds for him to, and it
[01:57:42.740 --> 01:57:47.900]   he would push the button, get up, start walking, and the coffee be ready when he got there
[01:57:47.900 --> 01:57:49.000]   and came back.
[01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:56.140]   Or if he's at work after 7 p.m., it sends a text to his wife, you know, I mean, just
[01:57:56.140 --> 01:57:58.460]   like they found all these scripts.
[01:57:58.460 --> 01:58:02.060]   And I think that that would be kind of cool just to automate everything.
[01:58:02.060 --> 01:58:03.820]   What were they written in?
[01:58:03.820 --> 01:58:04.820]   Probably.
[01:58:04.820 --> 01:58:05.820]   Well, who knows?
[01:58:05.820 --> 01:58:06.820]   I don't know.
[01:58:06.820 --> 01:58:07.820]   Probably.
[01:58:07.820 --> 01:58:09.460]   Yeah, probably Python or maybe Bash.
[01:58:09.460 --> 01:58:10.460]   I don't know.
[01:58:10.460 --> 01:58:11.460]   I don't know.
[01:58:11.460 --> 01:58:12.460]   Right.
[01:58:12.460 --> 01:58:15.860]   And then what you want to do is kind of sort of, yeah, what you want to do by what you want
[01:58:15.860 --> 01:58:16.860]   to do.
[01:58:16.860 --> 01:58:18.740]   And then it requires interfaces to everything.
[01:58:18.740 --> 01:58:23.020]   So you have to make sure the coffee machine could talk to the network and, and understand
[01:58:23.020 --> 01:58:26.300]   whatever language you're using and all of that.
[01:58:26.300 --> 01:58:29.300]   See, so if you learn ARM assembly, you can automate anything.
[01:58:29.300 --> 01:58:32.100]   I think for a coffee machine, Java is the preferred language.
[01:58:32.100 --> 01:58:35.100]   I might be, I might be wrong on that.
[01:58:35.100 --> 01:58:38.620]   Oh, so, so you like it.
[01:58:38.620 --> 01:58:39.620]   Flashforge.com.
[01:58:39.620 --> 01:58:40.620]   Flashforge.com.
[01:58:40.620 --> 01:58:42.420]   Yeah, we're very happy with it.
[01:58:42.420 --> 01:58:43.420]   It's fast.
[01:58:43.420 --> 01:58:45.740]   It's easy to use.
[01:58:45.740 --> 01:58:47.740]   Nice.
[01:58:47.740 --> 01:58:56.300]   Just 3D printing like many makerish things can either be super smooth or super finicky.
[01:58:56.300 --> 01:59:02.940]   And this has really just demonstrated the evolution from super smooth to super finicky.
[01:59:02.940 --> 01:59:04.980]   Wait, the other way around.
[01:59:04.980 --> 01:59:06.420]   Super finicky to super smooth.
[01:59:06.420 --> 01:59:07.420]   It is super smooth.
[01:59:07.420 --> 01:59:13.100]   And if you ever need to make dental appliances of any kind, they have a special dental printing
[01:59:13.100 --> 01:59:15.540]   version of the flashforge.
[01:59:15.540 --> 01:59:18.140]   Yeah, make your own teeth.
[01:59:18.140 --> 01:59:21.620]   Renee Richie, a pick of the week.
[01:59:21.620 --> 01:59:25.300]   So I'm going back to one of my perennial favorites because they had a big new update
[01:59:25.300 --> 01:59:26.980]   and that's procreate.
[01:59:26.980 --> 01:59:30.020]   And they added the ability to do text and type setting.
[01:59:30.020 --> 01:59:31.540]   So you could always sketch in it.
[01:59:31.540 --> 01:59:32.620]   You could always draw in it.
[01:59:32.620 --> 01:59:36.740]   You could always do all your design and your layout, but you had to do handwritten text,
[01:59:36.740 --> 01:59:40.620]   which for some people is super easy and for some people is quasi nightmarish.
[01:59:40.620 --> 01:59:47.500]   But now you have sort of full command of the typography that's available, such as it is
[01:59:47.500 --> 01:59:48.500]   on iOS.
[01:59:48.500 --> 01:59:50.620]   It's still a weakness on iOS.
[01:59:50.620 --> 01:59:51.620]   Rumor has it up.
[01:59:51.620 --> 01:59:56.140]   It will be addressing that this year and that'll be fantastic, especially because procreate
[01:59:56.140 --> 02:00:00.300]   is ready and Photoshop is about to ship and all of those things.
[02:00:00.300 --> 02:00:06.100]   But just the ability to sort of add all the text you want and all the styles you want
[02:00:06.100 --> 02:00:12.380]   using, the kind of engine and elegance that procreate provides is one of the best things
[02:00:12.380 --> 02:00:13.380]   ever.
[02:00:13.380 --> 02:00:18.460]   It's just such a, I like in using an iPad to finger painting with productivity.
[02:00:18.460 --> 02:00:23.460]   And there's something very old worldy about, it's not like picking up lead and putting
[02:00:23.460 --> 02:00:29.220]   it into a press or using a brush, but there's just something about putting stuff exactly
[02:00:29.220 --> 02:00:33.700]   where you want it and moving it around and making that perfect layout that I just find
[02:00:33.700 --> 02:00:35.700]   immensely satisfying.
[02:00:35.700 --> 02:00:41.620]   I just found out, because we had mom on iOS today for the show for Mother's Day, I just
[02:00:41.620 --> 02:00:45.100]   my mother found out that she uses procreate.
[02:00:45.100 --> 02:00:46.700]   And in fact, that's what she used.
[02:00:46.700 --> 02:00:50.380]   In fact, she's going to like the text thing because this is her Easter, she uses it to
[02:00:50.380 --> 02:00:51.380]   create cards.
[02:00:51.380 --> 02:00:52.380]   This is her Easter card.
[02:00:52.380 --> 02:00:53.380]   That's awesome.
[02:00:53.380 --> 02:00:57.220]   It says our nest eggs may not be the same size, but we're all spring chickens.
[02:00:57.220 --> 02:00:58.220]   Happy Easter.
[02:00:58.220 --> 02:01:00.180]   I don't know what that means.
[02:01:00.180 --> 02:01:03.620]   Yeah, she loves procreate.
[02:01:03.620 --> 02:01:06.780]   She'll be happy to know that you can use the text tool now.
[02:01:06.780 --> 02:01:09.140]   It's just the developed James Koot and the entire team.
[02:01:09.140 --> 02:01:12.500]   They're just so thoughtful about not only what they add, but how they add it.
[02:01:12.500 --> 02:01:14.180]   That's always the best thing for that.
[02:01:14.180 --> 02:01:15.660]   Very nice.
[02:01:15.660 --> 02:01:16.660]   Andy?
[02:01:16.660 --> 02:01:21.100]   My pick of the week, it's kind of a lateral thing.
[02:01:21.100 --> 02:01:24.580]   I did buy a brand new Mac book over the weekend.
[02:01:24.580 --> 02:01:25.580]   Wait a minute.
[02:01:25.580 --> 02:01:26.580]   That ain't no brand new man.
[02:01:26.580 --> 02:01:27.580]   Well, it's so funny.
[02:01:27.580 --> 02:01:28.580]   It's so funny.
[02:01:28.580 --> 02:01:30.900]   The Daisy get a hold of that.
[02:01:30.900 --> 02:01:32.420]   That looks like a...
[02:01:32.420 --> 02:01:39.340]   This is a 2008-2009 Mac book for comma one.
[02:01:39.340 --> 02:01:45.780]   That last Sunday was the third Sunday in April, which made it the first MIT flea market of
[02:01:45.780 --> 02:01:46.780]   the year.
[02:01:46.780 --> 02:01:51.340]   It runs the third Sunday of the month of April through October.
[02:01:51.340 --> 02:01:59.140]   I bought this because it said for parts or repair and for 10 bucks.
[02:01:59.140 --> 02:02:00.620]   Oh, nice.
[02:02:00.620 --> 02:02:06.020]   And see, one little trick is that when you see there is a pile of them and actually a
[02:02:06.020 --> 02:02:10.220]   lot of different sellers like had, I don't know what it is about white Mac books, but
[02:02:10.220 --> 02:02:13.500]   they had lots of people, had lots of them.
[02:02:13.500 --> 02:02:18.700]   And some of them will have like little posters that says, "Oh, bad backlight or a DVD drive
[02:02:18.700 --> 02:02:19.700]   does not work."
[02:02:19.700 --> 02:02:24.300]   The ones that you kind of want to look for are the ones that say for parts or repair because
[02:02:24.300 --> 02:02:29.100]   it might mean that it was so screwed up that they couldn't even quantify it on a post-it
[02:02:29.100 --> 02:02:30.100]   note.
[02:02:30.100 --> 02:02:33.620]   Or it could mean that they just didn't have time to test it and they don't want to take
[02:02:33.620 --> 02:02:36.940]   responsibility for saying it works when it doesn't.
[02:02:36.940 --> 02:02:37.940]   And well, I'll be darned.
[02:02:37.940 --> 02:02:38.940]   It works perfectly fine.
[02:02:38.940 --> 02:02:43.500]   So I got a $10 and it has a MagSafe connector.
[02:02:43.500 --> 02:02:47.780]   So I already had plenty of chargers that work just fine in it.
[02:02:47.780 --> 02:02:51.260]   And so I fired it up and tested it up yesterday.
[02:02:51.260 --> 02:02:53.700]   I was really taken with how different...
[02:02:53.700 --> 02:02:59.580]   I had my modern MacBook, excuse me, my 2015 MacBook on my lap, I put that on the side
[02:02:59.580 --> 02:03:00.580]   table.
[02:03:00.580 --> 02:03:03.180]   And I was really taken with like how different the world was.
[02:03:03.180 --> 02:03:04.180]   So here is...
[02:03:04.180 --> 02:03:05.180]   And this was...
[02:03:05.180 --> 02:03:07.980]   Remember that this was Apple's budget Mac.
[02:03:07.980 --> 02:03:09.620]   This was their $1,000 Mac.
[02:03:09.620 --> 02:03:10.940]   That's why there's so many of them.
[02:03:10.940 --> 02:03:12.580]   Schools use those like crazy.
[02:03:12.580 --> 02:03:13.580]   Right.
[02:03:13.580 --> 02:03:14.580]   Right.
[02:03:14.580 --> 02:03:15.580]   Right.
[02:03:15.580 --> 02:03:16.580]   Pretty much.
[02:03:16.580 --> 02:03:18.700]   And so you realize that, okay, well, what do you know, you have a whole variety of ports
[02:03:18.700 --> 02:03:20.500]   built right in there.
[02:03:20.500 --> 02:03:21.500]   Look at that.
[02:03:21.500 --> 02:03:22.860]   Including fire wire.
[02:03:22.860 --> 02:03:23.860]   It's unfortunately...
[02:03:23.860 --> 02:03:32.860]   It's a gigabit ethernet, but it is the old fire wire, a fire wire 400 mini DVI slot for
[02:03:32.860 --> 02:03:36.820]   external video up to 1920 by whatever.
[02:03:36.820 --> 02:03:39.180]   This will probably clean up very well.
[02:03:39.180 --> 02:03:46.780]   The keyboard that feels like even much as good as like my desktop keyboard almost, even
[02:03:46.780 --> 02:03:49.220]   though it's relatively low profile.
[02:03:49.220 --> 02:03:53.460]   The only thing that really threw me was I thought that the trackpad was broken, but
[02:03:53.460 --> 02:03:55.620]   only before I realized, oh, that's right.
[02:03:55.620 --> 02:03:58.220]   There's an actual separate button you have to press for the clicks.
[02:03:58.220 --> 02:03:59.220]   You can't.
[02:03:59.220 --> 02:04:02.940]   There is no 3D touch on this thing.
[02:04:02.940 --> 02:04:06.580]   And right now it's running a Mac OS 10.5.
[02:04:06.580 --> 02:04:12.220]   I can upgrade it to 10.7 Mac OS Lion without breaking any of Apple's rules.
[02:04:12.220 --> 02:04:13.460]   There are tricks to upgrading it.
[02:04:13.460 --> 02:04:15.540]   I've read above that.
[02:04:15.540 --> 02:04:21.300]   The only thing that's actually wrong with it is the battery just does not hold a charge.
[02:04:21.300 --> 02:04:24.420]   But again, here's another blast for a pass from the pass.
[02:04:24.420 --> 02:04:26.460]   It is a replaceable battery.
[02:04:26.460 --> 02:04:27.940]   I could actually replace myself.
[02:04:27.940 --> 02:04:34.020]   The problem is though, you do need to have a special esoteric tool to get it open.
[02:04:34.020 --> 02:04:36.020]   It looks like an echo.
[02:04:36.020 --> 02:04:37.020]   Yeah.
[02:04:37.020 --> 02:04:38.020]   That costs you how much that costs you?
[02:04:38.020 --> 02:04:39.900]   Yeah, it will cost me a 12.
[02:04:39.900 --> 02:04:40.900]   25 cents.
[02:04:40.900 --> 02:04:45.460]   It may look like a quarter, but the guy at the MIT fleece said it might void the water
[02:04:45.460 --> 02:04:48.340]   warranty if I didn't get the special $90 one.
[02:04:48.340 --> 02:04:52.300]   But yeah, so this is the only part that's broken.
[02:04:52.300 --> 02:04:58.180]   And I can get a replacement for anywhere from like $15 for a really sketchy one to 50 or
[02:04:58.180 --> 02:05:03.300]   60 for one by a more reputable maker.
[02:05:03.300 --> 02:05:09.180]   But that's I've it wasn't it's 10 bucks as cheap as free when it comes to like a usable
[02:05:09.180 --> 02:05:10.180]   Mac book.
[02:05:10.180 --> 02:05:14.220]   If it didn't work, I was going to consider like getting it using it, getting take off
[02:05:14.220 --> 02:05:17.700]   the display and using it for something else, using for some sort of some sort of a maker
[02:05:17.700 --> 02:05:18.780]   project.
[02:05:18.780 --> 02:05:23.500]   But for even if but as it's working, I don't know whether I'm going to upgrade it to lion
[02:05:23.500 --> 02:05:30.580]   and just make replace the battery and just have it as a permanently installed Mac on
[02:05:30.580 --> 02:05:35.420]   like an end table of the living room, or maybe I'll just install like arch Linux on it and
[02:05:35.420 --> 02:05:37.500]   just use it as a Linux box.
[02:05:37.500 --> 02:05:42.500]   But it's it is it's nice to have something that's this useful for 10 bucks.
[02:05:42.500 --> 02:05:44.820]   And also there you go.
[02:05:44.820 --> 02:05:49.420]   Holy cow, it's it has a dollar bill reader or something.
[02:05:49.420 --> 02:05:51.300]   Yeah, I think it's a bill reader.
[02:05:51.300 --> 02:05:52.300]   Yeah, I think it's yeah.
[02:05:52.300 --> 02:05:53.300]   I'll I'll stop.
[02:05:53.300 --> 02:05:55.300]   I'll put some baloney in there.
[02:05:55.300 --> 02:05:56.540]   But yeah, it's it.
[02:05:56.540 --> 02:06:02.140]   So I would I mean, I'm not recommending people run out and buy like old Mac books, but they
[02:06:02.140 --> 02:06:03.620]   are if you have speed.
[02:06:03.620 --> 02:06:06.220]   I mean, is it running a reasonable speed?
[02:06:06.220 --> 02:06:07.700]   You know what?
[02:06:07.700 --> 02:06:12.060]   It runs I running on 10.5.
[02:06:12.060 --> 02:06:14.500]   It doesn't seem laggy at all.
[02:06:14.500 --> 02:06:22.340]   That we had it's it had a course that whoever last owned it didn't wipe it before they got
[02:06:22.340 --> 02:06:23.340]   rid of it.
[02:06:23.340 --> 02:06:26.340]   So it had so it had a full suite of apps on it.
[02:06:26.340 --> 02:06:30.140]   And I was using the old version of Safari as using the old version of iTunes, the old
[02:06:30.140 --> 02:06:31.580]   version of word.
[02:06:31.580 --> 02:06:32.860]   They were all working just fine.
[02:06:32.860 --> 02:06:39.580]   I'm sure that if I did do a hack to get it to run run Mojave or something more modern,
[02:06:39.580 --> 02:06:43.900]   that's when it would really start to slow down mightily because it's not built for these
[02:06:43.900 --> 02:06:46.860]   old old core duo processors.
[02:06:46.860 --> 02:06:51.140]   But it doesn't mean that there's no nothing you can do with this, particularly if you
[02:06:51.140 --> 02:06:55.660]   want to start experimenting with other with other operating systems and stuff like that.
[02:06:55.660 --> 02:07:00.540]   So if you if you got if someone has a flea market, keep an eye out for these.
[02:07:00.540 --> 02:07:04.300]   They are they are kind of cool even just to show the kids what it used to what a real
[02:07:04.300 --> 02:07:06.060]   laptop used to be like.
[02:07:06.060 --> 02:07:10.220]   Again, I can't get over the fact that once again, this was the budget Mac.
[02:07:10.220 --> 02:07:14.540]   This was what you got if you if you walked in and said, give me the cheapest Mac you can
[02:07:14.540 --> 02:07:15.540]   possibly have.
[02:07:15.540 --> 02:07:19.540]   And there's so many things on here that I wish my $2,000 Mac.
[02:07:19.540 --> 02:07:21.980]   Yeah, I actually I think I have one of those in my garage.
[02:07:21.980 --> 02:07:23.820]   It was my daughters in high school.
[02:07:23.820 --> 02:07:26.980]   Yeah, I think it was the first Mac that I had.
[02:07:26.980 --> 02:07:30.380]   Yeah, I think that was my first Mac was was that year and everything.
[02:07:30.380 --> 02:07:36.060]   Yeah, they build these things to last.
[02:07:36.060 --> 02:07:37.060]   Do you rich?
[02:07:37.060 --> 02:07:38.500]   You probably have a lab of old Macs, right?
[02:07:38.500 --> 02:07:42.100]   So you could test BB ed in different.
[02:07:42.100 --> 02:07:43.100]   Not as much as we used to.
[02:07:43.100 --> 02:07:49.660]   We used to have old hardware, but as we sort of started supporting newer OS's and Apple
[02:07:49.660 --> 02:07:52.620]   started aging older hardware off, it became less necessary.
[02:07:52.620 --> 02:07:53.620]   Yeah, I guess.
[02:07:53.620 --> 02:07:59.980]   And also hardware is a really less of an issue for us specifically.
[02:07:59.980 --> 02:08:03.460]   So tech editor works where you are.
[02:08:03.460 --> 02:08:05.260]   That's the beauty of it.
[02:08:05.260 --> 02:08:06.660]   Rich Segal, great to have you.
[02:08:06.660 --> 02:08:10.380]   Everybody should have a copy of BB ed at go to barebones.com.
[02:08:10.380 --> 02:08:15.660]   You could try it free for 30 days or now get it in the Mac app store.
[02:08:15.660 --> 02:08:16.660]   Isn't that nice?
[02:08:16.660 --> 02:08:19.220]   Also, it's great to have you.
[02:08:19.220 --> 02:08:25.220]   It's we always we always enjoy it and no parrots today, which was on, but are they after cleaning
[02:08:25.220 --> 02:08:26.220]   or?
[02:08:26.220 --> 02:08:27.220]   Nope.
[02:08:27.220 --> 02:08:31.540]   They're right there being quiet, behaving themselves disturbingly well.
[02:08:31.540 --> 02:08:35.700]   What watch are you wearing today?
[02:08:35.700 --> 02:08:40.100]   I have a third series three Apple watch.
[02:08:40.100 --> 02:08:42.860]   Oh, I saw your watch winder in the background there.
[02:08:42.860 --> 02:08:46.460]   I thought you were wearing some automatic watch.
[02:08:46.460 --> 02:08:47.460]   Classic.
[02:08:47.460 --> 02:08:49.300]   Here comes the parrot.
[02:08:49.300 --> 02:08:50.300]   Look at that.
[02:08:50.300 --> 02:08:51.300]   So beautiful.
[02:08:51.300 --> 02:08:52.500]   Is that an African blue?
[02:08:52.500 --> 02:08:54.900]   What is she?
[02:08:54.900 --> 02:08:55.900]   This is Bruno.
[02:08:55.900 --> 02:08:56.900]   He's an African gray.
[02:08:56.900 --> 02:08:57.900]   I mean, yeah, blue.
[02:08:57.900 --> 02:08:58.900]   You're a fan.
[02:08:58.900 --> 02:09:00.620]   Yeah, very pretty.
[02:09:00.620 --> 02:09:01.620]   Hi, Bruno.
[02:09:01.620 --> 02:09:03.620]   Hi, Bruno.
[02:09:03.620 --> 02:09:04.620]   Mm hmm.
[02:09:04.620 --> 02:09:05.620]   Very pretty.
[02:09:05.620 --> 02:09:06.620]   Thank you.
[02:09:06.620 --> 02:09:07.620]   Thank you, Ritz.
