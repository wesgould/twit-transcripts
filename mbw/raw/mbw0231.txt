[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.480]   Welcome to Mac Break Weekly, Macworld Expo Week.
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.160]   And you know what that means?
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.440]   The studio is Jimmy Jammed with people
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.400]   in town for Macworld Expo, including
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.520]   our good friend Don McAllister, who--
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.960]   that's not him.
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.720]   That's Adam Christensen from tidbits.
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.320]   Hey, Adam.
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.960]   Well, that's the other Adam.
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.760]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.680]   Who are you?
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.880]   Adam Christensen from the Mac cast.
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.360]   The Mac cast.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Adam angst.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.080]   Yeah, I got Adam on a mind.
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.880]   I'm sorry about that.
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.680]   Yes, hi, Adam.
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.320]   I know who you are.
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.280]   I don't know what I'm saying.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.080]   I do.
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.760]   Good lord.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.440]   And then the Brit guy.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.520]   No.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.400]   I got my buttons on wrong.
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.520]   There he is.
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.080]   Don McAllister, who decided to come in.
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.520]   Hi, Leo.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.000]   Yes, yes.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.160]   Your town on your way to Buena Tharries.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.680]   On the way, you thought we'd just stop in, you know,
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.360]   see Macworld.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.160]   Is it on the way, really, to Buena's series?
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.080]   No, not really.
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.760]   Yeah.
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.200]   Well, wow.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.080]   That's Alex Lindsay also here.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.840]   We got a big show.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.280]   And we're going to try to--
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.600]   Adam, I mean, Andy Enacos on his way in.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.480]   He's on Virgin America flying to San Francisco right now.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.520]   And we're going to try to Skype him in from Virgin America
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.440]   because it got way too tight.
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.160]   I don't think it'll work.
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.720]   But anyway, we're going to try this.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.040]   But before we go any further, we should say hello
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.800]   to the man behind Macworld Expo.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.720]   For many years, Mr. Paul, Ken, hey, Paul.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.160]   Hi, Leo.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.680]   How are you?
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.440]   I am great.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.560]   You must be crazy right about now.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.440]   It is hopping over here.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.360]   I'm in my little office here at the Moscone
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.680]   and all of the little ants are out there moving things here.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.920]   They are setting things up.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.000]   It's actually very cool.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.360]   The building looks beautiful.
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.200]   And we're getting ready to host the big party this week.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.240]   When do you start preparing for the next Macworld Expo?
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.160]   You know, we work on Macworld year round,
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.240]   whether it's interviewing people to speak with us
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.240]   or out on sales calls trying to get new exhibitors
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.240]   to participate with us.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.720]   So Macworld is an ongoing concern for us.
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.120]   We worked 365 on it.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.360]   So really, this is Christmas New Year's and April Fool's
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.600]   all rolled into one.
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.200]   That's right.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.240]   Hey, Bob, congratulations on the new facility.
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.400]   I saw the video yesterday.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.280]   The brick to it house is awesome.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.000]   Thank you, Paul.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.880]   I appreciate it.
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.080]   Maybe, you know, we could have our own Expo there.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.400]   Thank you.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.280]   Got enough space.
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.200]   Practically.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.040]   Macworld Expo will be coming to Moscone Center in San Francisco.
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.000]   The conference starts tomorrow, January 26.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   The runs to the 29th.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.880]   The Expo itself is the 27th, 28th, and 29th at Moscone.
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:42.320]   Now--
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.880]   Moscone West.
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:43.920]   Moscone West.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.000]   Oh, Moscone West.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.480]   That's better.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.280]   That's where Steve always gives his speeches.
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.040]   I love Moscone West.
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.280]   We took all three floors of Moscone West.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.360]   The first floor is the Expo.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.560]   The second floor are the feature presentations.
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.640]   And the top floor are the conferences, which is pretty cool.
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.960]   Over in Moscone, north and south,
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.760]   there's a laser conference over there.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.200]   There are a lot of Dr. Evil jokes going over there.
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.200]   Oh, lasers.
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.800]   Well, that's good.
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.680]   You know, we get to get kill two birds with one stone,
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.400]   or so to speak.
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.560]   I shouldn't have said that was probably a felicitist.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.760]   So Paul, tell us a little bit about Macworld Expo
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.320]   and what people who are coming to town can expect.
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.920]   Absolutely.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.760]   So this is our 27th year of presenting Macworld.
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.480]   Wow.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.320]   Wait a minute.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.200]   Let me let that sink in.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.840]   27 years.
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:25.360]   Yeah.
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.880]   So when was the first Macworld Expo?
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.880]   It was 1984?
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.120]   I was three at the time.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.960]   So I don't really remember it very well.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.760]   Oh, stop it.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.280]   That's kind of hard to believe.
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.640]   Wow.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.600]   Macworld was part of the launch activities
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.520]   for the original Mac.
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.840]   I mean, the launch of the trade show
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.920]   was, again, part of the Buzzbuilding campaign
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.240]   when the original Mac came out when
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.680]   you were fighting the evil empire of IBM.
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.120]   Right.
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.280]   1984.
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.920]   So 27 years later, in some ways, it's not really a Mac show
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.600]   anymore, is it?
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.480]   I mean, I guess there's Mac stuff there,
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.440]   but it's as much as iPhone and iPad show.
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.440]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.880]   Macworld is kind of a mirror on the Apple products world.
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.400]   And so the show floor of Macworld this year
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.160]   is actually very parallel to Apple's reported earnings.
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.560]   About a third of the show would be Mac-specific products.
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.040]   And about 2/3 are phone, pad, or pod products.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.480]   You know, it's funny how that's changed.
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.600]   I mean, you wouldn't--
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.760]   27 years ago, you wouldn't have said that.
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.840]   That's just amazing.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.240]   Yeah.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.960]   How many vendors this year?
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.160]   About 260.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.280]   So up about 10% for last year.
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.520]   And that's great.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.040]   Remember--
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.680]   I'm really happy with that.
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.680]   I mean, again, the dynamics of the show have changed.
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.240]   One thing that's really interesting
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.320]   is about a third of the vendors are first time to Macworld.
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.120]   And so that tells us a couple of things.
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.240]   One, it's great for attendees because it's new blood.
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.760]   I think that's really exciting.
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.960]   Second thing is the way that people use a trade show
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:46.760]   has been changing.
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.200]   Rarely do companies use a trade show just to shake hands
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.040]   and keep in touch with customers anymore.
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.560]   Really, they either are a new company
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.560]   who's using Macworld as a place to come to market,
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.240]   or they've got a new product to bring to market.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.760]   And that's what they use the show for.
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.000]   Well, that makes a lot of sense, actually.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.960]   Two years ago, Apple announced it
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.240]   wasn't coming back to Macworld.
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.880]   Last year was your first non-Apple Macworld.
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.160]   But you're growing, which is kind of interesting.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.280]   Yeah, actually, not only are we growing in exhibitors,
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.680]   we're growing dramatically with attendees.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.600]   So I'm always cautious about sharing these types of numbers
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.120]   because the real number is how many people actually
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.760]   show up at the end of the show.
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:27.120]   But tracking things apples to apples to coin a phrase.
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.000]   The number of preregistrations we have
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.800]   is up dramatically from last year, about 25%.
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.840]   So if all things track the way they always have,
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.680]   we'll have close to 25,000 people here, which is up a lot
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.080]   over last year.
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.640]   And within shouting distance of the 26,000,
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.880]   we had the last show in 2009 when Apple did participate.
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.160]   That's kind of-- I'm glad to hear it, Paul.
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.880]   It's great.
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.320]   People root for Macworld.
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.600]   Of course, everybody here is an Apple product lover.
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.000]   But people really like Macworld.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.800]   It is a reason-- last year, you were so generous with us,
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.920]   promoting the show, doing the keynote for us last year.
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.360]   Macworld means something to people.
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.520]   It's still a place where people can get out of their houses,
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.320]   get out from behind their computers,
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.360]   and kind of physically establish and reestablish
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.080]   the relationships that are so important to them.
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.240]   There's some who say that--
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.800]   --important people don't do that.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.200]   But I think Mac people do it more than the others.
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.360]   Let's put it that way.
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.400]   Well, it's really users, too.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.120]   I think that a lot of the conferences that I go to
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.320]   is all filled with professionals.
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.040]   You know, like, you know, that are a little dated--
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:26.800]   A little bit of a professional track.
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.160]   I know there's a lot of pros there.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.160]   There's a lot of pros there.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.440]   But what I think is really-- what I find invigorating
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.320]   a lot of times is that there's a lot of users there.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:33.880]   There's this really--
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.120]   There's this there's a lot of users there.
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.320]   It's not-- you know, it's people who are really into their Mac
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.520]   that are really passionate and not quite as jaded as a lot of us
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.440]   are when we're walking around.
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.800]   I like to say, but Mac was one of the last populist technology
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.120]   events.
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.480]   You don't have to be an industry insider.
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.400]   It's not press only.
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.800]   It's not executives only.
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.600]   It's one of the few places where a user can buy a ticket,
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.480]   walk in, and discover products, take conference sessions
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.720]   for their own personal enjoyment.
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.120]   So it is a different vibe than many of the shows.
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.840]   And, you know, there's a lot of people
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.240]   who are kind of jaded conference professionals
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.640]   that are looking for different things.
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:07.400]   But the thing about Mackerel is that there's a joy quotient to it.
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.320]   There's just this great feeling that people come in.
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:14.320]   Everyone under the roof of Moscone has a common interest.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.760]   And that creates all sorts of really interesting dynamics--
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.760]   educators talking to musicians, filmmakers talking
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.400]   to musicians.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.720]   Just these kind of cross sections of users
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.720]   create a lot of really interesting things that
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.800]   is part of the vibe of what the show has always been about.
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.960]   Do you get any contact from Apple at all?
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.760]   So they talk to you at all, or is it kind of-- we're done.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.440]   We don't want to have any issue with you.
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.320]   It's nothing that sinister.
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.280]   There's plenty of people with Apple
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.560]   who walk around the show because these
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:44.800]   are their customers, too.
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:48.120]   I fully expect Souths to go in will be right there front
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:48.920]   and center, of course.
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:49.920]   Absolutely.
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.440]   And--
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.640]   The people we care about, let's put it that way.
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:54.120]   Right.
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:54.640]   That's true.
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.440]   Yeah.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.120]   I think that, remember, these are all Apple's customers
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.600]   getting together in one place at one time.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.280]   And it's an interesting dynamic, and it's a lot of products.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.900]   I heard last year that the store people
[00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.680]   walked the show looking for stuff to decide if they wanted
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:06.520]   to carry it or not.
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:07.520]   Not interesting.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.880]   This serves kind of a--
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.720]   they can't carry a flag for it, but I still
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.560]   think that this is a valuable thing for many pockets of Apple.
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.160]   Yeah.
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:16.720]   It'd have to be.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.240]   Do they-- one of the things I always worry about
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.480]   is that Apple will undermine you
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.400]   by making an announcement shortly before, shortly after,
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.040]   worse would be after.
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.360]   Do they communicate with you about that kind of stuff at all?
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.360]   Or--
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.800]   Well, remember last year they announced the iPad
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:31.640]   a week before the show.
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:32.360]   Yeah.
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.800]   So what we did was we created an iPad special event
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.240]   where we had everybody--
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.360]   Andy and Notco as a part of it.
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.040]   Jason Snell was--
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:38.360]   That's right.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:38.880]   I remember that.
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:39.520]   Yeah.
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.120]   Talked about what is the iPad going to be?
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.080]   Is it if we would--
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.200]   And it actually added some of the energy to the show.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:47.080]   This year, there's some energy about who's going over
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:47.640]   to Verizon.
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.160]   There's certainly--
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.440]   if you think about all the really interesting and informed
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.840]   people that are at the show, there's
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:54.840]   going to be conversation about Steve
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:55.840]  's health and will he return.
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.840]   There's going to be conversation about what the iPad 2 will be.
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.840]   And that's kind of one of the nice things.
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.840]   If you look at the shows kind of having this town hall
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:07.840]   feeling about it, opinion shaping, informed, opinion sharing,
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:08.840]   that all happens in a show like this.
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.840]   So whatever Apple does, we want them to keep making great
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:12.840]   products.
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.840]   And then people come to Mac will to learn about them,
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.840]   talk about them, feel connected in a different type of way
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.840]   than going into an Apple store is.
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:19.840]   That's awesome.
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.840]   Well, Paul, I don't want to keep you because I--
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.840]   you probably 18 people at your door going, Paul,
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.840]   we need you, we need you, we need you.
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.840]   So I'll let you go, but we'll see you.
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.840]   If you're going to the conference, you'll see them tomorrow.
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.840]   If you're there for the expo, it starts 10 AM Thursday at
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:34.840]   Moscone West.
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.840]   $45 for a ticket at the door.
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:38.840]   Is that right, Paul?
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.840]   $25 until tomorrow, actually.
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:41.840]   So today it's 25.
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:42.840]   So go now.
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:43.840]   Go now.
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.840]   MacworldExpo.com and you can get your tickets right now and
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:46.840]   save 20 bucks.
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:49.840]   Also, it'll speed you up in the line too.
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:50.840]   That's right.
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:51.840]   So a good thing to do.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.840]   Thank you, Paul Ken.
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:53.840]   Thanks for having me on.
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:54.840]   My pleasure.
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.840]   See you Thursday.
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:56.840]   Looking forward to it.
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:57.840]   Take care.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:58.840]   Bye-bye.
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.840]   Paul Kent, who is a-- I don't know-- executive director,
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.840]   Guy in charge, the boss of MacworldExpo.
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:04.840]   The dude.
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:05.840]   The dude.
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.840]   And you know, I have to think that it must be-- it's a
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.840]   difficult job for Paul, especially with Apple leaving and
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:12.840]   everything.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.840]   It is, except what's great is that you're working on a
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:15.840]   product that keeps on growing.
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:16.840]   You know, Apple--
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:17.840]   That's kind of--
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:18.840]   I think that's shock to me, to be honest.
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.840]   I think that-- but I think that that's the-- well, but I
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.840]   think that's shock to me because I think that because the
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.840]   Apple market keeps on growing, because Apple's having one record
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.840]   quarter after another, there is still a lot of interest in it
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:30.840]   from the industry in that area.
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.840]   And that's not-- for a lot of the industries, they're
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.840]   stagnating and Apple continues to grow.
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.840]   So I think that's the advantage.
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:37.840]   Go ahead.
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.840]   I think that the big thing that came-- and Paul said, it's the
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.840]   enthusiasm of Apple users and Mac users that go to the show.
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.840]   You know, and you don't really see that in many of the sort of
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:44.840]   conversations that--
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:45.840]   I was going to say, I can't think of a single platform
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:46.840]   conference anymore.
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.840]   I mean, Microsoft does conferences for developers,
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.840]   like the other ones that have the DC and they do Winheck
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.840]   for hardware, but those are very insidery conferences.
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.840]   You know, there used to be a Windows conference, a regular
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:57.840]   Windows conference.
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.840]   And remember, the Javits Center, that's long gone.
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.840]   So I think this is the last man standing on these solo
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:03.840]   platform conferences, you know.
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.840]   Yeah, but I can't say it diminishing, though, because
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.840]   it's-- you know, the enthusiasm for the Mac still keeps
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.840]   growing, and as they bring out more and more new products,
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.840]   it's just going from strength to strength.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.840]   And sure, you'd like to see a Steve Jobs keynote, but who
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.840]   knows when we're going to see another Steve Jobs keynote anyway.
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:21.840]   And in a way, Apple, not being there, kind of makes it all
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.840]   the more important in a way for the--
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.840]   I think it gives them a lot more freedom.
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:29.840]   It gives them the ability to be a little bit more actually
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:30.840]   closer to the user.
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:31.840]   It's true.
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.840]   Can you imagine the restrictions that Apple must have put on
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.840]   them and the difficulty of dealing with with Apple all
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:37.840]   this time?
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:38.840]   I don't know.
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:42.840]   Everyone says that the Apple's really just pretty laid back
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.840]   and anything goes.
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:45.840]   Yeah.
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.840]   They're not control freaks.
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.840]   Adam, are you coming out to know?
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:50.840]   I am.
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.840]   Yeah, I'm on Virgin tomorrow.
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:53.840]   Oh, good.
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:54.840]   I'll be out there tomorrow.
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:55.840]   Good.
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:56.840]   Good.
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:57.840]   Good.
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:58.840]   So, and you couldn't-- I mean, look, you do Maccast.
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:02.840]   I see you every time, every year for the last decade at
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:03.840]   Mac World Expo.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.840]   You couldn't not go to Mac World Expo.
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:06.840]   Oh, no.
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.840]   And, you know, big part of it for me is the community show,
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:13.840]   and as far as it growing, I think that the Mac community is
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.840]   growing, or not just the Mac community, the Apple community.
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.840]   I'm getting a lot more people in my audience who are saying,
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.840]   you know, I got an iPhone or then I got an iPad and now I'm
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:22.840]   getting more into it.
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.840]   I found your show and I can't believe this community.
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:28.840]   So, our community is growing with new users as Apple brings
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.840]   on new products and new people.
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:32.840]   Do you think-- here's a question.
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.840]   Do you think that the Apple community is welcoming to newbies?
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.840]   Do you think that if--
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:38.840]   Yeah.
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.840]   I know from my end, from my end we are in my show.
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.840]   It's really great because there's people adding stuff.
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.840]   And one thing I like about getting new users in the community
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.840]   is I learn things.
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.840]   You know, I call myself the jaded, you know, we think we know
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.840]   all this stuff because we've learned over the years how to do
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.840]   certain things, but we also get set in our ways.
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:00.840]   And so, I like it when new people come into the community.
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.840]   You kind of get new eyes on things and new perspectives.
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.840]   And so, at a show like Mac World, you know, when I go there,
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:09.840]   I'm going to meet these people and they kind of clue me in on things
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.840]   that I haven't really noticed.
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.840]   And I get smarter about Macs and Apple products and stuff like that
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:15.840]   when I'm there.
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.840]   There's something about the Apple community that's still--
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.840]   even though it's grown a lot and changed significantly.
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.840]   There's something about-- people feel connected.
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:24.840]   Like, if you have a Mac open and an airport,
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:27.840]   oftentimes a Mac user will just walk up and ask you something.
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:29.840]   Like, they feel like I can talk to him.
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:32.840]   Well, it's always good to be in a minority in that regard.
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.840]   Yeah, it's just like I can just walk over and have a conversation
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.840]   or-- and one of my favorite things to do constantly.
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:37.840]   It's a Mac thing.
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:38.840]   It is a Mac thing.
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:39.840]   You just wouldn't understand.
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:40.840]   Right?
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:41.840]   Yeah.
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:42.840]   It's that kind of-- it's a trick you would have to do.
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.840]   I see people on TV, you know, get an interview and then they pan down.
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.840]   There's a Mac and they're like, "Oh, he's okay."
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:48.840]   Yeah, he's all right.
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:49.840]   He's all right.
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:50.840]   But you're right.
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.840]   Yeah, like, I see a PC, you know, and someone definitely on TV.
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:54.840]   I'm like, "Really?"
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:55.840]   Or it's about-- in a movie.
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:56.840]   In a movie.
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:57.840]   And we always see those Sony Vios.
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.840]   Well, you always see the Sony Vios because Sony makes the movie, right?
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:01.840]   Right.
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:04.840]   And you always know that that person wouldn't be using a Sony Vio.
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:05.840]   I just saw it the other day.
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.840]   I know that that person wouldn't be using a Vio.
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:08.840]   Yeah.
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.840]   Except for the fact that Sony produces a movie.
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:11.840]   Right.
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.840]   Or I look at it and I go, "Well, that's going to be the bad guy."
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.840]   I'm coming back to new users though.
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:19.840]   The thing that really impresses me is-- and there's always been the halo effect of the iPod,
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:20.840]   the original iPod, you know.
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.840]   But I think that was very limited.
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:24.840]   It sort of exposed people to Apple products.
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:25.840]   But, you know, it was--
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.840]   iTunes on Windows was so god awful that that didn't help.
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:30.840]   Yeah, it was a really separate thing, you know, this is the music player and a Mac.
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.840]   Whereas now with the iPod touch and with the iPad--
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:33.840]   It's the font.
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:34.840]   It's what it really is.
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.640]   The halo effect is just exploded, you know, and it's actually bringing people more and more
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.640]   people into, you know, the Mac is--
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:41.640]   One, I think the new airs are bringing a lot of people in too.
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:44.640]   I mean, that's the 11 inch-- I see the 11 inch in the airport everywhere.
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:45.640]   I love the air.
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:46.640]   I was in-- I was on one flight.
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.640]   I counted it and I was coming back from the back of the plane.
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:50.640]   There were--
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:52.640]   There were a ton of iPads on the plane's about to--
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:53.640]   18.
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:54.640]   Yeah.
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:55.640]   Ours?
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:56.640]   Ours.
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:57.640]   Wow.
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:58.640]   Between the back of the plane and my seat.
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:15:59.640]   More airs than iPads, you think?
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:00.640]   What?
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:01.640]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:02.640]   It's great for flying.
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:03.640]   There were more out.
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:04.640]   That's all I'm saying on the cruise.
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:05.640]   I couldn't believe that I kept on going, "Oh, I'm just going to count--"
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:09.640]   Because I noticed it on the way back, and as I was coming back up, I was like, "I figured
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:10.640]   I'd count them."
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:11.640]   Well, I'm on the way over.
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.640]   I flew from Paris and it was 11 now flight.
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:16.640]   I've got my 13 inch MacBook Air, and I thought, "Well, I'll do some work on the plane."
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:19.640]   We're only in coach, so limited legroom, et cetera.
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:20.640]   And no power.
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:25.640]   Yeah, and also, to be honest, the 13 inch was just a little bit too big for the coach seat.
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:26.640]   Was it--
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:27.640]   Was it even across the way?
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:28.640]   There was a guy with an 11 inch.
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:29.640]   Guy came way back.
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:30.640]   Yeah.
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:31.640]   He was practically--
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:32.640]   He was a--
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:33.640]   Yeah.
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:34.640]   He even had his-- his meal tray turned--
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:35.640]   Yeah, his meal tray turned--
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.640]   Okay, don't eat while you're computing.
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:38.640]   That's just rude.
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:39.640]   That was rude.
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:40.640]   He didn't eat it.
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:41.640]   He said it in super, but I was very jealous.
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:42.640]   Yeah.
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.640]   I might have to get an 11 inch just for traveling, you know.
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:45.640]   I couldn't be happier with the 11.
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:46.640]   Yeah.
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:47.640]   I have to say.
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:50.640]   Do you think Mac owners are less smug?
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:54.640]   Somebody in the chat room probably here for Windows Weekly, which is original, scheduled
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:58.640]   in this time, says Mac owners, Mac users are smug.
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.640]   Do you think we're smug, Adam?
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:01.640]   Ah.
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:02.640]   Yes.
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:03.640]   I don't have--
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:04.640]   I don't think I'm a loser.
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:05.640]   I don't think I'm a loser.
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:06.640]   I don't think I'm a loser.
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:07.640]   I don't think I'm a loser.
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:08.640]   I don't think I'm a loser.
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:09.640]   I don't think I'm a loser.
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:10.640]   I don't think I'm a loser.
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:11.640]   I don't think I'm a loser.
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:12.640]   No, you're not smug.
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:13.640]   I don't think I'm a loser.
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:14.640]   No, you're not smug.
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:15.640]   I programed.
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:16.640]   You dot net Windows machines and I worked on both and--
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:17.640]   I really wouldn't admit to that.
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:20.640]   I think, especially in this day and age, it's less and less becoming.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.640]   That smugness is going away.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.640]   So that's kind of an old impression.
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:26.640]   I think so.
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:27.640]   I hope so.
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:28.640]   Maybe not.
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.640]   I think Mac owners were always like BMW owners.
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:35.400]   They were considered like the people who run the stop signs, the people who don't let you
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.400]   in and the highway.
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.400]   You know, that kind of smugness.
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:42.640]   I think though-- and this might sound smug by saying, but I'm intended to do that.
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:47.200]   Mac user-- once you become a Mac user and you get it, you know, it's really getting it
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:51.480]   understanding why the Mac is the platform that it is and why people enjoy it so much.
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:55.200]   And I think people can tend to get it and then at that point, either go completely over
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.360]   but and start evangelizing about it or, you know, they then start to say, right, that's
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:00.360]   it now, Mac and that's it now.
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:04.440]   It's just hard sometimes hard to understand, you know, like why, you know, like when people
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:05.880]   okay, we just proven the point.
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:06.880]   I'm sorry.
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.880]   You just digging it deeper.
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:09.880]   Come on.
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:10.880]   There are definitely lots of applications.
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:14.000]   So I probably spend 30% of my time on a PC.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.600]   So it's not like I'm not using using that, but I use it for very specific applications.
[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:22.520]   And a lot of times for me, when I look at people using doing certain things on their
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:26.120]   PC and then banging their head on most of the experience, you know, my dad, every time
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:27.800]   I come home, there's something wrong with his PC.
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:32.640]   Like, there's something that is seems simple like the audio isn't working and even I can't
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:33.640]   figure it out.
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:37.440]   Like, I don't know what he did to get that with, but without a reset of the system.
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:44.600]   I don't know what, you know, and it's like this deep well of unhappiness that, you know,
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:47.560]   that I think that that's the part where I think that's where the smugness comes from
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:50.320]   is you just kind of go, this is a lot harder than it has to be.
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:51.560]   Now there's a lot of reasons to have it.
[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:56.040]   I mean, I, for the PC stuff that I do, my graphics cards, for instance, work way.
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.960]   I mean, it's like lightning on the PC side of things.
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:05.760]   And so there's definitely things that I have to do on the PC, you know, and I love doing
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:06.760]   it there.
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:07.760]   Yeah.
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:11.160]   I think one of the things as well is the expense of a Mac and it's very difficult to sort of
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:14.680]   relate to somebody why they should pay the extra premium for the computer.
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:16.680]   That's what I have a hard time on the radio show is.
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:17.680]   Yeah, it's okay.
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:18.680]   It's gonna be 50% more.
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:19.680]   It is 50%.
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:20.680]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:21.680]   I don't think it's time.
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:22.680]   I just value my time.
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:23.680]   I don't want to, I don't want to.
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:26.320]   Everyone's coming from a PC background and they just use it as a utility and they're
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:27.560]   not really into computers.
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:28.560]   They just want something to do.
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.000]   I can get this for half the price.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   Why should I buy this?
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   And you really can't.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.760]   It's very difficult to actually put it across so that they wouldn't understand the concept
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.520]   of why you need to pay that premium.
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:44.720]   I think that's why the iPad is gaining so much traction with, I think, new users and
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:45.720]   PC users.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.760]   One, because of the price point, it's not the best.
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:51.040]   It's not a $300 Dell.
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:55.120]   But I think people can make the leap from, "Well, I'm gonna get that $300 Dell and I'm
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:58.080]   gonna struggle with it and all I'm doing is web and email and surfing."
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:04.920]   Well, the iPad can do that and I've eliminated all those sort of troubleshooting tech hassles.
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:09.560]   I think the iPad's perfect for people who are using the web and checking their email
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:11.360]   and want to watch some videos here and there.
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.360]   Yeah.
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:14.200]   I think that that unless it's flash, of course.
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.200]   Yeah.
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.560]   All right, let's take a break.
[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:18.720]   I got a great cast.
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:19.720]   Adam Christensen is here.
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:25.480]   He is from the great Maccast, kind of the original and still one of the best.
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:28.080]   I only say one of because I do one too.
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:29.080]   Macintosh podcasts.
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.720]   There's a lot of great.
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:33.640]   There are a lot of casts.
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:36.920]   Don and I are in the Mac Roundtable group.
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:38.520]   That's a good one too, yes.
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:39.520]   Yeah.
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:40.520]   All right.
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:41.520]   Thank you, Adam.
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:42.520]   You're very generous.
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:43.520]   Maccast.com, how about that?
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:47.560]   Andy Anaco may join us a little bit from his airplane.
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:49.160]   If he comes on, I'll see him and I'll call him.
[00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:52.760]   But meanwhile, from the Pixelcore, Alex Lindsay is here.
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:57.320]   Thanks to Alex for coming in a little early and talking about the new space.
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:58.320]   We're excited.
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.320]   So excited.
[00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:00.320]   So excited.
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:01.320]   We're going to occupy that probably.
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:02.320]   You'll occupy it before we do.
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.320]   We'll have it.
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:04.320]   We'll be building out.
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:05.320]   I mean, we can't.
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:06.320]   We'll occupy it this time.
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:09.720]   But yeah, I'll definitely have the we're going to put up the big, the big psych.
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.720]   The big psych?
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:11.720]   We're going to put, I think it's just going to be one wall.
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:12.720]   It's not PSYCH.
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:13.720]   See, yes.
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:14.720]   CYC.
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:15.720]   CYC.
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:16.720]   Yeah.
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:17.720]   Green screen.
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.720]   Yeah, we're just going to put up one big wall with a with a coat.
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:20.720]   We're not going to put the corner cove in.
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:23.160]   We're going to do more mocap and we're going to have a motion.
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.200]   We have a 24 camera motion capture system.
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.200]   24 cameras.
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.280]   Remember back in the day, you did both.
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.840]   I thought I had a lot of cameras.
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:33.280]   Yeah, it's 24 little tiny little cameras that we're going to put in there and and we
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:36.480]   can do it live and we're going to do a lot of great streaming.
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:41.720]   Pixelcore.com, Pixelcore.tv for the podcast and we will you'll be as you mentioned, you'll
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:44.320]   be a Mac world expo in force.
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.200]   We are streaming like crazy.
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:49.400]   So we're going to be streaming a couple hours a day starting on at least on Friday, possibly
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:50.400]   on Thursday.
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.400]   If you can't make it to the conference, just go to Pixelcore.tv.
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.400]   Yeah, we're going to be wandering around.
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.640]   So what we're going to do is we're going to have a live view following around the guy
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:56.640]   shooting the segments.
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:00.120]   So you'll get to kind of see and hear what they're what they're shooting.
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:03.680]   And so you can definitely kind of follow along with us as we as we do that.
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:08.160]   We're also going to be streaming some 3D stuff from the just for fun, which is by the way
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:12.200]   why we are not going to be doing Mac world expo at doing Mac break there because I just
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.000]   don't want to compete with this guy.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   Frankly.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   How old are you?
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   I know exactly Adam.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   It's like, okay, 24 cameras, 3D.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   I don't know.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.160]   I don't even go there.
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.760]   However, we will be doing iPad today.
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:27.040]   Sarah and I will be on the show floor and we'll live stream that in the afternoon 130
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:30.920]   on Thursday, Pacific for 30 Eastern time.
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:34.880]   Also here, Don McAllister, who is on his way to Patagonia.
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:37.800]   I just like saying that from screencasts online.
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:40.760]   Yeah, I do some sessions though in Mac world.
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.320]   I'm speaking on Friday.
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:44.320]   I've got two sessions in the user conference.
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:45.960]   What are you going to talk about?
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.760]   I'm going to do one session on screen flow, which I love screenplays.
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:50.600]   I want to use for screencasts online.
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.520]   Yeah, that's why I use for the initial capture.
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:53.800]   Have you looked at Camtasia?
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.800]   I have, but I sort of use screen flow since it first came out.
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:57.800]   So I'm sort of polarized.
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:58.800]   They're similar in features.
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:22:59.800]   Very similar.
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.800]   I like some of the transitions and things that you can do.
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:04.840]   The good thing is though, it's a nice dual position now.
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:07.120]   So we'll get lots of developments in both applications.
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.640]   Yes, competition, always a good thing.
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:13.040]   Camtasia, the great thing about the contagion is the tiny little file it makes.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:15.640]   I think they made like a deal with the devil.
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:17.400]   You know, like how do you do that?
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:18.400]   You know, it's like...
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.920]   And it's the speed as well, the speed that they can write these files away.
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:21.920]   Pretty amazing.
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:24.760]   Because you're capturing live motion on the screen.
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:27.600]   And so you're doing a lot of stuff in the background and you can't slow down the live
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:28.600]   motion and it has to be...
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:31.280]   But only a couple years ago, we had like one option on the Mac.
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:32.280]   We used Snap-Z Pro.
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:33.280]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:37.040]   And the file crashed while it was recording and there was all kinds of other stuff.
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:42.080]   And now it's like we have a plethora of choices and both screen flow and Camtasia is fantastic.
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:43.800]   I've used both and I love both.
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:45.400]   Can I put in a plug for iMovie 11?
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.600]   Because that's what I was using.
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:47.920]   I just used that yesterday.
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.640]   I never added video.
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:52.720]   You know, I try to avoid it whenever possible.
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.040]   And it was just so easy and fun.
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:57.480]   And I took the video was 1080p video from my 5D.
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:02.480]   Now I happen to have an i7 Mac Pro.
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:03.920]   I mean, I don't know what it is.
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:05.480]   It's got an 8 processors in it.
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:08.120]   So it's with 8 gigs of RAM.
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.680]   So it's a pretty beefy machine.
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:13.640]   But it was just couldn't have been sweeter to edit that video.
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:14.640]   Long way in 10 years.
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:15.640]   Yeah.
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:16.640]   5 years.
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:18.800]   Alright, we're going to get more lots to talk about.
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:19.800]   Did you talk last week?
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:20.800]   I wasn't here.
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.760]   Thank you for filling in while I was teaching Regis how to tweet.
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.320]   That's what I was doing during the show.
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:26.320]   I saw.
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:27.320]   I saw.
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:28.320]   You didn't say the Regis tweet stuff.
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:29.800]   I'm going to, that's coming up January 31st.
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:30.960]   No, I saw you on the show.
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:35.640]   I did the show and then afterwards with a car that I locked them into by accident.
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:40.240]   And then afterwards we went upstairs to Regis's office because next week on Live with Regis
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:43.080]   and Kelly is tweet, Twitter week.
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.080]   And they asked me to teach him how to tweet.
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:46.080]   Oh, that's funny.
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:47.480]   And I said, what do you want to tweet?
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:48.480]   Your first tweet.
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:49.760]   And he told me and I said, okay, start typing it.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.720]   And he said, okay, where's the eye?
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:52.720]   So what do you mean?
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:53.720]   He didn't know how to type.
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.120]   And then so that took a long time.
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:56.200]   Fortunately, they're editing it down.
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.960]   And then I said, okay, good.
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:59.480]   Nice, nice job.
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:00.920]   Leave those errors in it.
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:03.120]   We really know it's you that way.
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:07.280]   And then I said, now click, you know, tweet or whatever it says on the button.
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.280]   He said, click it.
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:09.280]   I said, yeah, the mouse.
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:11.040]   So it picks up the mouse.
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:12.320]   Goes over to the screen.
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:16.520]   And I thought, this is going to be a long time.
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:17.520]   We got him to do it.
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:20.440]   It was actually kind of neat because he saw his audience, he had announced that he was
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.080]   leaving the show that day.
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.520]   And he saw all the responses from his audience.
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:25.520]   And he was visibly moved.
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.520]   He got on the phone.
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:29.400]   He said, to a call to his wife, Joy, Joy, go to this thing called Twitter.
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.400]   They're all talking to me.
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:34.480]   It was very interesting to see a guy who is the longest running, he's 80 years old.
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:39.640]   He's been on TV for 60 years, longest running continuous television host in the world, England
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:40.640]   or the US.
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:42.240]   And England, they have no idea who reaches his.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:45.920]   But he's been here for a long, long time with us.
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:46.920]   Get it.
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:47.920]   Yeah.
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:48.920]   Get it.
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:49.920]   Suddenly he goes, oh, there's Pete.
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.560]   You mean, there's just, did you just said that?
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:52.560]   I said, yeah.
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:53.560]   So we took a picture.
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:55.960]   He says, I love, I love my followers.
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.240]   And immediately the tweet started.
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:59.360]   And he's like, so there I can talk to them.
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:00.360]   I said, yes.
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.800]   It was really, it was actually a great moment.
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:03.800]   It was really neat to see this.
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:05.280]   Oh, look at the video guys.
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:08.000]   Yeah, it'll be on Monday, January 31st.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   Awesome.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.160]   Hey, before we go on, we also, did you talk last week about Steve?
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:14.280]   I guess we happened after the, you did talk about him.
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:15.280]   Okay.
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:16.280]   So we don't have to belabor that.
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:18.200]   We actually didn't belabor it very much.
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.320]   We kind of moved through it as fast as we could.
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:21.320]   Yeah.
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:25.520]   Well, we have lots more to talk about, including the first Verizon iPhone ad, which we'll
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.240]   show you in just a second.
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:28.680]   Meanwhile, can I tell you about FreshBooks?
[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.440]   I've been using FreshBooks since 2004.
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:34.880]   I found Amber MacArthur told me about them because they're a Toronto based company.
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:39.560]   And I was, boy, it was perfect timing for me because I was invoicing all my clients by
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:43.640]   hand in, I think I was probably using Word.
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.040]   And it was painful.
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:47.640]   And I couldn't keep track of who I owed money to and so forth.
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:49.560]   Along comes FreshBooks and it changed my life.
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.880]   I want you to visit freshbooks.com.
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:27:01.000]   If you're an independent artist, if you're an independent, the thing is to have people.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.680]   If you don't have your people that are able to do that, you need to have some people now.
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:10.120]   You need to have people because it really is, it is really not how much you make it when
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:11.120]   you make it.
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:16.960]   And the thing is I've delayed invoicing someone by a month or two months.
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:17.960]   Three months.
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:18.960]   Yeah, because I was like, oh, I got to make that invoice.
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.600]   You know, I got to put that together.
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:21.600]   I got to do this stuff.
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:22.760]   And you just don't get around.
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:25.320]   This isn't what I got into the business to do, was to send invoices.
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:28.880]   And so, FreshBooks makes it so easy.
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.760]   You can go right now to freshbooks.com and sign up.
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.440]   I mean, I'll give you all the features.
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:36.360]   I mean, for instance, there are a lot of clients who still want paper invoices.
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:37.360]   No problem.
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.200]   You push a button that mails it to them.
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.840]   You can send them PDFs.
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:44.960]   They can pay online with FreshBooks, which is really cool.
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.480]   It really helps you get paid faster.
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:50.920]   They support PayPal and a lot of other online payment stuff.
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:53.360]   Salesforce.com, plug in.
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.360]   Wow, that's great.
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:55.360]   Isn't that nice?
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:56.360]   Yeah.
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:57.360]   So you can do the CRM.
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:58.360]   Yep.
[00:27:58.360 --> 00:27:59.360]   Yep.
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:03.320]   Basically, FreshBooks is your accountant, is your bookkeeper online.
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:04.880]   It keeps track of your invoices.
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:05.880]   It ages them.
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.280]   There are 11 electronic payment services.
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:08.520]   Actually, it doesn't.
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.920]   They can use your credit card.
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:12.200]   You can upload your company logo.
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.200]   So I mean, that's what I did.
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.720]   My invoice looked so cool.
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:17.720]   It was me and I had all the images and stuff and I did this great invoice.
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:19.520]   But it was so fast and easy to do invoices.
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:21.520]   I knew which invoices were still outstanding.
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:24.080]   I could-- it made it just so easy to keep track of it.
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:29.320]   Now, if you go to freshbooks.com, you enter the show code MACBRAKE, you will say
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:33.320]   save big time.
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:35.800]   You could try it free for up to three clients.
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:37.480]   So I mean, save what you need to save.
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.200]   It's free for three clients.
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.320]   For me, that was enough.
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.320]   Yeah.
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:42.320]   Take about a minute.
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:46.440]   When they ask you how you heard about FreshBooks, make sure you say MACBRAKE.
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:48.280]   And here's your reward.
[00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:52.480]   Every day, FreshBooks is giving away a quote birthday cake to one of our audience members.
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.480]   What if it's not your birthday?
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:54.480]   It doesn't have to be your birthday.
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:55.480]   You just get a cake.
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:56.480]   You get a cake.
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:57.480]   Happy birthday.
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:59.840]   It's $10 a month.
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:02.680]   You know, they sell the problem because I thought, well, how can we do it?
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:04.400]   It's free for three clients.
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:06.760]   So what is the offer code going to give you?
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:07.760]   They say cake.
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.720]   Let them eat cake.
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:11.760]   Let them eat cake.
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:12.760]   I love it.
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:13.760]   Freshbooks.com, give it a try.
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:14.760]   And we know you'll like it too.
[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:18.800]   Now, let me push some buttons here because I want to play the-- this is the Verizon--
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.240]   have you seen the ad yet?
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:21.800]   This is the two is better than one.
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:23.320]   No, I haven't seen that one.
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:24.320]   This is the--
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:25.320]   This is the one for--
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:28.560]   Thank you for being so patient.
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:29.560]   Listen.
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:32.440]   Or watch.
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:34.160]   Or watch and listen.
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:36.880]   There's a-- there clocks.
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.520]   All clocks ticking.
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:39.520]   Waiting.
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:43.720]   By the way, notice he had a magic mouse.
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.520]   Yeah.
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:46.520]   Waiting.
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:55.160]   To our millions of customers who never stopped believing this day would come.
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.160]   Thank you.
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:59.520]   I phone for Verizon.
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:00.520]   Now it begins.
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:04.240]   Now, you know what I thought very interesting about that is it was a very Apple ad, wasn't
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.240]   it?
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:06.320]   Doesn't it feel almost like 1984?
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:08.800]   It just-- it had that feeling.
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:12.080]   I wonder if they got an Apple agency to produce it because it just--
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.480]   Definitely had the feeling.
[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:14.480]   Didn't it?
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:15.480]   Yeah.
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.240]   So there's another one also after this?
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.240]   I didn't see it either.
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:19.240]   There was a two--
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.240]   There's the--
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.240]   The two is better than one.
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:22.240]   Sorry.
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:23.240]   It's an Apple ad?
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:24.240]   Is it an-- I think it's the Apple ad for--
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:28.520]   Yeah, it's the Apple-- Apple came out right after this I think the day after with their
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:33.600]   ad, which features both AT&T and Verizon.
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:35.200]   Oh, interesting.
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:38.520]   Now here's an interesting question.
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:39.760]   iPhone 5, right?
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:42.320]   Sometime soon.
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:46.920]   I'm starting to-- I just started-- saw a little thing yesterday that kind of intimated
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:50.040]   that maybe it would be AT&T only.
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:51.040]   Is that possible?
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:52.040]   I don't think so.
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:53.040]   Yeah.
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:57.760]   If I was going to lay bets, I would say it's going to be on everything, you know, by the
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:58.760]   end of the year.
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:30:59.760]   Well, that's the other-- that's the other question.
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:01.880]   You already got to see-- now you have CDMA and GSN.
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:03.800]   There's no reason not to be on sprinting T-Mobile, right?
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:05.720]   So the idea is you go across to all of them.
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:10.080]   I think that they have to do that to blunt, you know, more of the Android competition.
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:12.280]   I think they just need to make sure that they're available everywhere.
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:14.680]   That exclusivity age, I think, is over for us.
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:17.760]   And they're at great pains to say that it wasn't an exclusivity deal with Verizon.
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:18.760]   Yeah.
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:19.760]   It was just a CDMA.
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:21.960]   I think what Verizon gets is they get the phone early.
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:24.920]   They get to get that jump on sales because, you know, I think-- I was trying to figure
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.080]   out why would they do this?
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:29.680]   Why would they release the iPhone 4 six months before they're probably going to release the
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:30.680]   iPhone 5?
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:35.520]   And the only thing I could think of over the last two weeks was really that they're giving
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:39.160]   Verizon that advantage so that they can do whatever they're going to do.
[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:42.080]   And then when they release the iPhone 5, I think it's going to have a dual chip.
[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:43.960]   I think it's going to run on all the services.
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:46.360]   I think that, you know, or it definitely can.
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:47.360]   Yeah.
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:48.360]   All right.
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:51.160]   So let's do the-- let's do the happy dance.
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:55.200]   This is the-- this is the two for one.
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:58.640]   iPhone on Verizon and AT.
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:01.600]   They're going through a lot of trouble to say it works the same.
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:04.520]   It is exactly the same until the phone call comes in and you can't go to your data.
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:06.120]   Never mind.
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:08.760]   Don't mention that fact.
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:09.760]   That would be funny of AT&T.
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:13.600]   I love Ralph De La Vega.
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:18.280]   Not so much that Seidenberg fellow, but it's okay.
[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:21.920]   You can FaceTime on both today.
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:25.160]   iPhone 4, I'd love.
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:28.680]   It would be AT&T's response that would be someone getting a call.
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.240]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.240]   Do the exact same ad.
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:36.480]   And if someone got a call and it goes through, you know, that would be their response.
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:44.920]   Somebody already edited a version where the AT&T phone, you know, drops the internet connection.
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:48.480]   Oh God, I got to find that.
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:50.000]   That's got to be on here, right?
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   Somewhere it's got to be.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   YouTube's got to be on there.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   YouTube's got to be on YouTube somewhere.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   Yeah, I just saw it this morning.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.160]   Yeah, somebody's somebody edited it and then I think they changed the tag at the end to
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:01.840]   say one is not the same or something like that.
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:02.840]   Yeah.
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:04.040]   Can't remember the tag.
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:07.720]   I asked this last time and I think that I'm going to start to agree with Andy who said
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:10.640]   he didn't think a lot of people would switch to Verizon.
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:13.000]   This means nothing to you, Don.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.560]   You were you were had something to say.
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:16.560]   Well, I don't know.
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:18.520]   I don't think a lot of people run the Verizon.
[00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:20.200]   No, no, no, I think people.
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:22.760]   It's really aimed at people who are on Verizon and have been waiting and waiting and which
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:24.040]   is what the first ad is all about.
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:26.520]   You know, they've been waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and those initial
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:28.360]   throwing people actually jump on it.
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:30.240]   But I don't think it's going to cause many people to actually switch it.
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:33.800]   I actually with the iPhone 5 coming out, you know, in less than six months or so.
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:34.800]   All right.
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:36.120]   Here's the the edited.
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:37.120]   Thank you to the chat room.
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:39.560]   This is from nine to five Mac.
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:40.560]   There's the original.
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:42.040]   Oh, no, I don't want the original.
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:46.640]   Oh, OK, this is the I get it.
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:50.280]   This is the original quote, quote, right?
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:51.280]   Yeah.
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:54.280]   Yeah, let's see it.
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:55.280]   So there they are.
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:57.600]   They're all doing the same thing.
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:05.760]   So why can I open the page because the address is invalid.
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:07.560]   The iPhone's not doing so well.
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:11.800]   Oh, can't open page system status is working.
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:12.800]   Now open a book.
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:13.800]   No book.
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:18.080]   I'm scrolling through the book and I'm doing all this stuff and it's frozen.
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:20.640]   It's AT&T.
[00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:22.640]   It's socks.
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:23.640]   Ouch.
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:24.640]   Ouch.
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:29.600]   But I still don't think for all the hatred and boy, there's a lot of hatred for AT&T.
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:30.600]   Do you?
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:33.960]   I guess because you're so connected with the American market, you know about this time,
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:36.320]   but yeah, I can understand the sort of what's going on behind it.
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:38.120]   I mean, we thought that way in the UK.
[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:41.680]   No, we don't sort of have the same sort of allegiance is between the different carriers.
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:43.880]   You know, it's normally where we offer the best deal.
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:46.600]   I mean, the coverage is there's a slight difference between them, but it's such a small
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:47.800]   geographic area in the UK.
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.440]   A lot easier to do, I guess.
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:50.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:51.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:52.440]   So yeah, we just go with the best deals already.
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:54.200]   The service is so much better in the UK too.
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:56.200]   I mean, and in Europe and in Japan.
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:59.800]   And I mean, that's the big thing is I know it's my iPhone in these other countries.
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:02.000]   It's because America is a great land.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.680]   It is a spread out land.
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:05.040]   There is, I got Australians in here.
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:07.880]   I got Brits in here, but it's because America is stretch.
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:09.760]   There's a lot of area.
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:13.200]   The funny thing though is that the places that it doesn't work is not where it's stretched
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:14.200]   out.
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:17.840]   It's the places that it doesn't work is where there's lots of buildings and lots of.
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:23.960]   And this gets back into Verizon's core advantage, which we talked about about last week, is
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:28.040]   that the CDMA is a much more robust system.
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:29.680]   No one uses it.
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:32.760]   You know, or not many people use it, but it's a much more robust system to keep a signal.
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:34.360]   And so they don't have to put up as many towers.
[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:40.120]   And that's a big issue in New York and San Francisco where real estate is so expensive
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:41.120]   and difficult.
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:44.000]   It's difficult to get buildings to let you put stuff on them.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.760]   And that's the big challenge in New York and San Francisco, which is where all the press
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:52.680]   is, which is why part of why they they build all that up.
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:54.800]   Another big thing with the CDMA though is it's global impact.
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:57.320]   That's the true power of the press by the way.
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:58.320]   Exactly.
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.320]   We can get cell phone.
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:02.840]   There's there's on that market in India and China that use the CDMA network and that's
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:04.120]   where they can roll it out into.
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:05.760]   Yeah, you know, in those territories as well.
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:09.360]   Yeah, but is it true that there's there's areas in the UK and certainly in the US where
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:10.920]   there is no AT&T coverage at all?
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:11.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:12.920]   No Hampshire.
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:15.520]   Julie says she where do you live, Julie?
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:17.520]   Fargo North Dakota.
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:18.520]   Wow.
[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:21.560]   So you have Cuffed.
[00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:22.560]   No AT&T.
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:23.560]   So what do you?
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:24.560]   AT&T 3% of the market.
[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:25.560]   What do you use?
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:26.560]   What is your new living?
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:27.560]   Verizon.
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:30.120]   So are you going to get a Verizon iPhone?
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:31.920]   The day it comes out, she says.
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:32.920]   My wife's going back.
[00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:33.920]   She's a switcher.
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:34.920]   She's going to switch her.
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:37.040]   So this is the question is are people going to switch?
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:41.280]   And here's the decision process for my wife is that she doesn't care about having the newest
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.280]   phone.
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:45.080]   So she doesn't care about whether the iPhone 5 is coming out or not.
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:48.600]   She wants just to go back to Verizon because she doesn't like AT&T.
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:53.600]   So so I think this is where you they're going to see a million maybe two million sales is
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:56.640]   that she just wants to go back to Verizon.
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:58.480]   She'll keep this phone for another two or three years.
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:02.720]   It doesn't really matter to her that the iPhone 5 is a little bit faster.
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:06.080]   You know and that's you know she loves the iPhone but I'm going to ask because we have
[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:11.560]   a such an esteemed panel Adam Christensen, Don McAllister, Andy and Akko maybe on this
[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:13.360]   plane and Alex Lindsay.
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:17.960]   I'm going to ask you about iPhone 5 in just a second but we do have one other story about
[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:18.960]   the iPhone.
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:19.960]   I should mention it.
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:22.040]   Verizon has now said they're going to drop their limited data plan.
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:27.000]   They will only do one plan for $30 of quote.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   What does that mean?
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   Limited, unlimited.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:35.680]   Well I think all of them say limit in fact Virgin Mobile which had this unlimited plan
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:39.000]   is now sending out emails saying well if you go over 5 gigabytes we're going to slow
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   you down.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.960]   It may not charge you but we're going to slow you down.
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:46.320]   I know there's no way unlimited is truly unlimited on any platform right.
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:53.440]   So but this is what does that mean Verizon saying they also say they will give a $200
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:59.800]   Visa card for some customers, current customers who upgrade.
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:03.320]   They dropped their new every two promotion right before the iPhone.
[00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:09.560]   That's really annoying but they if you purchased a new smartphone feature phone or certified
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:14.560]   pre-owned phone basically any phone from the end of November to the beginning of January
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:20.440]   you will get some money back because you bought that phone just before the Verizon iPhone
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:21.440]   announcement.
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:26.480]   In November 26 through January 10 you'll be eligible to get $200 back on a Visa gift card
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:30.960]   but you have to buy the iPhone for it full retail and return the existing phone.
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:31.960]   I think that's okay.
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:34.120]   Is that what you're going to do Julie?
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:35.680]   She was nodding that's like she knew.
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.360]   Yeah that's how you're going to do it.
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:39.360]   What do you have right now?
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:44.160]   A dried and you're going to turn in your oh Eris is kind of old though.
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:45.960]   Yeah.
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:46.960]   All right.
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:51.440]   But I will say that you have to go to the store too.
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:55.880]   I will say I bought both the AT&T store and at the Apple store and it's one little thing
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:39:00.000]   and I have to admit the price is the same except that when I buy it at the AT&T store
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.720]   I have to go through all the manual stuff of getting my Apple care hooked up and where
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:07.160]   I have when I just go to the Apple store when you buy it it's all done and I have to admit
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:08.160]   it's faster.
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:09.160]   Why do you do AppleCare?
[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:10.160]   What's AppleCare?
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:11.160]   I don't understand.
[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.160]   If you use AppleCare as often as I did.
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.160]   You use it a lot?
[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:14.160]   Oh my gosh.
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:20.560]   I run my hardware pretty hard and I think that about half of my machines end up really
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:21.560]   at some point in time.
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:22.560]   All right.
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:24.920]   I mean I just beat them up and then I bring them in.
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:29.180]   My kids beat them up and bring them in and it's great to know that they can just you
[00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:31.440]   can replace the power supply or you can replace the whatever.
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:34.840]   You know I had it we had one issue where there's something wrong with our power at our house
[00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:38.360]   and they just kept on killing power supplies one after another and we just kept on taking
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:39.360]   them to the Apple store.
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:42.560]   You know and that paid off that Apple Apple you know that because it was blowing them out
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:43.560]   every two weeks.
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:44.560]   They're pretty generous.
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:49.080]   You know my daughter is going I bought my daughter an iPhone for while she was home for
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:53.920]   Christmas she's a college and she dropped it and broke within two weeks.
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:58.040]   I said oh crap and I was going to get the iPhone repair people up here in Rona Park
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:00.200]   and it's 125 bucks for a new screen.
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:01.600]   She said well let me bring it to the Apple store.
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:03.360]   She did and they replaced it.
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:06.400]   She said oh I just bought this and it was her fault she dropped it.
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:07.400]   I replaced it.
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:10.200]   And I have to admit what I do is I build up like so I have a laptop that's two and a half
[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:13.680]   years old and it's got a bunch of weird little things that aren't working with it.
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:16.960]   And what I'll do is two and a half years I'll take it in and say these are all this is
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:19.960]   the whole list of things that I want to make it all do it and they just do it and they
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:22.960]   just kind of you know I a lot of times I'll just kind of build up and then hand it to
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:25.240]   them and then they comes back all.
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:27.080]   So you're really abusing it basically.
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:30.640]   You know it's not it's like wear and tear it's not like I'm breaking it or dropping it.
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:33.040]   It's just that the trackpad doesn't work as well.
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:36.960]   But does Apple care really designed to take care of wearing care?
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:38.480]   That's why you get it.
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:42.880]   I mean if things are breaking then I didn't drop it and you know they gave me three years
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:44.880]   as far as I'm concerned.
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:50.120]   You know three years for me is like dog years you know so it's you know but.
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:53.280]   I think if you've got a laptop especially though that's what comes into its own we display
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:56.520]   problems and you know hinges and things and it just takes so much stress out of it.
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:58.680]   We buy every computer we buy never buy Apple.
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:01.880]   Oh I always get Apple care because it just takes this the thing here's the deal is we've
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:06.840]   had enough problems and we've probably bought 60 computers in the last three three or four
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:12.080]   years you know so we had enough problems with enough individual ones that paid off all the
[00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:16.580]   money we put in Apple care you know because of bad motherboards or bad and usually it's
[00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:19.560]   after the first year the things start to wear and tear.
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:21.640]   So I think the Apple store people are pretty nice.
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:24.120]   I think I did not buy Abbey Apple care I don't think for that phone.
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:25.120]   Oh really?
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:27.320]   I think they're pretty nice in general.
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:28.320]   Yeah.
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:29.320]   Oh it's great.
[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:30.320]   No it's fast.
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:34.000]   It's a nice little profit center for Apple so I'm all for it.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.920]   If I didn't feel like I was winning the winning on my I wouldn't get to do it.
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:39.680]   I'm pretty well you're winning all right.
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:43.160]   The only thing I would say about Apple care though is make sure you get it from a proper
[00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:44.160]   dealer either from Apple.
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:46.000]   Yeah don't buy that best buy crap.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.140]   Well I don't know about that but I bought some off eBay once and you can't buy Apple
[00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:51.140]   care on eBay.
[00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:55.360]   Yeah eBay Amazon you can get it Apple care is I and I've heard reports even of people
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:42:00.160]   who bought Apple care off Amazon sort of having to prove really buy it from Apple in
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:02.080]   other words because then you're in the database.
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:04.520]   A little Apple resellers yeah you have to buy it from them.
[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:10.480]   And then there are AT&T's that will sell a maintenance schedule on an iPhone but I asked
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:12.440]   them what I wouldn't buy that.
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:16.040]   My whole thing is I've just gotten after I bought them from I bought them from lots of
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:20.560]   different stores I bought computers from Amazon I bought iPhones from AT&T I've done
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:21.560]   all of it.
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:23.480]   It's always better to go to the Apple store and buy it.
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:25.960]   I know they hate me saying that but it's just not worth the trouble.
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:29.440]   You're lucky though I mean you have an Apple store nearby.
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.680]   There's one everybody has an Apple store nearby.
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:32.680]   Is that true?
[00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:35.040]   Oh it's like you go on the internet and then I click on it.
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:37.480]   If you know you want an iPhone why go to the store?
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:40.200]   I mean you know it's like if you know what computer you want I mean if you want to touch
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:41.200]   it it's fine but.
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:45.440]   No that's how I got my iPhone yeah and they deliver it day of which is nice it's just
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:48.560]   you know are you going to buy an iPhone 5 the minute it comes out.
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:49.560]   Me?
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:50.560]   Yes of course.
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:51.560]   Yeah you too.
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:52.560]   It's my job.
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:53.560]   You too.
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:57.320]   You know I'm taking one with the team you know Adam you too.
[00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:59.120]   Yep yeah I'll be getting one.
[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:01.640]   But we're not one of my wife's excited because she's just a little bit of a little bit of
[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:02.640]   a little bit more than I've ever seen.
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:03.640]   She's awkward.
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:06.400]   She said to me this morning she said then I'll get are you going to get a new iPhone when
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:08.080]   it comes out when is it coming out.
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:09.360]   I said well probably June.
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:14.160]   She said good because then I can get an iPhone 4 meaning my my iPhone 1 she's she's she's
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:15.160]   frugal.
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:18.880]   All right we're at let's talk about the iPhone 5 and what it might be in just a little bit
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:23.000]   before we do though I want to talk a little bit about hover.com it's a great place to register
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.040]   your domains and I'll tell you how you could save 10% just a bit.
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:28.240]   Hover makes it simple makes it clean.
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:31.540]   I'm getting more and more tweets from people who are moving from those other guys.
[00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:38.080]   Saying wow I had no idea it could be this easy and simple and straightforward and you
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:42.040]   know what just I want to say the word clean.
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:50.680]   Just go to if you go to Macbreak.hover.com right now I'm going to type that in here Macbreak.hovar.com.
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:54.720]   It's immediately apparent that this is something a little bit different.
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:59.080]   A little simpler little cleaner you could search for your domain click that if you're
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:02.300]   going to transfer a domain that's what we did we transferred a bunch of domains click
[00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:05.660]   the transfer your domain button it's very straightforward.
[00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:12.300]   Well if your X register arm makes it straightforward do notice that they have it for $25 no matter
[00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:15.140]   how many domains you're transferring they'll do it all for you and I think that's worth
[00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:16.500]   it I wish I'd done that.
[00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:18.420]   I'm still in locked domain hell.
[00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:19.820]   Oh I hate that.
[00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:21.660]   Oh I got to say but we're moving them all.
[00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:22.660]   What did you think?
[00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:27.300]   Three years ago I translated a domain name across from one of those people to have actually
[00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:28.700]   work very well it was very simple.
[00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:32.600]   It was in fact over the Christmas week so I was a little bit nervous about delays but
[00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:34.920]   we took about three or four days for it to go through.
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:35.920]   It was great.
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:40.440]   And prices start at if you're just doing domain forwarding $15 but they also will do
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:44.840]   email if you want custom URLs and so forth but they don't do a lot of upsell and one
[00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:49.280]   of the things I really like those other guys will charge you a significant amount of money
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:50.280]   for domain privacy.
[00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:54.200]   I don't like people to know you know you know nominally on your domain name you've got
[00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:57.240]   your phone number and your address and I don't want to add so.
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:58.520]   However it's automatic.
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:03.140]   Every domain has domain privacy automatically as part of the price and their new no hold
[00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:08.500]   policy for customer service calls Monday through Friday 9am to 8pm Eastern time means
[00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:14.540]   you will never be put on hold once you get a live person that person will fix your issue
[00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:16.240]   and you'll never get put on hold.
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:18.080]   So I want you to go right now.
[00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:22.000]   You can use hovers domain management to set up email addresses, forward email addresses,
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:28.200]   redirect your domain to other websites, create URL extensions, set privacy controls all with
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:31.960]   fewer clicks and without the upsell.
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:39.040]   Hover.com I want you to go to Macbreak.hover.com and on checkout use the offer code Macbreak
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:42.480]   you will save 10% right up front.
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:43.940]   That's a nice deal.
[00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:44.940]   We love hover.
[00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:47.640]   The old domain is direct.
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:48.640]   If you're aware of it.
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:53.880]   You've never heard of it's a two-cast domains direct and they just decided to rebrand it.
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:58.920]   I think it's a great service and I'm really happy to be moving all my domains over there.
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:04.720]   So iPhone 5 we think, Adam you think June.
[00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:09.160]   Yeah I think that Apple is on their yearly release cycle and I think they're going to
[00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:10.160]   stick to that.
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:13.000]   It's going to be shocking I think to the Verizon people.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:14.560]   Well that's what I was wondering.
[00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:19.240]   I mean in fact that's what I've been saying to people is if you are a Verizon person and
[00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:22.280]   you're switching just think how you're going to feel.
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:24.320]   Just kind of put yourself in that position.
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:27.440]   How's it going to be when the new 5 comes out in 4 months?
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:28.440]   You can live with that Julia.
[00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:29.920]   Yeah she said I don't care.
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:32.200]   I got to get a phone.
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:34.400]   Anything they're not going to have to use a dried heiress.
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:39.000]   See those people who would know would know in fact that there's an iPhone 5 most likely
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:44.440]   coming out in the summer and those people who aren't really interested in the next greatest
[00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:47.080]   phone they'll just get it now and just get it.
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:48.080]   That's most people right.
[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:50.040]   It's only us that really says oh I have to get it.
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:52.920]   So what is going to be in the iPhone 5 that's going to make it so good.
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:55.680]   I don't think it's going to have a higher res screen that would add too much to the
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:56.680]   price.
[00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:57.680]   I think it's going to add a higher res screen.
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:00.000]   The dual processor I think is probably likely.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.640]   Yeah everybody's going dual.
[00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:07.000]   Yeah there will be an A5 right which will have the Cortex the ARM 9.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.200]   That'll be a USB micro in there because it has to be.
[00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:11.200]   Oh for Europe.
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:12.200]   Yep.
[00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:13.200]   Thank God.
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:15.680]   Well it depends on what kind of feature functionality they give it but.
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:17.280]   Well it should have all the functionality right.
[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:18.600]   I mean it's just a data port.
[00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:19.600]   Well it'll have power.
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:22.320]   You don't need to reason they're doing it is for power right.
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:23.320]   So that's the.
[00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:26.000]   Well you think that they might instead if they're band it.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   Will they abandon the 30 pin connector or will they have it as well.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   I think they'll have it.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   I think they'll have it.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.080]   I think because that's a revenue stream for them as well as an economic and licensed
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:35.280]   connections using the 30 pin.
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:37.720]   So they're not going to give that up.
[00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:39.120]   So probably so cynical.
[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:40.120]   You're so cynical.
[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:44.680]   You think Apple cares more about money than they do about us as users.
[00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:49.200]   It's all about managing the quality of experience.
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:50.200]   Come on.
[00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:51.200]   You're such a cynic.
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:53.120]   They're not a charity are they.
[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:55.600]   Well I do think it would be.
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:56.600]   It would be good.
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:59.600]   I mean I'm a little bummed about the micro USB because it's such an unstable connection.
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:01.880]   I mean the mini USB was the last one.
[00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:04.080]   I mean once you go to micro they don't stay in as well.
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:05.080]   They don't they don't.
[00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:06.760]   There's lots of issues with cables.
[00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:07.760]   Yeah.
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:12.240]   I mean I use it for like the most easy to charge the most the one cable will work will charge
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:15.680]   and also sink one cable will just charge it and other care.
[00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:19.680]   That's why I actually got the Miley was specifically because I had a mini I literally went to the
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:22.160]   store and looked at it and was like oh we got a mini pin here I'm just going to use the
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:25.120]   mini because I don't I don't want to go to micro because it's I've had so much trouble
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:30.000]   with my my file with anything that's got micro USB I I've been beaten.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:34.720]   Big rumor on Bloomberg today that near field communications NFC will be built into the
[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:35.720]   iPhone.
[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:42.120]   I have NFC in my Google Nexus S and I can tell you right now I can't use it nobody uses it
[00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:45.960]   what are they talking about but the idea is this is like kind of like Bluetooth except
[00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:50.920]   it's within a like a foot or less you hold it so I can go to McDonald's right and I
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:53.280]   wave my magic phone and then they give me food.
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:57.240]   You can now buy Starbucks you can go to Starbucks and buy coffee with your barcode so you
[00:48:57.240 --> 00:49:00.400]   know you have to put it up on the screen and I don't know I don't I don't think in the
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:06.280]   States as are people in the UK using NFC nothing I'm aware of but if Apple does if Apple puts
[00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:12.440]   it in tens of millions of iPhone 4s or 5s I'm sorry presumably that would well my question
[00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:16.280]   is is that forward this right I'm curious as to whether that that's compatible with like
[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:20.400]   the technologies we see at BART and and so on so forth you know that with you know that
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:26.880]   they've gotten into with the cards those probably I don't know I think they are if it is it
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:33.880]   would be great to be visas using it with their pay wave I would bet you know it's very similar
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:38.080]   to RFID but it's not RFID it's a near field RFID I guess it's something they've had in
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:41.680]   Japan for quite a while isn't it this sort of technology that what the PASMA works with
[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:46.600]   possibly so if they built so that would be an interesting thing to build in so so we
[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:51.840]   got faster processor NFC you know Google's kind of in the we know wandering in the wilderness
[00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:56.880]   with this Nexus S nobody else uses it but if everybody uses it that's a good news what
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:00.920]   else voice possibly because they did the server was it serious the application they bought
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:05.800]   oh yeah I mean because I have started with the voice control I use that all the time on
[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:13.120]   the Nexus S I will I will press about to say send text and then to Don McAllister message
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:20.200]   yo yo yo what's up and it does everything is up the yo yo yo I don't know why but that
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:23.840]   no that's really nice to be able to do that I would love to see that yeah so they've started
[00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:27.240]   it's more than voice control they're going to have voice control this is like dictating
[00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:32.800]   messages stuff like that Siri was very smart Siri did you could book restaurants and things
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:38.760]   yes we never use that in the UK I think it was on the US service you could say book
[00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:43.240]   me a table for two at E for Telly and it would it would it would if you know use open table
[00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:48.720]   it would know there was some sort of interface you could say add a calendar point we had
[00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:54.080]   a lot of artificial intelligence do you use Siri Adam I played around with it when it
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:58.400]   first came out and then after kind of apple bought it I didn't really use it too much
[00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:04.160]   I don't I don't do that a lot on my on my phone I guess it's a it's a hard I think people
[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:08.600]   it's like texting remember I don't know if anybody remembers but we didn't text in the
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:14.560]   US about five years ago nobody texted and then because you there were a number of charges
[00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:19.600]   just a lot for it that was cross platform stuff and but right but when it happened and
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:23.640]   everybody got used to it now everybody is very routine everybody texts and I would guess
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:27.200]   this is like that that once you get used to talking to your phone maybe you would use
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:32.600]   it more but you have to get out of it I think you like it if it worked better I guess I
[00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:37.120]   you know I try and use just the voice stuff to like call people and so I guess if they
[00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:41.120]   can do a better job of it if they got the Siri engineers on board at Apple and they've
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:47.920]   improved it but my biggest dilemma with it was I'd say call Leo and I would say calling
[00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:52.400]   Alex yeah yeah it's terrible because I say call Tom and then I call my mom and I call
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:57.880]   my mom and I say mom's on oh see my hi mom yeah I'm I it gets me in trouble because it
[00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:03.240]   doesn't know who my wife is I say call Carlita and it always calls Cali Lewis you know it's
[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:07.040]   like you know it was like it was like it is like it's like so drink it like no turn it out.
[00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:13.440]   You can't say cancels the thing that's funny is you cannot say cancel you have to do it
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:18.560]   we have to touch the screen and I don't remember a bit of a imaginary wife Cali Lewis.
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:24.360]   Happy birthday Cali by the way she's her birthday today not Jermaine but I just thought I mentioned
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:26.240]   it since you mentioned it.
[00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:30.640]   What else what else in the iPhone I think that the iPad is going to be the big the big jump
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:32.240]   that's where the jump that's where the jump that's where you think that'll have a high
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:36.400]   red screen I think we're going to have a high R Rez screen not only it's going to be it's
[00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:39.520]   not going to be at the same to expensive well that would be well the thing is that would
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:46.320]   be a res a retinist screen at that size would be a higher resolution than the 27 inch iMac
[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:50.840]   I mean it would or very close to that and you're just talking about processing cool you know
[00:52:50.840 --> 00:53:00.240]   I'm cool I am I wanted I could to me I could see Apple going to 1920 by 1080 as a we know
[00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:04.600]   but I think that what they should do is 1280 by 720 or 1280 by 800 I don't think that they
[00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:07.560]   need to go any higher than that I think people are going to be a little disappointed when
[00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:14.560]   the iPad to just as a camera and I'll do process camera you know if they go a five across the
[00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:21.240]   board that would be a big deal I played with a number of the Tegra 2 stuff at CES and it's
[00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:26.520]   it's fast it's fast of course Tegra 2 has a g4 CPU in there we don't know what Apple
[00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:31.600]   would put into it's a five in terms of a GPU but presumably be comparable that would be
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:34.920]   pretty sweet I think going I think going into that higher I mean I think that that could
[00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:40.600]   be the thing that a lot of these Android Pat are going to higher resolution I think Apple
[00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:44.800]   might want to compete with them especially since they have the quote unquote retina display
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:48.680]   that they're kind of bragging about the thing that puzzles me that was why they would want
[00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:53.080]   to do it or the food you know is going up against competition because really the current screen
[00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:58.200]   is fantastic for watching movies or watching movies I've been reading though it that's
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:01.720]   where it makes a difference if you really look at the I've at the iPad it as something
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:06.880]   I can read I think that then you're tempted to want at least have you know that you know
[00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:10.800]   at least have a little bit more clarity where it does have a major feeling and that resolution
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:14.960]   is using folders and the small icons within the folders on the on the home screen because
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:18.360]   they do look very granular and very great and very difficult to make out so that would
[00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:21.760]   be a and they look so good on the iPhone and they actually read them you can see that there's
[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:24.960]   a little teeny we need to be bird right in there whether or not they'd want to go to
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:29.880]   the expense and the trouble of reengineering just for that sort of level I think they might
[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:35.120]   so it'll be interesting to see how that goes but I think that when will they announce
[00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:43.920]   the iPad to March March when they're ready to release it seriously because I mean last
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:47.760]   year they announced it you know two or three months in advance and they don't want to
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:51.600]   release they don't need to do that this time because it would hit sales so right as soon
[00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:56.200]   as they go so much when did they release it April I think it was a pattern I think there's
[00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:58.520]   a pattern we're seeing and I think we're going to continue to really you're going to get
[00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:00.800]   an iPad in the spring you're going to get an iPhone in the summer you're going to get
[00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:05.760]   something with iTunes in the in the fall and then we'll sprinkle quietly sprinkle about
[00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:10.080]   hard other hardware I think that's good I think that that Apple is looking at what's
[00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:13.680]   happening in the Android market with a new handset every two weeks and realizing that
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:17.760]   scares the hell out of people and makes it very difficult to keep up to date I think they're
[00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:23.000]   saying hmm if we we want our users to know when the updates are we want them to know
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   it's April June September April June September that's that's a good thing right for newbies
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.240]   I don't think a lot of people don't care I mean when they're just getting into it the
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:33.040]   people who just walk into the store and buy it they're getting all those sales because
[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:36.480]   people just wanted they won't advertise it because they don't want newbies right but
[00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:40.720]   but for those of us in the know well there's probably 20 I think there's probably 20 I'm
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:46.080]   going to guess 20% of iPhone users bomb I'm going to guess buy one every year I mean that's
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:51.440]   part of what you know this is every year 100% of the people in this room we're not we're
[00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:57.200]   not an accurate cross sample of the general population oh I don't know yeah yeah Apple
[00:55:57.200 --> 00:56:03.080]   Apple has made a good cycle for their revenue though too I mean it's going to stay nice and
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:08.800]   steady with that release cycle and I think they probably like that also so Apple announces
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:16.040]   we were watching the ticker go for the 10 billionth app to click over they they sold
[00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:22.080]   their 10 billionth app it was that paper airplane no no the paper toss where you throw
[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:27.280]   the crumpled up piece of paper and that it was free but remember bump was like the one
[00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:32.440]   one was in one millionth or whatever it was 10 billionth so it's a woman in the UK do
[00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:38.080]   you know her no what you did because you know I thought maybe you might know her because
[00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:45.160]   she lives there as a small little village is yeah she lives in your little village Apple
[00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:50.080]   calls her she hangs up she thinks it's a prank I think it was for her daughter right
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:54.000]   I think her daughter bought it and then I bought it right and she's just like I didn't
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:57:00.160]   buy that go away oh not with the accents go where what does it sound like in Orpington
[00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:06.760]   what is an Orpington accent she's not Ken to think so so the next oh I'm not going to
[00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:11.640]   have you you're a northerner I'm a no I'm scouser she said thank you very much I'm not
[00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:16.320]   interested now that's northern yeah the only problem was the caller was really someone
[00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:21.200]   from Apple and Davis really had one surprise it was in fact ten thousand dollars or something
[00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:26.560]   like that right paper glider that's the 10 billionth app that's a UK app as well a thing
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:31.640]   it wasn't paper tosses paper glider how far can you flick and fly your paper plane it's
[00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:38.800]   a copy of paper toss she called Apple back and was distraught because she called the
[00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:43.880]   help desk and the woman said right I don't like you talking to me I get out of here so
[00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:48.280]   she got a ten thousand dollar gift card so I can understand doing that because we do
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:51.320]   get I don't know if it's the same in the states we do get lots of cold calls from people saying
[00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:55.760]   you've won you know a cruise to for the Caribbean and stuff like that's right nine times out
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:58:00.840]   of ten people just put me to we get that yeah yeah she says the more I thought about it the
[00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:05.880]   more I realized that it was a genuine call the girls were getting quite tense they would
[00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:09.940]   never have forgiven me they would have held against me for all eternity ten thousand
[00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:18.040]   dollars worth of free apps that's pretty good that's a lot of Angry Birds yeah that is a
[00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:24.560]   lot of that yeah you could buy an iPod or something or iPod touch or something with that angry
[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:30.120]   eagles you can't know you can't I don't think you should only buy apps I think it just
[00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:36.960]   sucks yeah come you can have a great show you can buy a Mac pro with a 30 inch screen yeah
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:40.920]   and an Angry Birds if but I think so she might have enough left over for the Angry Birds
[00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:48.240]   they know we didn't talk it last week because it came out afterwards is that Apple made made
[00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:53.480]   some money turned out a little they didn't lose any money yeah I know we were worried
[00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:58.560]   about it we thought that we thought oh we didn't think they'd lose money come on really yeah
[00:58:58.560 --> 00:59:04.320]   so what were the quarterly results you have 20 and I want to say 26.7 billion for the quarter
[00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:13.000]   oh chump change you know I think I calculated it out at a hundred thousand dollars I want
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:17.680]   to say a hundred thousand dollars a minute mmm believe that was about it it was really
[00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:20.920]   something like that yeah I was lying around with the you know it was they were just kind
[00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:25.960]   of so it you know really they the printing presses in one could pretend of the new ones
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:31.640]   are all the operational that's what we do with our basement we're printing presses down
[00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:36.760]   there I was just thinking what I could do when we rule with ten thousand dollars worth
[00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:49.660]   a mojo 16.24 million iPhones 7.33 million iPads in one quarter right I said eight one
[00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:54.580]   I said eight point six million in all of last year and they did almost that in one quarter
[00:59:54.580 --> 01:00:01.220]   four point one three million max so they're selling four times more iPhones and max twice
[01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:08.260]   as many iPads as max they sold 19 and a half million iPods that's actually in unit sales
[01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:12.620]   that's the biggest is iPod which that surprises me that they're still selling iPods my parents
[01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:17.460]   love their little nano someone someone someone said that the iPod touch the sales was like
[01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:21.300]   two billion dollar industry on its own this old two billion the touch is pretty cool so
[01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:25.140]   if you don't have to get the contract I've bought touches for people in fact I bought
[01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:29.940]   two touches can you space time someone with a touch on Wi-Fi on Wi-Fi the new one yeah
[01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:35.940]   you have to the front facing camera those are pretty good 26 and three quarter billion
[01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:39.380]   American billions well and this was not you here's the interesting thing is this is the
[01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:47.260]   biggest myth though by unit sales I believe the highest sales of Max themselves so while
[01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:52.180]   they were smaller than I was not dead they've sold they sold more Max in the last quarter
[01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:56.620]   than they've ever sold before so revenue of twenty six thousand million dollars does
[01:00:56.620 --> 01:01:01.860]   that feel better to you if I say that twenty six thousand million dollars and a record net
[01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:07.020]   quarterly profit of three thousand million dollars it just sounds wrong is that how you
[01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:10.180]   say it though three thousand million three thousand million yeah that's three billion when
[01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:14.500]   I check my bank account that's what three thousand million it sounds like more three
[01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:17.540]   thousand million does sound like more than three billion oh we use billion no we use
[01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:22.340]   billion but your billion is more than a thousand million yeah I'm never really have to worry
[01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:28.380]   about too much a UK billion is a thousand millions right which if it were if I were a
[01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:38.380]   billionaire in the UK now that's rich mm-hmm it's only a thousand I confused it's a gazillion
[01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:43.820]   a big question 23% increase in max sales quarter to quarter a year to your big question
[01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:49.220]   is whether Apple can can bypass Exxon this year oh I don't know you keep bringing that
[01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:54.620]   up like that matters I just think it's cool that's all I think it's it's absurd that's
[01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:57.740]   why I think it's that the way the reason I'm fascinated by it is this that I think it's
[01:01:57.740 --> 01:02:04.260]   so absurd that Apple would pass an oil company yeah yeah that's pretty amazing it's kind of
[01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:08.100]   like pigs and flying that's just stock it's stock yeah that's the one thing to remember
[01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:13.180]   is that there's a meeting is that this is nothing that revenue no no no and Apple's much
[01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:17.220]   smaller when it comes to revenue than many many companies including Microsoft you know
[01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:20.900]   I think the big factor though for that last quarter for Max is the the map of care you know
[01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:24.540]   that must have a huge impact do we know did they break it down I'm not sure that he gave
[01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:29.140]   us the actual figures I'd love they did mention that it was a strong you know strong impact
[01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:33.220]   on the sales and that's only going to be carried forward you know into the isn't it interesting
[01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:38.260]   I mean the the original Mac book here as cool as it was just was kind of a don't you think
[01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:45.540]   kind of a dud it wasn't it was it felt slow it wasn't very overheated it just felt like
[01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:51.740]   a dud and this feels so much better and I guess it's the size yeah yeah that's the original
[01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:56.020]   air I think Apple has these products that I've always said are their their public R&D
[01:02:56.020 --> 01:03:00.820]   things like the cube I always feel was like public R&D for the Mac mini and the first
[01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:05.180]   air was sort of like let's just see if we can do this let's figure out the engineering let's
[01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:09.740]   put it out there for the the high end users and then get a lot of great feedback and then
[01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:13.940]   really want them with the with the next great version by the way somebody's saying in the
[01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:19.180]   chat room and this is true if you want to become as big as Exxon in revenue you in a
[01:03:19.180 --> 01:03:25.020]   you do the service that the NFC on the cell phones on the iPhone the near field communications
[01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:31.180]   you are the service you don't go through visa you do it and you take 30% of every whatever
[01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:35.100]   and you could be as big as Exxon too I should we pull on the car on the way up and he was
[01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:38.780]   saying that there's a possibility of Apple becoming a bank because of you know they actually
[01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:44.260]   right yeah they got the cash and you know they got the cash I thought I've decided that
[01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:52.540]   the best way to handle net neutrality is for Apple Google Netflix and Amazon to just invest
[01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:56.540]   billions of dollars into a new company that just builds their own service just shows just
[01:03:56.540 --> 01:04:00.340]   show we'll show AT&T and Verizon you know you take a bunch of the guys who need to have
[01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:03.980]   that open I wanted you know Google came very close to doing that when they were bidding
[01:04:03.980 --> 01:04:07.020]   for that 700 megahertz spectrum they could have if had they bought it it was going to
[01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:09.660]   be very expensive but had they and they had the money they could have if you built a
[01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:13.500]   new company with the companies that need you know the the companies that need that to be
[01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:18.420]   opened and you just let that they'd have the money to to run you know and they they wouldn't
[01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:21.900]   have to they wouldn't be caught up with all the old technologies and so on so forth and
[01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:26.740]   my wrong isn't billion okay now the chat rooms making me nuts isn't billion different in
[01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:33.380]   the UK it's a thousand maybe I'm wrong I thought a billion meant something different it's one
[01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:39.340]   in nine zeros I thought there was a difference I thought a million is a thousand millions
[01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:46.700]   I don't know that's what it is here it's what it is a billion is a billion all right oh
[01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:53.700]   oh UK doesn't do that anymore do we not apparently not okay so when I'm done was growing up a
[01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:59.700]   billion was a lot more now it's because no one had it so yeah that was a billion was
[01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:05.300]   just like you know it was it was an obtain a billion in the US is a thousand million in
[01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:13.060]   the UK I think it was it used to be a million million okay which is a lot I'll take it there's
[01:05:13.060 --> 01:05:19.340]   a crucial access there's a short and long scale I'm so sorry oh it's France that it's
[01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:27.340]   different and France is a billion here a billion zeros let us take a break come back Alex Lindsay

[01:09:15.660 --> 01:09:22.620]   a dither by saying hey playboy will be on the iPad and we thought maybe Steve has relaxed
[01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:30.820]   the rules no no it's a web app playboy he said in his tweet by the way you know you
[01:09:30.820 --> 01:09:37.260]   really should be following Hugh Hefner's tweets he tweets in his bathrobe and jammies
[01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:58.820]   he says playboy will be available on iPad without the playmate Steve J
[01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:15.700]   the web app thing I'll say something on the web app thing cuz we just started San Diego
[01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:21.260]   iOS user group here in our area and the guy that runs it is really into the web app thing
[01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:25.780]   which Apple kind of moved on from but you can sign up on Apple's website to be you know
[01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:34.220]   web developer Safari mobile developer right and you can really build full featured apps
[01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:38.380]   and they have a what's called a manifest document and you can put all your assets in there and
[01:10:38.380 --> 01:10:42.600]   you can have it downloaded and updated and that's interesting so there is a download
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:47.260]   to the machine that it will do yeah so you can set it up in a way where it essentially
[01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:51.860]   installs on the phone like a true app and he even showed me he can put it in his app in
[01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:56.660]   an airplane mode and run the entire thing without a connection and then if he pushes
[01:10:56.660 --> 01:11:00.940]   an update to his website the next time you do have a connection it'll pull down new assets
[01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:04.860]   and new updates I actually like that I think I did not realize that I think that that maybe
[01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:10.020]   is an underused tool I want to give you a lot of flexibility especially if your buildings
[01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:14.060]   are company we're experimenting with a lot of different ways of doing it so but we're
[01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:18.100]   looking at stuff that we want to use as general communication tools in the pixagora as we
[01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:22.420]   start to experiment with a lot of the stuff is I don't want to put it on the iTunes store
[01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:26.660]   I'm not ready to make it public I you know but it's going to move information around
[01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:30.420]   and it just it's enough you know to do that and I think for if you're a school if you're
[01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:34.140]   a corporation if you're you know there's a bunch of enterprise level stuff where you're
[01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:38.380]   not trying to sell it but and you also want to update it quickly and have control over
[01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:44.540]   it I think it makes a lot of sense I you know I'm gonna look at that more can you use something
[01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:50.420]   like Scribd to create kind of the beginnings of your HTML5 you ever tried that because
[01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:58.620]   they have like that generating thing okay Mac was 27 yesterday happy birthday oh I can't
[01:11:58.620 --> 01:12:03.660]   sing that I don't need a time Warner EOL it's a tad yeah really how many notes that was
[01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:13.620]   two notes I think I'm safe for a thousand dollars the next note was gonna be to you know
[01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:19.140]   27 years old so we were just talking to Paul Kent he said that the Mac rolled Expo was 27
[01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:24.420]   I mean that that's kind of cool it was a January I forgot it was it was January and if you bought
[01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:30.380]   within the first hundred days then you were like something special I think my cousin got
[01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:34.820]   one when I'm a hundred I'm a hundred day guy I wasn't I had an apple to and I it took
[01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:40.340]   so much work to get my dad to buy the apple to that I wasn't gonna get a Mac from YouTube
[01:12:40.340 --> 01:12:45.940]   our third YouTube video of the day this is Steve Jobs demonstrating the Macintosh 27 years
[01:12:45.940 --> 01:12:54.580]   ago you've just seen some pictures of Macintosh now I'd like to show you Macintosh in person
[01:12:54.580 --> 01:12:59.700]   sure was cute back then all of the images you're about to see on the large screen will
[01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:09.980]   be generated by what's in that bag no this was the original one one 28 K Mac one floppy
[01:13:09.980 --> 01:13:15.460]   400 K floppy so all the programs had to fit in 400 K if you had more oh look that's the
[01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:21.700]   famous Mac bag remember that bag oh there it is the first time we saw Macintosh he did
[01:13:21.700 --> 01:13:27.100]   this I think in Cupertino didn't he in front of an at mostly apple audience so they were
[01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:34.820]   very excited they've come a long way in their videography he's actually plugging it in look
[01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:41.380]   how formally he's got a double-breasted suit and a bow tie look there's the floppy 400 K floppy
[01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:53.660]   he's gonna boot that's pretty cool I don't know how they got to boot that fast I was
[01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:56.980]   gonna say it was quite impressive there's no smoke in there is because he plugged in
[01:13:56.980 --> 01:14:06.380]   yeah well this is a very early prototype for all we know this is all in firmware the floppy
[01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:12.740]   was but remember this is a bit map display nobody's seen anything like this in 1984 we
[01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:19.620]   were still looking at green screen on black the word Macintosh is smoothly scrolling across
[01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:24.340]   the screen you hear the audience go crazy first time I saw this I thought this is odd then
[01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:33.140]   I realized oh they're all apple employees and it's drawing insanely great the words
[01:14:33.140 --> 01:14:41.980]   Macintosh with a superlative in 27 years even them I'm magic yet just insane that was
[01:14:41.980 --> 01:14:52.260]   a Steve there's a Mac paint the lackinson's program amazing really act right you can only
[01:14:52.260 --> 01:14:56.700]   run one of these at a time because he chatted his own floppy and if you wanted to copy data
[01:14:56.700 --> 01:15:05.220]   you had a swap floppies like a hundred times this is a certificate celebration of Macintosh
[01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:14.940]   January 24th 1984 fonts fortunately spaced fonts it's hard to remember how remarkable
[01:15:14.940 --> 01:15:20.700]   this was the time but it really was there's the programming language in Pascal in the early
[01:15:20.700 --> 01:15:28.220]   days it's not the Olympics that's chariots of fire which is an odd choice but probably
[01:15:28.220 --> 01:15:32.820]   gonna have to oh Alice that was fun remember that game there was like a weird chest game
[01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:42.020]   now we've done a lot of talking about Macintosh recently but today for the first time ever
[01:15:42.020 --> 01:15:46.660]   I'd like to let Macintosh speak for itself he must have been pretty happy at this point
[01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:57.180]   hello I imagine it's great to get out of that bag
[01:15:57.180 --> 01:16:05.100]   I'm not as I am too ugly to be in I'd like to share with you a match and I sold her the
[01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:12.980]   first time I met an IBM name frame never crossed a computer you can see how the audience is
[01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:35.500]   going crazy 27 years ago kind of hard to believe isn't it I was a good moment though I have
[01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:41.860]   to say just thought I'd replay that did you get chills I just remember being very sad
[01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:46.340]   I was looking watching it just going I didn't I saw it later I mean I think I had I think
[01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:52.300]   I was playing on Macintosh I saw I didn't see it live and I went to Macy's credit card
[01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:57.700]   in hand twenty five dollars for I had one of those suckers I've had every Mac ever since
[01:16:57.700 --> 01:17:02.500]   by the way I don't think when did they start selling them at Sears probably so close to
[01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:11.420]   that time yeah it was you walk into buyers and I get a screwdriver and I'm not touch amazing
[01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:15.420]   it is time for our picks of the week and I will start with Alex Lindsay because he's got
[01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:20.300]   his sitting right in front of us not a pick it's not a pick it's not a pick for a Mac for
[01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:26.140]   a Mac show it's a 3D Panasonic 3D camera you saw that it's CES and now you already have
[01:17:26.140 --> 01:17:29.780]   one well then they're lending me one to shoot stuff at Mac world so I'm going to be talking
[01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:34.380]   about this a lot both at Mac world and at the Super Meat there's a final cut pro Super
[01:17:34.380 --> 01:17:38.180]   Meat on Friday night and I'll be showing a lot more of this and we're going to be posting
[01:17:38.180 --> 01:17:42.180]   some of this video on YouTube in in you know soon we're going to be doing a bunch of tests
[01:17:42.180 --> 01:17:47.220]   with it and and so we're doing lots of testing with it but it's a it's called a 3D A1 and
[01:17:47.220 --> 01:17:52.740]   it's um it is awesome I didn't really it's not really a Mac pick but it's a it's a really
[01:17:52.740 --> 01:17:56.260]   cool camera that's all I have to say so how do you you can't even that you can't edit
[01:17:56.260 --> 01:18:00.220]   that final cut yeah you can or there's a plug in there's a plug in to view it but what
[01:18:00.220 --> 01:18:03.900]   you do is you can simply stack the stuff up and and edit the left eye and then you and
[01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:06.700]   then you can worry about exporting it later so it's actually so if you edit the left eye
[01:18:06.700 --> 01:18:10.100]   you don't see the depth but you're going to at least edit it you can edit the content
[01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:14.780]   and then and then you can play with the depth and and we have our new conduit that's going
[01:18:14.780 --> 01:18:19.580]   to be coming out soon allows you to actually um composite in real time in 3D which is one
[01:18:19.580 --> 01:18:23.340]   of the reasons we're testing it right now so anyway we're having lots of fun with that
[01:18:23.340 --> 01:18:26.980]   but you need a place to view stuff like this and so that's actually one of my picks for
[01:18:26.980 --> 01:18:33.140]   today is it's it's by Luxology and it's called Lux Folio so if you want to see some 3D on
[01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:37.500]   your iPad nice you need the red the red the red and blue glasses we need some kind of
[01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:42.980]   glasses you know to see it in full 3D but Lux Folio is just a great way for you to view
[01:18:42.980 --> 01:18:49.060]   you know stuff and they've got a bunch of great sample files in it and and it's a great way
[01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:52.180]   to show off stuff I know that I've had trouble where I have to convert everything that I'm
[01:18:52.180 --> 01:18:57.820]   shooting that's 3D into into something so that I can put them in iPhoto and then I can show
[01:18:57.820 --> 01:19:03.020]   them to people this will take the actual 3D pictures themselves and I have an iPad app
[01:19:03.020 --> 01:19:08.180]   tonight at the fact you'll see some here zebras from Rwanda and dinner in Paris by by Alex
[01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:12.380]   Lindsey in their sample oh that's nice so I sent them as soon as they sent it as soon
[01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:15.300]   as they posted it I was like this is really cool do you want some more images and they
[01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:17.940]   were like sure and I sent them like a whole pile of them they were like we'll take these
[01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:25.060]   two so so anyway so these are the ones you took with a W1 and W2 yeah the W3 and W1
[01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:32.340]   these are both W1 photos I hadn't got the W3 yet but the so W1 that's the Fujitsu
[01:19:32.340 --> 01:19:38.820]   dual Fuji dual lens which is like the tiny version of this guy it does still with some
[01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:44.700]   video and this does lots of big video and and by the way this is like the first real like
[01:19:44.700 --> 01:19:48.500]   production camera that you can use that's easy to like is not like a big pile of wires
[01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:52.380]   and cameras all wired together it's like the non geek like I just push a button and start
[01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:56.740]   recording in 3D so the anyway but if you want to view stuff in 3D there's the and we're
[01:19:56.740 --> 01:20:01.660]   gonna be talking about I'm gonna be launching a 3D podcast soon so we're digging deep into
[01:20:01.660 --> 01:20:05.700]   that because I'm just having so much fun with it first to do it's any podcast and now
[01:20:05.700 --> 01:20:11.180]   that we're gonna put we're gonna do a mackbreak podcast nobody can watch yes it'll be an
[01:20:11.180 --> 01:20:15.340]   antagliff I'm gonna do an antagliff Mac break we should be releasing it the next week or
[01:20:15.340 --> 01:20:20.380]   two so with this camera so we'll have some fun with that the and one of the things we're
[01:20:20.380 --> 01:20:24.940]   gonna be talking about a little bit is also my pick for my Mac pick I always want to make
[01:20:24.940 --> 01:20:28.820]   sure that I'm still picking Mac programs yeah it's hard to do isn't it it is but there are
[01:20:28.820 --> 01:20:32.220]   some great programs out there and one of the ones that I've been using a lot and I wanted
[01:20:32.220 --> 01:20:36.300]   to really make sure that I was testing and don't think that I picked it so I realized
[01:20:36.300 --> 01:20:39.020]   I was looking through I think it's been on the list of picking is Wirecast I think I've
[01:20:39.020 --> 01:20:43.900]   talked about Wirecast I'm sure we picked it but I'll pick it a new one though is way better
[01:20:43.900 --> 01:20:49.660]   so I think I picked Wirecast in the past you know one of the older versions but Wirecast
[01:20:49.660 --> 01:20:59.580]   4.0 is super stable and I'm running three and some I've run four HDMI out of little like
[01:20:59.580 --> 01:21:06.620]   HD 40s or HS 21s and I'm editing you know so HD I may I've got it set up where Wirecast
[01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:10.380]   will look at you can have desktop presenters so you know like all of these computers you
[01:21:10.380 --> 01:21:14.220]   can have like 10 computers in the in the office and tell Wirecast as soon as you launch their
[01:21:14.220 --> 01:21:19.420]   little desktop presenter they all just show up as cameras that you can edit from and then
[01:21:19.420 --> 01:21:23.020]   it has all the streaming built into it so we use it a lot as just a raw streaming you know and a
[01:21:23.020 --> 01:21:26.380]   lot of people just use it like I'm just gonna pipe video into it and stream but it does editing
[01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:29.820]   it does a lot of other things you can do lower thirds you can do and the new pro version let
[01:21:29.820 --> 01:21:34.860]   you put in digital sets and you know lots of other stuff into it and so it took me a little you know
[01:21:34.860 --> 01:21:40.220]   I wanted to make sure that it was as solid as the you know the older one was a little flaky at times
[01:21:40.220 --> 01:21:44.540]   it was still really useful but this 4.0 has been we've been using it I've been banging on I use
[01:21:44.540 --> 01:21:48.700]   it every week for the pixel core streams as my test we have a lot of hardware mixers as well
[01:21:49.340 --> 01:21:54.860]   and but I'm just really really enjoying using it are you using whenever I've done live stuff
[01:21:54.860 --> 01:21:59.660]   I've used Wirecast and there's slight learning curve to get into it but once you've got past that
[01:21:59.660 --> 01:22:03.900]   it's a fantastic pro and I do like the way they built in the streaming capabilities as well so
[01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:08.700]   it's so easy streaming recorded disc all that stuff is all built in and you can stream to you
[01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:13.340]   know like I've on my Mac Pro I've done up to six streams to different locations at different
[01:22:13.340 --> 01:22:19.340]   compression rates and it just kind of clunks along you know so it's if you have the bandwidth
[01:22:19.340 --> 01:22:24.300]   it's good so that's those are my those are my picks well look who the dog dragged in ladies and
[01:22:24.300 --> 01:22:30.460]   gentlemen he's he's at the airport he's going I know exactly where he is too is it the international
[01:22:30.460 --> 01:22:37.260]   terminal he's going down the conveyor belt on his way to baggage claim at the SFO hello Andy
[01:22:37.260 --> 01:22:44.220]   and I co I'm traveling 100% carry on today sirs I'm not getting paid enough for a check bag
[01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:50.140]   that's the kind of well it's great to see you thank you for making it today
[01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:56.620]   yeah I'm just I'm just sad that we weren't able to make this an in-flight experience yeah I've done
[01:22:56.620 --> 01:23:00.700]   us I remember when Krista Bono for the first time had Wi-Fi in a plane many years ago he made a
[01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:07.900]   Skype call but I don't think really Virgin Atlantic Wi-Fi is quite up to Skype yeah I think it's
[01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:12.220]   mostly for downloading photos of the kids rather than doing Skype chats with your mistress
[01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:21.980]   so this is officially the hat trick though this is three weeks in a row in which
[01:23:21.980 --> 01:23:27.580]   due to circumstance and beyond my effective control I've had to at least make it token
[01:23:27.580 --> 01:23:34.620]   appearance via the mobile version of iPhone so I think of type F we did we do miss you but we're
[01:23:34.620 --> 01:23:40.380]   glad you're coming into town for Macworld and we look forward to seeing you on Thursday everybody
[01:23:40.380 --> 01:23:47.020]   are you doing some sessions at Macworld yeah I'm doing a session at the 3-3-30 on Thursday
[01:23:47.020 --> 01:23:52.380]   basically it's about using your iPad is the only notebook computer you ever need
[01:23:52.380 --> 01:23:57.100]   it's called business travel on one iPad a day so that's my one big thing I'm also doing a panel
[01:23:57.100 --> 01:24:01.340]   sometime around three o'clock Saturday afternoon with Joe Holmes and Chris Green and a whole bunch
[01:24:01.340 --> 01:24:07.020]   of other people who used to get together back when Macworld Expo was on a test cut and we were all
[01:24:07.020 --> 01:24:11.580]   just little residents of the shtettle fearing the the incursions of bizarre
[01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:17.820]   did you want to do your I know you're I mean look you're walking down the conveyor bell here
[01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:23.900]   but do you want to do your pick well okay I'm gonna you know I'm gonna have to swallow my pride a
[01:24:23.900 --> 01:24:29.260]   little bit and say that my pick of the week really does have to be Skype mobile because after all
[01:24:29.260 --> 01:24:33.740]   the complaining that I've done about Skype in the past and certainly in the future I'm not giving
[01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:37.660]   up my right to complain about Skype in the future the fact matter is that they've written a very
[01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:43.180]   very slick app to the iPhone that when you find yourself in the middle of the year when Macbreak
[01:24:43.180 --> 01:24:48.220]   weekly happens or when you find yourself in the middle of your car because your internet connection
[01:24:48.220 --> 01:24:53.420]   has dropped out you still have a perfectly good Skype video client I mean look at this where this
[01:24:53.420 --> 01:25:00.140]   is how he's he's talking to us right now it's via his iPhone it's like just a CNN and I'm like
[01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:05.660]   in a war zone it's actually a little better than that there's less latency the picture is pretty good
[01:25:05.660 --> 01:25:10.860]   in the audio is excellent also by my mother moving walkway so I can do it your miracle
[01:25:10.860 --> 01:25:16.700]   I video yeah no it's very nice it's a crane shot I like it exactly dolly shot I should say yeah and
[01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:26.700]   now and you not go with the dolly shot and he will let you go we'll look forward to seeing you at
[01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:31.980]   Mac world Expo everybody should go to cwob.com and his website and of course read him in the
[01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:37.500]   Chicago Sun Times Roger Ebert has been tweeting a lot of your stuff I guess you like that Nikon
[01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:49.980]   P7000 oh we lost I'm I'm pushed it just a little too far it was so close if I just hung up on
[01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:56.700]   him we're losing you now Andy but we'll talk about that next time I'll be next time we speak I'll be
[01:25:56.700 --> 01:26:02.940]   far less pixelated than I am right now I feel great thank you Andy and I go on his way to Mac world Expo
[01:26:04.140 --> 01:26:11.980]   he's coming by and my life see Andy it looks like an kind of like an Amish guy in that shot
[01:26:11.980 --> 01:26:19.820]   with the mutton chops in the hat so yeah I think actually Skype mobile is a good pick it's really
[01:26:19.820 --> 01:26:23.500]   pretty cool and it's a little more usable than FaceTime because he was using it on 3G I'd say
[01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:30.380]   that it's actually a lot more usable than FaceTime mr. Don McAllister you're pick of the week
[01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:36.300]   what I pick okay well I'll do two going from oh boy we're all gonna do two now aren't we all right
[01:26:36.300 --> 01:26:40.380]   all right I'm gonna do that too I'll do it too go ahead no the mac one really is probably one
[01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:44.540]   we've done before we just pixel mata and the reason I've picked pixel Wow I saw those numbers yeah
[01:26:44.540 --> 01:26:49.180]   they've just announced they've sold a million dollars worth of software in the first 20 days of
[01:26:49.180 --> 01:26:53.740]   the Mac App Store truly amazing there have been a lot of developers that are talking about how
[01:26:53.740 --> 01:26:58.220]   much more they're selling on the Mac App Store you know on the one hand I'm thrilled on the other
[01:26:58.220 --> 01:27:01.740]   hand I'm you know this is what I was worried about is that the App Store was going to be such a
[01:27:01.740 --> 01:27:06.780]   compelling experience both for users and developers that it would push all other forms of app we're
[01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:13.020]   gonna be talking about this actually at Mac world on Saturday Aaron and Heligast and I and a couple
[01:27:13.020 --> 01:27:16.540]   of other folks I mean it was one of the featured apps on the on the front of the app store from
[01:27:16.540 --> 01:27:19.980]   from day one I think so that's probably giving a huge boost but still a million dollars worth of
[01:27:19.980 --> 01:27:24.140]   business that's a lot and I think they're probably not the only one and pixel mators a really good
[01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:27.740]   example because they've been around for a long time they've always been a great program they've
[01:27:27.740 --> 01:27:33.180]   been a pick of the week many times on on Mac break weekly but because you didn't know where to find
[01:27:33.180 --> 01:27:38.620]   it you didn't kind of remember me the name or whatever it just was hard to find and it's right
[01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:43.100]   there in fact it's it's not even the number one top grossing app I see aperture i photo and
[01:27:43.100 --> 01:27:47.980]   pages all Apple apps are bigger than pixel mator it's only 30 dollars which was less than it was
[01:27:47.980 --> 01:27:53.580]   you know they've been in a lot of bundles they do the Mac heist every year but this was big for
[01:27:53.580 --> 01:27:57.660]   them I'm happy for him okay so I just thought I'd throw that in the mix but my main pick for this
[01:27:57.660 --> 01:28:03.660]   week is an iPhone app more called glimpse I don't know if you've uh oh I love
[01:28:03.660 --> 01:28:08.860]   fantastic as a concerned parent with a young teenage daughter and more often not you know I
[01:28:08.860 --> 01:28:12.780]   don't want to keep tabs on her all the time but it's sometimes nice if she's leaving somewhere going
[01:28:12.780 --> 01:28:16.540]   somewhere else that she lets me know where she is and I can you know make sure she gets her okay
[01:28:16.540 --> 01:28:22.300]   well with glimpse um basically there's an iPhone app that it's a free service as well um she just
[01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:27.020]   sends me a glimpse and makes it active for say half an hour and within that half an hour I can
[01:28:27.020 --> 01:28:31.180]   actually on my iPhone say exactly where she is and where she's going to and and sort of track it in
[01:28:31.180 --> 01:28:35.260]   real time and it's fantastic for you know for parents and stuff but what are you just going to
[01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:38.780]   meetings or anything if you're late for a meeting I've used it we were late for a google meeting and
[01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:45.180]   it's great it's fantastic work superbly yeah it's free um the first time I saw it as scoble was late
[01:28:45.180 --> 01:28:49.740]   to twit and he sent us a glimpse and we actually watched him oh right and we knew what he got here
[01:28:50.700 --> 01:28:54.620]   uh it's it's just really cool she broke down a couple of days ago and sent me a glimpse
[01:28:54.620 --> 01:28:59.020]   so I could find out where our location was and she could actually she can actually see where I was
[01:28:59.020 --> 01:29:03.020]   as well so I could see where she was and she see where I was and we can you know kind of mark a
[01:29:03.020 --> 01:29:07.420]   pollo yeah it's kind of amazing really because once you get within 50 feet now now you can
[01:29:07.420 --> 01:29:12.940]   hopefully see each other yeah I mean I think it's just remarkable gl y npsc it's free on the
[01:29:12.940 --> 01:29:17.740]   iPhone and android as well uh and it's cross-platform so that's kind of neat and it uses google maps
[01:29:19.180 --> 01:29:25.500]   um I think I have used it too I think it's an excellent uh suggestion let us head to uh
[01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:31.820]   mr. Christensen who is flying out tonight to Mackewold uh tomorrow yeah I'll actually be there
[01:29:31.820 --> 01:29:38.140]   tomorrow but uh yeah I guess if we have to do too I was gonna do an iPad app I'm a web developer
[01:29:38.140 --> 01:29:44.780]   also kind of in my second job outside of podcasting and um they I've been looking for a really good
[01:29:44.780 --> 01:29:49.900]   editor on the iPad and I don't know that it's all the way there yet but text
[01:29:49.900 --> 01:29:55.580]   pastic have you have anybody have any use this no I haven't seen it I've been I've tried some
[01:29:55.580 --> 01:30:00.860]   other ones yeah the the big thing for me with text tastic was it's just a simple straightforward
[01:30:00.860 --> 01:30:04.780]   editor I'm really looking for something that's going to mimic a lot of what text mate does for me
[01:30:04.780 --> 01:30:10.860]   on the desktop um so it has 80 different types support for 80 different languages with the code
[01:30:10.860 --> 01:30:15.820]   highlighting so that was a big one for me it's nice and fast it adds a little extra
[01:30:15.820 --> 01:30:22.140]   row to the on-screen keyboard with the relevant uh characters so brackets and things like that
[01:30:22.140 --> 01:30:26.860]   you have instant access to and the one thing that was really missing that they just added
[01:30:26.860 --> 01:30:33.420]   with the latest update was integrated FTP and drop box support so that's in there about the only
[01:30:33.420 --> 01:30:38.300]   thing if you got drop box you got it it's done you're done as far as I'm concerned yeah about the
[01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:44.220]   only thing left in it it will let you preview uh HTML so you can get live preview of HTML um
[01:30:44.220 --> 01:30:49.740]   the only thing I wish it had now the one last thing and hopefully they have plans to add this
[01:30:49.740 --> 01:30:57.980]   would be code completion but that might be asking a little bit much of a shit like that but yeah
[01:30:57.980 --> 01:31:03.660]   so text tastic actually can you actually code do you actually code in this I'm trying to like
[01:31:03.660 --> 01:31:08.940]   I said I'm playing around with it you know I haven't found the the perfect thing yet yeah it's still
[01:31:08.940 --> 01:31:14.620]   easier on the desktop oh it does have full um support for uh bluetooth keyboards and connected
[01:31:14.620 --> 01:31:18.380]   keyboards so I haven't tried doing it with a keyboard um but I could take my bluetooth
[01:31:18.380 --> 01:31:23.020]   keyboard in this out you know to a coffee shop and probably get some pretty significant amount of
[01:31:23.020 --> 01:31:29.340]   work done especially with the uh the code highlighting I do a lot of PHP development and CSS and things
[01:31:29.340 --> 01:31:33.580]   like that and it supports both of those very very nicely even for just like looking at code it's
[01:31:33.580 --> 01:31:39.020]   nice to have that highlighting that syntax I like yeah and and since we are doing a mac app I'll
[01:31:39.020 --> 01:31:44.060]   I'll do a really simple one I'm not a huge weather person but there is a weather app on the new
[01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:53.260]   mac app store called swaket which stands for sweater coat or jacket that's w a c k e t t dot com swaket
[01:31:53.260 --> 01:31:58.220]   dot com and what's really neat about it is it's just a big large interface and when you open it up
[01:31:58.220 --> 01:32:03.660]   and you've got your location in there it gives you these little uh simple line illustrations vector
[01:32:03.660 --> 01:32:08.620]   art illustrations of a man and a woman and the appropriate clothing for the type of weather that's
[01:32:08.620 --> 01:32:13.500]   happening that day and there it's free right now and they're gonna have it looks like add-on packs
[01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:17.660]   that you can buy different characters that's they have like a british invasion pack and you'll be
[01:32:17.660 --> 01:32:21.260]   able to get a bunch of you guys see the fat B or on the left there yeah yeah I was wondering whether
[01:32:21.260 --> 01:32:26.380]   it was gonna be uh location specific because in in in in LA it would be black and then the other
[01:32:26.380 --> 01:32:32.700]   one we black and then the other we black it's just it's a really pretty little weather weather app and
[01:32:32.700 --> 01:32:37.340]   and it's simple and it's free so you know as long as you're mentioning that I don't know if they've
[01:32:37.340 --> 01:32:43.340]   solved this but somebody stole the uh remember there's a great weather app on the iPad that is a
[01:32:43.340 --> 01:32:52.060]   HD weather HD and somebody and somebody made the same name on uh the app store but it's not the
[01:32:52.060 --> 01:32:56.780]   same app it's not as good yeah it's still there it's got a one star rating because it's such a
[01:32:56.780 --> 01:33:00.780]   crappy app I think a lot of people bought it thinking it was weather HD the same one we see on
[01:33:00.780 --> 01:33:05.580]   the iPhone and the iPad it is not right there's name squatting this happened if you remember this
[01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:11.900]   happened to a lot of uh app Macintosh developers when the app store came out right the iPhone
[01:33:11.900 --> 01:33:15.980]   app store people started making iPhone versions of apps with the same names but they weren't the
[01:33:15.980 --> 01:33:20.380]   same ones from them from the Mac that's gone the other way apples done nothing about it but fortunately
[01:33:20.380 --> 01:33:26.860]   if you read the reviews it's very clear look at that one one star and everybody says not the real
[01:33:26.860 --> 01:33:33.260]   weather HD in fact this one from the actual developer of weather HD he said the developer
[01:33:33.260 --> 01:33:38.380]   misappropriately used our name in selling this application has nothing to do with us the creators
[01:33:38.380 --> 01:33:42.300]   of the original and I would like to see weather HD on the app store actually I love it on the
[01:33:42.300 --> 01:33:49.580]   iPad it's really pretty do not buy imposter you know that's interesting fool me once why would I
[01:33:49.580 --> 01:33:55.180]   want the you know unfortunately I think it also damages these guys who create weather HD for the
[01:33:55.180 --> 01:34:00.380]   iPad because inevitably a lot of people think it's the same thing and this one's not not so hot
[01:34:00.380 --> 01:34:05.900]   uh thank you Adam two two apps I guess it's up to me to do two apps as well
[01:34:05.900 --> 01:34:12.380]   man you open the bar you guys is up in the bar well I'm gonna uh do let's start with the Mac app
[01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:17.020]   I actually wanted to do a piece of hardware I'll do that in a second but I'll do the Mac app as well
[01:34:17.020 --> 01:34:23.820]   and it's just a silly little app but I actually really like it it's called drop copy you know that
[01:34:23.820 --> 01:34:30.220]   app it's by 10 base t interactive and the idea is it adds a drop zone to your screen
[01:34:30.220 --> 01:34:37.100]   and you just draw it's like a little vortex your drag a file over to it and it copies it over
[01:34:37.100 --> 01:34:41.500]   your land to another system and it actually is kind of makes it very simple it sees the other
[01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:47.340]   systems that are running drop copy um it you know it'll it'll give you a list of systems that are
[01:34:47.340 --> 01:34:53.740]   available and you just drop stuff into it uh it couldn't be simpler to use let me move my
[01:34:53.740 --> 01:34:59.900]   uh my screens over and I can show it to you it's just right there there's a little you can't even
[01:34:59.900 --> 01:35:04.300]   really see it's just a little zone there that little circle and if I drag something over to the
[01:35:04.300 --> 01:35:08.700]   zone it's gonna actually I think it's copying it over the internet yeah it's copying it to my
[01:35:08.700 --> 01:35:14.860]   computer and the other at home in here because it makes a little wish sound at the end I think
[01:35:14.860 --> 01:35:19.100]   so that's called drop copy I'm not sure how much it is because it's installed I don't think
[01:35:19.100 --> 01:35:25.020]   it's very expensive and then this is the um let's see I'm gonna plop a camera here
[01:35:25.020 --> 01:35:30.940]   this is the physical thing I was gonna show you let's see that's you Don
[01:35:30.940 --> 01:35:37.900]   oh you're on camera five so I have to hold it up like this let's see where's Don there it is
[01:35:38.220 --> 01:35:44.060]   [laughs] there it is look at that Don this is from now we've you Don in fact hold up your mophie
[01:35:44.060 --> 01:35:48.060]   because you've got a mophie case and we've recommended the mophie before and I love the mophie this is
[01:35:48.060 --> 01:35:53.260]   a second battery for the iPhone 4 um this is similar it's a little thinner if you turn your
[01:35:53.260 --> 01:35:57.340]   mophie on its side it's not as pretty doesn't have that silver bezel this is a little smaller it's
[01:35:57.340 --> 01:36:01.820]   also not quite the big battery but what I like about this is from techieon it's 79 bucks a little
[01:36:01.820 --> 01:36:07.180]   cheaper than the mophie it has replaceable batteries so you can buy extra ones of these for 40 or
[01:36:07.180 --> 01:36:13.260]   50 bucks charge them up and then just plug them in so you can have three or four snap in battery
[01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:19.020]   packs that'll give you not a full charge in your iPhone but close to it uh it has an on off switch
[01:36:19.020 --> 01:36:25.500]   it it is the mini USB will sync over mini USB so you can charge and sync when it's on but I just
[01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:31.180]   like the idea that you can buy additional little battery units for your trip wherever you're going
[01:36:31.180 --> 01:36:35.500]   I bought two because the mophie has the just at the top yeah the mophie has something similar
[01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:40.780]   yeah but that's the battery so they've got it much more compact on this this techieon and the
[01:36:40.780 --> 01:36:44.060]   two is really important because it means you have one in charge and one on the on the phone
[01:36:44.060 --> 01:36:53.180]   exactly pop it out and swap it exactly that's that's how I how I plan to use it uh tekk uh can't do
[01:36:53.180 --> 01:37:03.500]   this again there's so many people in here tekken dot com they call it the iPhone power now I end up
[01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:08.780]   buying two cases because uh they're they're sold out of the little battery units and I wanted to have
[01:37:08.780 --> 01:37:13.820]   this for a mac mania 11 but uh you'll be able to buy a number of them and it's small and it's a
[01:37:13.820 --> 01:37:19.820]   little bit more compact in the mophie and they do come in colors so you can get red white or black
[01:37:19.820 --> 01:37:26.220]   I bought black so that you wouldn't really know there was anything on there tekken dot com it's
[01:37:26.220 --> 01:37:32.540]   very cool that's it for the show thank you Adam Christensen for joining us have a safe trip out
[01:37:32.540 --> 01:37:36.140]   to a san francisco for mac world we'll see you mac world expo day after tomorrow
[01:37:36.140 --> 01:37:40.700]   yep thank you looking forward to it can we do get up there you can do mac cast from there
[01:37:40.700 --> 01:37:46.620]   yeah I ran around the show floor I try and uh you know capture the things for my listeners who
[01:37:46.620 --> 01:37:50.300]   aren't able to make the show so I've asked people to send me in and say you know what what do you
[01:37:50.300 --> 01:37:54.060]   want to see who do you want me to talk to so we go to go around to do interviews and then I'll put
[01:37:54.060 --> 01:38:00.060]   those up on uh on the feed at maccast.com that's cool so it's like a request podcast yeah yeah we do
[01:38:00.060 --> 01:38:03.980]   we you know so I've always tried to make it real community based my show that's kind of that's kind
[01:38:03.980 --> 01:38:12.460]   of my angle on it is the the virtual user group feel so and you and uh don are on the mac round
[01:38:12.460 --> 01:38:18.460]   table how often do you guys do that um it's well once every two weeks ostensibly so uh
[01:38:18.460 --> 01:38:24.380]   twice a month we try to get but we don't live one at mac world um so uh we'll be at the oh good
[01:38:24.380 --> 01:38:29.500]   um you need to just double check when it is but here we go you can look at it at the mac world
[01:38:30.060 --> 01:38:33.820]   expo website it'll tell you but if I can find it quickly I shall tell you what it is.
[01:38:33.820 --> 01:38:38.540]   While he's looking at that I should also mention you know every every year for a while I've been
[01:38:38.540 --> 01:38:43.580]   doing just the podcast new media meetup and and paul can't give us a space a couple years ago to
[01:38:43.580 --> 01:38:47.180]   do that so that's one of the birds of a feather sessions. Oh good you're gonna do that again oh
[01:38:47.180 --> 01:38:53.020]   good. When is that? Yeah it's it's thursday the 27th from 5 30 to 6 so it sometimes gets a little
[01:38:53.020 --> 01:38:56.940]   difficult for people to get there but it's it's a lot of fun we just talk about podcasting and
[01:38:56.940 --> 01:39:02.940]   in new media and people have questions uh you know whether you're a listener or you're a producer
[01:39:02.940 --> 01:39:06.860]   it's it's good for both the birds of a feather if anybody doesn't know it hasn't been in mac world
[01:39:06.860 --> 01:39:11.820]   they're real casual just sessions there's no central speaker I'm just kind of moderating or
[01:39:11.820 --> 01:39:16.060]   guiding the discussion really and and we just chat back and forth so it's a lot of fun.
[01:39:16.060 --> 01:39:22.220]   I'm gonna try to make it I'm doing something with kind of weird uh mac world uh uh we're
[01:39:22.220 --> 01:39:27.580]   gonna do ipad today 132 3 thereabouts we're gonna run around with our live streaming unit so we
[01:39:27.580 --> 01:39:33.820]   will stream that here at live.twit.tv um and then give you an ipad today show that we'll edit out of
[01:39:33.820 --> 01:39:39.740]   that and then after that I'm going over to david praegers house for the dig dialogue this is where
[01:39:39.740 --> 01:39:44.460]   the folks at dig in your you know ask questions of somebody and uh they're gonna interview the
[01:39:44.460 --> 01:39:49.100]   CEO of dig and they thought we shouldn't probably have anybody in house do that they don't like
[01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:53.660]   fire it so they asked me so i'm very flattered and i'll be doing that interviewing the new CEO of dig
[01:39:53.660 --> 01:39:58.300]   on the dig dialogue that'll be not live but they'll edit that up but that's supposed to be like
[01:39:58.300 --> 01:40:03.260]   436 30 but if I can Adam I would really like to get to that pod poster round table because that's
[01:40:03.260 --> 01:40:08.700]   fun that's really fun. You know what i'm noticing is I think the mac round table podcast is right
[01:40:08.700 --> 01:40:16.140]   at the same time oh yeah yeah yeah arumba so it'll be interesting 515 to 6 it looks like on
[01:40:16.140 --> 01:40:21.740]   thursday on the mac world live stage which i think is in the in the show floor right don yeah that's
[01:40:21.740 --> 01:40:27.740]   the one that's the one so i think plug plugalicious right there we've got about 18 plugs thank you
