[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.000]   Convene.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Thank you. Rich Siegel, the word master.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.920]   Of course, he's the guy in charge of BB Ed at barebones.com.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.480]   Hello, Rich.
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.440]   We could afternoon everybody.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.440]   I apologize for my face being in China.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.800]   No, no, but you look good.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.320]   You look good.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.800]   It's nice.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.640]   And there's no birds in evidence.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.120]   Although there's a rather large bag of bird food behind you.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.040]   How many birds?
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.600]   Those are nuts.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.240]   Those are nuts.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.440]   Are they for you or the bird?
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.240]   They're for the birds.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.080]   I'll sum with us from Montreal where he's equally shvitzing.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.520]   Yeah.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.840]   Mr. Renee Ritchie from iMore.com.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.160]   Yeah.
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.520]   It's 26 degrees, Leo, but 100% humidity because Montreal is an island.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.560]   So you can't tell where the water ends and the air begins.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.680]   Thanks to Pokemon Go.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.240]   I now am familiar with the metric system.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:51.840]   That's awesome.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.880]   So I know the 26 degrees means hot.
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.840]   Yeah.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.080]   I mean, like some people in Arizona are just laughing at me,
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.880]   but you have a dry heat.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.840]   This is a wet heat.
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.640]   It's just unpleasant.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.120]   It's hospitalized.
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.680]   Muggy.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.240]   Muggy.
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.800]   Soggy.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.760]   I signed up for it.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.560]   Well, we did have hail.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.000]   We've had three hail storms in the last week.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.600]   I saw your picture of hail.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.880]   I thought, what the hail?
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:09.920]   That was Georgia's roof.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.520]   The hail took out Georgia's roof.
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.920]   And bizarre.
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.400]   How could it be hot and hail?
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.160]   Because it's cold up there, Leo.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.000]   It's still cold up there and then it falls on us
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.920]   and it's not hot enough to melt before it impacts.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:20.880]   It's hotter than hail.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.000]   Ice comments.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.120]   That's pretty crazy.
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.360]   And also in the warm eastern region of the United States,
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.880]   in this case, Mr. Andrew and Naco, the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.240]   Hey, there, Heather.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.800]   And who there?
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.520]   Hey, there, Heather.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.640]   Hello there, my friend.
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.640]   I do have to say this.
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.400]   Well, speaking of Pokemon, I have to have a story
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.160]   that involves Pokemon and hail.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.400]   Because I was in the public garden on Friday
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.080]   and just having a good time taking pictures.
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.520]   And the place was like, champ-packed with Pokemon players.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.320]   Again, adding to the wonderful ambiance of the place,
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.880]   walking around, having a good time smiling,
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.800]   and clustering big groups around
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.360]   whatever the thingy of the imaginary cartoon guys are.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.720]   And so my watch buzz is to tell me that there is
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.560]   like a suddenly a national weather service
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.520]   has issued a severe weather alert
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.000]   for the park involving hail and lightning storms
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.920]   that had touched down 20 minutes away
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:14.960]   and were hitting this way.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.120]   And I have my camera, so I break down my tripod,
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.640]   break down my camera, break down my lens,
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.640]   get all packed, my backpack, I'm about to go.
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.800]   And then I realized that, no, no,
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.680]   this is what Superman would do in this situation.
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.680]   And I walk into the middle of the conclave
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.480]   and I say, Pokemon players, man, have your attention.
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.360]   Would you please check the weather apps on your phone
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.040]   because they severe weather?
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.320]   Oh, no. Did you really do?
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.000]   I honestly did.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.960]   So awesome.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.400]   And I'm also not lying because when I tell you that
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.920]   one of the players like walked to me and said, I quote,
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:48.880]   you're a hero.
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.560]   Oh, well, there he is.
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.160]   You're a hero.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.640]   I have no telling how many lives you say.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.920]   Exactly.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.080]   Next time, please Snapchat it, video it.
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.120]   We got to see that.
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.080]   That's awesome.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.520]   So which method, like I actually took the long way,
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.320]   like through the park to make sure that I got all the groups.
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.920]   Because I wanted to be that.
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.000]   I wanted as many people to look upon me
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.400]   as some sort of Superman as possible.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.720]   This is probably my only chance my entire life.
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.640]   Super in the hero by strangers.
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.400]   You are a true hero.
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.600]   They're good.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.560]   They're good, honest folk.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.040]   Did you raise your hands like this?
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.760]   How did you?
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.280]   Why did you gesture?
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.720]   Well, I had I I I
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.520]   over the second time, like I found like a tree branch that was down.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.480]   So I held it aloft like like a Trump and Heston wave it.
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.240]   Uh, let my kids go.
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.160]   I was gonna say, did you part the duck pond?
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.040]   That is my suckling.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.960]   So same stick.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.160]   I did the Gandalf.
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.040]   That is so great.
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.720]   You show the post.
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:57.360]   Today, the big news today will be later today, unfortunately.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.240]   Apple does this, but you know, it's not I can't blame Apple for doing it.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.600]   They wait till the markets close.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.640]   They will at 2 p.m. Pacific.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.160]   About two and a half hours from right now, right?
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.240]   We'll announce their quarterly earnings.
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.360]   This is.
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.360]   I think it'll be 1.30 and then the conference call.
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.960]   Okay, so we might if we if we go a little long at the press release,
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:28.000]   this is the third quarter for Apple and Q three for Apple and Q four are traditionally
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.200]   down quarters because Q one is the one where you see the benefit from all the new stuff, right?
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.640]   Yeah, so they're going to make billions of dollars and be officially doomed again.
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.440]   I know.
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.880]   I know, but it won't be well.
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:39.760]   Will it be?
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.560]   I think people won't look at the profit, although profit will be, of course, good.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.040]   They'll look at and will be looking for declines.
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.960]   Now, is it a growth decline or a literal decline in sales in the iPhone?
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.400]   It's a growth decline.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.840]   For Wall Street purposes, yeah, they're they're interested in new markets and well, Wall Street
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.240]   is interesting because if you don't have a big market, they're complaining that you're not
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.440]   getting market aggressively enough.
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.720]   And if you do have a big market, they're complaining that there's no growth opportunities
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.040]   and you know, Apple's not opening stores on Mars anytime soon.
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.840]   So they're constrained to the population of just our planet.
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:10.160]   Yeah.
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.160]   Yeah.
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:12.640]   And there's been a sell-off.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.960]   Plus potentially the planet that the analysts live on.
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.000]   Yes.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.680]   I mean, the Earthling analysts.
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.440]   They're so they're so ethnocentric.
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.720]   I'm going to use Yahoo Finance just kind of for old times sake.
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.440]   What the hell?
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:23.920]   Verizon.
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:24.320]   Verizon.
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:24.880]   Verizon.
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:25.440]   Verizon.
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:29.600]   I'll use Verizon Finance to show Apple's it's not as you know what?
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.480]   I like Google better.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.200]   Well, you could see there's been a sell-off.
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.160]   This is five days.
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.640]   If we just look at today, there's a sell-off.
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.480]   People are expecting the worst.
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.760]   That may mean that and we're not we don't do stock tip hits here.
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:47.360]   The stock market is completely irrelevant to what we're talking about in general.
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.720]   But that may mean the stock price goes up when they make the announcement.
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:56.560]   But clearly, investors are expecting bad news from an investment point of view.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.040]   Yeah.
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:02.000]   I mean, people I hope that Apple fans don't ever take this sort of stuff personally
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.040]   because they are they it's not just that they're on a different planet.
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:09.440]   So they see Apple as a generator of stock profits.
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.480]   They don't see them as a generator of phones and other devices.
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.280]   So I mean, you know what that again, getting that it all comes back this week.
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:19.520]   It all comes back to either to either a camera app or a Pokemon Go.
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.080]   It's like that.
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:23.600]   So Nintendo stock went way way up when Pokemon Go was successful.
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:27.360]   And then the stock market realized, oh, wait, they don't actually make all that much money
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.680]   of Nintendo doesn't make all that much money off of Pokemon Go.
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.120]   And then went down again.
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.240]   That was so funny.
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:36.320]   When there was a sell off like, OK, please don't please don't worry about what what was
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:41.440]   analysts say about the stock market because they are they have been in the they have been
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:46.560]   fighting this fight this fight deep in the jungle for so long that they know no law
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:51.440]   unto the law that allows them to keep living and fighting another day.
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:55.760]   But here's why here's why it's it is germane to the things we care about, which are
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:01.440]   technology, which Apple products and with her Apple and all that stuff only because
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.680]   any publicly held company kind of has to pay attention to a stock price because that's how
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:06.880]   you know, hire people.
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:12.160]   And Twitter is a good example because their struggles, they're making money, they're doing
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.960]   fine, but their struggles with the with the stock price are all about acquiring talent.
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:20.400]   A and B Apple, I think to a certain degree because of that.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:27.600]   Well, let me ask to what degree does Apple strategize and think about what it wants to do
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.160]   based on the market's response.
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:30.960]   Is that important?
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:38.000]   No, they've remembered that famously Tim Cook has told a stockholder meetings in the past.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.120]   Hey, look, you know, if you don't like we're friends with in their their programs that are
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.560]   basically human rights oriented saying, well, let's shouldn't be spending some of this money
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:50.400]   bend in the form of revenues. And he said, look, you know, if you know, if you want us to max,
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.400]   if you want to come, it's going to maximize profits and not let us do what we want to do.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.200]   You know, Apple may not be the right investment for you.
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.400]   And then he added that I think that there will be people who will be much very willing to take
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.440]   your stock off your hands. And that's pretty much how it went.
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:08.560]   I'm sure that if that is the sort of thing that you can say when you hold a hand with four
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:14.560]   races in it, if they were in, you know, Yahoo territory financially, you would say they would
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:19.600]   be saying, yes, shareholders, thank you shareholders. Please don't sell us off to to Nintendo shareholders.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:26.160]   But I don't think that they're terribly concerned about the stock price only in as much as the stock
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:30.160]   price doesn't restrict what they can do in the next two to five years.
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:35.760]   It seems also that they struggle to communicate with this stock market. Like they just don't know
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:39.680]   why the stock reacts the way that it does to Apple. And it makes sense from a certain,
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.560]   you know, from a certain school of investing, especially the one that's very focused on what
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:47.120]   can you do for me right now? And they thought, you were making billions on the iPhone and Wall Street
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:51.280]   said, man, don't really care. And then they tried the services like we're, no, we're doing services.
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:56.240]   It's not about the margins anymore. It's about raising the amount of money we're taking from
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:00.080]   each user, like the average revenue per user, which is a metric used in many other industries.
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:04.080]   And then last call, they kind of down-emphasized that, but they started emphasizing other things.
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.680]   And it seems like they're struggling to figure out a new narrative. The old narrative was just,
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.600]   we make the most popular product in the history of products and people are throwing money at us
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:16.400]   and Wall Street was great. But when that product starts to max out, they need a new narrative.
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.520]   And that's something they haven't found yet. I mean, we'll hear today whether they've got anyone.
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:23.920]   But it's something they are a little influenced then. I mean, if we're all,
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:29.920]   what Tim Cook's protestations, they do have to pay a little bit of attention to what the world
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:34.720]   thinks of them, at least the stock market. They got a board of directors. Yeah. And they have to
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:42.880]   acquire talent and retain it. Perception is, yeah, sure. I mean, I think when Steve Jobs was there,
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:50.240]   he probably was so bloody minded that he just did what he wanted. But it's not that way anymore.
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:55.520]   It's not really a benign dictatorship anymore. Is it? Yeah. Well, I think it is.
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:59.360]   It's just there's a different dictator and-- Is Tim Cook that as powerful?
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:07.920]   Oh, I am quite confident that he is. He's not as opinionated. He's a different kind of leader.
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:15.040]   He's not as-- He's clearly a very different personality type. And I'm sure that he runs a
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:21.040]   very different sort of organization. But I am quite certain that he's just as strong-willed
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:29.520]   an individual. And my guess is that Apple focuses on the fundamentals, and they know that if they do
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:36.160]   that, the investors will be happy. The big institutional investors will be happy.
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.080]   The stock market in general will be happy. And that's okay.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:46.320]   That's what you want a company to do. That's what you want a company to do exactly. And I think that
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:54.800]   Apple is a long-term buy. You don't buy some Apple and then plan on selling it again any
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:58.880]   time soon if you want to make any money because that's just not how it works.
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:06.320]   And in fact, I would get-- I agree with you, Rich. I think I would guess that Tim Cook is a buffer
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:12.880]   to the pressure because there's definitely pressure. There's lots of pressure from Carl
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:17.920]   Icon and people like that. But there's also just pressure in general. And I think Tim probably,
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:23.280]   I would guess he's his job as kind of the front man. He's going to take that and he's going to make
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:28.960]   sure that people behind him go, "Don't worry guys, get the job done. I'll take care of this."
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:33.120]   Look, you stand there. I'll stand here. It all comes down to comedy.
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:36.960]   Remember that famous Steve Jobs line? There was this really famous Steve Jobs line where he said,
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:40.560]   "We feel it. We take care of the top line and the bottom line will take care of itself."
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:44.400]   And that's the right way to run a company. I just see so many companies not doing that now.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.480]   Super reactionary. Yeah. And even companies that don't need to
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:56.240]   really don't need to becoming less customer focused-- and this is my biggest gripe about the
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:01.360]   technology industry right now. They've turned their eye from-- look at Microsoft with its upgrade
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:08.000]   to Windows 10 thing. That's not for customers. That has nothing to do with customer satisfaction.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.600]   That's Windows as a service. That has to do with reinventing the company for their own benefit
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:19.280]   and probably for the stock market because the stock price has been so sluggish. It's now going
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:24.960]   well. And I see a lot of companies doing that that pretend maybe to be customer first but aren't.
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:33.920]   And so I want Apple to stay that way. There's-- every company has to strike a balance between
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:41.520]   doing what they want to do, making their customers happy, but also doing things that really enhance
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:47.200]   their business plan. You could also make the same statement that Apple is not making low-cost
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:53.440]   computers or services that work for the masses or devices that work independently of Apple hardware
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:57.840]   because they are creating products that always will suit the bottom line. It would be really
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:02.240]   wonderful if I could use my iPhone with other services. It'd be really wonderful if I could use
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:09.760]   iMessage on other platforms. It would be really nice if I could afford a $400 MacBook or a
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:15.680]   really made-- well-made $600 MacBook or a Mac for education that's really super affordable.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:22.080]   But none of these are going to help out Apple make a lot of money and secure their independence
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:26.080]   and maintain their independence in the near future. So that's always going to be true of some to the
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:31.040]   other. I think that Apple has to their credit, they've stuck their neck out a lot farther
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:36.560]   further than other companies by saying, "Look, we are actually explicitly stating we are here to
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:42.080]   make the best products for customers that have ever been made." So if they were to totally screw
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:49.760]   something up, they look a lot worse than some no-name Korean phone manufacturer would if they created
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:54.080]   a fingerprint sensor that doesn't really work very well or a healthcare service that is not really
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:16:00.240]   very useful because the people will replay that wonderful keynote presentation which the very,
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:05.280]   very famous celebrity CEO said that we thought about everything about this and we know that
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:09.840]   this is how customers-- our users are going to want to use this and then when they get the said trombone
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:18.880]   after one week after release date, like, "Yeah, should also say that a company that does what it
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:25.280]   thinks is right may also ignore users, some categories of users as well. For instance,
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:29.920]   Apple seems to be turning away from the professional. That doesn't mean that that's a bad thing
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.240]   if they-- - Ford wouldn't make faster horses.
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:36.400]   - Right. Right. So I hate that analogy.
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:41.840]   - No, I love it because very few companies have focus and it hurts them long-term and you can argue
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:46.080]   that Apple has missed many opportunities and maybe hasn't served the public good when it comes to
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:50.800]   things like lower cost devices but it's very hard to state over the long period of Apple's existence
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:55.200]   that that focus has hurt them and saying no to those things I think is key to their culture and
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:59.520]   would potentially have benefited a lot of companies that were very quick to say yes and now are
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:04.880]   either shells or remnants of great companies pasts. - Well, you know, focus is all about saying,
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.400]   I'm sorry, Andy. - Saying no.
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.880]   - I know where you're going. - Focus is all about saying no and
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:15.840]   the other thing that I was going to say is that there really is a two-way relationship between
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:18.720]   what's good for the customer and what's good for the business.
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:24.560]   You know, I'm not going to second-guess Microsoft done doing whatever Microsoft does
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:33.440]   but there are times when you might push a new platform because you know in the long run it is
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:39.920]   best for the customer. You know, all of these people who are running Windows, XP, 7, Vista,
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:43.680]   it's like yeah, they really ought to be using Windows 10. - Yeah.
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:51.760]   - And are there questions about or reasonable objections to how Microsoft has undertaken to
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:59.360]   drive that adoption? Absolutely. But I'm not necessarily sure that it is entirely self-serving
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:06.400]   of them to do so. I think there are times when you say yes to the customer, you say no to the
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:13.680]   customer, you push the customer in a certain direction because ultimately that does fit with
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:17.840]   what you want to do as a business and that will benefit the customer. - A little tough love is not
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:22.880]   a bad thing. - Well, yeah, kind of sometimes. You got to be nice about it, but yeah. - Right.
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:28.960]   - My way of thinking about it is that if you want to be a great company or any great creator has to
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:32.240]   have a point of view and has to have an ability to express that point of view.
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:35.600]   An understanding of here is what I believe the world to be like and here is what I think.
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:40.080]   Here's what I'm going to create that is going to be completely relevant in that world as I see it.
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:44.720]   And so without that, you're just an assembler of components. You're not really a creator of things.
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:51.120]   The only thing that I hope that didn't come across earlier as being harsh against Apple is just that
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:59.600]   there are a few narratives that I find a little out of date and unhealthy for the Apple community
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:04.400]   and for Apple. And one of them is to think of Apple as a really special company that really isn't
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:10.160]   about XYZ. - Right. - They're really about creating great insanely great things and making
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:17.440]   customers happy. It's like, well, again, at the end of every thought list, it comes to, there's the
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:22.560]   phrase, and this will make us money. This will make us profitable. This will make us
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:27.680]   be successful, still be around in five years and still be able to do the things we want to do,
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:34.080]   as opposed to having to react with cat-like reactions to what we think the market demands.
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:39.040]   I think every other company that is operating at Apple's level, and there are many,
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:46.400]   is also doing yet that exact same thing. So that's the only thing that whenever we have
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:50.880]   there are these discussions, I always want to make sure this not that Apple is this holy
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:59.520]   acid-dropping ashram attending company that's elevated above all others, they have found a
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:05.680]   narrative, a point of view, that also is compatible with being nice to customers. And sometimes they
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:12.240]   give to customers right in the neck, ask anybody who was deeply invested in Apple products for 12
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:17.600]   years, and then it was decided that we actually don't really need you as a professional creative
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:26.720]   type anymore. So hey, have an Apple watch. We made exactly the Mac Pro you've been waiting for
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:31.680]   for four or five years. It's a cylinder that you can't really upgrade that much yourself.
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:36.240]   But hey, if you have a big desk, you can put all kinds of packs and cables and plugged into it
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:40.800]   instead of actually just buying the components and plugged in. But hey, look at the cylinder,
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:45.200]   that's what you wanted. Well, actually we don't care anymore. We don't care really.
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:50.160]   Yeah, that's what hurt me. That's what broke my heart. But again, I'm not the master of the
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:55.440]   market that they're going on. I did a big article on why Macs haven't been updated this year. And
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:21:00.160]   it's like a confluence of everything bad happening, with Skylake problems and pushbacks on different
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:05.120]   standards being implemented and they're waiting on AMD for some stuff. But other things, they
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:10.000]   could have updated the GPUs and the Mac Pros and pushed out new GPUs. And they've had the
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.520]   Haswell and Broadwell versions of Xeon that they just haven't. Maybe they didn't fit what they
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:18.960]   needed, but they didn't use them either. And now they're waiting on Skylake Xeon. So,
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:23.360]   I'm sure internally it makes all the sense in the world. But from outside, it's like,
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:26.400]   you made the supercomputer and you haven't updated it in four years.
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:29.600]   Well, there's a missing piece too, which we don't know, which is how many they've sold.
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:33.040]   Maybe they've sold 300. You need it anyway. This is one of those things
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:37.120]   I would want to do it. And I am, by the way, it is now back to being a doorstop. I'm an
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:39.520]   actually, I've found somebody who'll take it off my hands.
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:42.880]   But it's one of those things you do because you have to do it. It's like,
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:46.880]   I'm sure Lan Rigini doesn't make all the money in the world for his Volkswagen or BMW owns it.
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:51.120]   But you have to do it. You have to make the way. You make those supercomputers because it's
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:56.000]   part of your vision as a company. And then you update them because people are body.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.520]   Because it's part of your brand. It works more than it's part of your vision.
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:06.720]   But this is also an area where I really think that if Apple, if there's a cultural shift,
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:11.760]   I would love to see Apple do that if I were a full of myself,
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:17.280]   analyst who is being paid at least 30 times as more than why I'm being paid right now for my job,
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:21.920]   I would be saying things that I would like for Apple in the next five years to lose the
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:27.360]   lose the philosophy of secrecy being a forced multiplier. And I think that they're entering a
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:32.400]   phase where it's actually holding them back. There's no reason for them to say, here is our strategy,
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:38.240]   here's our plans for now for the pro line of Max. And here's what's going to be required for us
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:43.760]   to release the next wave as opposed to again, well, no, we're not going to release an update.
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:48.880]   Nope, not this year either. Well, no, another year, near gone by. It loves it. It basically gives
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:55.120]   people a lot of room to think, look, I now have, I now have a Mac book or I have a desktop that has
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:23:00.960]   had so many beverages spilled on it right now that I could just make it mounted vertically and turned
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:07.600]   into an amp farm. It is so broken up, I need to buy a new one. And so when you do that, that's,
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:15.760]   that's a danger if a company like like HP is making a really super great laptop. And Windows is now
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:21.520]   really, really very, very good and does some things that seem seem, I'm going to underscore the word
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:27.200]   seem fresh and innovative to someone who's been using the same operating system for the past 10
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:31.760]   years. And someone might say, you know, this $3,000 been burning in a hole in my pocket,
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:36.400]   I'm going to give it to this company over here because I'm actually using mostly Adobe and
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:40.880]   Microsoft software that runs on any platform that I want to use. I'm using cloud services that will
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:45.360]   work on either platform. Why am I waiting and waiting and waiting in the hopes that someday
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.240]   I will be able to give this money to Apple and get a computer and return.
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:54.240]   What are the expectations? Will there be any surprises this afternoon in their announcements?
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:59.280]   Will they make an announcement? A forward looking announcement about products. Will they take
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:03.120]   any advice and maybe operating systems will ship this fall?
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:09.200]   I was going to say it's an earnings call, right? Yeah, but sometimes they've used earnings calls
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:12.800]   as more than an earnings call. They know that they've announced shipment dates for like the
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:17.840]   announced the Mac OS 10 shipment date one year, yeah, several years. And they've also explained
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:21.520]   themselves sometimes in there, right? That's that's that's one point I was going to make the it's
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:26.000]   I don't think that the user should care that much about the numbers that are being they're being
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.360]   trumped because they're a lot there. Believe me, there are a lot of people who are waiting on both
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:35.440]   sides of the flag line. They're waiting to pounce by saying, Oh, well, you see so Apple sold a lot
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:39.840]   of Apple watches based on the hype. But look what the numbers say that after that after that
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:43.680]   or Apple people looking at another piece of numbers and saying, Oh, well, look how much we're
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:48.320]   kicking butt in in the phone space. None of those things really affect users at all. So you can
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:54.320]   ignore them. But it is one of the very, very few opportunities over the course of a year for a
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:59.120]   room full of analysts and reporters to ask a question of senior management and put them on the
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:06.480]   spot and they have to answer it. Other companies, they tend to do that quite frequently, both formally
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:12.560]   and informally. So oftentimes this is a good chance to see for people to ask questions that
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:17.520]   maybe aren't going to be in the next fortune magazine cover interview with Johnny Ive and
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:22.160]   Tim Cook. Well, if we stall along enough, we'll give these get the press release. But that only
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:25.120]   will have the numbers. Let me tell you why it was in the public chagrin with my director and
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:30.880]   that's too much. I see. Yeah. Andy, Andy, Andy, Andy, Andy, Andy, Andy, Andy, Andy, Andy, Andy,
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:36.080]   I have to put I have to put on the Mark Twain wig to get care. Hey, are you still
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:42.160]   entering the Hamilton lottery or is it all over now that Lin-Manuel Miranda and Fulla Sue and
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:46.400]   a chance to see it for 10 bucks? Heck, yes. Yeah. And I'm going to be in New York a few times in the
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:52.800]   great show. I mean, it's just it. Yeah. I would go see it. We're going to go see San Francisco.
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:56.400]   I'm sure it won't even be the current company is going to be great. It's going to be great.
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:00.960]   It's such a good show. I still listen to the soundtrack almost every morning. It gets me up,
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:04.720]   pumped up. It's an amazing driving. I drove to Ottawa this weekend. I just put it on and it gets
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:10.000]   you from Montreal to Ottawa perfectly. Yeah. By the way, that Tesla does have a great sound.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.920]   It's better than my better than that Audi. That sounds like a good drive fast. It makes me drive
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:20.000]   faster because it's so exciting. Have to be careful. It makes me, yes, it does. I am not throwing away
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:28.160]   my shot. I just I've got I've got 20 bucks to any company that will legally sell me a copy of the
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:38.720]   King George or King George songs. Transpose to baritone. I always say the cost of my love.
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:45.760]   I can sort of get there, but I can't I can't do the poncing sort of. I know. I know.
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:51.280]   And keep my voice and another register higher. It's Jonathan Graft sound so good.
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:54.720]   That must be so much fun. So much fun. Everyone else.
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:27:01.520]   You got you got a crown and a cape and you get three numbers for your. Yeah. And that's it.
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:05.440]   There is the time backstage. You don't have all those people in course. It's like dancing around
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:11.680]   you taking taking the spotlight off of you. And then he doesn't move at all except for the
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:15.920]   he does a little shoulders. It's so funny. Anyway, I'm sorry. How did that happen?
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:21.760]   Hey, at least this. Hey, folks, at least it's not Pokemon go. Our show is brought to you today
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:29.920]   by my doorbell, the ring video doorbell. You know, it's so it's funny how you get used to having
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:36.400]   this doorbell because I now know when anybody anybody comes and goes in my house, I will get
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:42.000]   a notification on my phone. They have a Mac app. You can see the videos of somebody coming and
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.600]   going when somebody rings your doorbell. You'll hear a chime. You can respond. The ring video
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:52.720]   doorbell has a microphone and speakers. It's amazing. I was just talking to Russell, our IT guy
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:59.040]   who uses it. He says, for me, I have a lot of, you know, he's an IT guy. He's a contract guy. He
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:02.800]   doesn't work for us. He's one of our contract employees. But he has a business and he gets a
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:07.520]   lot of deliveries, as you might expect every day. And he says, frequently, I'm not there. I'm out
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:12.320]   on the job. But I know when I'm on a job in my doorbell rings and I can then speak to the
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:16.480]   delivery guy, I could say, okay, just enter the code 0345 and put that inside the door.
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:24.000]   Just another great way to use the ring video doorbell. It replaces your existing doorbell.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:30.480]   It connects to the internet and it changes literally as a lot of these technologies do. It changes
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:35.360]   the way you experience life. Pretty soon you take it for granted. And, you know, there's no
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:39.200]   mystery. I know when people are coming, I know when people are going, I can see people in my drive.
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:47.760]   I never miss a delivery. I know when, you know, appointments arrive on time yesterday. We had a
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:53.040]   repairman who didn't show up. He was supposed to come, you know, from, you know, what they do 8 a.m.
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:57.840]   to 5 p.m. We couldn't be there the whole time. But I knew that when he came and rang the doorbell,
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:01.920]   I'd know he was there and I could say, hold on, I'll be right there. And then I also know he never
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:08.880]   showed up because he had never, I got a video of him not being there. So here's what you do. You
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:13.840]   get the ring video doorbell and your life will change. Go to ring.com/macbreak. They're putting
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:19.760]   together a really great kit. This is the Ring of Security bundle kit or the Pro bundle kit.
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:24.640]   It includes the Ring video doorbell. Now there's two of them now. There's the original which has a
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:30.080]   battery and that means it can go anywhere even if you don't have a wired doorbell. But if you do
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:33.760]   have a wired doorbell, you can get the new, the new Pro model is slimmer because it doesn't have
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:40.880]   the battery. It also has a 1080p camera instead of a 720p if you, if you've got a thing for that.
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:46.480]   You'll also get the stick up cam, which means it's kind of a bad name or maybe they do them
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:50.800]   for a bit. But instead of just monitoring the front, you can put the stick up cam anywhere,
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:56.080]   monitor the back as well. And just like the ring, it has a speaker and a microphone and a camera.
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:01.520]   And the stick up cam and the bundle comes with a solar charger so you don't even have to get
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:07.200]   power to it. It just works. You could put it anywhere attached to the solar panel and you're done.
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:13.600]   Boom. You'll also get the chime, which is nice. You can plug that into any outlet and it will ring
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:18.720]   when your doorbell rings. So if you have a part of the house or maybe a shed or a garage where
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:24.560]   that you can't hear the doorbell, this is a really nice thing. All of that $50 off at a great price,
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:31.040]   ring.com/macbreak. The HD stick up cam, by the way, is wireless and weatherproof.
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:36.640]   So you can put it anywhere and that's really handy. And by the way,
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:43.040]   both the doorbell and the cam have optional cloud video recording. So you can easily capture and
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:49.760]   share video with family, friends or should it be necessary law enforcement. The ring video,
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:56.720]   doorbell, the stick up cam, they install easily. I did it myself and I am no handyman and you get
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:02.960]   24/7 out monitoring now of your entire home, wherever you are anywhere, anywhere and at home

[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:30.720]   video doorbell for their support of Macbreak weekly. Andy Anaco from the Chicago Sun Times
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:37.280]   Renee Richie from iMore and our favorite developer, Rich Segal, he's at barebones.com.
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:46.480]   I think a new BB Ed update just came out recently, right? Am I wrong? We shipped BB Ed at 11.6
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:56.000]   earlier this month, but also just two hours ago. What? We shipped an upgrade to Tech Strangler.
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:02.640]   Now don't say Tech Strangler. It's it's pronounced Tech Strangler.
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:13.280]   No, not text. Not text. He writes text of us. Strangler.
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:19.040]   Strangler. Actually everybody, this is a free version of BB Ed. And everybody should have a
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:22.720]   copy of this. When I set up a new Mac, it's the first thing I download because you always need
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:29.440]   edit text. And text wrangler makes it so easy. I bought BDB Ed. Both because I want to and I
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:34.560]   boned it ever since probably BB Ed. Because I've always wanted to support Rich, but also because
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:39.920]   it has some really cool additional features. My favorite I mention at every time is the command
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:45.840]   line worksheets, which remind me so much of MPW. I miss the Macintosh programmers workshop. I just
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:54.240]   loved that. And this does what that did, which is I can execute command line commands and get the
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:33:00.400]   result in an in an editable worksheet, which is so cool. Execute people at a distance. At a distance.
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:07.520]   Kill. So there's a couple of things we did with the new releases in BB Ed at 11.6. We changed the
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:17.280]   evaluation demo model. If whatever you want, what do you care to call it? There's still a 30-day
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:25.360]   demo and the software is fully functional for those first 30 days. And after 30 days,
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:31.840]   in the old versions, we used to say, well, sorry, your demo's over. You can't start the app anymore.
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:40.240]   And with 11.6, what we did was instead say, OK, your demo's over. So you don't get all the advanced
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:46.560]   features anymore. But the core feature set that you get to keep after the evaluation period is over
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:53.680]   is a super set of what's in Text Wrangler. Nice. That's very nice. So get BB Ed at the note.
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:34:01.200]   That's where you go. So here's the thing, right? Text Wrangler is still our product. We're keeping
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:06.240]   it up to date. We're supporting our customers. But, and we know that there are some folks who just
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:10.720]   sort of want to stick with what they know. But we are encouraging everybody who has Text Wrangler
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:16.480]   or who's looking at Text Wrangler to grab BB Ed at and take a look at it because, yeah, at the end
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:23.920]   of the day, at the end of the demo period, sorry, the evaluation period, what you have is Text Wrangler
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:30.960]   plus a few things. And there is a comparison chart on our website. I'll find that and put it into
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:42.080]   Text that shows you the differences. Excellent. Excellent. I will put it up in a screen in a second.
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:47.200]   But that's cool. That's how you used to do it with BB Ed. Isn't it?
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:55.440]   Well, back in the day of the BB Ed at demo, in the very early days BB Ed, it couldn't save in the
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:35:02.480]   demo version. We actually had a separate build of the product. And then we went to license codes
[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:08.480]   in a 30-day evaluation period. And the software would simply stop. There you go. That's the one.
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:16.960]   And down below that, so that shows all the differences between Text Wrangler and BB Ed.
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:23.360]   And then if you scroll down some more, there's a much shorter chart that shows the differences
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:29.200]   between BB Ed in demo mode and Text Wrangler. So it's a super set, as you said, more things in
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:36.880]   the demo mode. Exactly. And the demo mode is free to use forever. There's no nagging. There's no
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:43.840]   interruptions. If you don't want to give us any money, you don't have to. I think that's smart.
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:48.560]   Obviously, we'd like you to-- Yeah. You're going to get more people using the full features of it
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:52.480]   and then make the decision that, oh, yeah, it's worth it. It is worth it. It's absolutely worth it
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:59.520]   pay for. Thank you, Rich. I don't know if you know the folks at SoftPress. They've been around
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:05.920]   almost as long as you have-- They do Freeway, Freeway Pro and Freeway Express. Yeah. So,
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:14.000]   maybe the chat room just sent me the note that they have stopped development. And I guess they're
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:20.640]   retiring. Rich Logan and Joe Billings, the end of SoftPress. I remember those guys from way back
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:30.080]   when-- 1993. Yeah. And I've met them at several Macworld expos. Remember that name?
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:40.960]   Another late lamented Macintosh stall. And it's a shame that they haven't been able to keep going,
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:48.720]   but yeah, I remember those guys. I remember those guys very well. I hope they find a comfortable
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:56.800]   retirement or whatever the next gig is. It's hard to stop doing this. I bet. But you continue to
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:01.360]   make a living, right? I mean, you're comfortable enough that you could continue to do this. Or is
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:09.440]   it getting harder? It's getting harder as I've gotten older. It's getting harder as the economy
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:18.400]   has changed and it's getting harder as the industry has changed. Is it always going to be easy? No.
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:26.080]   I mean, hoping it gets easier. Yes. But I still enjoy writing and shipping software. Right.
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:31.680]   As long as I am able to make a living doing it and as long as I continue to enjoy doing it,
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:37.040]   I'll keep doing it. Well, we hope you do. Love VB edit. And love having you part of the
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:41.280]   Macintosh community. More importantly. And we can just mail you money, right? Like--
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:47.280]   Yeah, we just said-- We had money. You know, if you don't need a license, just send us money.
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:51.680]   Or if you already got one, just, you know, gift it or send more. Right.
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:38:00.320]   So good news and bad news. The bad news is there was a significant flaw of vulnerability
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:10.320]   that's hit not only iOS, but OS 10, watch OS and TV OS. Interestingly, it was a similar vulnerability,
[00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:17.200]   the stage fright vulnerability, the hit Android. It's the media player on these would allow a
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:24.240]   malformed message coming in to do a remote code exploit and take over your computer.
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:28.960]   For real, I think it was iOS 1.2 or something where a TIFF could just jailbreak it for you.
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:31.360]   Yeah. Yeah, those are the days, weren't they?
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:36.080]   Well, I mean, these are the things they run so close to the kernel that any bug or anything can
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:39.520]   result in an overflow. It's not-- I don't think it's a complete coincidence that it's so similar
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:42.400]   to the stage fright bug. I think you're right. I think media players.
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:49.280]   Well, we've seen this in Microsoft Windows 2, the WMF, Windows Media Format files were causing,
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:54.960]   had the similar problem. We're in a malformed-- this is a problem because it's a data file.
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:58.560]   I think sometimes people go, "Oh, a data file's got to be safe. There's no executable in there."
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:03.520]   So-- but when a data file can take over your system, that's a scary thing.
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:05.920]   When you move it down because you want performance, then you--
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:06.480]   Right.
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:11.760]   Yeah. In this case, nothing to fear-- well, mostly nothing to fear because
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:18.240]   Cisco, the company that discovered this, warned Apple and did not make it public until Apple was
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:24.880]   able to patch it. I say mostly because they have patched all current versions of their operating
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:31.760]   systems, but that is El Capitan on desktop, but not Yosemite and Mavericks. Do they intend to,
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:37.680]   if they said? Or they just-- They have in the past. They've done it several versions back in the past,
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:41.440]   but to Andy's earlier point, they don't disclose which ones are going to update and win in advance.
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:48.640]   This would be one that'd be nice. But this is where taking care of the customer is like a holistic
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:55.920]   sort of approach to Apple, where it's the same sort of threat that you find on other platforms,
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:40:03.360]   but its target is-- its threat is much less on Apple products because they really have created
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:09.440]   a culture where we are going to make it so damn attractive and easy for you to install every single
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:17.120]   system update by making them free, by making them only disable your phone for 10 minutes if that,
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:21.920]   to make sure that they are-- so they download in the background so that if,
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:28.720]   whereas it's a really big deal to get your dad or your aunt to say, you're running,
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:37.520]   not just XP, you're running XP without any security service packs. I can fix that for you so that
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:46.080]   you don't lose your house another three times by just-- and whereas this is culture in the Apple
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:50.880]   community of it just happens that way. So, but these are terrible because remember these are--
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:55.920]   also it takes advantage of the fact that operating systems tend to trust things that it doesn't
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:41:00.800]   think there's going to be code in. So, like a messaging app tend to say, "Oh, well, I can help
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:07.440]   the user buy-- here comes an image file. I will actually download that. I won't ask the user if
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:11.600]   they want to put it. I'll actually put it in the buffer automatically so that it loads in automatically
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:15.200]   and that's without even having to tap anything without having to do anything. That's how you get
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:21.680]   infected. That's how you get it, get the wound." So, as with stage fright in the WMF problem,
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:29.760]   a malformed data file, an image could trigger a buffer overflow and allow-- again, we should
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:35.680]   emphasize this has not been seen in the wild, although now that it's been revealed, that may change,
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:41.200]   but could allow an attacker to inject malware or remotely execute code. And since it's a media
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:47.680]   player, it is not just messages, but malicious web pages, MMS messages, other malicious file
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:52.800]   attachments opened by any application. Somebody could send you a TIFF or a bitmap in your email,
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:59.280]   and if you opened it, it's a similar problem. It does underscore the ability of Apple to update.
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:05.440]   And by the way, if you haven't updated the July 18th update for OS X fixes this,
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:11.280]   in fact, that was-- they did an update for everything. We saw that and we thought, "Oh, that's
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:15.120]   interesting. They updated everything. Well, now you know why." Yeah, it's a shared framework
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:18.560]   thing. I mean, they're using so much technology across their entire stack now that if you find it
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:22.560]   in one, it's almost-- well, it's a high likelihood you'll find it in a lot of them. Yeah, yeah.
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:29.120]   It sort of makes a-- gets an interesting angle to the fact that every single device that Apple
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:34.320]   makes in the next year is going to be running on the same unified file system and security system.
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:37.760]   It kind of ups the stakes for them to make sure that there are no vulnerabilities,
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:42.800]   because the idea of owning not just a phone, but if you found a vulnerability that can,
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:47.920]   in effect, not just one device, but the entire platform of devices that might be in someone's house,
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:54.160]   that's super bad. Yeah. And it does underscore the difference between Android and iOS and Android
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:58.880]   in Macintosh in general is that Apple people tend to update and Apple has the ability to push those
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:05.680]   updates. Stage fright is still an issue on older Android phones, because unless the manufacturer or
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:12.160]   the carrier pushes it, Google has no ability to force it on them. Yeah. And it's-- it's-- it's
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:18.400]   several layers deep, because not only that, but it has to be tailored for every chipset and multiple
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:24.000]   chipsets in each device. So there are times where if you really get the bad straw, you can wait a
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.800]   year and a half for a really valuable update to happen. Although Google's been trying to address
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:34.800]   that by splitting out security updates away from mainline Android updates, it's still a huge
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:40.640]   problem. It's one of the reasons why it would take a really great phone for me to not buy a Nexus
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:44.720]   phone. I really want a phone that gets updated directly from Google that Google can control.
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:50.080]   It will continue to be a big problem until there's a revolution in the way that Google architects
[00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:54.160]   these devices. And the important thing to think too, like the-- there was a jailbreak release this
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:58.960]   week. I think it's for 9.3 and 9.3.2, but those involve exploits. Someone found a way,
[00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:02.640]   probably many, many exploits, because they had to go through a circuitous pass to get there,
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:06.080]   but there's another jailbreak, an Apple will patch that as well, and they'll go back to trying to find
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:12.080]   more exploits, not to disclose to Apple or to use for attacks, but just to get jailbreak to keep working.
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:16.640]   And that's sort of the nature of modern software, is that people continuously pushing against it,
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:20.720]   find things, disclose them, or Apple discovers them in the wild and patches them.
[00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:27.200]   So just so you know, the two issues are in core graphics, and that's a CVE-2016-4637.
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:31.920]   That's been patched for Mavericks Yosemite and El Capitan, but there's another one
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:40.960]   that is in the image I/O-- let me say that's image I/O 4629 and 4630. Actually, there's several, and
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:46.320]   then there's another one in image I/O that's 4631. That's the one that has only been patched in El
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:54.480]   Capitan. So, you know, they have been-- it looks like they're trying to patch it as widely as they
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:45:01.360]   can, and for some reason, this particular issue 4631 has only been patched in El Capitan. I'm not
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:06.640]   sure what that is all about, but that's why it's probably a good idea to update if you are running
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:10.160]   its other version and get to El Capitan. I--
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:12.560]   Free, and it works on every Mac that the previous version works on.
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:19.680]   And you've often heard us carp about do not do not run beta software on something that you're
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:25.680]   going to be counting on. And even when the new operating system is actually released, wait at
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:29.200]   least a few weeks if you don't necessarily have to run it right now, just in case there are final
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:35.600]   bugs. When it comes to security updates like this, go ahead. The whatever minimal risk that
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:39.040]   there's something that's going to happen to your phone is far, far, far outweighed by the
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:42.720]   protection you're going to get from something that Apple deems so bad that they pushed out a
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:47.680]   special security update to address it. So definitely don't do it in any security update that comes out.
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:53.680]   Yeah. Security updates, maintenance patches, anything after the initial release. Yeah, I
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:46:00.240]   am with you, Andy. And I agree, I'm reinforced the point. Keep up to date, keep patched.
[00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:05.920]   For everything. Everything you can. Yeah. One of the things Google has done to address that on
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:12.400]   Android is they have a monthly security update. But again, they can't force manufacturers and
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:17.840]   carriers to push it. So if you're buying a Google phone, an Android phone, you absolutely should
[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:24.960]   check to see if they will support the monthly security updates. And Samsung does and Motorola does,
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:31.200]   LG does, the big ones do. But if they don't, in fact, that's one of the issues I have with
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:36.960]   this OnePlus 3, as much as I like it, they have not yet said they're going to support the monthly
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:42.880]   update. You have to factor customer service and ongoing updates as part of the price of a phone.
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:46.320]   So when you're looking at phones and you're comparing them, if something is $100 cheaper,
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:49.680]   but you know that phone is going to be updated all the time. And if you drop it, it'll be a place
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:53.680]   for you to call. And if you have a software issue or a bug, they'll be a place for you to like,
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:57.600]   a friend of mine just RMA to phone. And it was not a good experience. They have to mail it back.
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:01.280]   And a few, they'll check it once they mail it back. And after a while, they'll send it. They
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:04.080]   maybe if they agree to it, they'll send it. And it's going to be like three or four weeks without
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:09.280]   a phone. Yeah, it doesn't work. Yeah. And that you, and he, because he saved a few bucks up
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:13.360]   front, but he would have been better off going with a Nexus or a phone. And that's one, by the way,
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:19.760]   place where I think I fail and a lot of tech reviewers fail is that is we did that's not
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:24.320]   something we test very often. You know, what happens if you have to do an RMA? What kind of
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:28.640]   support are you going to get? It's hard for us to test. And we don't spend enough time with the
[00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:32.480]   phones. And often, you know, don't have enough problems with the phones that we experience what
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:38.560]   support is like. Yeah, I had a hysterically funny experience on that same day that I was in town.
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:47.280]   A wonderful, wonderful lyric tenor who calls himself the Boston tenor. But he's a perfect,
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:51.360]   I had a little clip of him on my Instagram. Yeah, he was doing this beautiful concert,
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:55.280]   like in front of in front of Boston Public Library, which has sort of like a natural sort of amphitheater
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:48:00.000]   effect. And he's under a big umbrella that he brought. And he has a clip to the pole of the
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:06.400]   umbrella, a Lenovo tablet that's got his music and his lyrics on it. And he's singing these
[00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:11.120]   beautiful Neapolitan songs as a warm up. And then like he says to stop in the middle,
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:18.000]   I say, dang it. That's it. Everybody don't file a Lenovo tablet. I broke that last week, a couple
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:22.480]   weeks ago, and I sent it in to be fixed. And I'm still using a loner that doesn't work properly.
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:28.320]   Well, I'm, you know, one good thing about being a little bit on the front line, like doing the
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:34.080]   radio show and stuff, I get user reports, you know. So I try to pay attention. And that's one reason,
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:38.960]   you know, you're safer with Apple in general, because they really do support their stuff. I mean,
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:45.440]   not nobody's perfect. But I think you do have to measure one one massive and the important measure
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:51.040]   of a technology company. Nobody makes perfect stuff. It's what happens when you get the bad
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:56.240]   seed and what they do. And Apple almost always does a good job at that better than any.
[00:48:56.240 --> 00:49:01.280]   I told this story before, but I my iPhone 4s got hit by fireworks and it melted the
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:05.120]   alphabet coating on the screen. And I took it in and the guy behind the counter looked at and he
[00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:08.560]   said, what happened? And I told him, I said, he took my iPhone heroically jumped in front of me
[00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:13.760]   and saved me from being hit by fireworks. But now it feels like sandpaper. And he gave me a
[00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:19.280]   very stern lecture about you really need to take better care of your your your devices, but then
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:23.840]   just replaced it gave me a new phone. I put in my iCloud stuff and I left with a virtually identical
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:27.520]   version of my phone half an hour later. And that was not Apple's fault. That's really nice.
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:33.600]   Yeah, they're obviously a great many variables to choosing a choosing a device. But one thing that's
[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:39.040]   always going to be in Apple's favor is someplace within the 10 minute drive or 30 minute bus ride.
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:44.800]   There is a nice person behind a desk who will who will look at the thing that broke and either
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:49.680]   fix it for you under warranty for free or again, give you a little bit of a lecture, but then say,
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:54.400]   we're awesome. So we're going to replace this. And other companies other companies are great too.
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:50:00.080]   I mean, I buy a lot of electronics that I test on eBay as a matter of fact, and 30 days send it back.
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:05.120]   They'll give your money back. That's fine. But you can't beat the Apple logo that you drive by
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:10.240]   pretty much three times a week just on your daily business and knowing that again, if things go
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:15.760]   really south, I can I can request sanctuary there at Notre Dame and they will take me in and give me
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:22.400]   cocoa. There is a long time attitude of this in the in the kind of the business or the higher end
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:25.520]   of the IT marketplace. You know, I just got this free BSD
[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:32.320]   desktop from a company called ABMX. This is what they do. And I was really impressed. This is the
[00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:38.560]   QA certificate that comes with it that shows that they've gone through every subsystem and
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:44.560]   and you know, inspected it. And there's a person's name by hand. And there's a person's name. And I
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:48.640]   think, you know, that's kind of a little more of the expectation in the business class and then
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:53.840]   server class stuff, the consumer class stuff. But it but it yeah, it is an exclusive to Apple.
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:59.200]   It's still out there. But boy, you got to really you really have to look for it. Don't you know,
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:02.000]   Apple will do it for you. Hey, let's take a break. We're coming back with more.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:09.440]   Renee Richie's here from imore.com, the host of the debug podcast. What else are you doing these days?
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:16.240]   Oh, Apple talk with Michael Gartenberg. I'm enjoying a lot. Yeah, it's going really well. Good.
[00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:20.640]   You must listen, go to imore.com on the left. There's a hamburger menu. You'll find
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:25.760]   the five podcasts right there. And they're all great. Really. I'm more. Thank you.
[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:31.760]   Just it's really I don't did you guys intentionally do a makeover or just kind of has evolved over
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:37.200]   time because it's really just so good. We decided a couple of years ago that the technology was going
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:41.120]   mainstream. Like it used to just be us early adopters who would grab, you know, technology and
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:45.280]   and play with it. But now it's it's totally mainstream. Like my entire family has iPhones and
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:49.680]   their interests are not the same as a typical tech person's interest. Like as much as we make
[00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:54.240]   fun of Pokemon, there's just so many people playing it and using Snapchat and Facebook is the
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:59.440]   Internet to a lot of people. And we pivoted hard into trying to sort like if your device is busted,
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:02.720]   we want to help you solve fix it. If you bought an iPhone, I don't know what to do with it. We want
[00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:06.640]   to help you get the most out of it. Right. And we're going to in the short term, we're going to be
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:10.560]   going much further into that. I think you'll see many more changes in relatively short order.
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:14.240]   It's always a challenge, you know, because I like serving the enthusiasts, the hardcore geek,
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:21.440]   but you still there are so you have to have an entry level, you know, because nobody starts that
[00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:26.960]   way. And you want them and and frankly, hardcore geeks don't need as much help. I just happen to
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:33.280]   like that group. So it's nice to it's nice to have somewhere you could say, I'll go to go to iMore,
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:38.400]   they're going to have all the explainers for you. And I do that more and more on the radio show. I
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:43.840]   will refer people to a website where they can learn the basics because people need to learn that,
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:48.160]   you know, we had one guy write in and said, you know, I work in enterprise and I'm so angry at Apple
[00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:52.800]   because I have to wait two minutes for my iPhone to turn off. Can't they just put a button on the
[00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:57.040]   phone that turns it off and you very nicely right back and go that little button on the side there.
[00:52:57.040 --> 00:53:00.960]   And they're like, Oh, I'm so embarrassed. But they're they're not dumb people. I mean, they have really
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:04.800]   good. They just don't know, right, because they've never thought about it. No one ever told them.
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:08.080]   Or like my father didn't know to email photographs. Like he just didn't know you could email them
[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:12.560]   off the iPhone and he's he was an IBM engineer back when they were installing early railroad and
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:16.400]   and airport systems. But he didn't know which little button you pressed and what you did. And
[00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:21.120]   so I showed him and now he emails me photos every day. Yeah, I just a ton of that stuff. Yeah,
[00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:27.120]   absolutely. Basically. Yeah. And also any not go from the Chicago Sun times where he writes about
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:37.280]   technology for the middle American. The backbone of America. The common the common
[00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:43.600]   broad shoulder man. Yes. Here you go. He also you got to follow any social accounts,
[00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:48.560]   particularly his Instagram and Flickr accounts because I love your images. And I you know,
[00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:53.360]   it's you're a great contributor to my Instagram feed. Things like that tenor and I just love
[00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:58.400]   running across that stuff. Yeah, I mean, I was fortunately I see I'd seen them before,
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:03.440]   but only when I had like just my phone and this time I was doing like a lot of photography. So
[00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:08.000]   I had like all my lenses. I have my good camera. I have a tripod. And I'm like, you know what?
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:12.560]   I had other things to do before meeting someone for lunch, but I'm just going to shoot video of
[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:17.040]   this lovely counter. Isn't that awesome? That's so was a fun that was a fun day.
[00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:23.040]   Our show today brought to you by Harry's now maybe you heard that those other guys just got bought
[00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:29.520]   by the big company for a lot of money. Maybe it's time to start looking at Harry's Harry's
[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:36.800]   is changing the razor blade industry. And I and I'm really happy to be not only Harry's
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:43.440]   advertiser, but a Harry's customer. Harry's makes high quality high performance blades in their own
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:48.720]   factory in Germany. They're designed for performance. They're designed for style, but they're also
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:54.480]   designed for price. They have the of course every feature that you want the flex hinge and the
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:55:00.560]   allolubricating strip. But you're also going to save it's 50% less than the other brands.
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:05.920]   And because because you're buying Harry's factory direct, they go right to your doorstep.
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:10.640]   I love Harry's and I'm not alone. A million guys have moved to Harry's. I just got the new
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:15.360]   and I just used it this morning. I love it. The new Harry's handles. They've got some great ones.
[00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:20.240]   I don't know what one is in here. This is the Harry's Truman kit. Yeah, this is the really nice
[00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:25.840]   soft touch handle in the Harry's Truman kit. Really a comfort. It's hard to describe. You
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:32.160]   got to try it. What's nice about this is this is a $15 kind of get started with Harry's kit,
[00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:38.240]   but they don't give you like sample size stuff for 15 bucks you get the of course the handle.
[00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:42.720]   You get three blades. You get the great and by the way, they're not shipping the blades in these
[00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:49.840]   great kind of reusable blade covers plus the travel cover, which is fabulous and a full size.
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:55.440]   Not sample size. Bottle of either they're foaming shave gel or their cream. I use the cream.
[00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:59.040]   A lot of guys I know like the foaming shave gels kind of like the edge gel.
[00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:04.480]   Find that lubricates better. You pick the one you want, but get the kit because that'll get you
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:08.880]   started. Then you subscribe and you'll get and you they ask you how often you shave and they'll send
[00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:14.640]   you the blades and the and the gel at appropriate interval. You don't have to worry about it. It's
[00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:18.480]   a subscription. So it just keeps coming easy to cancel. Don't worry. It's not going to be some
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:21.680]   sort of thing that you're locked into for life, but I don't think you're going to want to change.
[00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:26.640]   Now that's $15. If you want to spend a little bit more, they've got the new Winston handle.
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:33.200]   And I think this is awesome. The Winston set is $10 more, 25 bucks. The handle now has grippies
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:37.360]   on the metal. It's really kind of a best of both worlds. A beautiful beautiful handle, but the
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:43.120]   grippies make it easy to hold, easy to shave. Harry's is always improving and their customer
[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:48.800]   service is the best in the business. Check out the Harry's Winston set or the Truman set.
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:53.760]   Don't forget they have other products too. I use their lightweight daily face lotion with SPF
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:58.880]   15 every morning because I'm walking in. Got to protect. Got to protect the skin hydrate.
[00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:06.480]   Get the sunscreen. I added that to my subscription too. So I never run out. Why pay $32 for eight
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:12.160]   razor blades when you can get them for half the price and great blades too. No compromised blades.
[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:19.360]   Harry's go to h r r y s dot com slash Mac breaking at $5 off your first purchase.
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:29.600]   H a r r y Harry's dot com slash Mac break to save $5 off your first order. The best shaving
[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:37.200]   experience you've ever had. Harry's I was looking I look periodically at the
[00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:45.520]   the when to buy guide from Mac rumors, you know, because they kind of base it on. Well, when do we
[00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:52.080]   see when do we see a, you know, an iPhone update or caution on the iPod shuffle? I don't know what
[00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:58.720]   the hell that means. Yeah. Yeah. Don't don't buy an iPod right now. But I was looking more at the
[00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:02.880]   Mac because we know, you know, we know you you should worry because not worry, but you should
[00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:08.160]   maybe wait two months to see what the iPhone is going to be. But we don't have a schedule for
[00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:13.520]   the Macs. They say it's okay to buy a Mac book because that was just updated. But it's read
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:22.400]   on every other form of Mac because it's been a while. And and the rumors are strong that there
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:30.800]   will be a new Mac book pro Renee. What do you think it's so if you look at WWDC last year,
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:36.000]   I don't you know, everyone probably knows this already, but the Apple TV was supposed to debut
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:40.160]   there. And then it got pushed back to September. So they had this huge slot to fill. And we know
[00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:45.680]   what happened with that WWDC this year, the Mac book pros and maybe some other stuff were
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:49.680]   tentatively scheduled for the same time period. And it sounds like those also, you know, for various
[00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:54.640]   reasons. And with Macs, Apple is incredibly tied to the Intel roadmap. And in some cases to the AMD
[00:58:54.640 --> 00:59:01.520]   roadmap as well, those had to be rescheduled for September. So Mac book pros, I think, are certain
[00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:08.080]   the Mac pros, if Apple skips the Haswell, sorry, the Broadwell version of Zion and goes with Skylake,
[00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:12.080]   I'm not exactly sure what Intel's timeline is for that the Haswell ones are the Broadwell ones
[00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:17.280]   already here. Sorry. The Skylake ones. I don't know if we if that timeline matches up, but hopefully
[00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:21.920]   it does because we've been waiting so long for them. But I think that will come when when Skylake
[00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:26.800]   Zions are available. Skylake is the current one, although Katie, like is imminent now.
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:31.200]   Well, Zion is different though. So Zion is always different behind. Yeah, the mainstream core
[00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:37.360]   architecture. So but that's also the case, you know, when you're using something like a Mac Pro,
[00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:43.280]   that you don't necessarily need or even want Skylake architecture, I don't know if there's a real
[00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:50.240]   benefit to that. I just bought an E3 because it's very fast. And I don't need many of the like
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:55.200]   battery saving features of Skylake obviously on a day. I mean, there are some benefits.
[00:59:55.200 --> 01:00:00.240]   It also depends on your workflow. More if your workflow is super is super multi core,
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:04.480]   then you're more insulated because it's just the gross number of cores that you're that you're using.
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:08.000]   If you really need those single threaded processors, then there's probably all sorts of memory
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.840]   management and other things that will give you and it sounds silly, you know, to announce like to
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:15.440]   to a regular consumer. Oh, it's a few seconds here, a few seconds there, but to someone who's
[01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:19.600]   compiling code or editing video, all of that is just money. They're losing while they're waiting
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:24.320]   for a defendant. Yeah. Yeah. The other big deal is that some people don't have the luxury of being
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:29.200]   able to wait. Like they've broken their they've broken their laptop and they need a laptop or
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:33.520]   they have waited three or four years and they wouldn't they the reason why they've been waiting
[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:39.280]   is that they want they want the force touch trackpad or they want a retina display or they want
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:43.600]   something that's they want something special as opposed to something that's currently shipping.
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:47.520]   And at some point, you just have to buy what's there and you will you would have wished that you
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:53.760]   had an imperfect machine that had been updated four months ago rather than okay, I'm going to
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:01:01.200]   buy essentially the Mac that I bought three and a half years ago and knowing that any day now,
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:05.280]   they really aren't going to have to release something. Yeah. I mean, I bet again,
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:14.000]   to keep punishing myself for my for pouring Dr. Pepper into my laptop, I had I broke my laptop
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.720]   my Mac book in November, November, I just had to go out and buy a brand new one. Fortunately,
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:23.600]   it had been sort of recently revved and the fact in just two years had made a huge drift
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:27.280]   difference in what a Mac book could do. But there are a lot of people who are in that situation where
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:34.960]   it just calls you that you're buying essentially the same machine that you bought three years ago
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:42.720]   with a few speed bumps to it when you know that somewhere under a tarp in some part of the industrial
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:47.680]   park that no one knows at Apple Zones, there is the most amazing laptop ever that's just waiting for
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:54.800]   as Renee says, Intel to deliver in an envelope a little piece of sand this big plug it in and then
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:59.200]   they can actually go and ship it. So what do we some cases it's hard to like the 21 inch
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:04.800]   21.5 inch iMac. I think Intel is just discontinuing that chip line last I heard and so it's unclear
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:08.880]   what comes next for that. Do they do they go with the 27 is chip line? Do they find an alternative?
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:14.640]   Those things happen when you're dependent on other people's core. The iMac isn't as aged. I mean,
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:19.920]   it was updated in October. Yeah, but it wasn't completely updated. They couldn't do Skylake for
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:25.200]   the 2.21.5 because it wasn't available and it looks like it's not going to be available. Yeah.
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:29.120]   Yeah. And remember that if people think that it's just about waiting for all who cares,
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:34.000]   it's a little bit faster. Remember that one of the reasons why Apple was so far behind the
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:40.240]   rest of the industry in adopting USB 3 was because they can't just simply buy the USB 3 box and
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:44.320]   glue it onto the motherboard. Really all it's all everything is built together. They were waiting
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:52.640]   for certain CPUs that built that had USB 3 support built in for at the core level. So that's what
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:58.880]   was holding them back. And it really does put pressure on Apple to think about are we happy with
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:04.880]   still counting on an outside company having such control over what our game plan can be for desk
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:09.280]   tops and for notebooks. And the 15 inch MacBook Pro didn't get the same update that the 13 inch
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:12.880]   because I believe the other way around because the iris graphics weren't available and took
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:17.440]   another month or two but Apple had shipped by then. So it just missed that cycle. Yeah.
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:23.920]   It's almost like a system on a chip at this point. It's like you know. Yeah. And it is
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:29.440]   noticeable that Apple is not quite in lockstep within tell the way they used to be. And I suppose
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:37.680]   there's all kinds of teatly teatly reading you could do there. But it's hard. It's really hard
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:45.760]   to know what's going on. Yeah. KB lakes until begins shipping first KB lake processors but most
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:53.200]   Macs won't receive them until next year according to see any you know the Zions. The Zions and Mac
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:59.200]   pros are great. But one sort of has to wonder whether Apple might stop trying to do that anymore
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:04.400]   and just put the fastest possible I seven they can in that box. But you want cores right. You
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:08.400]   want multiple cores. I mean the people who use pros isn't that one of the things they're looking
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:16.960]   for is more cores 20 cores. I don't know. You know 64 cores seems kind of all waiting. Yeah.
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:23.920]   64 65 whatever it takes. So this BSD box I bought I thinking I had to decide what processor.
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:30.000]   I think I will I ever need more than four 3.6 gigahertz processors in a box. No.
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:36.640]   But I'm not doing rendering. You're right. I mean I'm not you know I'm but so you have to
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:41.840]   consider your you bought a Tesla with a ludicrous mode though. No I did not buy ludicrous mode.
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:48.240]   Only insane. If you push it off the top of the parking structure it gets into ludicrous mode.
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:51.840]   Just wait until ridiculous mode chips. Yeah skip a generation. No they're going to do
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:56.160]   ridiculous. It was first it was insane that it was ludicrous. What's next it's got to be
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:05:02.960]   ridiculous. I'm actually most interested in a believe it or not in a MacBook Pro. And that's one that
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:09.440]   really is super annuated. I mean it's been since last spring of last year since they updated. Well
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:13.840]   I mean again like Skylake was tough and then do you just keep bumping the MacBook with a like
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:18.080]   with a small spec bump when everyone else in the industry is pretty much caught up design wise and
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:21.600]   and spec wise you do try to do something really interesting with it which is what it sounds like
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:26.320]   Apple's doing and then you're also you're depend. Skylake was not easy for Intel. It was a huge it
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:31.680]   was so hard. They're doing tick tock talk with Kaby Lake for the first time. So you're dealing
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:35.120]   with Intel there too but also you're thinking what can we do that make the Mac Pro really stand out
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:40.320]   again because there's a sea of lookalike laptops now and you know an Apple sort of has these expectations
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:44.720]   for it. So whether it's the OLED strip or it's something else all of that has to line up as well
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:48.240]   and or if it's the graphics that they want to put in it so that it gets a kind of performance they
[01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:52.960]   want all of that has to be ready at one time and we still joke that you know it's a miracle that
[01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:57.440]   the iPhone ships every year when it's supposed to ship because there's so many moving parts from
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:01.680]   the chips as to the manufacturing to the case design to the build to getting everything online
[01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:04.960]   but it but it really really is it's like that joke about it's a miracle that Windows boots up
[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:08.720]   on all these different machines every day and Microsoft deserves endless praise for that but
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:13.360]   once in a while those things don't line up and then wow it's hard you wait 16 months for an iPhone
[01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:19.440]   4s or you wait 18 months for a MacBook Pro. There's a lot of intriguing things going on with the
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:25.280]   next MacBook I honestly had I known in November when I again replaced my MacBook had I known
[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:33.200]   number one how absolutely in love I would be with my 12.9 inch iPad Pro and had I known more about
[01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:38.320]   what seems likely for the next MacBook I might have decided to tough it out for a year and waited
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:44.000]   to pick up the new model. No you had you couldn't you spilled soda pop into it. No but I would have
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.400]   I would have said well just like again you know last year it looked like I was gonna be without
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:54.160]   a car for a month or two and then I said okay well let's see how I'll just get out until I find
[01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:58.320]   like another car that I want to buy and I still haven't bought another car because it turns out
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:03.120]   that I'm it's been a real plus to my life to not have a car and to find other ways of getting around
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:07.680]   that because I didn't need it at all because my life had changed since the last time that I bought
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:11.600]   a car it would it would have been an interesting experiment to say that it's going to kind of
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:17.440]   stink on some levels to use an iPad again realize that at this point I had not been like using I'd
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:22.560]   only been using it for what a month or two and I think there would have been an interesting
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:28.960]   experiment for the year that I it probably would take for the next Mac where to come out to see if
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:34.560]   maybe by September I'd realize that you know what maybe I don't actually I was I was smart to wait
[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:38.560]   for this this was a really I'd be whole I'll be at the event holding it thing that's really that's
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:42.800]   really cool a device but you know what the past year has taught me that what I really want is a
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:49.680]   maxed out I'm a really what I really want is a maxed out Mac mini for my desktop oh the mini's
[01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:56.640]   really old well but the mini's like two years old isn't it let's just see October 2014 has never
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:02.560]   been a really yearly updated product I've also never lied fallow for this long either but but but
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:05.920]   the point of getting it is that I was actually looking at now I'm not serious the thing about
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:10.240]   buying a Mac new Mac mini anytime in the immediate future but I was thinking about again if I were
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:15.520]   in that situation I would be the Mac book specked out the way that I need it would be about
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:19.680]   twenty two twenty three hundred dollars is about what I spent for for the one I'm using right now
[01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:27.520]   I could spec out a Mac mini to the same standards for about seven or eight hundred dollars less
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:33.680]   I'm using the iPad Pro so much that actually if I if I were to turn around Korean Camnet
[01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:39.760]   3000 future video podcasting you could see that it's basically it's got it's now a desktop machine
[01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:45.040]   mostly only I only ever unplug it that's what Apple wants really that's where Apple that's why
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:49.440]   Apple I think that's why they're not paying attention though that's the other hardware they want you
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:56.880]   to use the pro that well I also think part of it is that they know that if if a customer comes in
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:01.520]   and says you know what I should just buy on the via knock I should buy or I should buy like that's
[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:07.040]   what I did I bought a knock yep and they're willing to say I'm sure you're willing to buy
[01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:12.320]   all new software and learn a brand new operating system or actually you know we're sorry we know
[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:17.120]   that you can go on buy a Mac from competing many for oh wait you can't because we're the only one
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:21.920]   to make one I guess then we're not gonna rush and make a Mac mini that's updated until we feel as
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:25.760]   though we want to do that the only reason really we're talking about all this stuff is because
[01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:31.120]   everybody else is putting out new phones every month and new new laptops every month and every
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:37.200]   I mean you see all this ferment and Apple I mean really truthfully you probably don't need a new
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:45.040]   5k iMac if you have the latest one you don't need it oh it's I mean I know you want to buy one but
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:52.160]   they're fast enough come on it's tough because it is Apple against everybody else so it is actually
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:57.520]   true that every month or so there is a new major phone that comes out and so you don't necessarily
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:02.960]   have to wait until September when you find a phone that you fall in love with if you decide that this
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:09.920]   idea of Motorola making of just having a pogo pogo studs on the back of the case you can either
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:14.880]   cover up with the color of your choice or you can add a hardware expansion to it to either give
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:20.320]   it more battery or give it a better camera that's really great and I think I'd rather buy that right
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:25.520]   now than wait for an iPhone 7 or 8 months later and for each one who's considering a phone like
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:29.520]   that there's another new phone coming out next month that might side this is there was a hole in
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:36.320]   my heart exactly the shape of the Samsung Galaxy Note the new version with the super curved screen
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:43.120]   so it's Apple it's both a opportunity for Apple to say that well you know you're not going to just
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:48.000]   you're not going to go switch to Android or switch to Windows just because you're impatient to wait
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:54.240]   for a new device on the other hand it also means that they really have to make super super good
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:59.280]   choices for the few machines that they make because if they are behind it they're every
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:04.160]   every company can gamble their company on what kind of what kind of feature for a phone is going to
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:09.360]   be important to people next year Apple has to decide we have exactly two rolls of the dice maybe three
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:15.040]   in a really really productive year we can't really serve everybody and it's then they
[01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:20.400]   were asked Android can serve everybody and still be profitable crazy question do you guys call
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:26.960]   corn dogs pogo's in the u.s as well never heard because every time you're pogo's I think a corn
[01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:30.720]   dogs because that's the brand here so I get really hungry when they talk about new android phones
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:35.600]   what do you call chocolate jimmies we don't have those but smarties for us are like m&m's
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:38.480]   there you go you call a lift a torch
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:43.120]   but our lorries do have boots lorries with boots
[01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:50.880]   we'd like some we'd like some tonic having a bottle of tonic while we're popping up
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:57.120]   if apple were in a vacuum and didn't have all this you know play would be the best vacuum ever
[01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:01.760]   anyone has ever had a medium beat with people say gosh I need a faster graphics card no because
[01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:09.680]   the state of the art games are not on the Mac platform video editing I mean maybe 4k video
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:14.160]   no apple does a good job with that right on the camera and VR on a Macley on very sad
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:22.000]   yes okay palmer lucky is not happy no um you know by the way Mac people
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:28.320]   it was a fad don't worry about it it's over already it's over we all know apple's doomed
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:35.600]   totally he's at the universe five o'clock we'll come we'll consume us all all right so I'm not
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:40.400]   gonna worry about what the next apple hardware is we'll just uh just go maybe a busy September
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:46.240]   Leo you think it's gonna be a busy lovely it would be lovely if they did a mini with some oomph
[01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:55.120]   do you develop on the mini what do you develop on so I have a 2013 Mac Pro which replaced it
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:13:01.600]   2010 Mac Pro that's the trash can Mac that's what we call the trash can and I like it because
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:06.800]   it takes up very very little space beautiful I mean nobody finds it's beautiful it sits on a shelf
[01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:12.800]   instead of on the floor makes an excellent sound good look very doorstop for me really I'll be
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:17.120]   happy to take it off your hands man I can always use another one the prettiest doorstop I ever had
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:21.040]   rich I don't know if you want it because when he says doorstop he means that like he actually
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:26.720]   like hammered one end of it flat it's in front of the it's in front of the Tesla so he stops right
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:35.280]   hey if it still runs I'll take it I'm sure um you know the the Mac Pro I really wish they had made
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:39.920]   some parts of it swappable because we all know the technology has moved on since it's come out but
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:44.240]   I got to tell you it's still doing what I need and I don't have any complaints about it I'm
[01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:51.280]   I'm not held back by the hardware you don't want mine it never worked right seriously I was on my
[01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:58.240]   second one I traded it in and still doesn't it's got weird USB crap maybe it's just you Leo
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:05.280]   the rev-a-board that never got rev-bead right I don't want it I don't like I don't want to say
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:10.960]   this but it may be because it was assembled in the US I don't know that's a mean thing it's a knock
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:15.200]   on wood I got apple care for mine but it has been completely trouble free well apple's been very
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:20.160]   responsive it didn't cost me anything to fix it but um but it's still and now it's out of warranty so
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:26.480]   it's it's still not it's not reliable it's a mutant it's a mutant trash can I'd love to see
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:31.840]   I'd love to see new Mac minis um yeah it's new guts I think the mini is a really great form
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:35.840]   factor and you know it's interesting that you mentioned the knock the Intel knock which is basically
[01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:43.520]   it's so funny apple does a MacBook Air and Intel invents the what do they call it the
[01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:49.200]   is a name for it anyway it's a Mac book ultra books ultra book apple makes a Mac mini Intel
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:56.720]   invents the knock it's the same thing but the knock it has made progress and you can get
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:01.360]   nucks from a variety people not just Intel a lot of different people and you can get a lot of
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:07.600]   different things in it and better video cards and better processors and apples but I think the
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:11.600]   mini is a great form factor I'd love to see apple do more with the mini maybe make it smaller
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:17.680]   servers my knuckles smaller than a Mac mini how about a raspberry pie that could boot Mac OS
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:24.640]   yeah in your dreams apple pie no because Mac OS I'll tell you something I'm willing to go out on a
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:32.480]   limb here and say without inside knowledge and say that apple probably has Mac OS running on
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:38.720]   arm hardware oh absolutely you're right yeah yeah so you know imagine this imagine this tiny I
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:43.360]   have a raspberry pie on my desk but you can't see it because it's buried but imagine this tiny
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:52.400]   little box it's running Mac OS 11 apple pie apple pie is such a good name very little power has
[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:59.280]   has an HDMI pour it out of it and boots back I would be I would now with the sale of arm to soft
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:06.560]   bank does that change the equation or not I don't think so apple is an arm licensee right
[01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:11.760]   talked about this black wheat last week's I recall the license the architecture right and
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:16.480]   that's kind of what arm is is is there a licensing company that develops architectures and and
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:21.040]   license but there's two kinds of license when you take an arm chip as an instruction set and
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:25.200]   build your own right well and the other is what apple has an architecture license which allows
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:29.040]   you to modify it updated change it just your basic all it means is they have the rights to use
[01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:32.400]   a compatible language right on their chips and they can make those chips look like anything they
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:37.920]   want I host other comprehensive license apple has one thousand chip designers they bought PA risk
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:44.240]   I have to think that apples long this is by the way this is something you learn from Elon Musk
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:49.600]   vertical integration the more things apple makes the more control it has the better right
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:54.720]   yeah I mean they had arm max running in prototype for years I mean anything that we can think of
[01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:58.000]   they've had they've got billions was always to prototype and it's just a question like when
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:02.000]   Phil Schiller says that he doesn't like the ergonomics of a touchscreen Mac he's not just waking up and
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.520]   saying that they built one he had it on his desk and he played with it and said I'm not too happy
[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:09.200]   with this and the same thing with our max like you open them up and then you start asking questions
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:13.840]   does it run a version of OS 10 ported to arm because we know apple there was a university student
[01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:17.680]   who worked at apple who published it as a paper porting a lot like Darwin and a lot of those things
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:24.000]   to try to not that hard because frankly all of this stuff I mean next open step was arm compatible
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:30.480]   there's a one is a run so it's not it's not a big deal and even if it were apple has the
[01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:34.320]   resources to do that I think it makes sense for them to do the vertical integration I think it's
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:39.760]   just a matter than pulling the trigger and this last year with skylake probably is another
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:44.800]   nail in the coffin for Intel and but it's all those questions like do does it run iOS or does it run
[01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:48.640]   Mac OS does it run Photoshop like it does it run what version of Photoshop do we have to have a
[01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:52.720]   compatibility layer oh that's interesting yeah what do you do with the third party eyes for
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:57.120]   software yeah yeah processors are always tricky right what would that mean do you rich
[01:17:57.120 --> 01:18:03.360]   what Mac OS he's done all of them uh yeah I mean you write it in you write it in there I've seen a
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:08.720]   lot of I've seen a lot of processor transitions I saw you write an X code right it might just be a
[01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:14.400]   68k to power PC and and power PC to Intel honestly the notion of Intel to arm
[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:21.920]   to me seems like more of a challenge for the OS because you need to
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:29.600]   I mean there's sort of two courses of action you can either provide a layer the way apple has
[01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:40.640]   historically done something that temporarily lets you run Intel uh binaries on arm or you say hey listen
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:46.720]   remember this bit code thing we introduced where you could deploy something which wasn't
[01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:55.280]   necessarily targeted well guess what now we can retarget your binaries and you don't even have to
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:19:00.960]   think about it and then it's just a question of API availability and then
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:05.120]   you know there's also is it open or closed like if it runs because I think there's some that run
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:09.040]   iOS and you know some people want a big open platform and iOS is not a big open platform so
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:13.040]   if iOS is running on Macs and people I you know I can't do all these things I used to know I don't
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:18.240]   know I don't think we'll see iOS running on Mac I think we'll see I think we'll see Mac OS
[01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:24.160]   running on on eventually Mac OS running on arm powered hardware it's a much bigger challenge
[01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:29.360]   if for you know what's rich gonna do if suddenly it's iOS you that's a big rewrite because you're
[01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:36.000]   using API always 10 API calls but as long as your software is all done in Xcode with standard API
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:42.560]   calls it's probably just a recompile I would bet right it's it's a little more than just a recompile
[01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:48.400]   that's sort of a that's that's a popular trope that oh all you have to do is check a box or change
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:54.640]   or make a pile but well what would what would cause issues where would you run into problems
[01:19:54.640 --> 01:20:02.080]   well there are APIs that are older that may not be supported anymore even though right it depends
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:07.280]   on what kind of support Apple provides and there's and there's a lot depending on what kind of
[01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:13.280]   support you get from Apple for for the different API shapes right it's all imponderable but you know
[01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:18.640]   so in previous and previous processor changes some APIs were deprecated and left behind
[01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:24.720]   oh yeah and that's a problem because if you use that API you got to find an alternative
[01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:31.840]   right and honestly the way Apple has operated with with processor shifts and APIs
[01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:41.520]   if the APIs that go away are ones that are so long obsolete that if you're still using them
[01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:48.240]   your past do for rewrite right and do you do that do you kind of go through your code refactor it
[01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:52.880]   and make it more up to date periodically or all the time is for us it's an ongoing process that's
[01:20:52.880 --> 01:21:00.240]   actually one of the one of the biggest ongoing changes that we've been making with the most recent
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:09.840]   releases is the code modernization and updating is a is a constant process with us so yeah I mean
[01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:16.160]   we're doing that all the time yeah the new releases have less old code and more new code if you will
[01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:23.440]   then what came before yeah I'm not expecting it to be a a painless transition but it it doesn't
[01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:28.960]   have to be as painful as it might sound right you may not need a carbon you know carbon
[01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:34.880]   style Rosetta style how it's before I mean on an arm chip how it that emulation layer with
[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:40.160]   right well that's the one thing you you're gonna lose with arm is performance I would think okay
[01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:45.680]   so so here let me throw let me throw a concept at you right now all of the arm hardware that we've
[01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:54.240]   seen out of Apple is designed for extreme energy efficiency for a very high ratio of performance
[01:21:54.240 --> 01:22:01.840]   per consumed watt but when you have a much bigger battery like the one in a laptop or if you have a
[01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:09.040]   wall a line supply power supply all of a sudden performance per watt you can give up a little bit of
[01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:16.400]   of of that ratio in the name of both greater performance and greater power consumption so
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:26.000]   imagine a imagine an arm chip that ran at some outrageous clock rate right that had some outrageous
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:34.160]   number of pipelines and and suddenly you can make it run very very very fast on desktop hardware
[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:39.280]   right by desktop it does not include laptops as well and you know if when you don't have the
[01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:45.520]   constraints of a mobile device like an iPhone or iPad suddenly you know the horizon's broadened a
[01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:52.320]   little bit you can consume more power you can run things faster you can increase memory bandwidth
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:59.280]   and then the notion of emulation excuse me the notion of emulation might be a little more feasible
[01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:10.000]   and is the so is apple moving to bit code on OS 10 or just iOS they're uh I don't recall
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:16.400]   just iOS is it just iOS today it's part of app setting I believe right now okay but that would be
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:21.920]   another signal if they if they started doing that on the desktop that that might be part of the
[01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:27.200]   transition right because then the porting is a lot easier I think the biggest question is the
[01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:32.800]   Intel transition was called named was codenamed marklar so what South Park aliens could the arm
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:38.080]   transition that's something the internet needs to solve I just think it makes sense for vertical
[01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:44.000]   integration if nothing else and if you get some benefits with the risk architecture because
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:50.720]   currently Intel's pretty much cis yes if you get some benefits besides power obviously that's
[01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:55.360]   going to be good on laptop you know 20 hour battery life would be very nice apple a nine makes I think
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:59.680]   the core m cry on many many levels like when you put them side by side well again cuz Intel does
[01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:03.680]   the same thing in the reverse direction right they take their desktop chips and they make them low
[01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:09.280]   power and and and that's what you see in the core m but when you have a core like to riches point
[01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:12.640]   previously what happens when you put an arm chip in a laptop with a fan you know you're no longer
[01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:17.840]   worrying about thermals the same way you are or be or be heatsink exactly well I think I think
[01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:23.360]   that they'll get when the great one of the great things about the iPads and I have
[01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:27.120]   let's leave the iPhones out of it for now because it's not really the same class of performance or
[01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:33.440]   the same productivity certain device is that when you are really designing the whole widget inside
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:39.520]   out you can optimize in way you can optimize and get speed in ways that go far beyond just simply
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:44.160]   number of cores and simply number of cycles that you're getting you can really start to
[01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:50.880]   make every inch every every micro nanometer of that pipe so that numbers get to the screen as
[01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:57.040]   quickly as possible then that that memory is data is moving from iota vices through memory and then
[01:24:57.040 --> 01:25:02.400]   through the CPU really really fast it's something you can't do if you're just waiting to get a FedEx
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:07.120]   box from Intel and then you'll figure out how to adapt this Intel buck but if you basically say
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:12.720]   again with all this huge chip menu chip design company that apple has internally to say we need
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:19.520]   a we basically want a MacBook that will run about as fast as an i5 processor and design whatever you
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:24.400]   need for to have the CPU when I when I looked at the first time I looked at the MacBook nothing
[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:29.200]   you know the thing that really struck me I still have to call it the MacBook nothing or else people
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:33.040]   like I'm sure that people think that what back is you talk about the MacBook or manager first
[01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:40.000]   that's the internal name manager book exactly the wedge book but the first time I looked at it
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:45.600]   like with the with it disassembled I saw what what the what old timers like me would call the mother
[01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:51.840]   board and I'm also looking at everything that this is if you take out this that that part of it and
[01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:58.400]   you'll get every decision they made in assembling this I look at that little you know postage stamp
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:04.400]   size motherboard and I thought this was designed to run an arm if I were if they were designing a
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:08.400]   MacBook that's going to run an arm this is exactly what it would look like and this is the sort of
[01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:12.800]   priorities that they would have in trying to make the thing work so I don't know if I don't know if
[01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:19.600]   that points to a future direction but I I would like to think that there are a couple of offices
[01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:25.120]   a very very high up at Apple where nobody knows that their MacBook nothing is actually running
[01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:30.960]   on a special version of the operating system closet and it's getting it's getting 43 hours of battery
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:38.320]   life why is it ceiling the mini's now you don't know what's in there maybe I'm gonna keep saying
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:43.120]   I'm gonna keep saying this and eventually it will be true and that is that within two years we'll
[01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:50.560]   see Apple ship a version of Mac OS that targets arm I think it I think you're absolutely right and
[01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:56.080]   it might even be sooner because there I feel like everything's moving in that direction and maybe
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:27:02.480]   soft bank even had some inkling that arm was going to be even more valuable soon of course IOT is
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:10.000]   enough to push you to $32 billion for that company but still I this is imminent you know the analogy
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:18.400]   here with Tesla Tesla had been outsourcing their their cameras to a company was it called LiveEye
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:26.960]   and LiveEye even said and Tesla has said the problem is you can't have the cameras made by
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:31.440]   one company and then have another company do the artificial intelligence that the infirm you know
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:35.600]   the informational side of it really needs to be tightly integrated so Tesla has apparently
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:42.800]   uh is gonna stop going to is it mobile i or LiveEye and make and go use Bosch cameras and
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:49.040]   do their own software because they the tighter integration is almost necessary for autonomous
[01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:55.760]   vehicles and so this I see Apple in the same boat where vertical integration makes so much more
[01:27:55.760 --> 01:28:00.000]   not only is it more profitable but makes so much more possible and that's one going that way
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:03.600]   but see they did the Apple A9 and then they're probably working on a modem and I don't know
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:08.800]   what Qualcomm's you know CDMA patents mean for that but you know when the US is off CDMA maybe
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:13.520]   the Apple modem will appear and then the Apple photo optics and then the Apple display and you
[01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:17.120]   know when you do make these things right now Qualcomm is making chips that have to work on
[01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:21.040]   Windows phones and Android phones so they still they have they carry the burden of DirectX and
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:28.160]   Open GL and and Apple I had the M3 and the M7 latest generation MacBook it Intel deliberately
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:34.000]   hurt them like they crippled the M3 chip and it cries trying to do one one 4k stream and the iPad
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:38.240]   Pro can do three and laugh and when you start to figure out you know you can actually build
[01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:42.880]   exactly what you want for that like if you wanted to be a video editor you just do MP you just do
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:49.120]   uh h.264 h.265 in hardware and suddenly it's fantastic for playing and making video and you
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:53.920]   can make all those decisions when you when you license the IP and build your own chip yeah I
[01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:59.920]   also think that philosophically Apple is becoming a company that expects to be able to build to
[01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:06.640]   specify every single thing that goes into that device and take nothing that's just simply off
[01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:13.200]   the shelf and that there goes beyond strategy it goes beyond practicality goes beyond profitability
[01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:18.080]   it becomes this is how we tend to think of machines we don't tend to think we don't tend to
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:24.080]   anti-nocco buys a Raspberry Pi and then thinks of gee what can I build with this thing that someone
[01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:29.680]   else has made uh Apple tends to think of what would we need to create that doesn't exist yet that
[01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:35.040]   would allow us to create this imaginary machine uh that we think uh we are capable of uh of selling
[01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:38.160]   in three or four or five years rich do you think the move to swift is part of that?
[01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:46.240]   I really don't okay I think swift is interesting I think that swift takes very good advantage of
[01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:54.480]   the core technology in LLVM uh but I don't think that swift is itself really part of a part of a
[01:29:54.480 --> 01:30:01.520]   move to arm move okay I mean uh are there certain advantages that come with an arm targeted swift
[01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:07.120]   yeah sure I can imagine um well LLVM itself makes it more portable doesn't it yeah
[01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:13.680]   um by the way it was mobile i and today they announced that they are no longer making the cameras
[01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:17.920]   for Teslas in the this the Wall Street Journal published the story and the speculation is that
[01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:24.880]   Tesla is going to take it all in house and Elon has always said you know it's all about vertical
[01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:30.720]   integration uh let's take a break picks of the week coming up and listen well I should ask any
[01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:34.960]   other stories uh there's there's a lot we didn't get any I guess we should mention that
[01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:41.280]   CNET says that the iPhone launch will uh will be September 16th that's based on EV leaks who has
[01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:47.440]   a history of leaking android uh the iPhone leaks yeah huh oh wait sorry Evan um you know
[01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:53.280]   it could just be a calculation right let's see the first Tuesday after Labor Day and then 10
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:59.040]   plus 10 days he's off a bit because he's saying that it would ship Friday the 16th I think which is
[01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:02.480]   a little bit earlier than Apple ships traditionally in a lot earlier than it did because it had a
[01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:07.120]   three week break uh sorry a two week break instead of a one and a half week break last year the
[01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:11.120]   only reason I don't credit this is here in July I don't think Apple be setting a ship date
[01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:16.240]   I mean like those things are fluid we saw them move last year they were like the ship day was
[01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:19.840]   originally like I think 10 days like normal right the other really interesting news this week though
[01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:25.680]   was Bob Mansfield taking over Project Titan oh which yes yeah so let's talk about that Bob is this
[01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:32.240]   uh he's I love blue he's the blue collar Bob I call him yeah I love Bob Mansfield he's a legend
[01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:38.240]   yeah legendary in kind of uh ops right operations guy yeah well he took over hardware engineering
[01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:43.120]   at Apple and then he saw through the iMac the iPhone the iPad and then he left and Dan
[01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:47.760]   Riccio succeeded him he came back briefly because the transition was didn't he want to retire didn't
[01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:52.880]   Bob want to retire his family wanted to spend more time with his money is the usual saying that you
[01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:56.240]   get but he was never fully retired like you would still see him at campus which is like some of the
[01:31:56.240 --> 01:31:59.680]   story says like he was as far as I know he was still involved and he would still talk to him
[01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:03.360]   cook and he was there fairly regularly that he got seen around campus a lot
[01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:09.040]   and the project Titan which is widely believed to be the apple car was under Dan Riccio who's the
[01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:14.160]   current head of hardware engineering because all of apples projects like are owned by by different
[01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:19.760]   people within the organization so like apple watch is owned by one executive for example and
[01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:24.880]   iPhone was owned by Scott Forest all but as you go forward him taking this over is really really
[01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:30.000]   cool because Riccio has a ton of stuff on his desk because he's managing all the other hardware
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:36.400]   engineering teams Bob Mansfield has a ton of experience in doing all of this and he gets to
[01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:40.960]   focus now on project Titan he doesn't have to split his time with all of apple's other hardware
[01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:46.080]   projects so for me this is just a huge win I mean whether whether apple ships a car when he
[01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:49.680]   when it ships a car and what other interesting stuff they're doing on top of the car because I
[01:32:49.680 --> 01:32:53.920]   think the actual physical car is only one part of the really interesting stuff they're doing on that
[01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:58.480]   project having Mansfield there it's just it seems like a huge win for everybody
[01:32:58.480 --> 01:33:06.240]   when the where are we going to see an apple car uh to be determined there apple doesn't
[01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:10.800]   pre-announced project so they can ship you know however long it takes I mean people were saying
[01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:18.560]   2019 2020 now they're saying 2020 2021 nobody wants a bad premature apple car so take all the time
[01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:23.840]   you want please right it's interesting that we've we've gone from maybe they're doing it to
[01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:29.360]   everybody's kind of convinced now this is definitely on the road map I don't know a rumor
[01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:35.520]   done announced project that nobody has actually seen any confirmation of and and nobody knows what
[01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:40.400]   the schedule is for it has now slipped yeah so that's the thing like the thing that makes me
[01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:44.400]   super excited is uh the iPhone was project purple and that eventually got us the iPhone and the
[01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:49.280]   iPad but it also got us apples new focus on security and privacy and you know some people hate it
[01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:54.000]   but the sandboxing and there's just so much technology that has permeated all of apples product line
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:58.000]   and ways of thinking that were very different than when it was just one product with the Mac
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:01.600]   and when you're creating something like Titan there's going to be all sorts of technologies
[01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:05.840]   and I love that Project Titan is not on apple campus but it's external to apple campus because
[01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:09.920]   that means it's not you know stuck in every every preconception that apple has about every other
[01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:14.000]   product they've made so to me like whether the car ships or not is sort of secondary it'd be
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:17.760]   super cool but everything that comes out of there I think is going to establish the culture and
[01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:21.760]   technology for apple for the next 10 years and I think that's the really exciting part
[01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:26.160]   all right we take a break now that is a good I'm glad you mentioned that I didn't want to
[01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:31.760]   I forgot about that I don't want to let that go yeah Bob Bob Bob Bob's back and he's building a
[01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:37.760]   video that car I don't know what I just I just is one of the apple executives who actually looks
[01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:43.200]   like me so I like that instead of all these good looking sharp hipsters oh he's much better
[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:49.840]   looking than you are okay all right all right I'll take that we're going to take a break rich

[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:06.400]   care package from Rhode Island the only thing missing was del's frozen lemonade
[01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:13.280]   but it included some eclipse coffee syrup and completely coincidentally my doctor diagnosed
[01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:21.200]   diabetes just a few months later so I don't think it's related anyway well it's a funny
[01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:27.760]   coincidence because here oh there's a del's oh you're gonna drive me crazy this is I love it

[01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:32.800]   didn't know this though in 1993 the state Senate approved coffee milk is the official state drink
[01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:37.760]   yeah we're not talking about it no there's still there's still a lot of dispute as to whether
[01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:44.080]   it's coffee milk or del's yeah I like them both I like but also just a word out to
[01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:53.520]   oh look there you go look I could get a bucket one point nine gallons oh that's enough that should
[01:39:53.520 --> 01:40:00.960]   do me two two gallons of frozen lemonade and a lot of Arnold Palmer's you'll have a world ending
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:08.560]   brain freeze but yes also a word out here to to Bruno who has been exceptionally well behaved
[01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:14.400]   this afternoon thank you and he's a beautiful is he an African what is he he's an African gray
[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:19.280]   beautiful color look at that hmm and somebody in the chat room said rich looks like the kind of
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:27.120]   guy who kisses his parrot yes he is thank you rich segal always a pleasure having you on we really
[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:33.760]   appreciated mr. Renee Richie from imore.com your pick of the week so my pick of the week is a
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:41.040]   very small but very useful Mac app called rocket and what it does is let you enter emoji faster so
[01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:46.400]   if you've ever used slack it's super easy like you just start typing colon and then pretty much
[01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:51.200]   the name of the emoji or the name of something and it inserts it in and it's super fast because you
[01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:55.600]   never have to change context never have to let go of the keyboard on the current implementation
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:59.760]   of the Mac if you want to do an emoji you've got a you know a blanch you got to use a command key
[01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:05.440]   or to launch the emoji picker and then you can search through them but it just it's it's not fast
[01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:10.400]   it's not efficient it's it's not what you want from Mac emoji or jiffy goodness and this just
[01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:14.880]   gives you that you just again it's just like using slack you start typing it works the way you'd
[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:19.520]   expect it to work and it lets you use this wonderfully expressive pictographic and animated
[01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:24.640]   language in the way that the modern founders of the internet intended this is one thing that's
[01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:30.640]   gonna make me very sad about moving to free bsd is the is the lack of quality emoji content
[01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:35.280]   on my platform i mean they're great ones some people don't get them but they're great on many
[01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:39.360]   levels and i think we talked to us before but if i'm running late and i say you know leo i'm
[01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:43.040]   running late in text maybe you're like ah you jerk how could you do this but if you send like a
[01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:47.200]   little sticker or a little emoji okay just it creates affinity and it's gonna distress the
[01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:50.960]   situations and many people find it much easier to communicate when they're using these little
[01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:56.000]   expressive pictures then they would in sort of an emotional as awkward internet text medium
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:59.600]   and especially with jiffy i mean like it's hard not to love when you get the perfect cat jiffy or
[01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:04.960]   the perfect like your like ah yes and you're just petting a little bird who's prickly i mean
[01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:09.520]   it's just it's just wonderful it's really true it's so much better on the Mac yeah it's a huge
[01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:16.400]   thing it's fabulous we're humans yeah and it's there's something lost in text the nuance the body
[01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:21.600]   language the subtlety that the motion yeah we first tried to fix with emoticons but
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:26.640]   emojis and finally ask yard animated gifts which really they finally
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:31.680]   scratch that inch that old compu-serve technology has become the foundation of our communication
[01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:39.200]   if what a thought right who would have thought we'd be using animated gifts at 2016 they'd be like
[01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:46.080]   all the rage who does something andy and i co your pick of the week oh i wish you'd called on me
[01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:52.320]   instead of rea cuz i i almost had this time perfectly there is a kitchen item that i've been
[01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:57.760]   like sort of dreaming of owning since i was eight years old and my parents didn't have one but i saw
[01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:02.160]   the commercials for them and then stupidly i was only recently i realized that these things were
[01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:07.280]   still available so i can i can't show it to you in operation but i can show it to you there is
[01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:15.440]   magic the magical results of the west ben stir crazy popcorn maker oh they're popping right now
[01:43:15.440 --> 01:43:20.640]   it's happening it's finished popping see but it's amazing because like it's this like walk
[01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:26.320]   i let me adjust crayon cam 3000 the future video podcasting so you get a better look at it
[01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:32.640]   it is essentially just like a like a walk sort of thing you pour like a couple tablespoons of oil
[01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:39.600]   into and then like a cup of half a cup or a cup of popcorn kernels into and it's like it's it's
[01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:46.640]   it maximizes every variable of popcorn now first of all you get the jiffy pop aspect in which
[01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:52.400]   you just see these like they're like a little a couple of motor motorized arms that just keep the
[01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:58.000]   kernel spinning through the oil so it doesn't burn and every kernel pops so you basically get to
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:05.760]   watch popcorn appearing as if by magic but in front of your eyes and then you also get the advantage
[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:12.800]   of stovetop popping by which it's like light it's fluffy it's hot it's crunchy and it makes the
[01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:19.680]   room smell like popcorn and also you get the laziness of uh of microwave popcorn where when
[01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:25.120]   you're done when it's finished you just tip it over like this and then take the scorching hot
[01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:32.000]   electric walk sort of thing if you're not demonstrating it you can uh you will not get the towel trapped
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:37.040]   underneath it like that there you go because it is actually popping into its own bowl of popcorn
[01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:41.760]   it's not that hot but i just don't want to i don't want to make it be a youtube viral sensation
[01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:48.400]   it's scorching myself there you go and there you go look at that ladies have jennel
[01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:54.720]   it's like this is the best popcorn it's like alton brown has alton brown hates unit taskers alton
[01:44:54.720 --> 01:45:00.640]   brown has said that he you know i just put i just put like a big steel ball on the top of the stove
[01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:05.360]   and i cover it with aluminum foil and now you have a bowl a steel bowl you have to buy
[01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:11.600]   aluminum foil you have to clean up you just wind up here with just a an actual bowl of popcorn that
[01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:17.360]   you take with you into the living room or just keep this on the on an end table and keep making
[01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:22.560]   more popcorn as you go from the the the lord of the rings trilogy to the hobbit habit trilogy
[01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:31.520]   and again it's just beautiful crunchy hot oh it's only if only you could smell
[01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:39.200]   how nice my office smells right now delicious hot fresh popcorn and it's like 30 bucks
[01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:44.880]   and i and i sort of thought to myself like why i have 30 dollars i'm gonna make another 30
[01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:47.680]   dollars really quickly why don't i buy myself live the dream
[01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:54.480]   i buy myself a stir-craze corn popper so here it is empty so you can see like the spinning like
[01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:59.760]   rotating arms there and as you can see like every kernel is like has been popped and it's a very
[01:45:59.760 --> 01:46:04.800]   clean pan when you're done you can just like sort of unscrew these uh this motorized arms
[01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:09.760]   just give it a wipe out to make just to take the grease out of it there's like no cleanup whatsoever
[01:46:09.760 --> 01:46:17.200]   you can toss the the bowl part in the dishwasher so and so it's my pick of the week because
[01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:22.400]   it's inexpensive it's awesome it's entertaining on several levels and that means that as we say
[01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:26.880]   goodbye now i have a bowl of popcorn i can eat as i go back upstairs to my one room with their
[01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:36.400]   conditioning and the anaco and the anaco he's a man i'm sorry there is no phone app for this
[01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:41.760]   okay that does not disqualify it from being a useful kitchen item i you make me want popcorn if
[01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:46.880]   that's was if that was your goal there you go you you know if you don't if you if you can't have salt
[01:46:46.880 --> 01:46:50.320]   you don't have to put salt on it if you can't have sweet things you don't have to occur
[01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:56.720]   no i asked i asked my uh my internet doctor dr mom in the chat room she says popcorn's okay
[01:46:56.720 --> 01:47:03.680]   because uh it's got a low glycemic load so there you go more popcorn for everyone but i i don't
