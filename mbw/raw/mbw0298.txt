[00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.420]   Who was a cinematographer and the the are you still president of the so-cal a sc
[00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.040]   I was no past president the a sc of the association
[00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.600]   I know these American society cinematographers. There we go. We got it. You see it in every movie, you know
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.300]   You see Douglas crumble a sc
[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.100]   You see every movie that's what yeah, it's it's an honorary society. It's the oldest one in Hollywood started in
[00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.440]   1919 and
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.340]   It's made up of the best cinematographers in the world. Awesome. What's great to have you?
[00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.660]   We have Darren on every time we do CES or NAB but to have you in studio is wonderful thing. Yeah, it's great coming up
[00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.660]   You're in the brick house
[00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.300]   I wanted to see it now. I'm in the brick house. Yeah, and now we had your buddy Alex Lindsey
[00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:50.620]   But his connection from the motel Marriott in Burbank. Yeah, what a surprise wasn't so good. So we've he's dead
[00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.340]   And and that's fine because we've got you and we've got the lovely Andy and Ico
[00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.500]   Who was apparently coming to us from the Boston Public Library today? No, no, no
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.420]   This is the the the long-room at the at the old library Trinity College Trinity College. Oh yes in Dublin
[00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:12.220]   He's coming to us from Dublin. I also also as ripped off by George Lucas for the Jedi Library
[00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.540]   Star Wars episode two. Yeah, that's what that's why it looks familiar
[00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.940]   No planet Hoth in that episode though
[00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.540]   No, it could have used some Hoth
[00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.060]   I visited off
[00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.860]   Over the past week. Thank you Andy for filling in
[00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.780]   Uh for me. I appreciate it. It was a pleasure to give you a week off
[00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.860]   You do too. Well, and you have so few of them every time you're on I get tweets saying, you know, you should just get off that show
[00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.140]   But Andy did you dance on the table at some point?
[00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.420]   Uh, no, I had people dancing for me. It's okay. Just checking
[00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.140]   Wow
[00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.180]   Wow
[00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.100]   All right. Well, there's some apple news just a little bit in the in the works today
[00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.900]   I'm gonna start with probably the big security story
[00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.140]   Of a flaw
[00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.900]   In OS 10 lion that's been around for oh my god 10 three months and counting
[00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.220]   It allows anyone
[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.660]   Well, there's several
[00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.140]   Apparently they keep the uh passwords in plain text
[00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.020]   Uh, oh no s 10 lion
[00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.300]   So now the good news is you have to have physical access to somebody's computer
[00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:22.940]   But if you do even if you're not an administrator you can use a simple terminal command that will change anybody's password
[00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.380]   Have you tried that? Yeah, let's see if it works. Let's see. You want to try it. Should we do it? Yeah
[00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.460]   Let's see. Let's see how vulnerable it really is. I was actually gonna do it when you were looking the other way
[00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.940]   You get an error. Yeah, I know you get an error message
[00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.820]   Um, so the the uh, what you do is you go into the terminal and you type this
[00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.660]   That appears to give an error apparently. So let's let's just try it terminal
[00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.300]   Now actually I have to see who else I have because obviously I can change my own password
[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.300]   So that's not gonna really
[00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.860]   Uh, let's not let me see what else I have on this machine. Do you want me to show this or yeah? Why not?
[00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.020]   All right, I should make sure they all want to see his password
[00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.020]   I don't want to see my password. Okay, let me see
[00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.020]   You're all compromised anyway
[00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.580]   I only have me but I see what you do is you do this uh ds
[00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.740]   C l local host dash password
[00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.300]   And then you just put in a plug in a user
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.500]   And it says what's the new password? Oh, and just a wow
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.060]   That's
[00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.700]   Too fast now I am the admin. So I should really do this
[00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.460]   I should create a limited account and try to change the admin password
[00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.460]   But I don't want to take the time to do that but
[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.460]   Uh, let's let's take it as given since this seems to be the story uh everywhere
[00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:35.340]   Uh, once the admin's password has changed of course the hacker could then log in uh to the admin account have full access to the system
[00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.300]   Uh, but the key is on this
[00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.740]   Uh that you need to have physical access to the hardware
[00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.860]   So if you're like at starbucks don't walk away from your computer too
[00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.020]   All right, and if you have a prankster brother or co-host
[00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.700]   Do not you know log out
[00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:59.420]   Yeah, that's that's that's why it's always three times three kinds of scary whenever I'm at the panera the starbucks
[00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.660]   I see somebody just walk away from their
[00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:06.700]   $1,500 laptop to get a refill or to or to take the pause that refreshes
[00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:13.100]   Because they they they think that the people in the room are not going to simply kind of grab it and run but oh man
[00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:18.460]   I can do nothing but think about the nine different things you can do to computer to do lots of damage
[00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:23.980]   If you just have about two minutes worth of hands-on access to it that are just bad bad bad bad super bad
[00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:30.940]   Well leo did that and it was like 30 seconds bang bang but yeah, not even that long you just as long as you've got the uh command memorized
[00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:36.140]   Um, and it's also it's also it's also warning about having guest account access
[00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.340]   Uh, because a lot of people keep a guest account up there
[00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.460]   A because the lot then the matter of share computer
[00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.820]   But they want to make sure that people don't have access to other parts of the machine
[00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.260]   Some people also use guest accounts as a honey trap, right?
[00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.340]   So that if they have tracking software installed
[00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:57.100]   It will it will sort of inspire the fee for the person who buys it not to reform at the hard drive just yet
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:01.900]   And you know use it just long enough for the tracking software to get a fix and get a couple pictures
[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:07.820]   But this really does show the vulnerability of having anybody having any sort of access to uh to your machine hands-on
[00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:14.780]   So you don't even want to have a you don't want a guest account because you don't you just don't want anybody on your your system period
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:21.820]   Well, so here's what uh from from uh cnet uh from uh tofer a kessler writing in the cnet's mac fix it column
[00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.580]   Here's what he suggests first of all disable automatic login
[00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.740]   Now that's of course a terrible security race. It means when you boot your computer just logs in that course
[00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:35.820]   That's like you that's like leaving your car in law. Right. I have it set up that way just because i'm lazy, but I guess i'll turn that off
[00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.460]   uh
[00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:43.500]   Enable sleep and screen saver passwords of course if you walk away and the screen saver goes in kicks in
[00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.500]   You might even want to turn down the screen saver time
[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:51.180]   Uh, they will have to enter a password then to get to the terminal and they need to get to the terminal in order to do this or be able to get to
[00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:55.660]   With the directory where the passwords are stored disable guest accounts as we were talking about
[00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:58.380]   Um, because you can do this from a guest account
[00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:06.060]   So even if uh, if you have guest accounts turned on and even if you know if they can if they can log in as a guest
[00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:09.740]   They can do it and then uh, it says manage users in the system
[00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:13.820]   In other words, don't let other people be admins
[00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.780]   Um
[00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:22.060]   You can disable access to the terminal for all accounts except admin accounts for instance that might be the solution is
[00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:28.860]   Using the limit applications in the parental controls. That seems like a lot of work apple will i'm sure patch this
[00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:31.580]   But it isn't patched now and the reason I wanted to lead with it. I just
[00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:37.340]   Uh, mostly because I want to go ha ha no because I I want I led with it because I think everybody should know about it
[00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:42.700]   It's a very fairly security, uh, serious security flaw and has been around for some time
[00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:50.300]   Uh, and realize that physical access is is is the one thing you really can't do much just uh,
[00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.260]   The stop things about if people can get the hands on your machine
[00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:58.140]   Pretty much it's it's the security game over it's terrible that they can actually create a new
[00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:02.540]   Get access to your admin accounts and actually create their own admins accounts during whatever time they have
[00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:08.860]   But it all but it also reminds you that uh lockdown access to your machine is a really really big priority
[00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:13.100]   Also, it's as good as time as I need to remind people that if you haven't set an open firmware
[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:17.500]   Password on your mac yet. It's probably a really good idea to do so
[00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:21.660]   Uh, because if someone does have that physical access to your machine if they have enough time
[00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.900]   They could just simply reboot it into target dismode
[00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:28.860]   Uh, and they'll have full access to the actual volume just by mounting it as an external hard drive
[00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:33.180]   And they'll also have the ability to reformat it do all kinds of stuff to it if it gets stolen
[00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:36.540]   Whereas if you use the open firmware utility you get that by
[00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:41.340]   Booting into recovery mode. It's one of the utilities that apple that that you'll boot into
[00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:43.180]   If that's available to you in line
[00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:49.340]   You will be able to set an open firmware password so that none of the startup keys will work or be able to do anything really damaging
[00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:53.980]   Unless they you have that open firmware password plugged in so it's a little extra layer of security
[00:09:53.980 --> 00:10:01.260]   But once again try to make sure that you do not leave your machine unattended for any amount of time without a similar some sort of password locking it down
[00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:05.740]   Yeah, so um, that's a good point about the open firmware password. They should have included that
[00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:08.060]   uh
[00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:14.380]   This so according to a chris forzeman writing an infinite loop on ours technica this this bug was posted in february
[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:19.580]   By a german sis admin. He put it on the apples of fort support forms. No one responded
[00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:22.300]   Until until this weekend
[00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:27.180]   Uh, and then a cryptography mailing list secure on friday circulated the story
[00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.820]   um
[00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:37.340]   Paul hazel in a system administrator working in an education environment claims in a post on novel support forms that betas of the next os
[00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:39.420]   10 do not exhibit the problem
[00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:46.380]   Just kind of interesting flaw is also not present in 10.7 point two. So it's only 10 point 7.3
[00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:50.540]   Oddly enough. Yeah, this this i'm sorry. Go ahead. Annie
[00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:55.340]   Oh, no, I was gonna say you're talking about this the the second bug that's related to uh, file vault
[00:10:55.340 --> 00:11:00.540]   Uh, this oh, okay. This is a sec is this is a separate vault. This is a problem. I'm sorry
[00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:04.060]   Okay, I thought this is the same one. This is a different one. No, this is a different one apparent
[00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:07.980]   Apparently that and this one is well this allows you to decrypt file vault. Oh great
[00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:14.940]   Well, it's well the the problem is that apparently there was some sort of like internal debugging system that had not been turned off
[00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:18.300]   By the time seven three uh 7.3 shipped
[00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:25.100]   And so there is actually a file that if you know where to look for it your password is actually being logged and recorded in plaintext
[00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.940]   Now this was not supposed to obviously this is not something that was supposed to ever leave
[00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.860]   That a bugging suite, but apparently it did I apologize
[00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:36.380]   So that's two different bugs and I can I conflated the two and I apologize
[00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:39.820]   So this is the this is the home. This is the home dermouter
[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:44.380]   The fact that it keeps a log and in plaintext which would get it would get you the password
[00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:47.420]   But it's a different way of doing it. I guess and it lets you decrypt file vault
[00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:53.580]   Right and and and the good news is that it will well it will also has your login password. So uh, it won't work
[00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:56.220]   Yeah, it's it's it's a pretty big one
[00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:02.300]   Uh, but it's it's not like that. It's not like the first one in which it really affects every single user and every single mac
[00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:09.020]   That's running this os this really only affects users of file vault under certain conditions and 10.7.3 right right exactly
[00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:12.060]   And that that's that's the sort of thing that's gonna be quickly closed up right I think
[00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:16.620]   File vault two what's the difference to file vault file vault two?
[00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:19.420]   That's a full disk encryption
[00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:22.940]   Right instead of just your instead of just use a direct so if you use file vault two
[00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:28.780]   This does not impact it. In fact, this would fix both problems. I think if you used file vault two
[00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:31.900]   Use the full disk encryption now. I turned on file vault
[00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:33.660]   once
[00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:37.900]   And it seemed really felt like it's even on an ssd on a fast machine. It felt like it slowed things down
[00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.140]   Is that was that just my imagining?
[00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:43.740]   I I felt that when I when I did that the same thing happened to me
[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:45.820]   So I've I thought it was just
[00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:51.020]   Overloading the processor making it, you know encrypt and decrypt. Yeah, so I actually have turned up
[00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:54.380]   Maybe file vault two will not and do you have any experience with either?
[00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:59.420]   Yeah, I mean I had the exact same experience. That's why I didn't use it when it first when it first came out
[00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:02.860]   File vault two which which I have on my on my testbed machine
[00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:08.780]   The sacrificial lamb the the canary in the in the cave file vault two is a lot faster
[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:10.860]   It's still you still get a little bit of a performance hit
[00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:15.420]   Uh, but you're but you're gonna get that anyway. You just but it's not as bad as file right one
[00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:20.140]   It's it's possible to forget how fast your machine could possibly be if you was to try to
[00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:24.220]   Mean I mean look at what's doing you're you're saying that every time it accesses the hard drive
[00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.780]   And that means that every time it's paging stuff to memory it is
[00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:30.140]   It is essentially doing a whole bunch of really complicated math
[00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:34.460]   So so you can use file vault two on if you have os 10 lion
[00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:39.100]   Presuming that the recovery HD was installed in the startup drive which it normally is
[00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:42.140]   When you run the os 10 lion installer
[00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:45.260]   um
[00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:51.100]   So you go into the security and privacy preference pain and system preferences click the file vault tab
[00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:56.300]   And then I guess it will give you the option for the other one
[00:13:56.300 --> 00:14:04.220]   I'm not sure how that works. Yeah, I've never seen an option. Yeah, so I'm sorry. I apologize to everybody for working through this on the air here
[00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:06.540]   that security and privacy
[00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:08.540]   and uh file vault
[00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:10.780]   And I guess there's a I guess you have to do something else
[00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:13.580]   For file vault two
[00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:18.300]   It also, I'm told by beatmaster in our chat room because it needs a case sensitive
[00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:19.900]   uh
[00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:25.020]   File format disc format some apps and games but older apps and games may not like it
[00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:29.100]   So let's I'm gonna authenticate don't show that
[00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:32.940]   And turn on file vault
[00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:37.100]   It gives you the key which I don't want to show that anyway
[00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:41.980]   Uh file vault two is all you can create I get it
[00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:46.780]   So just file vault is file vault two if you're using lions just like the new ipad
[00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:50.540]   Right. It's just file vault just file vault the second of
[00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:52.540]   the two
[00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:58.220]   All right. Anyway, it's not a weed. We talk about that because that is fairly important breaking news two different security flaws
[00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:01.740]   Yeah, both of which require physical access at least for now
[00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:07.980]   I mean, we we've been so complacent just feeling that our systems are not vulnerable to anything
[00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:09.820]   Yeah, as we just you know
[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:15.020]   Have been sort of the minority of the computer users, but now it's you know
[00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:19.660]   You can't just assume that everything's safe everybody's after us now it looks like
[00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:24.940]   But also kind of bears mentioning that apple doesn't have a really great record when I
[00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:30.300]   I really think I really wish they would respond to these sort of problems differently
[00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:33.580]   Uh, there's so many different reasons why they can't just necessarily
[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:37.820]   So in emails them with a problem they get her email back an hour later saying yes
[00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:41.900]   We verified it and gosh, this is a problem. Then three hours later. There's an update that's been patched
[00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:46.860]   Right, that's not possible, but I wish there were some there were a greater labor of transparency
[00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:54.460]   Uh, the fact that someone can report a problem like this and not even get a get a response or the claim to never receive a response from apple
[00:15:54.460 --> 00:16:00.700]   Saying that at least we thank you for your report. We do take security problems. Seriously. We're gonna take a look at it
[00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:03.100]   We may not we may or may not be able to tell you what we're doing
[00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:04.700]   But we're at least gonna take a look at it
[00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:08.940]   You at least need to know that so that your email went to the right place and at least you know
[00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:12.620]   You you you you set up a flare if people ignore it. Maybe you're maybe they will
[00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:15.660]   Maybe they won't but at least you set up a flare and someone saw it
[00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:21.100]   Yeah, do you think it might be apple not wanting to show that there is any weaknesses
[00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:26.540]   Padra sj in our chat room says it's just not in apples dna to acknowledge problems of any kind
[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:29.260]   You know it look how hard it was
[00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:33.660]   Uh for them to acknowledge antenna issues, you know took it took you know some real
[00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:36.620]   cage rattling
[00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:40.780]   They just I think that that comes from steve. I think that that's just kind of in there in there
[00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:42.780]   Uh, is it do you think in their dna?
[00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:45.340]   Well, that that's where there are no problems
[00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:49.900]   That's one that's one possibility, but when you're talking about security vulnerabilities in an operating system
[00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:53.340]   There are competing philosophies on what the best thing to do is
[00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:55.020]   Uh, it's
[00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:59.100]   It's I think it's absolutely true that the quicker you get the word out the more
[00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:04.460]   The the the the less of the vulnerability is even if it takes a while for the patch to be released
[00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:09.500]   I think that in principle you should always make sure your users are very aware of what's what's affecting their own machines
[00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:14.300]   at the same time you worry about the problem of uh, you're worried enough about
[00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:19.980]   Bad guys like really active bad guys who are writing malware or just need to
[00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:25.820]   Trying to break into individual target targets computers having access to uh, that those kind of bugs
[00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:31.580]   But what you really really worry about is just idiots jerks in your office who are not, you know
[00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:36.380]   Matthew broader grade hackers. They're just hey, look what I found in this message board. Hey, look
[00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:42.300]   I mean, Doug's computer. Hey everybody and that then it becomes a problem. That's actually, you know, probably a thousandfold
[00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:48.300]   Uh, it's I kind of think about the problems with the guys in the treasury department had where it's bad enough when you have
[00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:55.500]   uh, organized crime who's trying to counterfeit bills and putting all this money into them putting all this money into this counterfeiting operation and
[00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.460]   Doing it's in a sophisticated way in a targeted way
[00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:05.100]   But then when everybody got a color photocopier and now you got to deal with millions and millions of just people saying hey look
[00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:09.660]   I made a $20 bill. Let's see if I can spend it now. They're dealing with all of these
[00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:14.380]   So so I at least I do think apple should at least be a little bit more
[00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:19.420]   Open about how they deal with these sort of things, but I appreciate that there are different philosophies on what the best
[00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:25.180]   No, I think you're right and other companies do the same thing. It's that security via obscurity
[00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:31.180]   Versus being open and in general. I think that there's kind of agreement in the in the security community
[00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:33.900]   That what you do when you find a flaw like this
[00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:39.020]   Is you tell the appropriate people and you give them a reasonable amount of time to respond
[00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:44.140]   Uh, we usually give them with a patch right and then after a certain amount of time
[00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:48.380]   Um, no response then you might want to start publicizing it
[00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:53.180]   Especially if you see that hackers now know about it kind of has gotten around the community and people are doing something
[00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:56.940]   Then you might want to light the fire. I can remember this happening with microsoft years ago
[00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:00.380]   We had uh matt connevar on who was a hacker with woo woo
[00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:06.780]   And um, they had found a bug in windows that was I think they gave they gave microsoft almost a year to respond
[00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:10.220]   They never did they never fixed it and people were starting to use it
[00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:13.980]   So at that point woo says well, we we have to publish it was very controversial
[00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:16.540]   I remember this was more than 10 years ago. We have to publicize it
[00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:20.460]   Because the world knows about it and it's not microsoft is not doing anything
[00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:22.940]   So there is if you're right, there's this balance
[00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:28.140]   It becomes kind of complicated especially now that there are all these white hat conferences and which they're prizes for uh,
[00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:32.300]   Proponed own there there you have security experts who will find a vulnerability
[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:35.580]   But they're going to sit on it for six months because they know that they can make five grand
[00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:40.620]   In the first 10 minutes of of the con if they wait for a man kiminsky does that he admits it
[00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:44.780]   He sits on it. He waits. I got it. I'm gonna hold on. Don't tell anybody
[00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:47.580]   Um, you know if if apple
[00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.540]   I don't I don't think it hurts them to
[00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:56.540]   notify their you know their customers if there's any kind of a security thing
[00:19:56.540 --> 00:20:03.260]   I mean to me it's I feel more confident that they're looking out after us because you know, there's a there's that trust situation
[00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.260]   And I I think in this case
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:09.660]   When there's that smoke screen of not being vulnerable
[00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:14.460]   I think that it you know as these kind of stories break, right? It's going to start
[00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:19.100]   Eroading at some of the confidence we all have with them might even be bad for them to admit it
[00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:21.100]   But there's kind of an obligate
[00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:27.260]   Yeah, there's a moral obligation to acknowledge and fix a flaw that could cause a problem not just for an individual user
[00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:30.380]   But for the internet as a whole I just think there is an obligation to do that
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:34.940]   I think the other point that put Dan kiminsky probably would make is that all there's holes everywhere
[00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:37.340]   Everything it's all there was a
[00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:39.900]   Yeah, I tweeted this there's a wired magazine
[00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:45.340]   Article that says everyone's been hacked now what the premise basically
[00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:50.860]   Uh, look, you know every every software every program ever written has flaws in it
[00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:58.460]   Everybody is vulnerable. This is they talk they start with it talking about how Oak Ridge national laboratory where they make nukes
[00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.620]   Was hacked last year
[00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:03.980]   and uh, and they said basically the premise is nothing you can do it's
[00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:09.420]   We're all so the real thing is what would come up with some good security policies that do the best they can
[00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:11.740]   to protect us
[00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:13.740]   uh long term
[00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:16.380]   There's a picture Dan kiminsky in this article by the way
[00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:19.020]   He says I wonder what he's looking at he's
[00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:20.860]   What you looking at Dan?
[00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:26.540]   He says, uh, he's glad the security bubble is finally burst and people are realizing no network is immune from attack
[00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:30.140]   That means he says and by the way to network I would add operating system
[00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:39.180]   That means he says the security industry and its customers can finally face the uncomfortable fact that for what what they've been doing for years isn't working
[00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:45.340]   Uh, the premise of this article is everybody kind of does the same voodoo which doesn't work and says well
[00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:48.300]   We did what everybody says you do so that's all we're going to do
[00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:52.140]   So I think we're in a new age and maybe uh apple needs to uh
[00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:56.060]   Think about these things. I don't think physical attack problem, uh, you know
[00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:59.900]   Holes are nearly as big a problem as stuff that can come in over the internet
[00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:02.780]   Yeah, because somebody has to get your machine. So just don't let anybody get your machine
[00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:05.180]   We're gonna take a break come back with more
[00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:06.780]   Uh, we're talking tech
[00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:12.220]   Right now Andy and Akko is here from the chicago sun times and the website celestial waste of ban with daren akada
[00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.780]   From the asc.com
[00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:16.860]   cinematographer
[00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:20.940]   I should ask you what we'll come back and we'll ask you if there's anything cool and exciting
[00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:26.140]   We saw a really cool camera at uh several really cool cameras at nab
[00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:30.140]   And i'm just wondering when is that black magic camera gonna be a but first a word
[00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:32.780]   About carbonite
[00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:34.780]   online backup when you're talking about security
[00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:40.620]   Uh, one of the thing one of the important things that maybe we forget is that it's not merely locking down your system
[00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:45.260]   It's making sure you have copies of your data in a safe and secure place so that you can get it back
[00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:47.500]   And that's what carbonite is all about
[00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:50.220]   online unlimited
[00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:54.700]   continuous backup for those files those irreplaceable files
[00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:59.580]   That you you just can't afford to lose and it's as little as 59 dollars a year per computer
[00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:03.980]   That's a great deal, but here's an even better deal try for free for two weeks
[00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:07.900]   Just go to carbonite ca r b o n i t e dot com of course it works on a mac
[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:11.420]   They've got a mac on their front page. That's how you know it works on a mac
[00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:14.780]   carbonite dot com use the offer code mac break
[00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:19.500]   And uh, you've got two weeks free. You don't even need a credit card. See that's a mac
[00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:22.780]   It's kind of an old mac it's titanium. I think right?
[00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.340]   It's very compatible. Great
[00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:30.860]   Backwards compatibility. I love it stock photo. They probably got it on pine five, right
[00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:37.500]   Carbonite dot com offer code mac break and then if you decide to buy and I know you will
[00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.260]   I use it on all my machines
[00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:44.380]   Uh, you're gonna you're gonna want to use mac break again because that'll give you 14 months for the price of 12 to three months
[00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:46.300]   with pichis
[00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:48.300]   Of a year subscription
[00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:50.860]   Carbonite dot com it's backup done
[00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:53.980]   Right. Well, I'm gonna move on to something cheerier
[00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:57.100]   Cheerier happier
[00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:58.940]   Something positive what did you
[00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:05.100]   Which you know after post morning na b you've had a few weeks to get over it. Yeah, we were there of course, jerem was there
[00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:06.940]   Um
[00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:11.420]   Canon showed those great cinematographer cameras right 10 foot is 15,000 to 30,000
[00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:18.060]   And then black magic. I think steals their thunder with the black magic cinema camera for 2,500 bucks steals your thunder
[00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:22.460]   4k camera. I understand it's it's a great camera for
[00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:27.660]   Being purpose built because it's a box. It's just a sensor. Yeah, it's a sensor
[00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:32.860]   It's a box if you're gonna mount it on a tripod. That's cool. The price price point. It's great
[00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:39.100]   Why do you say man on a tripod? Is that that rolling shutter jelly roll? No, it's just at the the shape of the camera
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:40.940]   It's like it's kind of fun. It's like a fat
[00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:45.100]   A big iPad here, you know, I like it because it uses my existing lenses
[00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:50.540]   Like my Nikon or cannon lens. Well, you can you can get mounts for a lot of different cameras, but I
[00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:58.860]   So it's not a threat to red or a cannon. No, it's it's in a different price price range. It's um, it's more for people normal people. Yeah
[00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:02.220]   Um, I actually last night
[00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:09.180]   I mean, you know na b had a lot of things and sort of the shakeout from it now is when they're people rolling things out, right?
[00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:10.300]   Right, um
[00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:13.660]   There's a there's with the high end cameras the 4k cameras
[00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:19.420]   The workflow issues are being worked out yet. I thought that was really interesting a lot of what we saw at an a b
[00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:25.180]   Was not about hardware was that how do you solve the problems that you are created by these giant video files?
[00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:26.700]   Exactly. What do you do with them?
[00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:31.660]   And the files when they come out or if you're talking like red raw files, right or
[00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:35.020]   Cannon all these 4k cameras have to be
[00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:40.620]   De-bear or de-mozick they take the pattern because of the the bandwidth that comes off the chip
[00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:45.580]   Comes off so fast 24 frames a second that it doesn't combine
[00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:46.940]   Um
[00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:49.980]   All of the the color pixels you need to create a picture
[00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:55.180]   It's it's like a raw photo that you would do when you steal camera you can get all the informations there you can get it back
[00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:59.180]   But the word where the files. Yeah, blow up is
[00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:03.980]   De-bearing it and then you get too much information. Yeah now you have a composite image
[00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:09.420]   But uh, but to do that workflow is what they're all working through now
[00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:11.900]   Right because you want you need to do it as fast as you can
[00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:18.300]   So we have 4k projectors and theaters. I think the question then is when do we get 4k projectors at homework 4k
[00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:25.740]   I think that's gonna be pretty close. I think we're interested a year too often. Yeah, I think next ces you're gonna see 4k in the home
[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:28.220]   So according to cult of mack leander connie writing
[00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:34.380]   Our our source who the unnamed source has seen the apple tv
[00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:37.500]   It's real and here's what it looks like
[00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:43.980]   Now I think that was speculative. I think what doesn't look like that picture. Um, no, I think this picture
[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.340]   If you're watching video and you're seeing a picture of robert redford not that
[00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:56.300]   We have a source says lander who has seen a prototype claims to have seen a prototype apple high definition television set in action
[00:26:56.860 --> 00:27:01.900]   Of course now I I I think we've heard from many people that we've seen these for years in action, right?
[00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:06.700]   So I don't know if that's meaningful according to the source who was asked to remain strictly anonymous
[00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:13.500]   The apple httv looks like an apple led backlit cinema display, but is quote much bigger
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:19.180]   That's almost like an iMac. I don't know. Is it 27? Is it 52? Is it 134? I don't know
[00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:23.260]   I think if they're gonna enter the television market. They've got a start at 32 to 4
[00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:25.580]   Nobody's gonna buy a tv that's less than that for sure
[00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:31.020]   But this and I think the standard is now really 50 right 47 or 50
[00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:36.780]   Any anybody who's making an investment in televisions getting a 42 inch or 50 inch if not bigger
[00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:44.860]   No, I I set up my projector last night and I projected on the wall with my 55 inch and this makes the 55 like this thing
[00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:50.780]   And you really what happens is your expectation is just scale right and so pretty soon
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:56.140]   I mean we're talking about a 42 inch tv 10 years ago. That's huge. Yeah now. It's like well
[00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:59.580]   That's not so big huge and huge in price. It was like $10,000
[00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:07.660]   The according to the lander built in eyesight camera for making free facetime video conference calls now. This is interesting. It has siri
[00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:10.940]   According to this guy
[00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:16.700]   Fine twit tv and it of course supports airplay. Yeah, wouldn't that be cool watch twit
[00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:19.500]   Hey, siri
[00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:21.740]   See that
[00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:25.820]   The series the thing that always comes up when we when we speculate about an apple tv
[00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:32.220]   And man even just today. I was using ipad voice recognition to respond to an email and
[00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:37.500]   I don't want I hate a remote control on a tv where the button is a little bit soft
[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:42.700]   And I had to push it three four times. Make you see what I want the second time that's I have to say
[00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:46.460]   The rifle man. Yeah, he said siri
[00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:53.740]   Fine. I'm in the mood for chuck conners that rifle man. Honey. I didn't mean to put that
[00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:58.860]   I was watching the Simpsons. I said the rifle man
[00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:02.300]   But this this photo that's on here, I guess is a
[00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:06.300]   Of what what it could look like
[00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:07.900]   um
[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:14.220]   What you know what what are the advantages of it being all in one unless the picture quality is going to be something that they
[00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:17.260]   Dean is ole d
[00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:19.660]   I mean, I led into this with a 4k thing
[00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:23.500]   I mean, I think if apple may be made a really high res display. I don't know
[00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:30.860]   Um, and the other thing is this could have been something which just cobbled together a cinema display an apple tv
[00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:33.340]   siri
[00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:35.820]   It's not clear. Although according to this story
[00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:38.540]   Uh, it's something they want to release
[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:42.860]   Our source is well placed and has provided us with great tips in the past
[00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:45.260]   However, not all of them have panned out
[00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:50.620]   Due to the fact our source tends to see products in the prototype or early development stage
[00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:56.620]   Oh, and it says they're speculating it. It's it's nothing exotic like oily dia 4k
[00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:59.820]   Which means it'll be oily d and 4k
[00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:03.900]   Art you're right. They're going for the double bluff exactly
[00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:10.860]   Um, they discovered a brand new color that only this monitor will be able to reproduce
[00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:13.580]   So if you want to see deep
[00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:16.380]   Naturalistic freely saturated blurb
[00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:19.020]   You're gonna have to go to apple with
[00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:24.700]   An interesting point here is that with with the the ipad being
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:29.100]   More more resolution than uh than hd tv
[00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:37.660]   I would think that for apple to make a really cool product. It would be more than a resolution more than hd tv
[00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:42.700]   I mean, it's it's a tough why not? Yeah, why not go that and then offer on itunes, you know
[00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:46.860]   Yeah, 1280 by 1090 and you can exactly
[00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:50.380]   Not just that but for for the gaming experience certainly
[00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:57.740]   Uh for for the photo experience to simply say that we can't we can show you photos that are even better than what you can get it best by
[00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:02.380]   Uh, and it only costs you extra you know at what 900 dollars a thousand dollars
[00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:05.660]   You know, this is but here's but here's here's another area which
[00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:10.700]   I I have always had to preface this by saying I don't i'm not skeptical. It's just that I don't understand
[00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:13.020]   I can't I can't imagine
[00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:18.300]   What apple sees is a priority and what apple thinks they can so the the difficulty is that
[00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:21.740]   hd tv even if even just a 1080 hd tv
[00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:23.820]   Has to be
[00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:25.820]   pretty pretty big before
[00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:31.100]   Uh, it becomes a retinus. Uh, the advantage is it become truly retinigrade where
[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:39.020]   The if you if you sitting at the apex that holy triangle that's that next that that's certain distance from the screen before you can really tell the difference
[00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:41.260]   between 1080 and even 720
[00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:43.660]   so i'm
[00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:48.460]   It's just another question mark that i've added to a big bag full of question marks if apple were to do a greater than
[00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:50.300]   1080 resolution screen
[00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:55.100]   Could they do it in such a way that someone sitting on a sofa would actually appreciate the difference between that and 1080?
[00:31:55.100 --> 00:32:00.940]   Well, you know, andy this this is actually the evil plan looks like it's it's it's actually materializing that
[00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:09.260]   What a great way to get people to only use itunes as your as your source to rent movies because it's 2048
[00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:11.980]   Beyond hd and you can play it on the new apple tv
[00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:19.980]   What if I mean that but my confusion is that apple always makes a big deal about how
[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:25.660]   Every time they use the term retinites about the the minimum resolving resolution of the human eye
[00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:31.660]   And then what if at the press conference the first question asked is yeah, but according to your own math
[00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:34.940]   Nobody's going to be able the human eye cannot tell the difference between your
[00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:39.100]   $2,000 tv and a $1,200 tv made by sony
[00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:46.220]   Because you're unfortunately there there are no there there are no jaguars in the audience of my living room
[00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:48.860]   It's human eyes that we're dealing with here
[00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:50.780]   so
[00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:54.540]   Why would why would they create a screen that's higher resolution than the human I could really make out
[00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:57.180]   Because they can sell the movies
[00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:59.180]   Oh, no, no
[00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:06.460]   I I have to say I have I I am still highly skeptical about this. I just don't buy it and uh,
[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:09.340]   I just don't see them doing this
[00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:10.940]   I'm not I'm not skeptical
[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:15.740]   I mean if there's there's so many signs right now that such a thing is being worked on whether i know we keep hearing this
[00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:17.740]   This this year next year or never
[00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:18.220]   uh
[00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:19.740]   My disconnect is that uh
[00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:25.020]   So there's so many other apple products where I really do have strong opinions that uh if if I have paid
[00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:28.940]   If I have a paying attention if the conclusion that I've drawn about apple and what they feel their messages
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:36.060]   Makes sense that I don't believe that this product will have that feature or that product that would be of any interest apple at all
[00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:39.740]   When it comes to an apple branded tv, I just don't know
[00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:41.340]   I mean
[00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:46.460]   This could this could be like uh like an apple branded camera where I feel I feel as though
[00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:51.100]   Oh, yeah, exactly. Why why would why would apple get into that market? I have to dismiss that out of hand
[00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:55.660]   Or is it more like the iPad where it's like I understand the concept of a tablet
[00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:59.660]   I can understand the concept of how apple why apple would want to get into that market
[00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:05.420]   But I don't feel as though I can predict exactly how apple would build a tablet and what that would look like
[00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:06.860]   And I'm sure they would make a lot
[00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:11.660]   It would make perfect sense when they make it that this is why apple felt as though they could really disrupt them
[00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:16.300]   The existing market with their own attitude and their own idea for for tv set
[00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:18.700]   Yeah, we have to I mean that's always the standard disclaimer
[00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:22.860]   We didn't I didn't think they'd make a phone, you know who wanted who would want to get in the cell phone business
[00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:25.180]   And apple in fact turns out didn't want to get in the cell phone business
[00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:27.500]   They wanted to make their own, but they just couldn't
[00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:32.780]   Um who would want it right what would be cool about a tablet? How could they possibly uh?
[00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:36.380]   You know succeed in a sector that Microsoft failed in for 10 years. So
[00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:41.580]   Yes, you're right. We acknowledge that at least I acknowledge I have no idea. We are doing it
[00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:44.540]   I am but an imperfect vessel for the university. Yes
[00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:48.540]   Long to talk in rumors. I think this is interesting
[00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:50.460]   um
[00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:54.860]   A 799 $799 macbook air kind of a response
[00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:59.420]   To the low priced ultra books. Although I have to say the best ultra books are the same price
[00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:01.660]   Basically as an air there they started
[00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:06.940]   That's that's like saying that like the the avengers movie is marvel's answer to the green lantern movie
[00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:09.420]   You know
[00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:15.180]   I really don't think that apple is very intimidated by the success of the ultra book concept at this point
[00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:21.020]   And that they would do anything to really respond to it unless unless they were they found themselves in a position where they could produce
[00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:25.100]   A substantially different version of the 11 inch air
[00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:27.740]   That is so good that at
[00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:30.460]   $999 it's still a really impressive
[00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:33.740]   Device and that they could take the existing
[00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:37.260]   Macbook air and do what they did with the ipad to simply say okay
[00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:39.180]   We're gonna knock 150 dollars off the price
[00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:42.140]   And so now there is now there's going to be an 850
[00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:46.860]   MacBook air for a 11 inch model that has two year two year old processor minute
[00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:51.660]   But still very very good and very very capable of running iLife iWork and accessing iCloud
[00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:55.180]   But if you want the really cool sandy bridge processor for the exact same price
[00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:57.580]   We'll give you a larger storage. We'll give you it
[00:35:57.580 --> 00:36:03.580]   We'll give you a three thunderbolt ports because that's how strongly we feel about this new standard and keep that as the price at $999
[00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:09.340]   But otherwise, I don't feel as though they're feeling any pressure from I don't think so the only case I would make for $799 air
[00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:12.940]   And it's the only case and it's a very limited case is that they they
[00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:16.620]   No longer have an inexpensive education product
[00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:20.940]   They dumped the polycarbonate white macbook and the reason i'm aware of this is the school
[00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:23.260]   I'm on the board of my my kids high school
[00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:26.140]   And they have a what they call a one-to-one program
[00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:32.380]   When you as you come in as a freshman you get a laptop and you keep it for all four years and it has been the white macbook
[00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:35.500]   And I said why don't you know they killed the my map book?
[00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:37.180]   I said why don't you go to the macbook air and they said well
[00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:42.460]   It's you know even that few hundred dollars more is too much. We can't afford it. Well, it's applied by all the students. Yeah, it's the losters
[00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:44.780]   uh, so
[00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:48.460]   They're actually I think I hate to say this but I think they're gonna go to a windows machine
[00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:51.580]   Which just kills me in fact if I can talk them out of it
[00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:55.180]   I will but they just cannot afford new to buy a mac
[00:36:55.180 --> 00:37:00.300]   And so that would be the one argument for a low-cost something is the education market
[00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:05.340]   I sincerely think that apple when when people make that complaint to them apples answer as well
[00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:11.900]   We have this wonderful $399 computer called the iPad that is even better for education than maybe even more appropriate
[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:14.700]   Than a windows notebook and even more appropriate than a mac
[00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:20.780]   I've advised them not to get it. I agree and I think the iPad especially the new one is is a lot closer than ever
[00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:25.260]   But I just don't see a student writing a paper on an iPad. Oh, you need a keyboard
[00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:32.620]   Yeah, but then that's but then yeah, then you're you're pretty much making a mac book about cheap air
[00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:39.660]   Still cheap right yeah through a three three ninety nine plus 69 dollars for an apple for an apple wireless keyboard
[00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:46.540]   That's still that your five hundred bucks and still one full thing or you can I think there's still concerns about durability
[00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:50.940]   Uh, and I think they're because I mean I don't think an iPad is particularly robust
[00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:55.020]   And I think there's also a concern about how people work
[00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:59.580]   I mean I find it hard to do research and write a paper on a screen that doesn't have windows
[00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:02.940]   Yeah, I agree with doing yeah lowercase windows. Yeah
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:07.500]   I I think I think they're their advantages to be to eat to either one of them
[00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:13.020]   That the devil's advocate position is that a windows notebook or even a mac book isn't a really good book reader
[00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:17.020]   It really isn't great for us for advanced kinds of course wear
[00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:24.700]   Uh, and it isn't now it isn't that and the battery life is such that you really do have to keep the students tethered towards towards power
[00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:26.460]   Most of the time
[00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:32.300]   But and speaking speaking at with the full authority as somebody who has only one dependent and that's a stuff
[00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:35.420]   Toy Dalmatian dog as opposed to the two or three kids
[00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:38.540]   Gate grades k through 12
[00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:44.940]   But I I do keep it closer to what my friends with with kids are up to and yeah, I mean that's the story
[00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:50.300]   That's played out in every single school system. It's tricky. More than more than more than we're seeing the credibility of an iPad
[00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:55.980]   Uh because of the cost benefit because of the fact that it's a very very low maintenance sort of thing
[00:38:55.980 --> 00:39:00.540]   And it's very there very few things that a kid can do outside of dropping it to screw up an iPad
[00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:07.900]   We're not just talking about dropping. We're talking about. Oh god. Why is this kid downloading this? Why did there's a lot to be said for that
[00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:13.340]   By the visiting this site and downloading this sort of malware, but it's it's it's a it's a spread spectrum problem. Yeah, no
[00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:15.340]   There's there's a lot to be said for that. Um
[00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:18.300]   however, uh
[00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:22.380]   For whatever reason this school I think is going to get a there's a 500 dollar Lenovo
[00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:27.900]   Education model model that they're going to go for and and I think that
[00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:33.020]   They just they looked at the iPad and they really and I think quite rightly I think that look when you it's education
[00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:39.900]   You don't want to experiment with kids future, right? Yeah, so and when you buy an iPad as a friend coming freshman, you're kind of making a commitment
[00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:42.300]   and
[00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:43.820]   For four years
[00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:46.940]   And the other thing is that you have to you have to think about support infrastructure
[00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:51.500]   Where if you're if you need to hire or or subcontract a group that's going to keep
[00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:56.620]   Keep 500 copies of this device running and all the software running at the same time
[00:39:57.100 --> 00:40:03.420]   The the pool of candidates for that job on windows is vastly greater than the pool of candidates who can do that job on an iPad
[00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:06.780]   So it's a lot of variables there's and I think also now
[00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:13.180]   Let me ask you but it seems to me that if you give kids an iPad the assumption is they have a computer still at home, right?
[00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:18.060]   That's that there be their only computer. Well, they would need they would need Wi-Fi access at home
[00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:20.940]   So you would assume there'd be another computer at home, right?
[00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:24.940]   I don't know. I'd like to experiment but not with my kids
[00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:28.380]   I mean, I I don't think apple
[00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:31.740]   On your kids but not with you. Well, you know, it's interesting neither abbey nor henry
[00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:35.820]   And I've offered both of my pads has any interest. They don't want iPads they both have laptops
[00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:39.500]   Abby has an air and uh, no, she has a 13-inch macbook
[00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:44.220]   Pro and he has a 13-inch white macbook and neither one has an interest in an air
[00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:48.460]   For whatever iPad iPad for whatever reason
[00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:50.140]   I
[00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:52.620]   Wonder if that's going to change the next couple of years because
[00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:56.860]   I talked about this last week. I spent my week in aryland the only computer
[00:40:56.860 --> 00:41:04.220]   I bought what I brought was an iPad and and a keyboard and it worked just fine even though I was doing a lot more than just
[00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:07.980]   Just you know emailing people and twittering of pictures from the day
[00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:12.940]   So as we get more muscular apps and as more that infrastructure gets built out
[00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:18.940]   We might see that we might see those decisions going the other way next year. Yeah, it's really interesting
[00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:26.780]   And challenging and it's I guess the sad thing is that you know apples education computer now is a thousand bucks instead of a hundred bucks
[00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:31.980]   And that's a significant difference from the point of view of a school who's buying, you know hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:35.820]   Um, that would be my only argument for a cheap
[00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:44.860]   Because apple's not going to make a 799 air because of an ultra book because the ultra book you won't get the mac OS
[00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:47.020]   No, I don't think they're challenged by the ultra books at all
[00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:50.380]   In fact, everything we've seen is the ultra books don't sell anyway, right
[00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:55.980]   Uh, but that's for a lot of reasons one of which is there's a new version of windows coming out in the fall and people in wind
[00:41:55.980 --> 00:42:00.380]   And windows world historically when people know there's another version of windows, especially one that's so different
[00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:06.140]   Uh, which means different hardware touch hardware and so forth. I think they just say well, we'll wait no problem. We'll wait till the fall
[00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:08.700]   When windows xp isn't that bad?
[00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:14.540]   This isn't a Pentium 2 this is a Pentium 3. Yeah, okay, okay, okay
[00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:17.340]   Hey, let's take a break come back with more
[00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:21.180]   Dara no kata andi and ako and you talking
[00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:24.860]   About max and ios and all that stuff
[00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:27.580]   Now I know a lot of you have websites
[00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:31.660]   Uh, some frequently though. I think people are looking for where I get calls all the time
[00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:33.420]   Well, what's the best hosting?
[00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:39.180]   And I often will say look at what you want is something. It's more than just hosting you want square space. It's hosting
[00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:46.940]   Plus analytics plus software plus 24/7 support. It's really the best place to create an amazing website
[00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:52.300]   I want you to visit squarespace.com if you haven't been there lately you've got to take a look they've really updated it
[00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:59.260]   There's new templates. There's the new google fonts 300 fonts. They have android ipad and iphone apps
[00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:04.700]   That don't just let you post by the way, but moderate comments look at stats all of that stuff
[00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:09.580]   You know, it's really a full uh and really nicely done interface to your uh, your website
[00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:11.660]   blogs photo galleries
[00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:16.460]   E commerce all works great with squarespace.com
[00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:19.420]   I was talking to aden. I think he's in a chat room who uh
[00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:25.180]   Who does the he's the webmaster for the nordic light photography festival that I was at christianson
[00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:31.100]   Nle dot n o and he was uh, he moved them all to squarespace
[00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:36.540]   So everything in fact, I think the whole town of christianson is now going squarespace basically
[00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:42.540]   Um his blog here. We are recording. We went up into a tower in christianson and recorded
[00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:46.460]   That's bruce davinson is one of the best photographers in the world. You would love his stuff
[00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:50.940]   Uh, and he does uh, he's a street photographer brilliant guy. You've seen many of his
[00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:58.300]   Because anyways squarespace entirely everything not only for the festival for the blog for personal blogs adenga is
[00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:01.980]   I think if squarespace suddenly notices a a
[00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:08.460]   Blip a cluster of new users in christians in norway you can thank aden ghost
[00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:13.340]   Who's done this because he just and he loves it. It looks great. It really does
[00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:17.740]   The nice thing about squarespaces every site is unique you start with their great templates

[00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:40.300]   Um

[00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:52.940]   Apple fears nothing
[00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:55.100]   Certainly not puny ultra books
[00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:59.820]   I do have it. I'm going to review for before you buy the new del xps 13 ultra book

[00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:06.940]   I7
[00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:10.060]   Thin light beautiful aluminum, you know all that
[00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:18.220]   Um, it's just a macbook air. I will not I will not make fun of these manufacturers for copying of really correct design. Exactly
[00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:20.540]   That's just smart. That's just smart
[00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:23.740]   Thanks. Thanks for the rnd rnd investment of apple
[00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:26.860]   We we want i'll take up take up the torch that you didn't drop
[00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:31.580]   So one more rumor will kind of cover and this is uh the liquid metal
[00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:37.420]   And I don't even think this is a rumor the the guy who created liquid metal, which is a new uh metal metallic alloy apple has used it
[00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:41.580]   In a very trivial way, you know the sim
[00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:45.900]   Uh the poker that removes the sim and the iphon that's made of liquid metal
[00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:51.500]   But he says they're going to use it in a very significant way going forward
[00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:54.140]   And that's when the rumor mill went crazy
[00:47:54.140 --> 00:48:00.620]   Saying oh must be the iphone five. I don't know if times or I don't I this is early days in this process
[00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:05.100]   Uh, I don't I don't know if they can actually use liquid metal to do something like a uni body
[00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:07.340]   Yeah, I think they have they do have a
[00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:12.460]   A period where he they have to figure out the fabrication. Yeah, there's a lot of yeah
[00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:18.060]   It may be a ways off. It really is like that seen in star trek to where you have the secrets of transparent aluminum
[00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:21.820]   But you have not yet figured out exactly how to manufacture and actually use it right?
[00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:24.380]   However, we go ahead
[00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:28.300]   Oh, so also from the the quote from the context of the interview that I read
[00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:31.660]   I think that he was when he was saying that it's going to be used in a breakthrough product
[00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:39.260]   My interpretation within within context of the interview wasn't that there is a specific breakthrough product that apple is targeting this towards
[00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:43.020]   More that there is going to there is in sometime in the future
[00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:47.260]   There's going to be a design problem for which liquid metal is the perfect solution
[00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:51.100]   And at that time they're going to find that they've solved the engineering problems
[00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:55.180]   And they've been waiting to not just say we're not going to make a macbook air out of liquid metal
[00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:57.180]   Just so that we can say we made it out of liquid metal
[00:48:57.180 --> 00:49:02.220]   Right, we're going to make sure that this the solution to a problem remember remember the the titanium power book
[00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:07.180]   That was cool cool material really look great on a poster
[00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:13.740]   Then you realize that yeah, it's it's great for the skin of an airplane not that great for skin of a notebook
[00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:16.140]   I mean it got cracks. It got it got tears
[00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:20.860]   Right, uh, I think in the first one there they didn't understand how it would affect the shielding
[00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:24.380]   on the internal on the internal uh, wi-fi antennas
[00:49:24.380 --> 00:49:28.540]   So there's i'm sure that they're smart enough to not make that mistake again
[00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:32.220]   I'm just looking for rumors about the iphone five
[00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:35.900]   I think this is what they're waiting to do the apple tv in
[00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:40.620]   Oh, yeah liquid metal it'll be like determinator three or it's their breakthrough product
[00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:45.500]   Yeah, you can lift it up one finger. I think I think they're going to do like the 30th century mac
[00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:48.140]   Whereas they will screw it because 90 000
[00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:52.700]   Why not it's made it's made out of unobtainium it hovers over your desk
[00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:58.380]   Why not and and blue cat-like creatures will put a three foot long arrow through your heart for buying ones
[00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:01.260]   so
[00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:02.460]   so uh
[00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:06.140]   It is notable that apple has decided to uh sue
[00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:11.180]   Uh to gain control of the domain iphone five dot com
[00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:14.700]   Or not
[00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:19.900]   They probably sue for every iphone very actually right the fact that has the word iphone and it is good enough
[00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:23.020]   See i'm just trying to find some rumors that
[00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:27.660]   That's that's okay. It's after the apple tv stuff. It's good
[00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:30.860]   I would have been a bit of a something solid
[00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:32.620]   Yeah
[00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:38.540]   I love this the at and t you I don't know did you talk about this last week the uh the the ceo of at and t randal
[00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:43.180]   Stevenson saying the most mistake i ever made was offering unlimited data on the iphone
[00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:46.540]   No, I think that was after the show. He says
[00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:52.220]   He wished the company had never offered an unlimited data plan for the device and he loses sleep
[00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:56.780]   He loses sleep over free texting services like iMessage
[00:50:57.100 --> 00:51:04.380]   Okay, the reason why he's losing sleep is that he keeps all those bundles of thousand dollar bills in the mattress
[00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:09.180]   Yeah, okay if he went to it's like one of those memory foam mattresses he'd do just fine
[00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:12.140]   If a team t hadn't offered unlimited data
[00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:17.180]   It would have been able to get people who use more data pay to pay up as opposed to having the light users
[00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:19.500]   Subsidize the heavy ones
[00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:25.100]   Yeah, because every remember you forget how quickly they withdrew the unlimited data plan
[00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:29.740]   Right and how many how many iPhones and how many iPads have been sold since they they turned that off
[00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:31.980]   They they turned that off like after what six weeks
[00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:35.980]   Of with new the new ipad buyers can no longer get unlimited data
[00:51:35.980 --> 00:51:38.380]   Uh, and we also forget
[00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:42.780]   AT&T was sort of a second tier maybe even a third tier carrier
[00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:45.740]   Uh before the iphone hit iphone really helped
[00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:48.380]   AT&T build itself up they
[00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:50.860]   They poured enough money to
[00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:54.460]   Excuse me they they were definitely a second or third tier third tier character
[00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:59.500]   Carrier back then and the fact that they did whatever they had to do to close that deal and get the iphone
[00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:02.300]   I think on balance has to be one of the smartest things ever
[00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:06.460]   I mean you can you can regret the fact that you still have i don't know how many
[00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:10.540]   Subscribers that are still getting $30 a month all you can eat access
[00:52:10.540 --> 00:52:12.380]   But I mean
[00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:13.820]   Is he is he saying that?
[00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:18.620]   AT&T is doing nothing to throttle down like after after you get i don't know towards
[00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:20.860]   30 gigabytes of usage a month
[00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:24.380]   Maybe the bandwidth goes down 3 percent has he ever thought about that?
[00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:27.420]   Is he tempted to do that or is he actually doing that right now?
[00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:31.740]   Uh, so yeah, I think he's doing it if you go past two gigabytes as a matter of fact, but
[00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:36.540]   Um, but he's he's trying to blame iMessage as stealing money
[00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:43.660]   I'll guess this last quarter at and t made 6.1 billion dollars on mobile data
[00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:47.580]   6.1 billion on mobile data alone
[00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:52.460]   70 percent of the people on tier data plans are buying the most expensive option
[00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:56.060]   70 percent we're all going to i'll take whatever you can get
[00:52:56.060 --> 00:52:59.420]   Um, he says you lie awake
[00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:03.420]   You lie awake at night
[00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:08.940]   No worrying about that which will disrupt your business model iMessage is a classic example
[00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:13.420]   If you're using iMessage, you're not using one of our messaging services, right?
[00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:18.460]   That's disruptive to our messaging revenue stream. I'd like to know how much money they make on SMS mess
[00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:22.860]   You know if their phone service was better, you wouldn't have to iMessage you can just talk to them
[00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:30.940]   But also i i i feel as though this statement from him comes with an implied warranty of make fun ability
[00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:35.980]   So we let so let's go through all the things that have not been keeping him awake at night
[00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:43.660]   Children starving to death in a world doesn't bother in it. Okay. No the species dying by species dying off by the thousands
[00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:48.940]   Leopelessly ignorance want sleeping like a baby
[00:53:48.940 --> 00:53:54.140]   Exactly, but the fact that but the fact that not enough people are paying 25 cents per text message
[00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:56.620]   That gets him just in
[00:53:56.620 --> 00:54:03.260]   Now i have to say he's at michael milkins global institute congress, so i don't know maybe he felt like this was a
[00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:06.540]   No audience that would just you get me you really get me
[00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:14.140]   He's it is true that the mobile industry worldwide is suffering a decline in text messaging
[00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:18.700]   But not in the united states text messaging is still growing it's growing more slowly
[00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:23.820]   Uh, but it's such a big revenue stream life. We did the calculation once if you paid 20 cents
[00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:26.460]   per mess per 160 character message
[00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:31.020]   It's like $2,000 a megabyte of data. I mean some are ridiculous amount
[00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:38.380]   Um, so maybe at some point they will let make less money on texting than they do now, but it's but it's not today
[00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:40.060]   It's not tomorrow
[00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:42.060]   Uh, he also said skype
[00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:48.940]   Poise poses a threat now that's that's true right? Yeah, but he doesn't regret the decision to support the smartphone
[00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:51.580]   Oh, yeah
[00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:53.580]   The phone that's made at tt
[00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:55.580]   Atnt right now
[00:54:55.580 --> 00:55:02.140]   Also touch tone was a great idea in retrospect. He was chairman of the singular board at the time singing it was singular
[00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:04.620]   This is how long ago when steve jobs first approached?
[00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:07.980]   Uh at the time singular
[00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:15.180]   Uh, mr. Jobs met with remember stan sigma remember when stan sigma walked on stage in the apple of iphone announcement
[00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:17.420]   He was the ceo at singular
[00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:21.900]   Uh at after the meeting mr. Sigma approached the board to talk about a quote unique opportunity
[00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:23.900]   He hadn't even seen a picture of the iphone
[00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:28.060]   But he described a device with a touch screen that one would use to make calls do email and run apps
[00:55:28.060 --> 00:55:30.300]   The board was nervous
[00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:34.700]   By the way, I don't think that he said run apps because there were no apps in the original iphone, but
[00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:42.620]   The board was nervous so this is a little revisionist about the apple smartphone because it was aware that it would transform its business model
[00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:46.860]   This just tells you why big companies suck
[00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:50.060]   It could it could change things
[00:55:50.060 --> 00:55:53.900]   Uh, I remember asking the question he said mr. Stevenson
[00:55:53.900 --> 00:56:00.380]   Are we investing in a business model? Are we investing in a product or are we investing in steve jobs?
[00:56:00.380 --> 00:56:04.620]   The answer was you're investing in steve jobs. Let's go
[00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:06.620]   [Laughter]
[00:56:06.620 --> 00:56:12.940]   Wow, wow, but that that just shows you why
[00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:18.780]   These you know the record industry tv industry the phone self-unindustry why they suck so bad
[00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:23.180]   Because anything that changes the business model for good or bad
[00:56:23.180 --> 00:56:28.300]   Makes them lose sleep. Yeah, they're scared then they don't want to change anything
[00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:31.420]   like to
[00:56:31.420 --> 00:56:33.100]   to be to be
[00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:39.420]   To back off a little bit because I'm feeling a little bit guilty because I did say that he cares more about money loss from text messaging than children
[00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:43.580]   Dies, you might be losing sleep for many reasons. Maybe I should exactly there were many reasons allude sleep
[00:56:43.580 --> 00:56:48.540]   Perhaps it's like the third Thursday of the month is the day I lose sleep because I had clams for dinner. I mean, you know
[00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:52.780]   You can lose sleep for a lot of reasons exactly
[00:56:52.780 --> 00:57:00.300]   Um, it's it really it is difficult to imagine when you when you have a system that's worked for you for decades that
[00:57:01.020 --> 00:57:05.820]   Put put your dollar here at in 30 days. We'll get $1.40 from over here
[00:57:05.820 --> 00:57:12.380]   When someone comes up to you and says that here is a way that will be that will ensure that your we you'll still be making money five
[00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:18.780]   Years from now, but you have to have a little bit of faith that that won't shoot that won't destroy your your 10-year-old way of making money
[00:57:18.780 --> 00:57:23.180]   That is a leap of faith. That is a leap of logic and not a whole lot of companies are capable of doing that right
[00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:25.420]   so
[00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:30.620]   I'll tell you this was such a benefit to AT&T that sprint when it got the opportunity to get the iPhone was willing to sync
[00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:32.700]   $15 billion
[00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:39.340]   Into the iPhone in fact, they pay a $200 higher subsidy per device than on any other phone they sell at sprint
[00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:43.260]   And of course still they wanted it, but apparently the shareholders were a little peeved
[00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:47.100]   So sprint CEOs Dan Hesse is going to take a pay cut
[00:57:47.100 --> 00:57:51.340]   He's going to lose three and a quarter million dollars in his salary
[00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:54.140]   because
[00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:56.860]   to i guess to mollify shareholders who
[00:57:56.860 --> 00:57:59.580]   Say you spent too much to get the iPhone
[00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:04.940]   They sold sprints sold 1.5 million iPhones in the first quarter
[00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:08.620]   1.8 million in a q4
[00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:15.820]   and 44% of the new iPhones sold during q1 were customers who had not been spring customers before
[00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:17.580]   Wow new customers
[00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:24.140]   660,000 new customers, you know shareholders you might back off Dan a little bit. Yeah, bringing in business give him a break
[00:58:24.140 --> 00:58:25.660]   long-term business
[00:58:25.660 --> 00:58:27.260]   give him a break
[00:58:27.260 --> 00:58:31.820]   I wonder if he's losing any sleep three and a quarter million dollars a year. I'd lose some sleep
[00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:38.620]   T-Mobile has does not have the iPhone. There's the guy who should be losing sleep
[00:58:38.620 --> 00:58:43.340]   Whoever's in charge of T-Mobile is making a ton of money off a text messaging, right?
[00:58:43.340 --> 00:58:47.420]   Right. Hey, I don't have to worry because we have text messaging
[00:58:47.420 --> 00:58:52.780]   T-Mobile is though going to roll out a 4g network that's compatible with the iPhone
[00:58:53.740 --> 00:58:57.740]   Hoping I think that to take advantage of these unlocked iPhones it'll be coming into the market
[00:58:57.740 --> 00:58:59.340]   and
[00:58:59.340 --> 00:59:03.900]   And you know you can use for our 4g network on the on the new iPhone
[00:59:03.900 --> 00:59:08.300]   It could be a coincidence, but they wanted to use this in 1900 megahertz band
[00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:11.180]   Which is I guess the same band is
[00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:13.900]   AT&T
[00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:15.900]   Oh really? Yeah
[00:59:17.980 --> 00:59:23.660]   AT-Mobile says the iPhone will be technically supported but no deal between Apple and T-Mobile has been struck
[00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:29.820]   So if you just happen to have a iPhone in your pocket or somebody else's pocket
[00:59:29.820 --> 00:59:37.260]   Well, did Apple or was it to AT&T it was AT&T that said that we will unlock it after two years
[00:59:37.260 --> 00:59:43.740]   Oh really? Or was that but AT&T does the unlocking. Yeah, once you've once you've paid off your contract
[00:59:43.740 --> 00:59:46.620]   We'll unlock the phone for you
[00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:49.420]   So you should be losing sleep over that
[00:59:49.420 --> 00:59:50.860]   AT&T is gonna lose cost
[00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:55.580]   T-Mobile yeah, really T-Mobile in April said that there are a million unlocked iPhones on our network
[00:59:55.580 --> 01:00:00.300]   1 million but they're running on edge. So I think this makes sense
[01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:04.940]   All right more numbers
[01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:07.180]   90
[01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:09.500]   This is this is like a the
[01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:14.620]   95 of all tablet web traffic comes from the iPad
[01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:20.780]   I'm surprised really wow really
[01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:26.780]   Well, it just shows you that uh android and the blackberries uh playbook
[01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:29.900]   What other tablets are there have not really kind of
[01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:37.020]   Touchpad the galaxy tablet has 1.22 percent market share. That's the best selling android tablet
[01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:41.100]   I think the kindle fire. It's interesting sales apparently you're going or dropping a little bit
[01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:43.340]   The fire is not
[01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:46.460]   The nook has 0.53 of the web
[01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:49.260]   Traffic of course is really more of a reader
[01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:54.460]   Kindle fire is not is is almost at the bottom 0.8 percent of all
[01:00:54.460 --> 01:01:00.220]   Well, I would think once you've downloaded a book you want to read on on the fire
[01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:06.140]   You're not going to be accessing the web as much whereas with the iPad we're always hitting the web
[01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:08.700]   So this is an interesting graph this comes from
[01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:10.780]   Chitika
[01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:14.940]   Which is I guess a uh an analyst the average number of tablets per
[01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:16.380]   100
[01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:19.260]   iPads so for every hundred iPad on the net
[01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:23.740]   There's about 1.3 Samsung galaxy tabs
[01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:27.900]   There's about 1.2 transformer primes
[01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:33.580]   I'm surprised the zoom did pretty well. I'm able to resume just a little under one zoom per hundred iPads
[01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:39.180]   a little over 0.8 playbooks per hundred iPads kindle fire same
[01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:41.820]   and then the nook is 0.53
[01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:45.100]   0.5
[01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:49.660]   So there's 0.8 no 0.8 Kindle fires for every hundred iPads on the internet
[01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:53.660]   Now I I guess you could buy a fire and not use it on the internet. Yeah, yeah
[01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:56.860]   I don't I don't think people are buying them as a multi-use tablet
[01:01:56.860 --> 01:02:02.620]   They really are using as a consumption device. So that's that's that's that's that's that's not as as painful as statistic as
[01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:05.260]   You know Samsung and Motorola say yes
[01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:10.780]   That's better here. Here is our challenger to the iPad which nobody has apparently heard of or is using or is running so
[01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:17.420]   There's probably more software development on the malware side of business than in the actual productivity side of business
[01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:21.660]   there, you know, it's it's I had to I posted my
[01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:24.380]   tame
[01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:27.420]   Restrained a 3000 word review of iPhoto for iPad
[01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:33.020]   This week on the Sun Time site and I really couldn't you really couldn't avoid saying that
[01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:39.020]   In summing up how good an app iPhoto is and what it can do that it really just underscore how
[01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:44.620]   It's it's it's it's not a bad situation that and android has for tablets
[01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:47.740]   It's not even a you know a come from behind situation
[01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:54.220]   They're just they're they're just taking three steps forward and 12 steps back with every single release. They have nothing
[01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:59.820]   I have to have they have absolutely nothing. It's as though they haven't released anything in the last two years
[01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:01.820]   They have achieved
[01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:06.460]   Nothing and I think iPhoto is a really good example of because like you
[01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:11.500]   You know, I usually use Lightroom on a desk on a laptop and I did bring my laptop to Norway
[01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:13.740]   But because I was going to be on the train. I thought well, I'll just
[01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:17.580]   For a change I'll import my use the camera, uh, you know
[01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:23.420]   Connection kit and import right from the camera and these are by the way, you know big files. They're 12 megabyte
[01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:26.460]   Canon 5d mark 2 raw
[01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:29.260]   Files import them in iPhoto took them
[01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:32.620]   It was easier to modify these monster files
[01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:38.220]   And and do everything I needed I would I got great images. This was as good as lightroom almost
[01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:44.300]   It is all my iPad. I'm sitting on the train going and before the train when I was over. I had a slideshow
[01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:46.780]   Because I then hand it around
[01:03:46.780 --> 01:03:51.580]   I think it's brilliant for triaging photos. I mean, uh, I don't think I've ever I've ever taken a trip
[01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:54.700]   They're their trips and usually in a trip like this. I will take
[01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:59.980]   Um at least 100 photos a day usually somewhere on 200 or 300 photos and sometimes
[01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:04.620]   It can be months before I've actually managed to cull that down into 50 or 60 things
[01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:07.020]   Actually want to keep and put into library with this one
[01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:13.260]   It's like not a not an even an afternoon would go by by the time that I decided to just I've I've got 30 minutes to kill
[01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:17.820]   Five minutes to slurp these the most recent 80 pictures into it iPhoto
[01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:21.740]   Another 10 minutes to isolate the ones that are really really good and just like you said
[01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:27.580]   To the great distress and dismay of all my friends back home as soon as I got off the plane
[01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:31.660]   I had a slideshow I could show them and if they wanted to taste any of the whiskey that I brought home with me
[01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:34.220]   They're gonna have to sit and watch that slideshow
[01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:39.580]   It really was a wonderful experience and there is a nice thing about doing in touch
[01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:42.780]   Compared to doing it with a mouse. There's just it was just a now
[01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:47.180]   I think I still can do a lot more with light room and I think that's probably the black and white processing
[01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:50.780]   I'm going to do with the nick, uh, you know, silver effects is going to be better
[01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:55.100]   But I was able to get a pretty darn good quick approximation
[01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:58.700]   And I think you hit the nail in the head what I mostly used it for with selection
[01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:03.500]   Yeah, because you're looking on a nice screen on the new iPad it really looks nice and you can say no
[01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:05.580]   I don't want that one now Andy. Do you then?
[01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:13.260]   What do you do then do you then uh sync up your iPad and use the raws from the iPad or do you go back and then?
[01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:16.220]   Yeah, that's that's the only thing I wish that
[01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:23.420]   uh if if you the iPhoto doesn't know from raw it doesn't understand rock and view that you can you can view raw
[01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:28.140]   But you can't even do anything with it. Uh, I would have loved if usually with my camera
[01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:34.300]   I'm shooting raw plus jpeg pairs that way iPhoto could edit the jpeg and post them
[01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:37.980]   For flicker and and sharing you know, I had a different experience Andy
[01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:42.620]   I only imported ros and I did everything in ros and my canon cr2 raw files
[01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:48.300]   Really really because ios doesn't know how to decode ros
[01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:51.980]   Well, I didn't point anything else
[01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:56.220]   Okay, I mean it's it's possible that raw on the image. It says raw and I picked the image
[01:05:56.220 --> 01:05:58.700]   Okay, it must be it must be jpegging it or something
[01:05:58.700 --> 01:06:03.100]   But it reads it what what it can what it can do is uh the standard image capture
[01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:08.700]   Excuse me the center photo roll it can certainly import ros and then export them later on when you hook it up to
[01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:15.580]   Whatever your desktop image processing or image library app is but iPhoto does not know how to edit raw
[01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:19.580]   It must be it must be j it must be converting the raw to jpeg
[01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:22.780]   No, it can't it can't even convert it into jpeg
[01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:27.100]   Well, then I don't understand what I was doing because I was not importing jpeg. So I was importing
[01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:27.980]   Although
[01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:33.100]   I'll you're unfortunately you've inspired me to go back and double check that was the one thing that of the review that
[01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:36.860]   Uh, there are a lot of things about iPhoto not really here it is here it is
[01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:43.020]   This is from support note ht 5182. Thank you scooter x when you import a raw image to your ipad
[01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:49.340]   It does say raw on the iPhoto iPhoto will display only the jpeg version of the image embedded in the raw file
[01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:55.100]   Oh, so it's like the proxy that's embedded into that. I didn't even know that the canon was embedding at jpeg
[01:06:55.100 --> 01:06:58.700]   Yeah, it's it's it's a complicated issue on top of everything else
[01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:03.580]   Uh iPhoto has an upper limit of 19 megapixels right her image
[01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:08.700]   Also, and the double whammy is that it's not that it'll down sample it to 16
[01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:10.620]   It'll down sample it by factor of four
[01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:15.340]   So if you have a 24 megapixel image like from the canon d800 it becomes a six megapixel
[01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:22.620]   Yeah, and I knew that I was degrading the images and what I was hoping is that if I then deleted images
[01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:28.940]   I knew I didn't want and then synced up that those raws would be then copied over and I could do the final editing in photo
[01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:34.700]   But like rum or photoshop. I wish that for the next version of iPhoto what I really wish that it would do is
[01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:41.180]   Because iPhoto has its own internal library that a photo library that you don't access directly
[01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:43.260]   but every time that you
[01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:47.500]   Have iPhoto operate on an image or make make an image active
[01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:50.780]   It will automatically copy that jpeg into its own internal library
[01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:56.700]   So it becomes very very simple to take all the if you're just if I were just shooting jpegs would be very very simple to simply
[01:07:56.700 --> 01:08:03.180]   With like maybe four taps of the of the screen say please export all of my favoriteed images
[01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:08.860]   To itunes that I could simply copy them over and then just erase all the photos that I didn't pour it over the course of the week
[01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:11.100]   But since i'm shooting
[01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:12.300]   raw
[01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:16.620]   The the raws will not be copied into the internal iPhoto library
[01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:18.540]   So I have to what I was so to answer your question
[01:08:18.540 --> 01:08:22.140]   What I was doing was I was really using iPhoto to generate
[01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:26.220]   All the stuff that I was going to be sharing on flicker and then when I got back home
[01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:32.700]   I really just had to sort of manually take a look and refresh my memory as to which ones I was actually using an iPhoto
[01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:36.860]   In the actual camera app and then select those and add those raw images
[01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:39.820]   into my aperture library so I'll have the the higher
[01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:41.340]   the higher
[01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:45.420]   Higher density version of my library. There's kind of these things that's something clever to wait
[01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:50.860]   Yeah, some sort of clever way of letting aperture know what I've done on iPhoto
[01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:53.180]   Right or just or just have iPhoto say
[01:08:53.180 --> 01:08:57.900]   I recognize that I've got two files of the exact same file name on this memory card
[01:08:57.900 --> 01:09:02.940]   One of the ends in dot jpegs jpg the other ends in rw2 or whatever
[01:09:02.940 --> 01:09:06.620]   I'm going to copy both of them into my own internal library and whatever
[01:09:06.940 --> 01:09:12.540]   Someone tries to export the jpegs. I'm also going to put that into iTunes the iPhoto and as well. Yeah, yeah
[01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:14.380]   So, um, I love it
[01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:21.420]   I think that the bottom line is if you're going to do what I did and what ami's been doing in iPhoto is do not use the embedded jpegs
[01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:24.460]   That's pretty low quality. I think that's done mostly for the back of the camera
[01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:30.860]   Exactly. You do turn on jpegs raw plus jpegs and use a high quality jpegs and then you'll have the best of both worlds
[01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:39.260]   Yeah, it's incredible though. It's like now now they can get a 30 high speed 32 gigabyte card for like, you know for 12 bucks
[01:09:39.260 --> 01:09:41.580]   You don't even have to
[01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:44.460]   I have to admit that I wasn't even syncing things back off of my ipad
[01:09:44.460 --> 01:09:47.900]   I just simply took the same card that had inside my camera and hooked it up
[01:09:47.900 --> 01:09:55.900]   And even bother to get the ros off because there really is no point really in deleting stuff off of your camera card anymore because you can be the most
[01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:59.900]   Hessian aggression uh of shooter at a at a
[01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:08.060]   During a vacation and still come home with at least eight to ten gigabytes where the free space left in the card. Yeah. Yeah, I love the 21st century
[01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:14.860]   I have I have four 16 gig cards and one 8 gig card and I I filled filled them up with both
[01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:18.060]   We shot a lot of video for that to it photo video with the killer on there
[01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:22.220]   But I filled them up, but I didn't have to race any I had enough enough cards and I brought them all back
[01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:28.140]   So that I had the originals on the cards and of course I make copies onto two different hard drives one in my carry-on one in my checked and
[01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:32.300]   You know and then we left I think we will have to copy and then Norway just in case so
[01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:34.700]   That worked out quite well
[01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:38.380]   You by the way all those photos and more will be available not this week on twitter photo
[01:10:38.380 --> 01:10:43.340]   But next starting next week on twitter photo we're gonna do a two part special on the Nordic light
[01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:48.700]   Festival was an amazing photo festival just incredible. Hey, if you're buying an ipad
[01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:52.140]   This is interesting the engagit track this down
[01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:59.420]   the late model ipad 2s known as the in the system information as 2,4
[01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:06.140]   Is a 32 nanometer processor as opposed to the 45 nanometer chips and the other ipad 2s
[01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:12.380]   You'll get better battery life actually this comes from a non tech 16 percent increase in battery life
[01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:16.220]   30 boost when playing game 16 percent during web browsing
[01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:21.980]   So that the thing to do is if you can buy when you buy it a older
[01:11:21.980 --> 01:11:27.660]   When you buy an ipad 2 even if you're buying a brand new one see if you can find out if it's the 32 nanometer process one
[01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:30.780]   I would guess all the i knew ipad 2s would be that way, right?
[01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:34.220]   I don't mind out you can't
[01:11:34.220 --> 01:11:41.260]   No way to know so that's not from engagit. I'm actually give a credit to a non tech. They do such great work
[01:11:41.260 --> 01:11:44.140]   the ipad 2 comma 4 review
[01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:54.380]   Talk about great work who knew there was a another edition of the ipad 2. It's the 32 nanometer a5
[01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:59.660]   Uh, I don't know. I I bookmark this. I don't even know if it's worth mentioning
[01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:04.140]   Some of us want more I don't particularly but many people apparently want multi user
[01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:09.580]   Support on the ipad so different people can use the same ipad log in and so forth apple says
[01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:12.460]   It's currently being investigated
[01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:16.780]   Not after this operating system
[01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:23.340]   Yeah, law security flaw somebody somebody reported as uh, well not uh, they use the apple bug reporter
[01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:25.580]   But not as a bug report but as a suggestion
[01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:32.620]   Developers said the company should add support for multiple users of the ipad apple responded officially after further investigation
[01:12:32.620 --> 01:12:34.700]   It has been turned determined. This is a known issue
[01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:39.580]   Which is I think this might be boilerplate. Yeah, it's currently being investigated
[01:12:39.580 --> 01:12:43.260]   That's got to be boilerplate. We're gonna investigate this
[01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:47.340]   I think I think the monkey touched the wrong button
[01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:53.500]   There's there's there's just a line of very well cared for monkeys that you know get get the get the banana pelvis
[01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:57.100]   They touched the we're looking into this. Thank you much very much for your looking
[01:12:57.100 --> 01:13:01.900]   I we're gonna sue you and try to buy your domain name and a big green one that says ignore
[01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:06.780]   I think they touched the wrong if you thought you were gonna make millions of dollars or the iOS app think again only about
[01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:11.500]   40 of developers even make any money 60 don't even break even
[01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:14.620]   So, uh
[01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:17.980]   There just mention that there is I got it right here
[01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:19.660]   I
[01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:24.380]   Stay stay in dental school kid stay in dental school apps are not gonna change your life
[01:13:24.380 --> 01:13:28.060]   There is an update to iOS 5.1.1
[01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:32.780]   Uh download and install. I love it that we don't have to you know sync up anymore
[01:13:32.780 --> 01:13:36.300]   I agree to this very long terms and condition. Oh my god
[01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:39.580]   Oh my goodness. Wow. I read this all by the way
[01:13:40.220 --> 01:13:46.060]   Every word on the iPhone. Can you zoom it? No, no, no, that would that would make it too easy to read
[01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:52.540]   Uh, I guess you could probably email it connect your phone to a power source. Okay, whatever and there you go
[01:13:52.540 --> 01:13:57.340]   So we're gonna it's improvements and bug bug fixes it fixes airplay network bugs
[01:13:57.340 --> 01:14:00.300]   um
[01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:02.860]   I think that there is a
[01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:08.540]   A fix to the camera. There's something about the the way the camera works
[01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:16.780]   It when it yeah, there's a camera out of lockbox. HDR option for photos taking works better. Oh, so it didn't you didn't have hdr at all before
[01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:18.620]   uh
[01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:21.020]   better thinking of bookmarks and reading list
[01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:24.540]   If you've ever seen the unable to purchase
[01:14:24.540 --> 01:14:31.420]   alert after a successful purchase I have I have but my credit cards with max that's why
[01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:33.420]   I'm fixed
[01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:38.140]   And apparently the jailbreakers have already jailbroken it
[01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:41.500]   Callee that was fast
[01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:47.820]   Good news. Uh apple finally is acknowledging the use of open street map data in iPhoto speaking of iPhoto
[01:14:47.820 --> 01:14:51.900]   Um, I'm not crazy about the iPhoto maps and the journal thing
[01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:57.260]   I made a journal of Norway, but I couldn't zoom in and you know enough it was hard to zoom in didn't have streets
[01:14:57.820 --> 01:15:03.100]   Um, they have been using uh two-year-old mapping data from the open street map team
[01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:08.860]   And the app now credits open street map as it is required to do so by the license
[01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:14.300]   Apple didn't credit them at first, but that's good. I love open street map and I don't want to see them
[01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:18.860]   Hurt finally will end then we'll go to our tips of the week
[01:15:18.860 --> 01:15:21.580]   But we'll end with this because I think daren you had something to do with it
[01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:27.020]   I was this blows me away. I was so surprised this surface. This was shot for a
[01:15:27.820 --> 01:15:28.460]   um
[01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:31.020]   sales video, right? Yeah, it was in um
[01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:35.980]   1984 there was it was this is from 1984. Yeah, it was a sales gathering
[01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:39.820]   Um that they were gonna have they have and they were having in hanalulu
[01:15:39.820 --> 01:15:42.620]   and just to get every all their
[01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:48.220]   You know sales people and people own remember when they used to own little stores and you go buy
[01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:54.940]   They used to have third party sales people. Yeah, so instead of 1984 the the bid is it's 1944
[01:15:55.420 --> 01:16:01.260]   You and your brave fighting calls and steve jobs plays fdr
[01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:06.620]   Will be at steve. It will be hard, but it will be won
[01:16:06.620 --> 01:16:12.620]   So did you shoot this? I shot this. I I and blows me away to see this
[01:16:12.620 --> 01:16:15.500]   You didn't even know that this is sanely great
[01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:19.660]   He had he had a great sense of humor. We had a lot of fun
[01:16:19.660 --> 01:16:23.900]   That is funny. You have a fake oval office steve jobs at the at the big desk with
[01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:29.580]   flags, but the flags are apple flag. Yeah, I mean we there there's the longer version that I saw on here
[01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:36.940]   There's it's nine minutes higher thing and yeah, it's just it's a play on everything apple and how IBM's the enemy and
[01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:40.860]   but um, I was telling i lien earlier that uh
[01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:45.500]   We we shot for two days this this film and uh
[01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:51.980]   We didn't know when steve was gonna be able to be there right so this little oval office and chair
[01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:55.740]   We said well, let's just leave it there. No, let's just put in the back of a truck
[01:16:55.740 --> 01:16:59.260]   really because we were out we were out in the uh
[01:16:59.260 --> 01:17:05.260]   In a place where we had in the back of a truck. Yeah, and it's like well. We'll take it out when steve gets here
[01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:07.900]   I won't make him get in the truck to shoot his piece
[01:17:07.900 --> 01:17:12.620]   Yeah, because we had no idea when he was gonna be right and he finally arrived and uh, they said well
[01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:14.620]   he's always gonna have an hour and
[01:17:14.620 --> 01:17:17.260]   And so you made him get in the truck
[01:17:17.260 --> 01:17:23.820]   Actually, we we did set it up and after we were done. I mean yet he was it was a little nervous at first
[01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:26.940]   And then he just started having fun with it and did you know
[01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:31.020]   Somebody must have known that he could do an fdr impression. No, we had no idea
[01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:34.940]   In fact quite good actually did you have to coach him?
[01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:42.540]   Yeah, there was a little bit of coaching but in fact there was another there was an actor waiting in the wings in case this all just blew
[01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:44.380]   up but um
[01:17:44.380 --> 01:17:49.900]   That poor actor he was gonna be fdr. Yeah, but you know he got paid anyway, but yeah all this stuff
[01:17:49.900 --> 01:17:54.860]   We created all this war war two shot in black and white 16 millimeter. What fun
[01:17:54.860 --> 01:18:00.220]   And it's just resurfaced every company does this for their sales meetings and so forth
[01:18:00.220 --> 01:18:04.060]   Yeah, microsoft has some great videos, but i've never seen anything like this from apple
[01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:09.660]   This is really it was because there was somewhat seriousness going on. We just mocked everything about it
[01:18:09.740 --> 01:18:14.380]   Right. This was early in the this was when the mac first came out just released in the mac
[01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:18.460]   Yeah, and it went in there and they're fighting at ibm still which just tells you something
[01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:19.900]   Exactly
[01:18:19.900 --> 01:18:26.220]   That's really an issue any any more now it's interesting how things have changed around and yeah, no kidding
[01:18:26.220 --> 01:18:28.140]   Apple fighting ibm
[01:18:28.140 --> 01:18:32.460]   We actually had a few jokes in there about software because that was the big question about the mac
[01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:35.180]   Yeah, but it was no software. Yeah
[01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:41.500]   This is very but I had not seen this over 20 years ago. Wow and uh last night
[01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:46.540]   I was going over you know the the show notes that i lean sent and then I clicked on this
[01:18:46.540 --> 01:18:50.060]   You said wait that's my old video like fell over
[01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:55.820]   Isn't that funny Steve jobs is fdr. You could find it. It actually uh, it's uh was published
[01:18:55.820 --> 01:19:01.420]   Uh at network world.com in the buzz blog by paul macnamara, and I don't know how
[01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:06.300]   He found this yeah, I don't know how he founded everything lives now, you know, there's nothing
[01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:09.260]   There's nothing you've ever done that doesn't live on
[01:19:09.260 --> 01:19:15.340]   And there are people who deny that he wanted to dress up like willy walka for the one millionth mac i'm axled
[01:19:15.340 --> 01:19:19.340]   I think this shed some light on another story from last week
[01:19:19.340 --> 01:19:22.460]   That's right. So the story about how they found this kind of interesting because
[01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:25.420]   Two snippets for this movie without any dialogue
[01:19:25.900 --> 01:19:33.260]   Appear in a photo montage tribute to steve that apple employees made to mark his 30th birthday, which would have been a year later
[01:19:33.260 --> 01:19:36.540]   When steve jot jobs died in october
[01:19:36.540 --> 01:19:43.580]   Somebody posted that birthday video on his facebook page. So that was the first time anybody had seen it in 25 years
[01:19:43.580 --> 01:19:46.060]   It went viral
[01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:51.900]   Um, and then sony music entertainment pulled it down because it had a bob dillin song in it
[01:19:53.740 --> 01:19:58.060]   But not before somebody else started to dig and say hmm
[01:19:58.060 --> 01:20:01.020]   I remember that where is that?
[01:20:01.020 --> 01:20:03.020]   1944 video
[01:20:03.020 --> 01:20:05.020]   Thank you sony. Yeah
[01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:10.460]   There are a lot there like the cops who who told the Beatles to climb down off that root
[01:20:10.460 --> 01:20:15.260]   That's not making noise. Yeah, they're just for this captain and major of the no fun brigade
[01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:17.900]   Stop making noise
[01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:20.780]   Cheese louise
[01:20:20.780 --> 01:20:24.380]   All right, let's take a break. We'll come back. We're gonna have your tips your picks
[01:20:24.380 --> 01:20:26.620]   and more
[01:20:26.620 --> 01:20:31.820]   Darren ocada's here. It's great to have you great to be a man who made the 1944 commercial
[01:20:31.820 --> 01:20:34.780]   Her video wow. I mean that is a coincidence
[01:20:34.780 --> 01:20:43.740]   Total coincidence is not bizarre idea. You were just 12 at the time. I was a young man just had a film school probably now
[01:20:43.740 --> 01:20:45.740]   I was
[01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:52.620]   Just just begged for a job and you didn't work for apple. No, no, but steve did give me an apple coffee cup
[01:20:52.620 --> 01:20:57.980]   Oh, that was nice of him had a not a mac just an apple. Yeah, here's a coffee cup
[01:20:57.980 --> 01:21:00.860]   And uh because they had a lot of apple
[01:21:00.860 --> 01:21:06.380]   There's a guy walking behind steve with a box of coffee cups probably there is it was the color apple logo
[01:21:06.380 --> 01:21:08.300]   Yes, it was the color one. Yeah
[01:21:08.300 --> 01:21:12.540]   Did he asked to keep the glasses because those those would pop up 30 years later
[01:21:12.620 --> 01:21:17.020]   I think we sent all of it there in case he wanted to pop up on stage dressed like that
[01:21:17.020 --> 01:21:22.780]   That's actually pretty funny because you're right. He then adapted those those FDR glasses later when he needed them
[01:21:22.780 --> 01:21:27.900]   Hey, I want to talk a little bit about pond five before we continue on pond five the world's
[01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:30.540]   Stock media
[01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:35.100]   Marketplace they were such great sponsors at nab and they're just such a great company
[01:21:35.100 --> 01:21:42.220]   Um if you go to pond five dot com you can take a look at what they do they for both media makers and media users
[01:21:42.220 --> 01:21:46.300]   And actually I think there's a kind of a big crossover because if you are a photographer
[01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:51.340]   You make video or illustrations you do music or you know in podcasts you also
[01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:56.300]   You know, you probably make some of these and you also probably use some of these in your own creations
[01:21:56.300 --> 01:22:01.020]   And that's why it's so cool when you create a pond five account you can also you can buy or sell
[01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:04.140]   And boy look what they've got in here 5,000

[01:23:36.780 --> 01:23:41.420]   You know, you can listen to sound effects just right in there. You can listen to music
[01:23:41.420 --> 01:23:47.420]   You can even look here. So audio logos, you know, we should just use these for some of our shows. Let me just
[01:23:47.420 --> 01:23:51.740]   It's time for mac break
[01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:58.060]   See they put a little that's a little watermark in there. We'd have to and audio i've never heard of an audio watermark
[01:23:58.060 --> 01:24:02.460]   That's the first time i've ever heard that. Yeah, well you have to right? Yeah, I never crossed my mind
[01:24:02.460 --> 01:24:07.420]   How to do that so somebody who's like good with a keyboard or good with logic or something is making these
[01:24:07.420 --> 01:24:11.740]   They're affordable how much is that four dollars?
[01:24:11.740 --> 01:24:15.020]   Here's a business corporate raindrops
[01:24:15.020 --> 01:24:24.940]   Welcome you are strong you are powerful you can sell
[01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:29.500]   With mind isometric exercise
[01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:37.260]   Your prospect and meet your quota here's one after week here's one called news of science
[01:24:37.260 --> 01:24:42.620]   We should use this for dr. Kiki and now it's time
[01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:46.060]   for the science minute
[01:24:46.060 --> 01:24:48.460]   Very house md
[01:24:48.460 --> 01:24:51.500]   It is very house md. Anyway, check it out pun five

[01:25:05.420 --> 01:25:06.700]   Five
[01:25:06.700 --> 01:25:10.220]   I love these guys are really nice really great guys. I really wanted to do well
[01:25:10.220 --> 01:25:15.660]   I'm gonna try putting some stuff up on that just for fun. You should I know people who do this and are very very happy
[01:25:15.660 --> 01:25:18.380]   You probably don't don't stop footage
[01:25:18.380 --> 01:25:21.980]   Stuff that you've been shooting. Yeah, I just have to kind of
[01:25:22.460 --> 01:25:25.740]   Put that pattern over the actor's faces so we don't know who they were
[01:25:25.740 --> 01:25:35.100]   Now don't worry about it. You got releases time for our ios tip of the week. Are you gonna do this, Andy?
[01:25:35.100 --> 01:25:42.780]   Uh, I have a mac OS tip, but I have something that will also bridge as I see an iOS tip sharing your Wi-Fi connection
[01:25:42.780 --> 01:25:45.340]   Is that who put that in?
[01:25:45.340 --> 01:25:47.340]   Oh, that's Alex and he's not here. So
[01:25:47.820 --> 01:25:51.420]   Cause Alex had problems so we won't use that go ahead and give us some echo s tip
[01:25:51.420 --> 01:25:55.900]   Okay, uh, this actually comes courtesy of ted land out who tweeted it the other day
[01:25:55.900 --> 01:26:02.940]   Uh, and got so much love from the rest of the world for solving a problem that people have been bothered with since line came out
[01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:11.180]   Uh, you're if you ever have to deal with old documents the big pain of the butt is that they're automatically locked by the operating system against changes
[01:26:11.180 --> 01:26:13.420]   So if you try to open them, they'll
[01:26:13.420 --> 01:26:16.540]   The every all these mac apps will keep telling you. Oh, I'm sorry
[01:26:16.540 --> 01:26:23.580]   You can this in the I can make a copy of it for you if induplicated if you want to actually, you know scroll through it and double click and something
[01:26:23.580 --> 01:26:25.580]   But unfortunately, I'm not gonna let you do that
[01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:31.820]   Uh, there's actually a setting that will disable that but it's buried a deep deep deep deep in time machine
[01:26:31.820 --> 01:26:36.220]   If you go into system preferences, uh, click on the settings for time machine
[01:26:36.220 --> 01:26:42.300]   You'll find an options tab that lets you uh set how much time passes before a document gets locked
[01:26:42.300 --> 01:26:47.980]   And you will also have the ability to I believe disable that completely. Uh, now I do think that
[01:26:47.980 --> 01:26:53.020]   Keeping old documents locked is kind of a really good idea
[01:26:53.020 --> 01:26:56.700]   Given that as we move forward into 10.8
[01:26:56.700 --> 01:26:57.900]   Uh
[01:26:57.900 --> 01:27:04.780]   The operating system believes that every single document is is is is there's no such thing as an official version of a document anymore
[01:27:04.780 --> 01:27:07.740]   This is a ongoing record of everything you've ever done to it
[01:27:07.740 --> 01:27:11.340]   And sometimes if you've got a document that you last opened 10 years ago
[01:27:11.340 --> 01:27:14.060]   It really is you really want it to be frozen and amber
[01:27:14.060 --> 01:27:15.900]   So I wouldn't want to disable this permanently
[01:27:15.900 --> 01:27:22.140]   But there's so many times when I am trying to triage an old CD or an old dvd of documents
[01:27:22.140 --> 01:27:24.940]   And trying to find that one image file from this event
[01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:28.140]   I went to 10 years ago that I want to resurface on a presentation or something
[01:27:28.140 --> 01:27:32.780]   And man, is it a pain in the butt to always have to unlock things and duplicate things
[01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:37.660]   In order to actually work with a file. So yeah, you you you you walk to use that
[01:27:37.660 --> 01:27:40.060]   To turn it off or for the time being and then turn it back on again
[01:27:40.060 --> 01:27:41.900]   Maybe uh when you get done with the end of the day
[01:27:41.900 --> 01:27:44.060]   That explains why I keep getting this message
[01:27:44.060 --> 01:27:48.700]   Documents locked you want to duplicate it now. I understand I turned it on
[01:27:48.700 --> 01:27:51.500]   Good tip andy and not code now
[01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:55.980]   Let's get our picks of the week and I'm gonna start because I never get to get my pick in because we always run out of time
[01:27:55.980 --> 01:27:58.220]   So I'm gonna do it now if we're gonna at a time. It's your fault
[01:27:58.220 --> 01:27:59.340]   Okay
[01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:00.940]   This actually I'm not a programmer
[01:28:00.940 --> 01:28:04.860]   But there is a new way of writing software for ios native ios apps
[01:28:05.180 --> 01:28:08.380]   I think people don't perhaps know that you have a choice of languages
[01:28:08.380 --> 01:28:14.460]   I think a lot of people say well you have to use xcode and you have to use objective c if you're gonna develop for ios and it's not so at all
[01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:21.340]   Um, you have to use the ios api's and everything but this is new and I think is very cool 150 bucks
[01:28:21.340 --> 01:28:25.260]   It's called ruby motion and it lets you instead of writing an objective c
[01:28:25.260 --> 01:28:30.460]   Uh right in ruby use the command line to um
[01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:36.780]   And ruby's rake tool, which is its make file to create everything you need to deploy your app including
[01:28:36.780 --> 01:28:44.380]   Ready app for the app store. I'm very interested in this. You don't actually use xcode you use your own whatever editor
[01:28:44.380 --> 01:28:46.300]   You like
[01:28:46.300 --> 01:28:48.220]   You do use the simulator of course
[01:28:48.220 --> 01:28:51.260]   I'm very interested in this as a way to quickly create and deploy
[01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:55.900]   Ios apps maybe purpose built ios apps not necessarily apps you want to sell
[01:28:55.900 --> 01:28:59.180]   Although it will in fact work just fine for apps you want to sell
[01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:04.620]   I think it's very cool ruby motion.com if you're interested in knowing more
[01:29:04.620 --> 01:29:06.700]   um
[01:29:06.700 --> 01:29:08.700]   During your tip of the week my friend
[01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:11.340]   mine is it's a
[01:29:11.340 --> 01:29:13.980]   A web app called asana
[01:29:13.980 --> 01:29:17.340]   And you can look at it at asana.com
[01:29:17.340 --> 01:29:22.220]   And the the videos on it are great. I use it for organizing
[01:29:22.220 --> 01:29:28.540]   Uh task list because I've tried every way and it always goofs up
[01:29:28.620 --> 01:29:33.580]   But this has actually been something that's worked really intuitively. It's simple
[01:29:33.580 --> 01:29:35.420]   um
[01:29:35.420 --> 01:29:37.420]   I think the easiest thing to do is just
[01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:40.540]   Time wise just look at the videos because the videos are really
[01:29:40.540 --> 01:29:46.540]   A clear cut way of how to use this is it designed mostly for sharing with a team or do you use it for your own stuff?
[01:29:46.540 --> 01:29:53.100]   You can do both which is great. So um, and it'll you know email you every day a list of what we need to do
[01:29:53.260 --> 01:29:59.980]   And it's just simple and I can get it on my iPad use it on a lot of different platforms and incorporate things
[01:29:59.980 --> 01:30:06.060]   But the way that you can move stuff around is the way we sort of think you know, you're not locked into a structure
[01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:09.340]   Which I found a lot of these task apps
[01:30:09.340 --> 01:30:13.340]   Have you do? I mean I spend more time trying to figure out how to do it
[01:30:13.340 --> 01:30:18.300]   But this does it very freeform if there's an idea while i'm driving you know on the you know or somewhere
[01:30:18.300 --> 01:30:19.340]   I'll just
[01:30:19.340 --> 01:30:24.380]   Email it and it'll go right into the top and then once I open it just drag it to where I need it
[01:30:24.380 --> 01:30:27.020]   Oh, I'm gonna sign up for this. What does it cost?
[01:30:27.020 --> 01:30:33.580]   It's a sauna and you can sign up and do a free a free account for a bit until you
[01:30:33.580 --> 01:30:37.900]   I'm going to use my google account because uh and so allow access to a sauna
[01:30:37.900 --> 01:30:41.580]   And uh, then I don't have to do anything more elaborate
[01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:44.060]   But I've used it for organizing
[01:30:44.860 --> 01:30:51.260]   Production shoots just anything that comes into my head if you know not having a piece of paper or an iPad to type it out, right?
[01:30:51.260 --> 01:30:54.380]   Asana a sana
[01:30:54.380 --> 01:31:00.460]   A.com and they do have as you said a lot of videos so that you don't have to kind of you can you can learn this
[01:31:00.460 --> 01:31:07.980]   With help yeah, I mean it's the clearest instructional videos. I've always looking for a better way to do it
[01:31:07.980 --> 01:31:12.380]   I've I've bought every to do app there is yeah me too and it's there's always an issue with it
[01:31:12.460 --> 01:31:16.780]   There's a you end up not using it. Yeah, but this one is good. I'll check it out. Thank you
[01:31:16.780 --> 01:31:20.140]   You're you're pick of the week andi and aca
[01:31:20.140 --> 01:31:23.820]   Uh, this is another aryland trip related to pick the pick of the week
[01:31:23.820 --> 01:31:28.460]   Um, I went to a lot of museums and there are a lot of places where you're not allowed to take pictures
[01:31:28.460 --> 01:31:30.700]   Uh, and so that's the time when I
[01:31:30.700 --> 01:31:34.780]   Fortunate my iPad with me so I decided to sit down and actually do some sketches of what I was seeing
[01:31:34.780 --> 01:31:37.180]   Oh, not because I'm a real artist
[01:31:37.180 --> 01:31:38.860]   But because it's nice
[01:31:38.860 --> 01:31:42.620]   When when you get to the point where you want to remember what it was like to be in a place
[01:31:42.620 --> 01:31:46.780]   Even like a really weak stupid sketch is better than like having absolutely nothing
[01:31:46.780 --> 01:31:49.100]   Uh, and like this is
[01:31:49.100 --> 01:31:55.420]   Uh, so this is like a inside the the library was so cool. So you're so this is like a really really cool book that was there
[01:31:55.420 --> 01:32:00.140]   So it's really a memory for you. It's not it's not something you're gonna. I mean it's it's it's not terribly good
[01:32:00.140 --> 01:32:02.380]   I will I will say though. This is the
[01:32:02.380 --> 01:32:05.020]   The paper app is not my pick of the week
[01:32:05.020 --> 01:32:10.220]   But I probably if you sit in the library doing like for an hour doing sketches on an iPad
[01:32:10.220 --> 01:32:14.700]   You will learn five different foreign languages in which you can say what app is that?
[01:32:14.700 --> 01:32:18.300]   So I believe I heard it in english. I heard in french. I heard it in german
[01:32:18.300 --> 01:32:20.940]   Bosses noss
[01:32:20.940 --> 01:32:23.340]   Exactly. Yeah, bossa to the ipad app
[01:32:23.340 --> 01:32:29.340]   Called paper. It's also a paper. Yeah, just pa papers quite beautiful. It's amazing. Yeah
[01:32:29.340 --> 01:32:31.340]   So it's it's it's it's a nice app
[01:32:31.340 --> 01:32:35.740]   But it reminded me that uh, I really really should like be traveling with a stylus
[01:32:35.740 --> 01:32:41.180]   And so that led to like a week late really from that hotel room like I bought like probably three or four of them
[01:32:41.180 --> 01:32:44.780]   And my favorite is something you probably saw at mac and expo
[01:32:44.780 --> 01:32:49.180]   This is the from adon at ado n it the jot pro
[01:32:49.180 --> 01:32:57.580]   It's a really cool idea in that the problem with styluses that the ipads scanner is designed to react to this
[01:32:57.900 --> 01:33:03.980]   A surface the size of a fingertip which means that you always have to be dealing with this really really huge like magic markers sized
[01:33:03.980 --> 01:33:08.620]   A stylus what they did is that they decided to make a ballpoint type stylus
[01:33:08.620 --> 01:33:11.740]   But put this little disc of plastic on the end of it
[01:33:11.740 --> 01:33:16.220]   So as far as the ipad is concerned you've it's got this big fat disc that it can read
[01:33:16.220 --> 01:33:21.980]   Correctly as far as your eye is concerned though. You've got this really nice pinpoint control
[01:33:21.980 --> 01:33:26.540]   Uh, lost focus. Sorry about that. Uh, you've got this really nice pinpoint
[01:33:26.540 --> 01:33:30.780]   Things you can actually do fine lines. You can actually sort of see like the difference
[01:33:30.780 --> 01:33:38.140]   Uh a minor minor version of that, uh on this sketch right here where I wanted to I wanted to like write down what
[01:33:38.140 --> 01:33:41.820]   The the book was that I was copying the artwork from on the bottom
[01:33:41.820 --> 01:33:46.620]   That's as big as that that's as small as tiny lettering as I could possibly draw with my fingertip
[01:33:46.620 --> 01:33:51.260]   At the top there is actually what I wanted to do what I actually wanted to write because uh
[01:33:51.740 --> 01:33:55.660]   As soon as I got it and try to rewrite it and you can get really fine cross hatching
[01:33:55.660 --> 01:33:59.420]   You can get really fine lines and again, even if you're just sort of a thing
[01:33:59.420 --> 01:34:01.500]   Not a real artist but just someone who just doodles
[01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:09.580]   It's so frustrating when you really want to put a line right exactly there or you want two lines to actually intersect and touch right there
[01:34:09.580 --> 01:34:12.620]   But there's absolutely no way to do it when you're just using your finger
[01:34:12.620 --> 01:34:17.580]   Uh, this is just really wonderful and it's it makes it gives you some modicum of control
[01:34:17.820 --> 01:34:20.860]   The bad news is that when your sketch turns out lousy you
[01:34:20.860 --> 01:34:23.660]   You can't blame the fact that you didn't have a stylus
[01:34:23.660 --> 01:34:28.300]   There's actually there's no excuses if you have uh, this the the uh the jot pro
[01:34:28.300 --> 01:34:31.980]   It's not terribly expensive most styluses that are any good at all cost
[01:34:31.980 --> 01:34:34.860]   Between 15 and 25 bucks this one costs
[01:34:34.860 --> 01:34:39.900]   All of 30 bucks, but again if it's something that you want to have a handy with you
[01:34:39.900 --> 01:34:43.180]   It's certainly worth it. I just I just wish that they had thought to put
[01:34:43.660 --> 01:34:46.780]   An actual clip on it. So I won't lose it inside my pocket
[01:34:46.780 --> 01:34:47.580]   Yeah
[01:34:47.580 --> 01:34:50.860]   You go you go to a good old-timey office supply store or go to amazon
[01:34:50.860 --> 01:34:55.260]   You can actually buy a pencil clip and put it on that way. So I've got one of those on order too
[01:34:55.260 --> 01:34:59.500]   So add another three dollars to the cost. This was actually a, um
[01:34:59.500 --> 01:35:01.980]   Kickstarter project about a year ago
[01:35:01.980 --> 01:35:06.780]   Yeah, and it's one it was one of those few kickstarter projects that is actually exactly as good as the video
[01:35:08.380 --> 01:35:13.580]   So seriously you get it as like oh, that was a great video not quite so much a good product
[01:35:13.580 --> 01:35:14.780]   Right, right, right, right
[01:35:14.780 --> 01:35:18.540]   I'll submit it to your fourth the the only the only caveat i'll put on it is that
[01:35:18.540 --> 01:35:21.420]   Uh most styluses they're made of soft rubber
[01:35:21.420 --> 01:35:25.660]   And so if you're the sort of person who uses a stylus to actually take notes
[01:35:25.660 --> 01:35:29.180]   Uh, the adona, remember that's hard plastic and that's hard like metal
[01:35:29.180 --> 01:35:33.020]   Uh, it won't scratch the iPad at all, but as you're if you're taking notes
[01:35:33.020 --> 01:35:35.340]   Everyone in the world that you're tap tap tap tap tap
[01:35:37.100 --> 01:35:40.940]   As you write so not maybe it may be better for sketching and drawing than note taking
[01:35:40.940 --> 01:35:44.540]   But if you're sketching and drawing best best one that I've found so far
[01:35:44.540 --> 01:35:50.700]   the uh, the verge did a uh, I think quite a good uh review that somebody in the chat were mentioned
[01:35:50.700 --> 01:35:55.660]   The best styli for the ipad and they include that and among many many others. I think they reviewed
[01:35:55.660 --> 01:35:59.420]   Well, it looks like about nine or ten of them. There are a lot out there right now
[01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:02.540]   So uh, yeah, depending on what you're looking for
[01:36:03.260 --> 01:36:09.500]   Um, yeah, I think the two best are that one and whatever cheap no name one you can get like spent for $20
[01:36:09.500 --> 01:36:16.700]   Because it's it's very likely that this I have to be really careful with this one because I am the sort of person who can't have like a nice
[01:36:16.700 --> 01:36:19.660]   $50 pen because at some point I will lose it somewhere
[01:36:19.660 --> 01:36:22.220]   I won't I won't lose it in the library, but I'll lose it somewhere in the house
[01:36:22.220 --> 01:36:27.500]   I will never be able to find it when I need it. They call it the most precise ipad stylus money can buy
[01:36:29.420 --> 01:36:32.860]   So they also agree. This is that they like the idon it
[01:36:32.860 --> 01:36:35.020]   the job pro
[01:36:35.020 --> 01:36:39.980]   Uh, annie and not co is at the chicago sun times you can catch his new review of iPhoto there
[01:36:39.980 --> 01:36:45.500]   Uh in the printed newspaper as well as online in print as well as odd live. Yes
[01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:52.460]   We want your eyeballs. We don't care whether they're aimed at glass or dead trees. He is an ink stained wretch
[01:36:53.420 --> 01:37:00.140]   He also blogs at www.cwob.com and lots of great pictures and are you going to publish your sketches?
[01:37:00.140 --> 01:37:03.980]   I think that's kind of a neat idea. I posted why I posted one or two of them
[01:37:03.980 --> 01:37:08.940]   I'll probably when I when I finally get around to actually hitting the button on uh, all the all the dublin stuff
[01:37:08.940 --> 01:37:12.380]   I'll probably include them there too. Uh, my problem is that
[01:37:12.380 --> 01:37:15.820]   Editing the photos takes so their photos are all edited
[01:37:15.820 --> 01:37:17.820]   But I'm like I want to write 20
[01:37:17.820 --> 01:37:21.740]   I want to have circles and arrows and a paragraph on the bottom of each one explaining what the what the scene is
[01:37:22.220 --> 01:37:25.020]   And so it's like that's why it takes me five months to publish it
[01:37:25.020 --> 01:37:28.300]   You're just too good
[01:37:28.300 --> 01:37:34.860]   We also want to thank darin ocana for joining us from the asc.com. He is a professional cinematographer
[01:37:34.860 --> 01:37:39.020]   It's great to be here. This is fun in the brick house in the brick house
[01:37:39.020 --> 01:37:42.780]   Maybe we could do a video of me as uh as harry truman
[01:37:42.780 --> 01:37:45.340]   Absolutely. What do you think?
[01:37:45.340 --> 01:37:51.100]   And the buck's holding up a newspaper saying cnbc defeats twit. Yes
[01:37:52.060 --> 01:37:54.060]   [laughter]
