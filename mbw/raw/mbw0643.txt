[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   It's time for Mac Brake Weekly, the show we get together
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   with the Mac journalists to talk about the Apple world.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Alex Lindsey is in studio with us.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Hello, hello.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   In the Pixel Core.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Hello, Alex.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   He's got his cup of tea, so he sets.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   There's you.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   I was a kid.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   I just brought an knowledge of that.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Also with us, he probably has his cane sugar soda,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Mr. Andy Naco.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   We were late, so I no longer have a cane.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   He's got his 1893.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Even better.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   I had this about 40 minutes ago.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Now, you ration those, right?
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   You only can have a certain number of 1893s a day.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   I buy one 12 pack per month.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   If I were foolish enough to drink them all in one day,
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   I am free to do that, but Andy, that means that you will not have
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   any for the rest of them.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   That's brilliant.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   So I usually like when I cook like a real meal or if I have
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   guests over, so yes.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   It's the special tiple.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Otherwise, it's usually just flavored salt.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   I should mention that is not Coca-Cola, but Pepsi-Cola.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Well, it's against the 1893 with like real cane sugar,
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   and like has a very peppery sort of artisanal taste.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Oh, really?
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   It doesn't taste like regular Coke.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Pepsi?
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Because the regular Coke, the regular Pepsi, it's like really,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   really sweet compared to this stuff.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   This is designed to be like, you really, really taste like the
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   cane sugar.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   You taste like the colonnuts.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   I can't tell you what is being contributed by what, but it's
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   like a more of a spicy sort of savory sort of taste.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   It tastes like the best cola you've ever had.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   It tastes like the sort of stuff that costs an extra.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   That has to come in a fancy can with a fancy label, and you have
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   to tell yourself, again, I can only have this.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   This is too tasty without rules.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   I have to have only 12 of these a month.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Or else that becomes medically contraindicated, I think,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   but real sugar soda, important 12 times a month.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   I think Mike, you can start to look.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   I think Mike, you can start to feed this to his Chihuahuas.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   This is a good idea.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Yeah, I mean, I just have water and that's not fun.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Maybe what, yeah.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Their Chihuahuas might actually become like jumpy or something
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   without that caffeine.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   That's hard to imagine.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Regular contributor.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   They're going to actually vibrate so quickly that they will
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   ascend to another plane, and I won't have them anymore because
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   they will sort of exist in another dimension by drinking
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   that caffeine beverage.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   You'll find my guest, Chihuahua.coffee, and he has a
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   apparently a nuclear reactor behind him, which is a pulsing.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   I just wanted to warn you, Michael.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   You may be in trouble.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   It looks like it's a, I don't know, is it time to scram?
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   What is it?
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Those LED, those weird LED lights behind you.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   That is a lifex light.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Lifex.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Okay.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Yes.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   I swear by the lifex one as opposed to the Philips Hue one,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   because as you can see, there are multiple colors going on back
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   there.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   The Philips Hue only does one color across the whole
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   dog on thing, and that's boring when you can have all those
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   colors all at once.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   So, the day after we did the show, no, we didn't do it last week.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Is this our first show of the new year?
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   It is.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   It is.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Happy to hear.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Tim Cook began the new year, Wednesday, and this is our first
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   chance to get together to talk about it.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   In fact, I was doing Twig when the chat room told me, "Apple
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   shares, trading has been halted."
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   What?
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   That's a big deal.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   And then Tim Cook's letter came out, a letter to Apple investors,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   in which he said, "We told you in our last analyst call that we
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   expected revenue around 92, 93 billion.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   It's going to be 84 billion."
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   And we just want to let you know, of course, Apple immediately,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   the stock dropped significantly.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Apple went from being a trillion dollar company to a 700
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   billion dollar company.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Ah, the ha.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Only number four in market cap in the world.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Now, Tim only gets to park in the multi-billion dollar company
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   lot when he goes to the hunting lodge in Aspen.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   I thought there was a lot of, and I use the word "shodenfroid" on
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Sunday.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   A lot of people, this is what we do as human beings, right?
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   We build people up just so we can knock them.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   I knew it.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   I knew it.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   It is rare.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   The last revenue warning Apple issued was back in 2002,
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   but they have had other bad quarters.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Ben Thompson, I thought, wrote a good piece which came out yesterday
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   in Stratecary.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   He was on vacation, so it took him a little while to come out
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   with this analysis.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   But he said, "Actually, I expected this.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   I think a lot of people did."
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   And despite the, you know, the shodenfroid, the sinful pleasure,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   and others misfortune, this might be good news in the long run for
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Apple.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   He said, "I believe Apple's management made three critical
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   errors in their forecast for this last quarter."
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   He wrote this up, actually, some months ago, that were
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   predictable precisely because they made the same errors.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Before errors, I wrote about it that time.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   In other words, I'm very much susceptible to confirmation bias
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   as well.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   We all expected it, so we got it.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   If I am right, there's good news for Apple.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   The company's in better shape than the last week of hysteria
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   suggests.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   So Tim blamed China.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   He said that the strong dollar meant that, of course, the
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   exchange rate was in our, you know, against their China's favor,
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   that the Chinese economy had been slumping.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   And he said, "Over 100% of our year-to-year revenue decline
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   occurred in greater China."
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Greater China, I found out, is not just China.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   It's also Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   So they didn't sell us well in China.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   But remember, this was the strategy to compensate for
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   dropping sales in general, right?
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   We're going to make it up in China.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   So they didn't make it up in China.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Great.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   I mean, this is the bottom line is that it bottomed out in other
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   parts of the world already.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   And the growth that they saw over the last couple of years was,
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   as they moved into the Chinese market, they became more and more
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   dependent on that for growth, not for overall sales.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   I mean, there's still a large number of people who are buying
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   iPhones, obviously.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   Yeah, they're still going to make eight-
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Not a bad four billion.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Not a bad three months.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   Remember, a couple of years ago, they did 76 billion, and that was
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   the biggest quarter ever.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   You know, and so 84 billion is not necessarily a huge disappointment.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   Does it mean that the iPhone is not, though, as successful as it
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   should be, or what we expected it?
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Certainly, if they were expecting to break the piggy bank in
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   China, that's something that I never, that was a plan I never
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   really understood.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   I wouldn't have gone to so far to say that it was wrong, somebody
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   that I didn't understand it.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   Given that in China, Apple's been so lax over there that other
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   services and other phones are really the, had a chance to
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   already become sort of the iPhone of China.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   There's really no opportunity for Apple to say, hey, look at our
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   entire ecosystem.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Look how wonderful our network of, our network of services.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Our network of services are look how wonderful our network of
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   software is, because again, because China developed all kind of
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   in its own sort of walled in garden of its own, Apple couldn't
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   build its own walled in garden inside its walled in garden.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   And the third thing is that I, my perception of, of Apple and
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   China is that it really is more of a fashion brand than it is
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   here in, in the United States.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   A lot of people with, with just cause continue to support Apple
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   products because they say it's really well built the last
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   long time.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   They're very well supported.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   I think that in China, it's, excuse me, end it end in the
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   United States.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   It's also like the fashion brand.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   You really want to be able to flash that Apple logo.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   Whereas in China, you can buy a, the reason, one, one reason
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   why there's such a good market for knockoff phones is that people
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   care about having that logo on the back of the phone.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   It's, it doesn't matter to them that once they drill down past
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   the top layer of the interface, it's actually an Android phone.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   Just like a lot of people, they don't care if they don't have
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   a real Louis Vuitton bag, as long as they have a real, a
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   well made bag that has that Louis Vuitton styling and the
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Louis Vuitton logo on it.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   So I, that's why I never understood the idea that Apple's
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   going to crack this big giant piggy bank full of cash that is
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   China.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   And then we don't even get into the problems of what kind of
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   controls is China going to continue to exert over, over a
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   company like Apple and what kind of effect are the trade wars
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   going to have in trying to get products into, into that market
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   to begin with.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   So I, I think that Apple has larger problems around the iPhone.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   Like you said, I think they've, they've had a great, they, they
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   still are very, very profitable.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   There's no problem with them continuing to exist.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   But if there's a good thing that comes from this is that maybe a
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   lot of people outside of Apple will reflect upon the fact that
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   Apple is mortal and that it is not a natural thing for a company
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   to keep having a better quarter, quarter year after year after
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   year that's okay to simply to be profitable and to have their,
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   have their money in a lot of different businesses.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   And that's what Apple's going to be like in five or ten years.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   At some point the iPhone is going to be a nice part of their
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   portfolio, but the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the joy is going
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   to be over for, for the iPhone as being their big huge wedge of
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   profitability every year.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   Michael, what are the lessons?
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   What are the lessons for Apple in this?
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   I mean, well, so it's interesting to me, I think because we've
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   already seen, I think that maybe Apple wasn't ready quite yet to
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   do this whole, oh, yeah, now we got to be worried about this thing.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   And here's what's going on.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   But if, you know, I, I transcribe the earnings calls every time
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   they come around.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   And so I've had a chance to listen to all for a while.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   And so I've had a chance to listen to all for a while.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   Now the way that they report these things and the, and what they
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   talk about.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   And Apple has been, and you know, this is not new information.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   Apple has been saying services, services, services, services,
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   services, services, services for so long now.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   And it is clear that they have been sort of like wink, wink, hint,
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   hint, hint beating around the bush saying, Hey, pay attention to
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   these other companies that, that are within our company.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   And you know, you've got iPhone, that's great, but we're going to
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   stop reporting unit sales and unit numbers.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   And we are going to sort of back away from that.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   And by the way, did you hear about services and also these other
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   devices that we're selling?
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   It's, I think that, you know, if Apple, if there's a lesson for
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   Apple to learn, it's kind of what, who was, I think it was, yeah,
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Bloomberg said, Apple's iPhone warning comes years too late.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   I think for some reason, the financial industry needs some
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   like hand holding and maybe did not realize that this had to happen.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   But it's just, as Andy said, it's obvious that at some point we
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   were going to hit this thing.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   And it's clear, I think that Apple internally was planning for
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   this and was saying, you know, we've got to start looking at these
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   other ways to make money, like charging people for little amounts
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   of storage.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   But, you know, that's an, that's an aside.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   And we've got to sort of diversify.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   But I think that they just didn't come to Apple's or rather to,
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   you know, the world and say, hey, get ready because the iPhone's
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   about to drop.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   And I don't know if they predicted it.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   And my guess is that this correction, I mean, I think that
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   they probably saw it.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   They probably calculated that it was going to be in the spring or
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   the, you know, one of the next two quarters was going to be a
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   contraction.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   They did issue a guidance though that was well above what it
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   was going to be.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   No, no, what I'm saying is that I think that they didn't think
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   it was going to happen this quarter.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   I think that the reason they turned it off was we're going to
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   have a great quarter, you know, because that was the holiday
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   quarter.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   You said it will be a record like a masonry said last time and
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   you wrote it down, Micah.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   Right.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   That it was going to be a record quarter this year.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   So I think my guess is that they expected it to be a record
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   quarter.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   They figured this is the time, if you're going to shut off the
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   iPhone numbers, shut them off when it was a record quarter, you
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   know, and, and I think that they expected to have another quarter
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   or two before it was going to be something that contracted.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   I think it's not that they didn't expect it to contract.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   It's not that they, they, I think they just didn't expect it to
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   contract this quarter.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   And that was the, you know, I think that is the, that is the
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   distinction I bet you they were going to talk about more services
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   oddly enough.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   But I think that the interesting thing for Apple is that what
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   Apple has cornered, I will argue, is 200 to 300 million people who
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   are willing to pay a premium for things just to work, you know,
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   and that is probably not talking about morals.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   I'm not talking about what it's, the way the world should work
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   from a business perspective.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   That's the, that's one of the most valuable groups of people.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   Two to 300 million people willing to pay a little extra for
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   everything to work is, is probably the most valuable client base
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   you can have.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   And so, so I think that there is a huge opportunity for Apple to
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   increase services, but also products.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   I think that one of the things that Apple hasn't done very well
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   is expand.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   They've kind of taken the culture of Steve Jobs and just continue
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   down it.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   And the problem is they don't have Steve anymore.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   So without Steve, you can't do that.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   You know, you have to now spread out and have things that are
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   not the next big thing every single time.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   But the problem was, is that Steve would look at one thing and
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   focus on it and make it successful.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   And then he'd look at something else and that thing just
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   disappeared for him.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   And he would just now look at this other thing and make that
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   successful.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   And so what Apple needs to do now is pay attention to a bunch of
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   things.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   For instance, I think that the home, the whole home automation
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   process is moving very, very slowly.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   They're starting to show off, hey, we've got a doorbell.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   We've got a bunch of other things.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   Apple should have been building those products.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   I mean, they should have just, you know, it doesn't, you know,
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   they should have just said, we're going to build the products for
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   you.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   And if you other people want to build into the system, that's
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   great.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   But we're going to make it because I look at like, I have, I have
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   14 sonuses at my house, right?
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   That came with the house.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   I bought the house and had a bunch of them.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   And that's always a lot of money.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   So I was like, I was like, do these come with the house?
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   And they were like, yeah, it came with the house.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   Yeah, I was like, I'll think, like literally they're speakers all
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   through every, the whole house.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   And it's got these, but every time I do an update to my Wi-Fi,
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   every time, like, I have to like go back and accept them all.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   There's like this huge process of updating the house's audio
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   system every single time I do something.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   Whereas my, my, my Apple HomePod just fixes, you know, like, like,
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   just, you know, and new Apple products, people come in with
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   their iPhone.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   You Kevin Hanson was at my house the other day.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   He went to, he went to go, uh, jump on the, on the Wi-Fi and it
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   just pops up on my phone.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   Do you want to give him the Wi-Fi password?
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   I was like, yeah.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   I love that.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   And, and the thing is, is that there are--
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   It's interesting you say that because one of the things Thompson
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   points out is that lock in that Apple has here doesn't apply in China.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   It may not.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   It may not.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   A lot of the phones, a lot of the apps, like WeChat, they use
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   across platform.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   So he says, there's not nearly the penalty in China for moving to an
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   Android device.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   And I, I agree.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   And I, and I think that there's, I, I think that there's two things
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   that Apple, two lessons that I hope Apple doesn't learn from this.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   One is that they should start opening up all their, you know,
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   opening up everything up.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   And, and I see that a little bit when they're starting to put like,
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   iTunes on, on Samsung's and everything else.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   And so--
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   I don't want that.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   I mean, as an Apple user, I just want everything to work.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   I want everything to be tied together.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   I want a walled garden.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   I want it to work.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   I want it to work.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   I want it to look.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   I just want it to look.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   What that experience of.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   If someone comes to my house and I give my password, my home pod
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   works, my eventually, my car works, my, my glasses work,
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   everything just ties together.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   There's no pro, external protocols that have to be figured out.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   I just--
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   I mean, the other option is that, but this will never happen.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   Or support it.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   This is a foolish pipe dream is that every, every time you
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   have a new name is that everything's open and everything
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   interoperates.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   But when everything's open--
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   And when everything is open, it's a mess.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   Look at Android.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   You know, like--
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   If everybody read on the page--
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   If everybody reads on the page--
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   It's an adhered to it, but nobody will, because everybody wants
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   their walled garden.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   Fundamentally, everyone wants--
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   Every company wants to take what--
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   It costs what--
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   An unused cost and commoditize it.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   And they want to take what they--
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   What makes them money and control it.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   And those things all mismatch between every company.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   And that will destroy every open format ever.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   And so Apple has this incredible power of they have the hardware,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   they have the OS, they have the products, and they can tie all
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   those together.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   And there are--
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   And again, I think that there are 200 to 300 million people.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   And the question is, can they get 200 to 300 million people to
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   pay about $1,000 a year for different things so that they can
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   have their life work.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   So what you're doing with this new accounting is we're not going
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   to look at units, so we're going to look at revenue per customer.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   And I wouldn't say--
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   That's the number you should be looking at.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   And I would say that the cynical way of looking at that is
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   how do we squeeze the most out of the customer.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   But really, how do we provide a great experience for the people
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   that are willing to pay for that?
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   And there's a lot of them.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   And it turns out that there's hundreds of millions of people
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   that are willing to pay for that.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   The possible lesson-- I'm not saying this is true, but the
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   possible lesson is that Apple might have seen what happens
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   when they really have to compete, like everybody else competes,
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   in a marketplace that it doesn't actually work out as well as they
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   would like it to work.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   That sometimes what I worry about Apple is that they're not
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   being as-- they're not being as strong or as competitive as they
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   could be by wanting to be the toughest predator on a very,
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   very isolated island with that nobody else can get into.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   And as soon as, like, one cat or one rat lands on that island,
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   or as soon as a creature from that island tries to compete,
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   like with the rats in New York, they get killed really, really
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   quickly because they have not learned skills that every other
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   company has learned to deal with.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   For instance, how to embrace other people's technologies,
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   how to embrace open standards, how to make something that works
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   well with another thing or another system that you have no
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   control over.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   It's not a toy-- it is harder on the Android--
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   It used to do that on the--
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   It was the dominant operating system.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   They used to do that.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   But they had to do that in the last decade.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   I just find that everything that's an open standard that you
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   have to tie to, you just end up with all this gobbledygook.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   As someone who's unfortunately the fact of it,
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   I wish it weren't because it would be better for everybody
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   if things interoperated, but they don't.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   But like an example of the-- it only works if you provide enough
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   of the solution.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   So Apple providing all the different pieces,
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   and so when they don't provide, for instance,
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   all the home products.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   The downside to that is when Apple doesn't do it right,
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   or they decide not to do something, you're out of luck.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   So there is no Sono solution yet.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   There's a home pod.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   No, I agree.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   That's the downside to a closed one.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   By the way, it's not just Apple.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   This chart from Bloomberg shows that, in fact,
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   smartphone sales are declining across the board.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   Samsung took a big drop, too.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   So everybody's got to deal with this.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   Everybody has a smartphone.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   We have smartphones.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   I've seen it talked about how they're like appliances now,
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   and we don't necessarily need to give them up.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   Is Apple charging too much for its phones?
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   Not for the people who are willing to buy the stupid iPhone
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   XS Max that I have that I didn't need,
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   even though I have an iPhone X and I upgraded them.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   We all bought one, right?
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   Yeah, we got one, and they're happy with that.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   But I think that in terms of price and maybe like the lesson
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   here, and I saw some folks talking about this too,
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   the lesson here is that, yes, there is finally that upper level
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   of, okay, well, $1,500 is definitely the limit that folks are
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   going to go.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   But I do think that we've reached a point where lots of people
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   now have smartphones, and for some people, the value prop is not
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   getting a new smartphone that has a new, better screen.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   It's the fact that this phone that they have still works,
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   and it's just fine.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   And so it makes sense to me.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   I mean, it's like a solution.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   If you fill the water with salt, eventually the salt stops
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   dissolving into the water because there's too much salt.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   And like now that we've hit this level where so many people
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   have smartphones, they aren't necessarily needing to get rid of
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   them, they aren't necessarily interested in upgrading,
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   getting a better device.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   And so if there's nobody to buy the devices, then what do you do?
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   You have to come up with new things.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   You have to come out with a subscription video service that can
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   be not just on your own set top box, but can be on other televisions
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   because folks who already have those devices might want to then
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   pay Apple to have their subscription video service or what have
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   you.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   So this is just very clearly in my mind, we've reached the
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   period where it's saturation to a certain extent.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   And I realize there are plenty of markets where we can expand,
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   but it's clear that Apple now is going, okay, let's look at some
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   other ways to make money because we can't just keep growing,
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   growing, growing when it makes no sense to do so because people
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   have the phones and they're fine with them.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   And then the battery thing too, it doesn't cost a whole heck of a
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   lot to get a new battery put into your old phone.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   So it lasts even longer.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   So no, I'm not going to buy a new iPhone, 10S Max.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   Well, I might as well, I am, but you know what I mean, someone
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   else might not do that.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   It just, it seems like we're getting to that point where this
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   all just makes sense.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   A lot of people can't sell more smartphones because the
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   smartphones are out there.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   We should point out, not that the stock market is the, is in
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   any way a bellwether, but Apple stock today is up 2.33%.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   People saw that as a buying opportunity for a stock that has
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   been tumbling for six months.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   This is the peak was October 3rd at 232 bucks.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   It's down now to $151.30.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   So, but the inner day, but today the stock is declining up.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   Not that that means anything.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   I'm just, but if you're going to talk about market cap and I
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   don't, obviously, I'm on the show and I don't have any.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   We don't have any Apple stocks, but I'm going to get a dog in this.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   But I think there's also in China, there's a little bit of a
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   backlash after the trade wars and the dissing of Huawei and
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   ZTE from the United States that may be seen as
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   unpatriotic to some people in China to buy an American.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   It does seem like, well, companies have been telling their
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   employees not to use it.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   Especially because you've got great phones in China from
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   Chinese manufacturers that are about half as much as an iPhone.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   Right.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   Also, we should point out that the Huawei staffer who tweeted
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   Happy New Year from an iPhone has been demoted.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   Well, that was, that's a pretty classic.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   That's a classic thing.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   But I think it was seen a little bit as, you know, you're
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   being a, you're being unpatriotic.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   You're being disloyal.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   Anyway, that's a side, a side story.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   But so Apple's lessons, let's continue on because I think a
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   smart company, question number one is Tim Cook, the wrong guy to
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   lead Apple into this future.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   He was the right guy for less 10 years.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   I think that it's kind of one of those things like the
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   offense, he's a different quarterback and the offense is still
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   the same offense.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   And I think that's the problem.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   Sorry to the football.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   That's a good point.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   But they're still playing the same offense, which is one
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   product at a time when you have someone that's operational.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   I feel like they need to expand the number of products.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   Not just services, but hardware.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   But expand the number of products that they're providing
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   their consumers because they have to, they have this limited
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   group of consumers and that's going to grow slowly.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   And what they need to do now is to figure out how they serve them
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   with more things that just work.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   I can tell that Alex, you really want Apple to release some
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   home kit products of their own.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   And I do for that world.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   I am 900,000% for that world.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   Please let that happen.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   You just want everything, when you open it up, like when you open up
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   a home pod, it just, it pulls a bunch of stuff and then it works.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   People avoid it home because it's hard to develop for.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   And for a while you had some hardware, some specific stuff.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   And I think Apple should have kept it.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   I mean, from a security perspective, you know, and I think
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   that Apple has made the biggest thing that they have done well is
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   this whole, now that privacy, the biggest risk for them is
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   Australia because if they start to really break into the
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   hardware and, you know, do you encrypt stuff and put it back
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   in, and that's a huge issue for Apple.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   But I think that otherwise the privacy, there is, again, a
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   group of people who are willing to pay to know that all those
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   hardware and all the services are all relatively tied up compared
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   to, you know, all the other platforms.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   And I think that that's been the right choice for Apple.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   And especially when you're talking about homes, you're talking
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   about your car, you're talking about, you know, all those other
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   things, you're going to want to have that privacy more than ever.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   What do you think that you said?
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   Something important.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   Oh, go ahead, Mike.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   This is something really important about this, you know,
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   the, you know, this home kit thing.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   I, whenever Apple first released the news specification to where you
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   could do home kit authentication via software instead of hardware,
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   I did some super deep digging in trying to understand what it is.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   And that's because there was a common misconception out there
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   that if, uh, if a product did not have the hardware chip from
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   Apple, then it meant that it was less secure because it was
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   using software based authentication.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   That is not actually the case.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   Whether you use the hardware chip or you use the software chip,
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   Apple's requirements for the security and the authentication
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   process is the same.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   What the hardware chip allowed people to do companies who
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   manufactured smart home products was make that whole thing
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   easier for them.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   Apple did require it.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   Yes, you had to have the chip, but what it did was you sort of,
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   you, you know, you make your board and you connect all the stuff,
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   the Wi-Fi thing, and it's all connected.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   And then you add that chip and it takes care of all of the
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   processing.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   It does it, or rather authentication and it does it.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   In the low power way that was easier for folks who are making
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   Bluetooth, L E gadgets and Wi-Fi gadgets that were not connected
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   to, uh, to, you know, your normal house power.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   So that it was then an Apple only product that couldn't work
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   in other ecosystems.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   So it made it difficult, obviously, because the people
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   want to be Z wave.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   They want to be Zigbee.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   They want to work with other ecosystems.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   They want to work with the Android.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   And if you'd put in a chip that makes it Apple specific.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   Oh, no, no, no, that's cost.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   And does it limit your choice?
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   It's cost, but it doesn't, it doesn't make it so that it
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   couldn't work.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   You could still put a radio on the other stuff.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   Yeah, you could still work with the Amazon assistant.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   It's just it costs more.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   And for companies who had already been creating these
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   products for so long, they're not going to redesign their chip
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   and have to start all over to include Apple's authentication
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   co-processor.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   So when they came out with the software authentication option,
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   it said, hey, you still have to do the exact same stuff we've got
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   to do.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   I can't remember all of the different things, but it's like
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   doubly encrypted and this and that and the other.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   All of these different processes still have to happen, but
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   we're letting you take care of that on your own now if you want
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   to.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   You don't have to get this chip.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   And they still have to go and send the product to certain
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   testing places that Apple has set up that if they've said, okay,
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   yeah, you know, we give this an approval for doing the testing
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   and that is expensive.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   One thing that I do like about it though, and this is about the
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   privacy comment is the fact that Apple, one of the requirements
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   in order to have that works with Apple HomeKit badge is that you
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   have to be able to completely set up the smart home product using
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   the home app for iOS.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   That means that there's no third party.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   You can't require the third party app.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   And then, you know, then they, yeah, they lose user accounts.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   They lose the chance to connect with you over the server and
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   things like that.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   So companies weren't.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   It's good for users.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   It's good for Apple.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   But these companies all want to have their app.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   For those companies.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   So somebody in the chat room said, I thought this was a good
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   question.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   Is Tim Cook, Apple's Steve Ballmer?
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   Ballmer Microsoft made it very, well, he made a lot of money.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   Microsoft was very successful, but not in the way that mattered
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   in the long run under Steve Ballmer.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   Is Tim Cook that person?
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   Andy, what do you think?
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   I don't think so.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   Probably just because of the culture inside of Apple.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   The problem wasn't just Steve Ballmer.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   It was the culture inside of Microsoft, which was to really
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   make everybody internally, exactly fight with each other as
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   hard as possible and not necessarily for the benefit of the
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   company, but for the benefit of their own projects or their own
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   units.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   So I don't think that at all.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   There is a, I suppose you could now ask a question.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   If the person whose business brain was formed out of the problems
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   of how do we get components from where they are being made to
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   where we need them to be manufactured into products and how
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   do we get these products shipped from A to B?
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   That's what he, that's why he was brought into Apple and that's
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   one of the big things that he's been bringing to the company
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   ever since.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   You could ask the question of does he still have the right
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   brain for a company that's going to have to transition into a
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   business of electrons instead of just actual hardware.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   I don't think so once again because of the culture.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   Sometimes however, if you really need to make a huge, huge,
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   huge change, sometimes that really does come with a brand new
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   person right at the top.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   Not because the other person is doing a bad job, but because
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   this new person doesn't have any preconceptions over where the
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   money comes from.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   But I think that if one bad quarter and one letter and one
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   all employee communication from Tim Cook caused the stock price
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   of Apple to go down that badly, imagine how badly replacing Tim
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   Cook would be.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   I don't see any problems that Apple is having that is solved
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   or helped by swapping in Tim Cook.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   We might see some new vice presidents come in, we might see
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   a slight reorganization, we might see some projects move from one
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   person's house to another house, but I don't think there are any
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   problems that could be solved by moving Tim Cook into an
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   emeritus position.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   I also think that their next "next big projects" have
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   probably taken a little longer.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   We've seen the rumors, stops and starts, the glasses, the car,
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   those were things that would have been a big push and they've
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   had a lot more trouble getting those out the door than at least
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   that's the rumor that they've taken longer to project because
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   they're hard.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   I think we're going to see those things still come out.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   I think that they've got a good future, but I do think that
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   Apple needs to expand what they do.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   There's ways for them to redefine how these markets work.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   I still think, I'm going to say one thing that I've said a couple
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   times, but I'm going to say it again, is that if you look at
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   something like iBooks, I think iBooks was a big failure on
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   Apple's part partially because they just wanted to make a
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   bookstore that was like Kindle and they gave it a whole bunch
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   of new tools but didn't prove how to use those new tools to make
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   it really compelling.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   They did the same thing they did with HomeKit, which is that
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   they went to Pearson and they went to all these publishers and
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   asked them to make iBooks.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   Of course, these guys couldn't think their way out of a box.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   They just created the same book with Apple moving videos as
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   opposed to redefining more.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   They were like, "I agree, I agree, it was a bad offer for Pearson."
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   What they should have done is they should have built the first
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   set of books and set the pace for how far you can push that
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   technology as opposed to going to an established group.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   In the same way that HomeKit is not good for a lot of the
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   established folks, Apple should have innovated that area and
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   then forced them to move forward.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   On iPhone, Apple couldn't have tried to persuade people to do
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   something with the iOS.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   By creating the phone, they forced the entire industry to move a
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   certain direction.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   I think that when they don't do that, it doesn't work because
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   people can't see that far.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   That's a consistent problem.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   When Apple keeps creating products that work great, so long as you
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   buy a whole bunch of other Apple stuff, you are limiting your
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   market to people who have already invested in Apple or
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   already have an emotional level of faith in Apple.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   You have to create a product that lets people solve their own
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   problems.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   That doesn't involve going to the Apple store.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   Once again, if I have one worry about Apple's ability as a
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   company, is that what do you do when you have to build something
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   that has to work with something else and you don't know what
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   that something else is going to be?
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   That's a really hard problem to solve and most other companies
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   have been dealing with that for the entire lives of the
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   company.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   Whereas Apple is, okay, we'll create our own messaging standard.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   Okay, we'll create our own connectivity standard.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   Okay, we'll create our own system and they can create all
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   kinds of our own publishing system and they can promote all
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   kinds of very, very rational arguments by their system is
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   better, but for someone who, because of their own preferences
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   or because of their own budgets or because of other technical
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   needs, they can't buy the iPad that's required to run this
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   textbook, all these advantages, they can only be admired
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   academically from a distance.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   So I really think that Apple has to figure out how to coexist in
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   a larger world without making their product suffer as a
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   consequence.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   I just think their ecosystem has to be large enough that it makes
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   sense.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   I mean, you look at, if we say, if we agree that 200 to 300
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   million people are willing to pay for that, pay for that
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   interconnectivity and everything else, I don't think Apple needs
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   a market bigger than that.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   You know, I think that, you know, and they could literally, you
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   know, the thing is, is that you keep on tying those folks in
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   because there's a lot of people out there, and admittedly, I
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   mean, I have an Android phone.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   I have PCs, Linux, a whole bunch of other things, but the core
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   of my life mostly revolves around a Mac experience and I don't
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   really, I just want to worry.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   I just want to worry.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   But there's no way Apple's going to say, oh, yeah, stock market,
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   we're not going to grow.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   We just got these 200 million people.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   We're going to be happy.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   No, no, no.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   Grow it.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   But I think that, you know--
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   Well, they are saying services, services, services, which is
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   about one of the things--
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   Yeah, and there's a lot of us that the kind of person buying
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   the Apple phone is someone who's paying a lot of money for a lot
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   of other things that Apple could encroach on.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   So the thing is--
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   Stock market, though, want them to grow into new markets, new
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   territories.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   I'm saying they can.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   With that group.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   But the thing is, that's a group of people that are, that have
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   disposable income, that are paying for those margins, that are--
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   I think Apple says, no, we've got to find new markets, and that's
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   why they're looking at self-driving cars.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   But I think they're going to stop off from being okay.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   No, I agree.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   No, but I was saying they're taking that 200 to 300 million people
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   and leveraging it into new markets.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   I completely agree with you that that's what they need to do.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   I think that they need to take--
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   Grow into lots of new markets with that group of people, because
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   there's a lot of things that we buy.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   And I think that that's the--
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   And if the--
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   The music has stopped, and if I was going to stop the music right
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   now, I would want to be the company making 30% margins, not
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   companies that are making 1% margin.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   Yeah, 38% is what they're making.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   Go ahead, Micah.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   Oh, you hit the point at the end there.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   I was going to say, while Apple is expanding into other
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   markets, those of us who are happily within Apple Camp will be
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   okay.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   They are still going to keep doing those things for us.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   It just means that they're expanding.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   And then Alex, you ended up saying, yeah, they're leveraging us
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   who are here and happily in Apple and to expand.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   So, yeah, we got there.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   We got there in the end.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   But it's tough, because I mean--
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   I agree that would be a reasonable business, but it's not
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   the way the world works.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   The markets want to see them expanded to new markets and
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   grow and get new consumers.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   Not just say, well, we got--
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   No, I look at Twitter.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   Twitter's been stuck at the same--
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   But I think that--
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   I think that you don't need--
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   The double the number of users every year.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   I think that you can, obviously.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   But I'm saying, but if you have a bunch of--
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   The problem is--
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   There aren't enough people in the world.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   The privacy issues and the privacy issues, the--
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   The fragmentation issues, all those things are going to continue
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   to have certain groups of people go more and more people
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   saying, I'd rather just have it work.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   And I'd rather have just this go away.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   And so, it's not that you're limiting it to that's all you're
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   going to have for the next 10 years.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   It's just that you focus on making sure that that experience
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   is great.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   It's still a really good business in the meantime.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   The problem with Microsoft is, yeah, sure Microsoft had a problem
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   and an existential issue.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   But they also had low grade hardware and low margin
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   everything.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   It's not--
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   The thing is, yeah, they had a problem.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   And they had a problem with a bunch of people that were cheap.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   And they pivoted.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   Yeah, and they pivoted very successfully.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   But I think one of the problems is just that the nature of technology
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   is actually manufacturing is that the first ones cost a hell of a lot
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   of money to make.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   And because they're going to be expensive to begin with,
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   you're only selling them to luxury buyers, which means that you build
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   this car with a luxury coach on top of it with space for a driver
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   and a working fireplace in the enclosed back seat.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   But eventually, you figure out how to engineer it and how to manufacture it.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   So it becomes affordable to everybody.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   And that's when it really becomes a problem if you built your entire
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   brand around luxury.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   And that's what's happening with phones as well.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   This used to be this thing that couldn't possibly be made for anything
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   sold for anything less than six or seven or $800.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   And now what would have been an $800 phone two or three years ago is now $450,
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   maybe $500.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   And that's where it's going to go.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   It's going to go to the level where it's a really, really good phone with lots of
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   features that people actually need is at a price where manufacturers can make a
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   decent profit from it or at least as part of the service that they're selling.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   And then people who are building their entire businesses out of expecting people
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   to spend $800 for a phone are going to need to figure out the next step.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   And it doesn't look like making an even better $1,200 phone is the most natural
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   next step.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   So I will say I think that the calculation Apple made is I think that they put out
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   cheap phones and not near any people bottom.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   I think that they're market.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   I think that the the the the the the that cheap.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   But they but what I'm saying is that they were when they put the iPhone,
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   whatever it was that see the see or whatever.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   I bet you I bet you didn't see.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   I bet you internally that the numbers were not in the S you know those.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   As you did pretty well.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   They did okay but they didn't do they didn't do as well as as the as the higher
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   end ones.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   And so I think that that is part of the indicator is that Apple's market's not
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   there.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   You know as in the same way, you know, and I think that I do think though that,
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   you know, those people are going to buy more phones, but they might buy more cars.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   They might be interested in AR.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   They might be interested in more home kit things.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   They might be interested in other services.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   And so the you know, there's a lot of other places that Apple, you know,
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   because there's lots of things when I look at it, like this is, you know,
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   my microwave is stupid.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   I would love to buy an Apple microwave.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   Oh, geez.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   You know, like, you know, like they just worked.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   They just worked.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   It talked to my phone and when I plugged it in,
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   it just connected with the Wi-Fi and I don't think about it.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   Honestly, I'm with you.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   I'm so with you on this guy.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   I know that no one's going to buy it except for you and I, but that's not.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   It's not.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   It's not.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   Let me have it.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   And then you just illustrate it another, another problem that most people,
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   they want, they have a microwave because they want to heat up a cup of coffee in the morning.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   And when they come home, like drunk with a, with a, with a foil container of takeout,
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   they want to be able to reheated for breakfast the next day.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   And okay, and CES demo video, they love the fact, oh, look, it can talk to my phone and look,
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   it can actually, it has a camera built in so it automatically figures that,
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   oh, that's Mugu Guy Pan.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   I know how to, I know how to reheat this.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   But really, as soon as you do a good, a reliable job of heating a cup of coffee in the morning,
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   reheating leftovers from last night, people do not figure out how to spend the extra,
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   why to spend the extra $200.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   And for a lot of Apple products, that's what they're dealing with.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   But the thing is, is there a question as a two or a great job?
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   The question isn't most, most is a horrible idea.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   Most, most people, serving what most people want is going to be a, I mean, that's just
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   a lowest common denominator, drop to the ground, not, not worth even doing as a business.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   What you should look at is you find the market.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   You define your market.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   You define your market.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   They're actually not.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   Also, also, also Palma was, remember the, Palm kick Newton's butt, because Apple made
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   a conceptual device, where as Palm said, what if we made it so you can actually stick it
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   in a shirt pocket, and what if we actually gave you a developer kit in the box so that
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   people could write software without spending $900 for developer kit?
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   Sometimes you have to, it's not necessarily making the cheapest, shawty as thing.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   It's about what do people actually want?
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   What are people asking us to make and part of your business should be making that thing?
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   Define your market, define it big enough to support what you need to do, and then, and
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   then serve that market really well.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   You know, and I think that that is, that's not most, that can be 5% of the market, that
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   can be 10% of the market, that can be 2% of the market, if, if, if, if what, if your margins
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   are, are good enough.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   And two or 300 million people is only, you know, a couple of percentage points of the total
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   population of the world.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   And that's, that's all you need to, to, to make that work.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   I mean, maybe you want to grow that to 500 million, but that's, that's still a very small
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   percentage of the world, and you don't need to serve most.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   You're, you're absolutely right.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   The people forget, and I, I too sometimes forget that apples only need is to make money
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   year after year after year, and they get to stay in business, they get to keep doing
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   what they want to do, which is the only, the only thing, is the only marker of a successful
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   business, the ability to keep doing what you want to do.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   But the, the, the thing that I would, I would add though is that if artists and creators
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   didn't continue to evolve, they turn into like the beach boys, where you only, you go, you
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   go to a beach boys concert and they will play only the same hits you've heard a million
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.600]   times before, and who cares.
[00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:46.600]   You have to be in a position, if you are truly an artist, if you're truly a creator, you have
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:51.600]   to get your fans kind of angry with you from time to time, and you have to drop old fans
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:53.720]   and get new fans from time to time.
[00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:57.920]   So that's, that's, that's the thing that I want Apple to be able to do from time to
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:01.000]   time is to say that this is absolutely not an Apple product.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   Isn't that wonderful?
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   Well, and I think, I think from, and I think that they should still embrace those things.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.280]   I just think that when you talk about standards and, and, and supporting standards that, you
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:13.600]   know, I'm always reminded of the saying that none of us are as dumb as all of us, you know,
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:17.480]   and, and when you start getting to all these, you know, these design by committees, which
[00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:22.680]   I've been in many of those meetings, it's just like you're just, it, it just gets ground
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:26.360]   into something really stupid, you know, and, and you, you know, end up, you started with
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:30.800]   a great idea and you end up with something that is just a ground chuck.
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:36.000]   And, and so I think that Apple has the opportunity to continue to do great things and make great
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   things for.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.600]   And you think Tim Cook's a guy to do that?
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:43.800]   I think if they change the offense to more a wider range of products, a wider range of
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:45.640]   services, I don't think it needs to be.
[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:47.080]   I don't think they need to be.
[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:51.360]   No, I think that there are, there are plenty of markets that Apple can move into that are
[00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:52.360]   almost obvious.
[00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:56.160]   So that's the old Apple, the visionary driven Apple, you know, visionary one product at
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:57.160]   a time.
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:58.160]   Yeah.
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:44:59.160]   That's a different kind of offense.
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:01.840]   That's a, you know, that's a, you know, and, you know, and, and they need to widen that
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:02.840]   offense out.
[00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:03.840]   Michael, you agree?
[00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:11.280]   I kind of do, because I think that right now we're seeing so many companies, you know,
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:18.440]   these big companies, the Googles and the Apples and others, Samsungs are all sort of
[00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:21.400]   working pretty closely.
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:23.240]   I mean, the phones all look alike.
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:24.240]   Yeah.
[00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:26.320]   You know, these, these different devices all look alike.
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:30.800]   All of the tower devices with voice assistants inside all look alike.
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:36.040]   And so it's not as if there are, there's much of an opportunity to step out and come out
[00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:37.040]   with something new.
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:38.040]   I mean, what was it?
[00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:40.880]   The essential phone was like trying to do something new at the time.
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:41.880]   Yeah.
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:42.880]   And that story there.
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:43.880]   Yeah.
[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:44.880]   Yeah.
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:47.840]   And so I think more what we need is let's look at these markets that are out here and
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:50.440]   let's figure out how to move into them and dominate them.
[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:54.840]   And there's a little bit of future looking stuff, but right now we've got several companies
[00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:59.600]   all thinking about augmented reality and virtual reality in the future there.
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:04.360]   And so it doesn't necessarily, I don't know that the technology is far enough along,
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:11.240]   like in life to where we can have a company that says, let's put iTunes and the internet
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:16.160]   and, you know, a phone all together and make it into it because everybody's doing it.
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:18.320]   I think Steve Jobs is interested in changing the world.
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:24.680]   I don't think, I don't think it's very, I mean, to become the, I don't know what, the
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:31.240]   Mont Blanc, the Louis Vuitton of the computer world is not a particularly inspiring or interesting
[00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:32.240]   thing.
[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:36.040]   It might be good for profitability, but I think you want to, I think that Apple's heritage
[00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:40.120]   is to change the world, to make the world a better place.
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:41.120]   And I think that they still can do that.
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:44.680]   And I think it's easier if they don't try to water down what they're doing.
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:45.680]   Oh, I agree.
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:47.320]   I mean, nobody watered down Steve Jobs vision.
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:48.320]   Right.
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:49.320]   Nobody.
[00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:51.640]   And I think they're doing it in a different way with, with theirs.
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:55.760]   And like, when we talk about changing the world, there's changing the world in the sense that,
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:59.120]   oh, look at this cool as hell thing I just made.
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:00.560]   And it's going to be so great for you.
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:04.520]   And then we talk about changing the world like new environmental initiatives and figuring
[00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:07.080]   out how to recycle old products.
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:11.680]   Those are incredible things that one can only do when they are this multi-
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:15.600]   Well, I'd like to see Apple do that, but these products, I mean, the only good news
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:21.520]   about Apple's lack of iPhone sales is there'll be fewer iPhones in the recent, in the
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:24.120]   landfill in years going ahead.
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:26.040]   Apple's not exactly the greenest.
[00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:32.600]   I despite all the, despite the Liam, the Apple iPhone deconstructing robot, I don't
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:36.480]   think Apple's recycling record is all that good.
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:38.720]   They make these, these are disposable products.
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:40.520]   They're not, they're not designed to be.
[00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:41.760]   And I use them for a long time.
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:42.760]   Almost every phone I buy.
[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:43.760]   That's your mistake.
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:44.760]   You're supposed to buy a new one every year.
[00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:45.760]   Well, I do.
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:46.760]   But then someone else that's up with them.
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:49.280]   Someone else in the company ends up with like someone else up.
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:50.680]   Someone else in my kids.
[00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:53.680]   My kids are using older, you know, older phones without.
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:54.680]   Yeah.
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:58.480]   So you're the reason that they didn't make any money because you didn't get all the kids
[00:47:58.480 --> 00:47:59.480]   new phones.
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:00.480]   That's what's going on.
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:01.480]   Yeah, it's your fault, Alex.
[00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:02.480]   I stuck with six, sixes.
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:04.240]   It's not China's fault.
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:05.240]   It's your fault.
[00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:06.240]   Yeah, let's take a little break.
[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:09.200]   There's more to talk about, including Apple's presence.
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:13.680]   I put that in quotes at CES, but first a word from Slack.
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:15.400]   This is how we communicate.
[00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:20.480]   I have Slack running all the time on my phone, on my desktop because when anybody needs something,
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:24.880]   uh, from me or from anybody in the office, it's in Slack.
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:30.840]   Slack is the tool we use to keep the right people in the team and the loop to get the
[00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:33.840]   information out to everybody on the team.
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:35.760]   Teamwork on Slack happens in channels.
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:37.200]   It's so much better than email.
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:44.840]   It lets you organize conversations and information around, in our case, shows and projects, business
[00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:51.800]   ideas, offices, teams, and everything you need to get to work is in one place.
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:54.560]   So it's faster and easier to get things done.
[00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:59.680]   And they don't say this in their ads, but honestly, the reason Slack has dominated the
[00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:01.480]   world is because it's fun.
[00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:03.240]   It looks great.
[00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:04.240]   It works.
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:08.000]   It gets the job done, but you, but people like to use it.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.520]   When we got, when we moved to Slack, everybody was happy in the office.
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:14.400]   And we started using, we've been using it Slack for years, years and years.
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:16.440]   And one of the producers got it and I was like, what is this?
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:17.920]   Like, why aren't we just using email?
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:20.880]   And I was, it was like one of those things like I very slowly and then suddenly the whole
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:21.880]   company was using it.
[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:23.600]   And then before I knew it, I was using it now.
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:27.160]   And then it got to a point where I was saying, uh, you know, like people send me email and
[00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:28.160]   I was like, why is it you?
[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:29.160]   Why are you emailing me?
[00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:30.400]   This is a Slack conversation.
[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:31.400]   Yeah.
[00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:32.400]   Yeah.
[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:35.360]   Reduce emails, streamline your team's conversations.
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:40.200]   Slack connects by the way all the, one of the reasons we, we use Slack is because it integrates
[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:43.960]   all the tools we need are automatically built into there.
[00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:47.200]   So the engineering Slack, they've got stuff from ops, genie and all the other things
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:48.800]   pumped into there.
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:53.680]   Uh, Slack allows you to organize your team with real time messaging or video or voice
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:55.880]   calls, group files sharing.
[00:49:55.880 --> 00:50:00.120]   Yes, we integrate it into our Google drive cause that's where we put our files, searchable
[00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:01.120]   archives.
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:07.800]   It's all easy right there centered in that app on your desktop, on your phone.
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:10.400]   It saves you time and improves productivity.
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:14.640]   Uh, you don't have to have multiple tabs and multiple apps open to keep updated with work.
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:15.640]   It works with Jira.
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:16.640]   It works with Salesforce.
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:17.760]   It works with Zendesk.
[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:22.920]   It works with, as I said, Google drive and a thousand more apps integrated right into
[00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:26.480]   Slack and people just love to use it.
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:32.200]   There is something magical and there's only been, you know, every year there's only one
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:37.560]   or two apps or, or programs that are just, there's something about them where you go.
[00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:41.400]   Fortnite's an example, we just took over because there was something about everyone
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:43.240]   who used Slack is like that.
[00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:48.680]   It's one of those, those unicorn apps where just everybody wants to use it.
[00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:53.640]   I found out after we moved to Slack that Jason and Megan had a secret Slack channel
[00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:56.440]   they were using to do tech news weekly.
[00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:58.560]   Yeah, an unapproved.
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:01.360]   So now they're, now they're on the Slack channel with Slack.
[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:02.760]   Your team is better connected.
[00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:04.080]   Learn more at Slack.com.
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:11.040]   Go to Slack.com.com/slackslack.com, we thank Slack for doing such an amazing job where
[00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:14.180]   work happens.
[00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:16.520]   So Apple doesn't have a booth at CES.
[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:18.200]   They haven't, I don't have they ever had a booth.
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:22.760]   They haven't in a long time had a booth at CES, but they are there.
[00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:31.800]   As CNET says, in the snarkiest way possible, the big ad on the side of the spring hill
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:36.800]   suites that's a Marriott right next to the convention center says, what happens on your
[00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:41.080]   iPhone stays on your iPhone, apple.com/privacy.
[00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:50.600]   Yeah, as long as you're not in China or any of the other countries where Apple says, hey,
[00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:54.760]   government who wants to turn an iPhone into a yoke of yoke.
[00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:55.760]   I don't think so.
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:57.760]   I don't think that actually what happened.
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:58.760]   No, Apple's not.
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:01.280]   I'm personal opinion only.
[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:08.200]   I don't think Apple is allowed to take a victory lap like that until they have some statement
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:12.480]   that says that there are limits to what we will allow a government to do to its own people
[00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:13.680]   through our phones.
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:18.400]   Well, I think that right yet, I believe that what they've given what they've given China
[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:25.280]   is access to iCloud, which they do in the United States as well, not to the phone.
[00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:29.920]   There is they have, but I'm sure that that's why that billboard is very specific to the
[00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:31.800]   phone is because they're not giving access to the phone.
[00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:33.800]   They're giving access to the cloud.
[00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:39.840]   Unless you put a third party app on the phone that exfiltrates all your information to Facebook.
[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:44.920]   Yeah, I mean, that's, I mean, from the point of view of a consumer, what, as soon as you
[00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:50.360]   start using your phone, that's not Apple's fault, but it shouldn't, and I shouldn't pretend
[00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:53.200]   that that phone is, you know, isolated from the rest of the world.
[00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:54.960]   There's no other stuff on there.
[00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:55.960]   Absolutely.
[00:52:55.960 --> 00:53:00.960]   I think that's why I think that the phone is not going to be the most important thing
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:01.960]   to do.
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:06.960]   I think that the phone is going to be the most important thing to do to the phone.
[00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:11.960]   I think that the phone is going to be the most important thing to do to the phone.
[00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:16.960]   I think that's why I think that's why I think that's why I think that's why I think that
[00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:19.960]   it's not going to be the most important thing to do to the phone.
[00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:24.960]   I think that's why I think that's why I think that's why I think that it's going to be the
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:28.360]   phone that works only using the one I'm on a desktop, which is becoming less, as you
[00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:30.640]   can see in front of me less and less.
[00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:36.280]   Michael Simon and Macworld also points out that that billboard is on the side of a Marriott.
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:40.720]   Oh, I love that.
[00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:42.720]   I love it.
[00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:44.520]   Good catch, Michael.
[00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:45.520]   Yeah.
[00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:53.880]   So, but I think, you know, certainly every security guru I know says I would never use
[00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:54.880]   an Android phone.
[00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:56.200]   I would only use an iPhone.
[00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:59.200]   So, you know, it is encrypted.
[00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:00.920]   It's encrypted by default.
[00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:04.720]   So far, they've managed to hold the line against law enforcement.
[00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:07.800]   Even in China, I don't think the Chinese government can get into the phone.
[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:10.240]   I think, again, I think the greatest danger is not China.
[00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:12.120]   It's Australia and really the five eyes.
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:13.120]   Yeah.
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:14.120]   But let's be.
[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:17.160]   Can you explain a little bit about that in case folks don't know the Australia thing?
[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:18.240]   Because this is news to me.
[00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:20.080]   I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:21.080]   Australia is passed a law.
[00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:24.120]   I don't know if it's gotten through all of it, but basically.
[00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:26.040]   It's not an effective, but it has passed.
[00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:30.880]   It has passed that theoretically could give them the ability to force Apple to open up
[00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:31.880]   a phone.
[00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:34.920]   Now, this is not, in my opinion, this is not Australia.
[00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:36.120]   This is the United States.
[00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:43.560]   So, the United States is part of a consortium between the United States, New Zealand, Australia,
[00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:47.480]   Canada and the UK, generally known as the five eyes.
[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:50.760]   So what the United States wants is they want into the phone.
[00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:54.760]   And what Australia is a quiet place where they don't get so many complaints.
[00:54:54.760 --> 00:55:00.160]   So, when they try to do it in the United States, they get all kinds of letters to their people's
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:03.640]   congressmen and then it's not fun anymore.
[00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:07.840]   When they do it in Australia, it just passes right through because they don't get the same
[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:08.840]   resistance.
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:12.840]   But it's basically a backdoor that once Apple opens it to Australia, or if they're forced
[00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:16.280]   by Australian authorities to open that phone, of course, what's going to happen is the
[00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:19.560]   United States is going to come in behind it, China is going to come in behind it.
[00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:23.400]   And the problem with all of this, with all of the letters into your phone and it's for
[00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:29.720]   law enforcement is we just always have to remember, and I agree that getting valid terrorist
[00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:35.160]   or information and so on and so forth is important, but we have to remember that the NSA cannot
[00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:37.920]   even keep track of their own secrets.
[00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:42.920]   This is not, like when they lose what they lost to Snowden, what they lost in Germany,
[00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:46.520]   they cannot even hold on to things that they know are important.
[00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:50.000]   So if they can't hold on to their own secrets, how are they going to hold on to a bunch of
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   people they don't even know?
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:52.640]   And the answer is they're not going to.
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:56.040]   So opening this up is not a matter of whether it's right or wrong.
[00:55:56.040 --> 00:56:02.480]   It's a matter of the ability to keep it confidential and the inability of our most secret agency,
[00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:09.000]   well, not really, almost most secret agency, of their inability to actually protect themselves
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.240]   means they're not going to protect us.
[00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:12.240]   Wow.
[00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:18.840]   And the other problem is that it's one of those really poorly written laws that simply says
[00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:25.720]   that law enforcement can compel a company to give to unlock a phone and without saying,
[00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:26.720]   well, what if it's impossible?
[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:28.200]   Well, that's your problem.
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:30.640]   We have the ability to compel you to do that.
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:40.160]   Also, if Apple has, let's say, an employee in Australia, if they have an employee in Australia,
[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:45.320]   the fact that this Apple employee is in Australia means that they can be compelled by the government
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:52.800]   to unlock a phone and also held on to a secrecy binding, which means that not only are they
[00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:57.200]   not allowed to tell the public or the person whose phone has been affected, but they can
[00:56:57.200 --> 00:57:00.800]   also be compelled to say, unlock this phone and don't tell Apple that you've done this
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:02.960]   or your bosses that you've done this.
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:06.480]   That's how poorly written this law is.
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:12.680]   But I still say that something that's kind of a little bit above the waterline, it's
[00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:17.320]   when you get into problems like it's not Apple has to remove the Taiwanese flag from the
[00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:22.080]   emoji library on the iPhone because time one does not exist inside China.
[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:24.480]   And this is, and they went ahead and they did that.
[00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:28.400]   And so what happens if they say that their keyboard cannot allow to cannot be allowed
[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:34.680]   to post pictures of Winnie the Pooh because we feel as though that is derogatory against
[00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:36.160]   the party.
[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:40.120]   I think that I think Apple has a core of what they're willing to protect and what they're
[00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:41.120]   not willing to protect.
[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:43.200]   And I think that we can see what that looks like.
[00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:46.120]   I'm just always surprised when I looked at the Australian thing, I'm just like, you're
[00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:47.400]   all Australians.
[00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:49.200]   How can you be lackeys for the United States?
[00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:51.200]   So you're like, you're Australians.
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:56.960]   You have a different level of expectation of them to be rebels and for them to push back.
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:58:00.680]   And instead they've just done what the United States wanted them to do.
[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:01.680]   Yeah.
[00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:02.680]   Wow.
[00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:03.680]   We'll see what the upshot of that is.
[00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:09.040]   It's passed in December, a quick pre-resis legislation that nobody really took a look
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:10.040]   at.
[00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:13.160]   And we've been talking about it since it passed in December, but it's a big mess.
[00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:18.000]   But it's probably, I still think that is Apple's number one because so much of their
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:21.200]   world is wrapped around privacy that opening that up.
[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:22.800]   It's a good thing for them to push.
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:27.120]   And I want to see those ads because it forces them to step up.
[00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:28.120]   It's not just marketing.
[00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:30.240]   You got to step up.
[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:34.160]   In fact, I think Microsoft, we were talking on a Windows weekly last Wednesday, Microsoft
[00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:39.000]   has an opportunity here to back down in some of the spyware that they put on their systems
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.280]   and step up and say, we're also a privacy company.
[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:47.280]   The two companies that can are Google and Amazon and Facebook, three companies that can't.
[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:52.000]   And so it's important that companies that can, because their business model is different,
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   do, I think.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:56.080]   And I have to admit, this has been a shift for me.
[00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:57.720]   For a long time, I was like, I can't be private.
[00:58:57.720 --> 00:59:02.840]   I mean, privacy is a useless thing to try to be because there's too much out there.
[00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:03.840]   There's too much data.
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:07.120]   And I've kind of gotten to the point where I would say I'm nearly a one issue voter about
[00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:08.120]   it at this point.
[00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:12.840]   I almost feel like when we go into 2020, I want to hear what, like if a candidate says,
[00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:17.280]   I'm willing to break into someone's phone, there is nothing else they can say that would
[00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:18.440]   allow me to vote for them.
[00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:19.440]   It's tough.
[00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:20.440]   Nothing to come out of their mouth.
[00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:26.680]   Because in general, I think when you phrase it, well, we want to catch bad guys and terrorists,
[00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:28.320]   so we need to get access to their phones.
[00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:30.880]   They can't be able to communicate privately.
[00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:33.680]   Most people in America hearing that sentence will say, yeah, you're right.
[00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:34.960]   We have so much data.
[00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:35.960]   I know.
[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:36.960]   So much data.
[00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:37.960]   I know.
[00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:41.720]   I mean, you, I think technologists, I think we understand why that's not doable without
[00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:42.720]   compromising all of us.
[00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:45.560]   And to be clear, I don't know if that message is gotten out.
[00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:51.160]   I don't think I don't have a problem with metadata and who we called and all that stuff.
[00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:52.520]   I think that's valuable too.
[00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:53.520]   It is valuable.
[00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:56.640]   I think that there's a valid, there's a valid.
[00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:58.120]   You draw the line.
[00:59:58.120 --> 01:00:01.480]   But you draw the line like that is the line where I say, yeah, because I, we actually,
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:03.040]   I think I'm not going to talk about it.
[01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:05.760]   We got to TV back one time because of that.
[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:09.560]   So, but, but I understand how that works and I understand why it's important.
[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:12.720]   And I think that there is a, there's a lower limit to when, when that's okay.
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:14.680]   And I think the metadata is fine.
[01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:18.480]   And I understand why the NSA wants to get all of it all the time because you want to be
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:22.120]   able to rewind 10 years back to see before that guy thought about being a terrorist.
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:23.440]   Who was he talking to?
[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:25.200]   So that, that all makes sense to me.
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:29.760]   But, but the, but I think that we have to say there's an enclave that is our phone and
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:34.280]   the data that's on it that we're, that, that the government doesn't, doesn't get to be
[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:35.280]   part of.
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:42.960]   Especially because so many folks use, you know, our brains are not meant to be storage
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:43.960]   devices.
[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:45.040]   They're meant to be processing devices.
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:46.960]   They're not meant to be storage devices.
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:53.480]   And, you know, there are plenty of psychological studies that talk about how by trying to log
[01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:57.160]   or by trying to bog down our brain with a bunch of things to remember, it's not good
[01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:58.360]   for us.
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:02.600]   And so oftentimes people use tools to keep those things instead of trying to have their
[01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:04.520]   brain remember everything.
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:11.400]   And so in that sense, our devices become these tools that store our thoughts and our
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:20.600]   memories and our relationships and our interactions and so much of, of, of who we are in a way.
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:24.240]   Because you know, at the end of the day, what, what is a person but their memories and their
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:26.200]   experiences and things like that.
[01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:33.360]   And so essentially when you look at this tool that you use to exist as a human and reach
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:41.360]   out to other people and, and live for a government to request full and complete access to that
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:48.920]   how, how is that much different than asking for full and complete access to me as an individual.
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:50.960]   And, and that's, I was the same way.
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:53.720]   I used to be very kind of like, well, we're online.
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:57.000]   I guess I don't really have a reasonable right to privacy.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:02.120]   But it was actually Georgia Dow who sort of kind of swayed me a little bit because she's
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:04.920]   very staunch privacy advocate.
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:08.400]   And you know, when I started to think about it and particularly from that psychological
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:13.960]   aspect, it changed the way that I feel about this because yeah, I mean, you can learn a
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:18.000]   lot about who I am by getting access to this device.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.640]   And then there's also just the fact that it's kind of lazy of the NSA to just say, oh, can
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:25.960]   we just have everything that's going to make it so much easier for us?
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:29.760]   You know, I mean, we could figure out exactly what it is we're looking for and then request
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:30.760]   just those things.
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:33.800]   But why don't you just give us a key so we can get in and get everything.
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:38.040]   And well, if something ends up leaking, oh, well, we've already got enough of that.
[01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:43.040]   So well stuff with Marriott and the credit reporting agencies and all of these other
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:49.160]   places that leak all the time and get little slaps on the wrist, it needs to be, it needs
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:51.560]   to be locked up a lot better.
[01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:53.200]   We need, there need to be consequences.
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:54.640]   We need to have some sort of a bill of rights.
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:55.640]   It's simply.
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:58.880]   So the reason why this is all these things keep happening is that all you have to do if
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:05.200]   you if you lose the data of millions and millions of people is say, yeah, you don't have to
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:08.640]   say, oh, gosh, isn't that horrible?
[01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:11.800]   Well, here's a press release for you at seven p.m. on a Friday.
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:14.400]   We're going to use your free credit monitoring.
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:15.800]   Just because exactly.
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:20.320]   There are consequences if you there are consequences for dumping poison into the into a water supply
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:22.680]   and it's not oops are bad.
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:24.600]   Everybody have a free voucher for pizza.
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.600]   It's no you.
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:28.720]   There are supposed to be actual punishments.
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:32.920]   And right now we've been we've been experimenting with lack of regulation.
[01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:34.480]   And now it's not really working out for us.
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:36.960]   And now we need to regulate control of data.
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:43.560]   Apple also had some CES presence with some briefings.
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:46.360]   Now I know that Renee Richie is not here.
[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:47.360]   He's at CES.
[01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:50.840]   That's what Micah Sargent is here.
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:53.200]   And at first I thought, oh, that means he's not meeting with Apple.
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:04:00.400]   Well, maybe he is because Apple showed off a bunch of home kit stuff at CES.
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:02.720]   I thought it was interesting.
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:03.720]   Yeah.
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:08.240]   But Apple because I don't know.
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:13.320]   The way that Apple sort of putting this forth or rather that the TechCrunch was talking about
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:16.040]   this is Apple saying, hey, come check out these companies.
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:21.640]   And it is it's just a little weird to me because it kind of reminds me of what is it?
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:28.720]   The LG monitor that works with with the newer Mac books where there's like a close close
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:29.720]   partnership.
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:37.360]   The fact is Apple, although externally was not super bullish about the home kit software
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:41.840]   authentication stuff that I was talking about earlier, certainly within the company.
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:43.120]   They were very excited about it.
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:47.320]   It's just it's one of those things that's difficult to sort of make a temple feature
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:52.040]   and explain to everyday consumers what that what exactly that means.
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:57.880]   And so I think that that is a lot of what this is because Belkin Waymo Belkin's Waymo
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:04:59.680]   line is one of the main lines.
[01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:00.680]   Oh, yeah, we know.
[01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:01.680]   Yeah.
[01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:02.680]   Thank you.
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:08.520]   One of the main lines that is you know, using that is using that software authentication.
[01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:16.080]   And at the beginning, a lot of folks were very into these these wemo gadgets and liked what
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:18.400]   Belkin was offering, but it didn't work with home kit.
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:21.480]   And then therefore, while you could buy a bridge that gave you home kit compatibility
[01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:25.320]   and then later on, they're like, oh, now we can just do software authentication.
[01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:27.960]   And I know a lot of people really do like their we most stuff.
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:30.000]   And so I think backwards compatible.
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.760]   In other words, if I have older wemo switches, will they now work with home kit?
[01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:35.520]   I cannot answer that.
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:36.520]   I'm not certain.
[01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:37.520]   Yeah.
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:38.520]   Do I have to get new ones?
[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:42.600]   That's one advantage of a software only fixes that maybe you can upgrade the old ones.
[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:47.120]   We'll find out even now it's a smart light strip and smart power strip.
[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:49.240]   Connect sense, a new smart outlet.
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:52.600]   Can I just say those I connect sense?
[01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:53.600]   You got to do better.
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:54.800]   I'm sorry.
[01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:59.080]   But those connect sense are just they're ugly.
[01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:02.760]   They're they're they're like Fisher price toys.
[01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:03.760]   So I'm sorry.
[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:04.760]   Connect.
[01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:08.080]   I have an I devices home outdoor plug that I use for my Christmas lights.
[01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:09.080]   That's ugly too.
[01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:13.520]   But I did love it that I could not only set it up with home kit, but I it then told me
[01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:14.760]   my power consumption.
[01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:15.760]   Yes.
[01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:17.360]   Which was not good.
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:20.720]   I was really like what?
[01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:21.720]   It was expensive.
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:23.680]   It was like eight dollars a day for my Christmas.
[01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:25.400]   I thought these are LEDs.
[01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:26.400]   Why is that?
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:27.400]   Cosemies.
[01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:28.600]   Quick set is expanding it.
[01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:30.000]   You know, they do locks.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.160]   They're line of a touchscreen smart locks.
[01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:34.400]   Is that a good idea?
[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:39.120]   Really with a new model that describes is more contemporary and sleek.
[01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:41.160]   Might on.
[01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:50.600]   Launching an Avia smart lock in May, particularly secure locks there by the UK.
[01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:53.200]   Police is secured by design initiative.
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:58.400]   The nano leafs, which a lot of a lot of people have, including Stacy Higginbotham, the nano
[01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:03.120]   leaf canvas will be now home kit enabled.
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:08.320]   Net atmo is doing a smart video doorbell that will be home kit enabled.
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:09.320]   That one is cool.
[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:14.000]   That one is cool because so many companies that were that produce these cameras, they
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.680]   make you pay a subscription service to store your video in their cloud.
[01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:19.680]   Right.
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:20.680]   And so privacy, privacy, privacy.
[01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:24.800]   That is awesome because you can store it locally on an SD card and be able to access
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:27.720]   that stuff without ever signing up for some online things.
[01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:32.480]   So not only are you not paying, but you're not also relying on the company to produce
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:34.120]   or to keep your video safe.
[01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:38.840]   I think that's a trend because wise cam, which I think just took a big investment,
[01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:45.200]   VC investment, WYZ also does not require an internet connection.
[01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:48.720]   You can look at it on your phone, but they don't, you don't have to pay a monthly fee
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:49.920]   and they have a little SD card.
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:50.920]   I think that's really cool.
[01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:51.920]   All right.
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:58.880]   Well, so Apple is at CES, but it's kind of home kit stuff.
[01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:02.320]   Apple apparently in discussions to support RCS.
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:03.680]   This is a Google initiative.
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:06.600]   Well, I shouldn't say that, but Google's been the one pushing it.
[01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:12.600]   The rich communication service that will be replacing SMS text messaging on some phones
[01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:19.560]   with some carriers, it would be, you know, if at least in the US, if Apple doesn't support
[01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:23.080]   something like this, it's an on starter because half the smart phones.
[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:26.240]   Well, the question is, are they going to support it as in they're going to tie it in
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:28.240]   with iMessages or are they going to support it in?
[01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:29.800]   Yeah, you can talk to it.
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:32.600]   You can send the, I think that's all they're going to do because, you know, so that's how
[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:34.360]   it works now with SMS.
[01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:35.360]   There's a gateway.
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:36.360]   Right.
[01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:39.160]   And if somebody dares not have an iPhone, well, there'll be a little green bubble.
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:40.160]   Oh my God.
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:42.000]   Those green bubble memes.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.480]   Oh, don't be a green bubble.
[01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:46.440]   My son was the first to tell me about green bubbles.
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:48.360]   I said, in his frat.
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:50.600]   I said, are there anybody with an Android with Android fun?
[01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:52.000]   She says, this is one guy.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.320]   And he hears about it constantly.
[01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:54.320]   He's a green bubble.
[01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:56.560]   He doesn't get to any of the group messaging.
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:58.360]   He doesn't get to any of the group events.
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:01.040]   This poor guy talk about peer pressure.
[01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:03.280]   Talk about a lock in and then walled, walled garden.
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:05.880]   If you don't get invited to parties and you're a.
[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:07.800]   It's like a dating thing too, Leo.
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:08.800]   I know.
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:10.040]   So I'm, I'm sure you're not.
[01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:12.000]   You get less dates.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.320]   I've had some of my friends very seriously.
[01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:18.040]   I know that it's going to sound like I'm joking, but I have had some of my friends very
[01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:20.480]   seriously say, oh, yeah, things are going well.
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:23.320]   And then they were a green bubble.
[01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:26.800]   Burn burn burn.
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:30.560]   Well, our CS probably they'll figure out a new color.
[01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:32.960]   That's a proud, proud data point for Apple.
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:38.120]   They'll say that, you know, I'm glad that we've provided a new vector for people to
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:44.200]   irrationally prejudge somebody and dismiss their entire worth based on a simple consumer
[01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:46.200]   choice that they made.
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:47.200]   I hope it's.
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:50.200]   Where's the billboard for don't be ostracized?
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:52.080]   Get in with the pack.
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:55.360]   Yeah, go with the go with the peer pressure.
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:59.160]   If we could do anything to pressure Apple into supporting RCS, I'd like to do that.
[01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:04.400]   Same thing with aggressive web apps, PWA, which Apple's been a little slow to the table.
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:05.640]   You know, this is that lock in.
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:11.160]   There's no there's no incentive for them to be to play in anybody else's garden.
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:14.560]   Just, you know, it works better if you're all.
[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:16.760]   They also they also like to control.
[01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:19.280]   Yeah, yeah, it works.
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:21.080]   But as a user, it works better for me.
[01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:24.480]   You know, you know, like, you know, I get the progressive web apps and that's they're
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:25.480]   cute.
[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:26.480]   But the.
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:27.480]   Thank you.
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:32.360]   But the thing is, is that they're never I people argue with me all the time about this.
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:34.400]   Eventually they're going to replace the I don't like they're never going to be as good
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:36.360]   as a native app ever.
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:40.360]   You know, like they're never going to be as good as a native app and it is.
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:43.360]   Well, it depends what you mean by as good as.
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:44.360]   Yeah.
[01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:48.960]   It's aggressive apps are good for the developer, not good for the user.
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:49.960]   Right.
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:50.960]   Okay.
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:51.960]   I think it depends on the.
[01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:55.800]   I think it's going to be an issue because Apple's not doing a very good job of supporting
[01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:57.400]   it and I don't think they ever will.
[01:10:57.400 --> 01:11:01.600]   And that's going to make it very hard for PWA to succeed, even though both Microsoft
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:04.960]   and Google are 100% behind it.
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:08.840]   I just want them to support RCS because every time a holiday comes around, I've got the
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:13.960]   one family member who sends out a message to every single person wishing them a happy
[01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:15.680]   birthday.
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:20.280]   And then I've got seven new people texting me whose numbers I don't have tonight.
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:21.280]   Yeah.
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:26.120]   So just if RCS saves me from that, I please do that, Apple.
[01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:31.560]   Meanwhile, the Qualcomm wars continue.
[01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:34.600]   Apple has won in some regards.
[01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:41.440]   Apparently the FTC is now going after Qualcomm for not allowing frand licensing of some of
[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:42.440]   their patents.
[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:46.200]   On the other hand, in Germany, iPhones are getting banned.
[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:54.160]   In fact, Qualcomm has put aside $1.5 billion in funds in escrow so that the ban on iPhones,
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:58.800]   some iPhones, not all iPhones, but the ban on some iPhones can proceed in Germany.
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:05.840]   The newer iPhones that the tennis and 10 are not affected, but iPhone seven and eight sales
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:07.000]   have been halted.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.440]   It seems to be an iOS 12 versus an iOS 11 thing.
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:15.720]   Like anything that came with iOS 12 is not, I don't understand it myself.
[01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:25.440]   In fact, 12.1.2 addresses some of the concerns Qualcomm had in China.
[01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:27.760]   So the battle goes on.
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:33.160]   It rages on with some victories on each side.
[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:42.400]   So 75% of all of Apple's devices introduced in the last four years, 78% are running iOS
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:43.400]   12 now.
[01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:44.400]   That is pretty impressive.
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:50.120]   Well, I think it's amazing that 95% are running the last two OS's.
[01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:52.160]   That is just a crazy number.
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:53.160]   That's amazing.
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:55.440]   Yeah, only 5% are pre iOS 11.
[01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:58.440]   And probably it's because they can't run iOS 11.
[01:12:58.440 --> 01:12:59.440]   Right?
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:02.520]   I will say that Apple, the updates.
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:05.960]   You just are constantly beroged if you don't update.
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:06.960]   Definitely.
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:09.360]   That's one of the reasons.
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:11.360]   That's hard, isn't it?
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:12.360]   Yeah.
[01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:13.920]   Well, let's take a little.
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:14.920]   I'll tell you what.
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:17.240]   Do we want to do it's too early to do the picks?
[01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:19.200]   Let me maybe not.
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:23.560]   Let me do a couple more stories and we'll do the picks of the week.
[01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:25.720]   Apple, this is interesting.
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:28.960]   AirPlay 2 getting wide support at CES.
[01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:36.560]   Apple's going to launch an iTunes video app on Samsung Smart TVs this spring.
[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:41.480]   And we've seen Samsung and LG and others announced Smart TVs with AirPlay 2 built-in.
[01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:45.440]   So this is an example of you don't have to have a home pod.
[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:46.440]   This is open.
[01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:47.440]   This is good.
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:48.440]   Yeah.
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:49.440]   Maybe.
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:50.920]   Well, there's a lot of services.
[01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:52.480]   Services, services.
[01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:53.480]   Services, services.
[01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:54.480]   Yeah.
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:58.560]   But there's still a lot of questions about it.
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:03.680]   Again, Apple, the billboard about how we respect privacy company.
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:07.400]   Samsung's press release doesn't talk about what kind of data will or will not be harvested
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:09.000]   through this app.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.360]   It's what kind of service is going to be used for payments to this app.
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:17.040]   We're going to assume this is going to be whatever Samsung-based payment service is
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:23.000]   going to be is supported by the infrastructure of their TV app architecture.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.640]   It's a lot to think about.
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:30.040]   But yeah, if Apple really is serious, obviously they are about creating a video service, they're
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:34.640]   not going to make it just by selling it to people who own Apple TVs and people who have
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:38.440]   iPads and Apple products.
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:44.360]   The people who don't necessarily spend $1200 on a phone also watch television.
[01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:47.480]   And perhaps you want to be able to make that deployable elsewhere.
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:50.840]   So right now, the only place you could be able to watch the content you've bought and
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:54.400]   paid for on iTunes is through the Windows version of the iTunes app.
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:55.400]   You can't get it through Android.
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:57.840]   You can't get it through any other set top box.
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:04.160]   So I'm keen to see how quickly or if Apple rolls out new versions of this special app
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:05.640]   onto other platforms.
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:07.520]   It'd be great to see it for Android TV.
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:08.520]   It'd be great to see it.
[01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:15.080]   We'll see it for Roku and even Amazon Fire TV sticks before we see it on Android TV.
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:19.360]   But this is going to be this is the first it's a good move for anybody who has spent
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:21.640]   more than $8 on iTunes content.
[01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:23.800]   Bad though, if you want to sell more Apple TVs.
[01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:24.800]   Right.
[01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:27.000]   And I think they don't even care.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.000]   Maybe they don't.
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.000]   Apparently they don't.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.520]   You know, I think that I know for me, I've just gotten to the point with my little tin
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:36.640]   foil hat is that my TVs are not allowed to talk to the internet.
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:39.800]   Like I'm not, you know, like I'm just like they're not like I have.
[01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:43.440]   But you talked to your TVs because these Samsung TVs has big speed built.
[01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:49.040]   No, but I have use of the TVs all have either some version, some of the last three versions
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:50.040]   of Apple TVs.
[01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:51.040]   They're all on Apple TVs.
[01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:52.040]   They're there.
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:56.480]   Oh, so all of my services sit on an Apple TV and then the Apple TV has an HDMI connection
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:58.480]   to the to the TV.
[01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:01.000]   And then I have all, you know, cause I'm that's actually cut out legally.
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.000]   And I just can't.
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.480]   Any television is wrapped in a Faraday cage.
[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:05.480]   Exactly.
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:06.480]   Yeah.
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:08.960]   It's an it's a Faraday cage with an Apple logo.
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:10.520]   There you go.
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:14.760]   Apple, Apple branded Faraday cage.
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:17.040]   But I, you know, I think that there was just I just have too many.
[01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:21.720]   I just don't think that I think that they are playing as wild and loose, if not more
[01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:25.200]   wild and loose than a lot of the technology companies with those with those TVs.
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:26.560]   They're not tying them up.
[01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:28.880]   They're not closing them up because no one's asking them to and no one's requiring them
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:29.880]   to.
[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:31.160]   And I'm not until they figure it out.
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:35.840]   I'm just going to let them, you know, just keep them as a dumb monitor system.
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:37.840]   No, it works fine for me.
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:38.840]   I agree.
[01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:45.520]   Are showing that brought to you by way, but hold that thought brought to you by WordPress.com.
[01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:49.400]   The best place to make your new website.
[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:51.840]   Henry, have you set up your WordPress site yet?
[01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:52.840]   Yeah.
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:53.840]   Have you?
[01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:54.840]   Awesome.
[01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:55.840]   I call it.
[01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:57.920]   Oh, both my kids have WordPress.com sites.
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:04.720]   So do I, by the way, leooport.com back when you were born 20 years more than 20 years
[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:10.880]   ago, I bought your name and your sister's name, your domains, hoping that someday, and
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:15.000]   I bought a 20 year plan, by the way, figuring out that's great.
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.400]   Someday they would want their names.
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:17.560]   That's what I call vision.
[01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:18.560]   Yeah.
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:21.400]   And now, now you can do it at WordPress.com.
[01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:25.400]   WordPress was started so that anyone could publish their ideas.
[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:28.480]   And now, and I'm so thrilled about this.
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:31.200]   Thank you, Matt Mullenweg, the creator of WordPress.
[01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:34.920]   WordPress now powers 33% of the internet.
[01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:39.560]   One third of all the websites in the world are running WordPress.
[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:43.040]   And there's no easier way to run WordPress and WordPress.com.
[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:49.160]   With powerful site building tools, thousands of themes, and 24/7 support from real experts
[01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:51.560]   were very nice, by the way.
[01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:57.160]   WordPress.com lets you and everyone listening pursue whatever it is you love by creating
[01:17:57.160 --> 01:18:00.760]   a site that's free to start and has room to grow.
[01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:03.480]   And yes, of course, e-commerce.
[01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:07.880]   Great for a blog, but great for a portfolio for an artist or a designer.
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:08.880]   Great for a business.
[01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:13.000]   If you are a business and you do not have a website, what do you think?
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.280]   No, that Facebook page doesn't count.
[01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:16.760]   The Twitter account doesn't count.
[01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:19.160]   You need somewhere your home on the web that you control.
[01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:24.920]   When you upload files, audio, video, text, pictures to your WordPress site, they still
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:25.920]   belong to you.
[01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:28.400]   You can get them back any time.
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:31.080]   There's no two week trousers, no hidden fees.
[01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:33.600]   You own your own content forever.
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:37.840]   WordPress.com, it's built to grow with you to get you where you want to be tomorrow.
[01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:38.840]   I love WordPress.
[01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:41.720]   I'm so happy to be on WordPress.com.
[01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:44.600]   And by the way, you're not alone on WordPress.com.
[01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:48.160]   Some of the biggest publishers in the world use WordPress.com.
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:52.600]   Millions of people use WordPress.com every day to turn their dreams into reality.
[01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:59.800]   And you get 15% off any new plant purchase right now at WordPress.com/macbreak.
[01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:06.800]   15% off your new website at the best place to host it in the world.
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:10.080]   WordPress.com/macbreak.
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:11.880]   This has to be a bit of a shock to the system.
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:19.000]   Netflix has decided that in 2019, they are not going to allow subscribers to pay for
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.080]   their account through the iPhone app.
[01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:22.080]   Why?
[01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:23.080]   Because Apple takes 30%.
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:24.080]   That was an easy...
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:26.080]   I think that's an easy decision on Netflix.
[01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:27.080]   It's just...
[01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:28.080]   I mean, that's a lot of money.
[01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:32.080]   $853 million in iOS revenue.
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:33.600]   Holy moly.
[01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:34.600]   Almost a billion dollars.
[01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:38.200]   Isn't that amazing?
[01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:43.200]   Android has not a whole lot of absolute advantages over Apple.
[01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:47.600]   But when I started testing out this Pixelbook and reading comics on it, the ability to go
[01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:52.320]   to the Comicsology app and just click a buy it now and start reading it was like, "Oh,
[01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:53.320]   my God!
[01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:58.720]   The same app that lets me read the comic book also lets me buy the comic book."
[01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:04.200]   So yeah, they're falling in line with pretty much everybody else who's telling content.
[01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:08.360]   It's giving away free money to Apple for something that they're not really delivering.
[01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:09.360]   Well, it is.
[01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:10.360]   It's because...
[01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:14.080]   I mean, you could say as a developer, well, if Apple's hosting the app and helping me
[01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:17.480]   market the app that maybe that's worth a 30% check.
[01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:19.160]   But if it's subscription fee...
[01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:20.160]   Yeah.
[01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:22.160]   That's basically what I'm seeking.
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:23.160]   Yeah.
[01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:26.320]   And I think it's not so people who are not going to be subscribing to Netflix unless...
[01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:29.760]   Oh, well, Netflix, you say?
[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:33.480]   They're actually just sort of handing money to Apple as opposed to Apple helping Netflix
[01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:34.480]   do anything.
[01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:38.480]   It is the number one grossing app on the App Store Netflix.
[01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:44.840]   And I think that Apple could easily do things that are basically how much you gross with
[01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:46.720]   the store changes your percentage.
[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:51.120]   So when you are a little company, admittedly, you are benefiting more from Apple than they
[01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:52.120]   are benefiting from you.
[01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:54.000]   So 30% might make sense.
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:58.040]   When you are bringing in that much money, it might make more sense to be two and a half
[01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:00.240]   percent or five percent or something that...
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:03.080]   And it just comes down to...
[01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:05.720]   Apple created 850 million users to do it.
[01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:09.800]   We know they're open to it because they lowered after the first year subscription cut.
[01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:14.560]   In fact, partly probably because of Netflix to 15% after year one.
[01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:17.040]   So I'm sure they're open to this side.
[01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:22.800]   I think a sliding scale that provides discounts, because I'm in the same state.
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:25.680]   And the other side of it is like this is one of those eye rolling things.
[01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:32.400]   Every time I want to buy an Audible book or you have to add it to the wish list and then
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:36.760]   you have to remember to go back to a desktop, which I don't spend much time on anymore.
[01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:40.600]   And then I have to remember to order that book and it is an...
[01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:43.360]   I just use mobile Safari.
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:44.600]   I should.
[01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:46.360]   I just then I'll figure out.
[01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:47.360]   And then I have to log into it.
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:48.360]   It's still annoying.
[01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:49.360]   It's absolutely annoying.
[01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:53.280]   And sometimes you click on it and then it hops into the Amazon app and then it's like,
[01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:56.080]   "No, no, I'm not supposed to be here because you can order through the Amazon app."
[01:21:56.080 --> 01:21:58.240]   And then it pops back to mobile Safari.
[01:21:58.240 --> 01:21:59.720]   Yeah, it's ridiculous.
[01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:00.720]   Fortnite.
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:02.720]   How much do you think Apple made out of Fortnite?
[01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:03.720]   I mean...
[01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:04.720]   300 million.
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:05.720]   Yeah.
[01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:06.720]   Well, they made...
[01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:12.840]   So Fortnite generated 100 million in revenue in the first three months.
[01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:16.600]   By July, it was a billion dollars in all on an app.
[01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:17.600]   And this is just an app purchase.
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:19.800]   It's a free to play game.
[01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:24.280]   And this is why Apple's future really is in services.
[01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:27.520]   You can make a lot of money by selling the thing to the person, but you can make a lot
[01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:31.520]   more money by letting other people make and sell the thing and just take a cut off of
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:32.520]   that.
[01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:33.520]   What does services include?
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:36.360]   Besides App Store revenue?
[01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:38.160]   App Store iCloud.
[01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:39.160]   iCloud.
[01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:40.160]   Apple Pay.
[01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:41.160]   Apple Pay.
[01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:42.160]   Yup.
[01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:43.380]   - Let me say Cam, that would do- - We do the music.
[01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:44.600]   - The whole music, yep.
[01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:46.680]   - What's the biggest revenue generator?
[01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:47.900]   - No, App Store.
[01:22:47.900 --> 01:22:48.780]   - App Store?
[01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:50.280]   - And then number two- - Yeah.
[01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:51.620]   - Google.
[01:22:51.620 --> 01:22:52.460]   - I think it's ineffective.
[01:22:52.460 --> 01:22:54.720]   - Because Google pays Apple nine billion dollars a year
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:56.400]   to be the search engine on Safari.
[01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:57.240]   By the way, that's-
[01:22:57.240 --> 01:22:58.320]   - I don't know if they do that-
[01:22:58.320 --> 01:22:59.080]   - That's rolled, no, no.
[01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:00.720]   - No, no, they do.
[01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:02.060]   - Have to trip this.
[01:23:02.060 --> 01:23:02.860]   - Oh, is that part- - And that's rolled
[01:23:02.860 --> 01:23:04.400]   into the service as revenue.
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:06.560]   So it's not all for your consumers.
[01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:09.680]   Let me verify that, but I think that was the number.
[01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:11.560]   - That, see, that's wild.
[01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:13.960]   - Didn't, if, yeah, wow, okay, that's sneaky.
[01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:15.280]   - Yeah, nine.
[01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:16.640]   And it's a good deal for both of them.
[01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:20.200]   - According to Fortune, Google, pay Apple.
[01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:23.160]   Whoa, wow, now 12 billion.
[01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:25.080]   It was nine billion last year.
[01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:28.800]   They expect it to be 12 billion in 2019.
[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:30.760]   That's a services business.
[01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:32.840]   - Wow, I didn't realize that's where they put that money
[01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:34.400]   is in the services readout.
[01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:35.560]   That's-
[01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:37.680]   - Again, access, like being the gatekeeper
[01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:42.680]   to the type of consumer that Apple has accumulated.
[01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:44.280]   - It's worth it to Google obviously.
[01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:45.440]   - It's nine, right?
[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:46.280]   - Yeah.
[01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:48.000]   - Well, also people do search through mobile.
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.400]   That's where they're looking for restaurants,
[01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:50.880]   that's where they're looking for everything.
[01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:53.520]   That's really, they really want that spy glass.
[01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:57.160]   And also, let's be honest, I don't think an Apple user
[01:23:57.160 --> 01:24:01.160]   wants to dip into Safari or ask Siri, excuse me, ask Cuomo
[01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:06.160]   a question and say, "Alta Vista says that the latest,
[01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:09.240]   yeah, it's, they want Google search."
[01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:12.240]   - We should mention that the Apple and Google neither one
[01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:13.680]   actually talks about these numbers.
[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:16.640]   These, 'cause Apple, as you know, bundles everything
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:18.640]   all together under the word services,
[01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:21.400]   but this is what Goldman Sachs is estimating.
[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:22.920]   And I imagine that they have analysts
[01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:26.000]   who know what they're talking about.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.920]   GarageBand, 15 years old.
[01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:31.360]   Such a great app.
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:32.880]   - That is amazing, isn't it?
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:34.800]   That it came out in 2003.
[01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:39.840]   - What a revolution.
[01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:43.240]   15 years ago this weekend, Steve Jobs introduced GarageBand
[01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:46.680]   at Macworld Expo 2004.
[01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:48.720]   Wanna watch a little of that?
[01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:49.800]   That might be kind of fun.
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:51.360]   - John Mayer, yeah.
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:55.160]   - It works seamlessly together in iLife 04.
[01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:56.000]   - iLife.
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:59.240]   - But today, we're announcing something so cool.
[01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:03.840]   It's a fifth app that's gonna be part of the iLife family
[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:06.000]   and its name is GarageBand.
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:10.000]   - It's kind of a funny name if you think back.
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.320]   I mean, we don't know it now, but--
[01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:15.040]   - GarageBand is a major new pro music tool,
[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:17.000]   but it's for everyone.
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.240]   It's for all of us.
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:22.120]   - And what does it turn your mask into a pro song?
[01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:23.720]   - I don't know, back when you could use it.
[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:24.560]   - That was tech time.
[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:27.120]   - No, that was, that was, that was,
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:27.960]   what was it?
[01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:29.400]   - Now you could say, well--
[01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:31.680]   - You recognize that fine andies are fine experts.
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:34.480]   - I'm saying that that was remember when like keynote,
[01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:36.840]   Steve Jobs always presented with like the next version
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:39.400]   of keynote and all the keynote developers were like,
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:41.040]   please don't crash, please don't crash, please don't crash.
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:42.680]   - I think, I don't know if this was--
[01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:44.760]   - It was, was keynote part, we should go back.
[01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:46.680]   Was keynote part of iLife by this thing?
[01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:48.920]   - It's gonna be part of the iLife family.
[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:51.800]   - No, but that's, that's what he was using it,
[01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:53.560]   but it wasn't yet available, right?
[01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:54.720]   - If you've got a kid that plays the piano--
[01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:57.760]   - So let's go ahead to like a guitar on a keyboard,
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:25:59.640]   especially with the velocity being,
[01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:01.520]   you can bend into a note.
[01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:02.720]   He's so young.
[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:05.400]   - Back on Grand Piano Now, but when it was for the guitar,
[01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:06.240]   you can hear it.
[01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:08.200]   - He's not very tattooed at that point.
[01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:10.080]   - It's pretty cool that they got John Neumann
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:12.600]   there to demonstrate garage fans.
[01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:14.600]   (audience applauding)
[01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:15.600]   That's pretty cool.
[01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:18.320]   That's the power of Jobs.
[01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:19.600]   Hey, wait a minute.
[01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:22.320]   Wait a minute, wasn't there a guy there with a camera?
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:23.160]   - He was a keyboard, especially with--
[01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:24.000]   - Streaming live.
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.640]   - How come he's not banned for life?
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:28.840]   - That's back on Grand Piano Now, but when it was
[01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:30.680]   for the guitar, you can hear it.
[01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:32.000]   (guitar music)
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:33.880]   This makes a man in pain.
[01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:35.960]   - String it in there too, so it has to be back.
[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:37.200]   - You know what, I don't--
[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:39.480]   (audience applauding)
[01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:40.600]   Let's see this guy.
[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:41.440]   Look at that, look at that.
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:42.280]   See that?
[01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:43.120]   - I have that camera on the sofa.
[01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:44.440]   - How come he's not banned?
[01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:46.280]   (laughing)
[01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:48.400]   Anyway, Henry, you used GarageBand,
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:50.720]   but then you moved to Logic, right?
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:53.080]   Which is also an amazing deal.
[01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:54.160]   - Oh yeah, three more.
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:56.360]   - Oh God, what a great deal.
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:59.920]   Logic kind of GarageBand Pro, just as Final Cut
[01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:02.360]   was kind of iMovie Pro, right?
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:05.800]   - Yeah, I think you can still find it on the internet though.
[01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:10.800]   The single coolest GarageBand file is when Trent Reznor
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:15.600]   bounced a bunch of stuff to the--
[01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:16.440]   - Love that.
[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:18.640]   - So it's a whole song, nine inch nail song
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:20.160]   that's in GarageBand, now he didn't make it
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:21.320]   in GarageBand, he made it in Pro Tools,
[01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:23.840]   but he bounced all the tracks out.
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:27.320]   And it's just, you can see the incredible,
[01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:29.600]   what a master does when they build something out there.
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:32.680]   But what I will say about GarageBand is,
[01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:36.960]   my kids went with their grandmother
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:39.080]   and they went to an Apple store
[01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:40.800]   and they took a GarageBand class and I came back
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:42.720]   and I was like, "Hey, what's that song you're playing?"
[01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:44.480]   And my daughter was like, "I made it."
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:46.040]   (laughing)
[01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:48.640]   And I think that's the power of GarageBand
[01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:52.560]   is that my kids are sitting there making music
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:54.800]   and not just like coming complex music
[01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:56.120]   and understanding the structure of it
[01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:57.040]   and how to put it together
[01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:59.480]   and the fact that that can be done on your computer
[01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:01.760]   is as an old foggy, it's pretty amazing.
[01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:02.920]   - And do people, you know,
[01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:04.960]   Apple is always doing these little things like,
[01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:09.240]   what was the music sketchpad that was like voice memos?
[01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:14.120]   I can't remember what was called.
[01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:16.800]   It's like clips, Apple keeps releasing these little apps
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:19.280]   on iOS and they don't mention them again
[01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:21.040]   and I think people forget they exist
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:23.240]   that there wasn't that great little,
[01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:25.080]   Jason Howl was using it, what's it called?
[01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:26.400]   - Oh, music memos?
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:27.680]   - Music memos.
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:30.760]   Yeah, not clips, music memos, yeah, something like that.
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:32.440]   I don't even have it on here.
[01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:33.800]   - I don't think I have mine on.
[01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:35.560]   I'm sure Serenity Caldwell would have used that.
[01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:36.480]   - It was really cool.
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:38.040]   Yeah, you could basically,
[01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:41.800]   ♪ Go back, step it up, it would turn into music ♪
[01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:46.240]   And what a device, an amazing thing.
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:47.800]   All right, I wanna do one more break
[01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:50.880]   and then we will get your picks of the week boys.
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:54.400]   Prepare for your picks of the week
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:57.520]   while we mention one of our long-term sponsors,
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:00.000]   company I think that grew up with us
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:01.240]   and we're really thrilled to have them
[01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:06.160]   as a continuing sponsor, IT Pro TV.
[01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:09.240]   Man 2018 was a good year to get an IT
[01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:11.760]   and I think 2019 is gonna be an even better year,
[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:14.840]   especially IT security, but every area of IT,
[01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:18.120]   this is an area where job growth is phenomenal.
[01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:18.960]   And if you've thought,
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:20.880]   hey, I know a lot about technology,
[01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:22.600]   you're listening to this show after all,
[01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:25.040]   well, I should get a job in IT.
[01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:27.920]   There's no time like the present to start a career
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:30.600]   in IT with IT Pro TV.
[01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:32.760]   No, no, we're not talking about going back to school
[01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:37.760]   or sitting through another boring slideshow snooze fest.
[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:40.640]   No, no, my friends, IT Pro TV is kinda like Twit.
[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:44.200]   In fact, they were inspired by a tech TV in Twit to create,
[01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:49.200]   they have now five studios in their Gainesville, Florida studio.
[01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:54.240]   They have an amazing bunch of trainers who are IT pros,
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:57.440]   IT experts, but also engaging and fun
[01:29:57.440 --> 01:29:59.000]   and they create new content,
[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.600]   hours of new content every week.
[01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:03.400]   I think they're up nine to five Monday through Friday,
[01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:06.200]   five studios times 40 hours,
[01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:08.120]   hundreds of hours of new content every week.
[01:30:08.120 --> 01:30:12.520]   Over 4,000 hours of binge-worthy on-demand content
[01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:14.520]   in their library.
[01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:17.360]   Every IT cert, every IT topic you'd ever wanna know
[01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:22.360]   from CompTIA, the A+ and security plus certs to Cisco,
[01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:27.080]   EC Council, that's a certified ethical hacker cert.
[01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:28.560]   That's an awesome cert.
[01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:33.120]   VMware, Don Pezzet, Ronnie Wong, Cherokee Boos,
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:35.680]   they are great, they are the best,
[01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:39.480]   they present information in a talk show format
[01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:42.240]   that is engaging and fun, just like us,
[01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:43.640]   they even have a, look at that,
[01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:45.880]   configure failover clustering, how about that?
[01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:47.200]   That's something you wanna know,
[01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:48.840]   actually that is something you wanna know.
[01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:51.080]   They have a chat room going on in the background too,
[01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:53.680]   just like we do, you can stream it on your computer
[01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:55.120]   or your tablet, of course.
[01:30:55.120 --> 01:30:58.560]   There's done interviewing people at the RSA conference,
[01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:02.400]   they go to RSA every year and get great content from them,
[01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:04.880]   study basic syntax and PowerShell.
[01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:08.600]   You could stream it on your Chromecast, on your Roku,
[01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:10.000]   they have iOS and Android apps,
[01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:14.160]   they've got Amazon Fire TV app, a great Apple TV app.
[01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:17.720]   Anywhere you are, ITProTV can keep you company,

[01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:26.480]   if you've already had a career in IT
[01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:29.080]   and you just wanna get better or learn,
[01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:31.640]   I just, I think keep your subscription going.

[01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:00.000]   Let's let Micah start.
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.080]   He's our guest.
[01:33:01.080 --> 01:33:03.240]   - Hey, well I'm hoping that this pick
[01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:05.080]   has not been picked before.
[01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:06.640]   - I don't think looking at the name,
[01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:09.520]   I don't remember anybody ever saying this.
[01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:13.280]   - Good, I'm glad, because the name is pretty great.
[01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:15.520]   It's called the Dongle Dangler.
[01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:19.760]   And this is just like, so I got this as a gift
[01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:22.000]   from a friend over Christmas.
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:26.000]   And it's just a simple, it's almost stupid how simple it is.
[01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:30.400]   It goes on your key chain and it's just a little headphone jack.
[01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:32.680]   And then you just slide your--
[01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:34.320]   - Oh, that's hysterical.
[01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:36.600]   - Headphone to lightning jack adapter,
[01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:39.000]   right there onto your key chain.
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:39.840]   - That's hysterical.
[01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:41.360]   - And then you always have it with you.
[01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:43.120]   - OMG.
[01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:43.960]   Does it fall off?
[01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:45.080]   - Is it unreleased securely?
[01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:47.400]   - No, it's like, I'll have to do the,
[01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:49.120]   here we'll do some foley work here, hold on.
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:50.160]   - Yeah.
[01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:52.280]   Oh yeah, let's do that click.
[01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:53.120]   That's serious.
[01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:53.960]   - Nice click.
[01:33:53.960 --> 01:33:55.040]   And I mean, I'm shaking all my,
[01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:56.160]   I got too many keys on here,
[01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:57.680]   I'm shaking them and they're just fine.
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:33:58.680]   - Look at that.
[01:33:58.680 --> 01:34:00.200]   - That's the Dongle Dangler.
[01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:03.400]   It's only, it's like, it's 10 bucks for two of them.
[01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:04.240]   Even less for one,
[01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:05.880]   you get them in a bunch of different colors.
[01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:07.560]   It's so stupid that like,
[01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:09.000]   I'm just mad at how simple it is,
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:09.840]   but I love it for that.
[01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:11.280]   - What a great gift that is.
[01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:13.840]   That's a very nice, that's a thoughtful gift.
[01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:15.080]   - Good little stocky stuffer.
[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:15.920]   - Yeah.
[01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:17.560]   What is this?
[01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:19.400]   Oh, it's the Dongle Dangler, Michael.
[01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:22.080]   Very nice.
[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:22.920]   - Thank you.
[01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:23.760]   - It's on Amazon right now.
[01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:25.280]   Just search for Dongle Dangler in Amazon.
[01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:26.720]   Don't search outside Amazon.
[01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:27.560]   - Yeah, please, yeah.
[01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:29.880]   Don't just do a Google search for Dongle Dangler
[01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:31.760]   'cause I can't be held responsible for that.
[01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:33.600]   - Go into Amazon and find it.
[01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:35.800]   Great pick.
[01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:37.120]   I love that, Micah.
[01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:40.040]   That's practically an Andy and not co-pick.
[01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:42.400]   What do you have for us, Andy?
[01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:44.640]   - Well, this was, we've been off for a couple of weeks
[01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:46.800]   and a lot of that was like people home for the holidays
[01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:49.720]   and I had an unusual amount of tech support to do
[01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:51.480]   with friends and family
[01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:54.200]   and which was made it very, very happy
[01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:58.200]   that I had IFixit like Uber toolkit handy
[01:34:58.200 --> 01:35:01.040]   that has all of like the security screws,
[01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:04.480]   security bits you need to get into phones and tablets
[01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:05.960]   and all kinds of stuff,
[01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:09.680]   which is not to say that people should be sending work
[01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:13.240]   to friends and family if there's an Apple store handy
[01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:15.360]   but you never know when there's something simple
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:18.840]   that just requires you to like get at the bottom.
[01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:21.400]   A friend of mine had a bad interaction
[01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:25.360]   with a cup of like hot lemon water and a laptop
[01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:29.200]   and it wasn't, the Apple stores were closed at that moment
[01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:32.560]   and I was able to at least get the lemon,
[01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:34.480]   the lemon scent at least wafting out,
[01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:36.920]   get the molecules flowing out of it.
[01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:40.720]   The thing is it's, they'll sell you just the tool you need
[01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:41.880]   to get into a device.
[01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:45.640]   I was missing versus a P5 Pentaloap screwdriver
[01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:48.480]   when I needed to fix my own laptop a couple of weeks ago.
[01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:49.800]   But the great thing about having this kid
[01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:51.280]   is that you will have everything
[01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:54.880]   and you never know when you're gonna be in a situation
[01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:57.480]   where you just need to get something done right now.
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:35:59.480]   And the third thing is you will make sure
[01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:00.960]   that when you do need to do this thing,
[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:03.840]   you will have the right tool for that job.
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:06.200]   Over the years, I've accumulated a drawer
[01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:08.880]   of like dentist tools and guitar picks
[01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:11.640]   and things that work well for a certain situation
[01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:13.840]   but this kid will have like a really good
[01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:16.000]   well-made spudger for prying apart.
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.840]   Like they show a video where you're trying to replace
[01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:23.400]   a battery in a car fob and you can't pry the two halves open
[01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:25.640]   you might have jabbing a screwdriver in there
[01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:28.600]   and then you might wind up like just getting it open
[01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:30.040]   but scratching the hell out of the thing.
[01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:32.560]   Whereas you will have a proper plastic spudger
[01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:34.880]   that will get things open safely.
[01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:37.400]   It's great for those sort of tasks
[01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:40.000]   where it's not worth ordering something
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:41.760]   and waiting two days to get the tool
[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:43.800]   but if you have the right tool handy,
[01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:45.920]   you will absolutely use the right tool.
[01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:47.840]   Buy it once, the full kit is 60 bucks.
[01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:50.640]   If you just wanna buy individual tools,
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:53.720]   you can buy less ambitious sets for,
[01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:58.000]   I replaced my P6 Penelope for like,
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:36:59.840]   I don't know, like 10 bucks or something like that
[01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:02.000]   but buy it, put in a drawer, have it handy
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:03.760]   and suddenly you can solve problems
[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:06.880]   without causing more damage than God inflicted.
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:09.520]   - We, of course, sponsors of many of our shows
[01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:12.000]   and we're big fans, we gave them away
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.360]   as Christmas gifts a couple of years ago to host.
[01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:17.400]   So I agree, it's a great, great gift.
[01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:18.600]   60 bucks too, right?
[01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:20.040]   It's not very expensive.
[01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:22.400]   - Yeah, and it's so good that if you lend it to somebody,
[01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:24.600]   they'll deny later on that they lend it to you
[01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:26.560]   and you have to decide whether it's worth it
[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:28.360]   or what you're talking about.
[01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:30.040]   - I had to buy another one.
[01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:32.160]   But thank you for the, it was a wonderful gift.
[01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:34.880]   I had to reflect upon the fact that it was a gift to me
[01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:37.600]   and so that I've just learned something about somebody.
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:38.600]   (laughing)
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:39.600]   It was probably one more than 60 bucks.
[01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:41.760]   - That was the real gift, isn't it, Andy?
[01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:43.960]   To know your friends.
[01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:45.480]   Alex Lindsay.
[01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:47.960]   - So I'm recommending one that I haven't used
[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:49.960]   on the slopes yet.
[01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:51.600]   - Oh, I'm so excited.
[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:52.440]   - I'm so excited, look at it.
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:55.240]   Yeah, friend of mine, friend of mine Fred
[01:37:55.240 --> 01:37:58.000]   was talking about this and I opened up the app
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:37:59.480]   and I almost wanted to go skiing
[01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:01.520]   just because I was like looking through this app.
[01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:04.800]   It's called slopes and you can track your progress
[01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:05.640]   on the slopes.
[01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:07.440]   So I figured, we're still in the winter
[01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:09.840]   so this is your time to go out and ski.
[01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:12.480]   This is just the coolest app.
[01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:16.400]   I went through a lot of it and it is keeping track
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:18.160]   of all the data.
[01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:21.240]   And the reason I'm interested in it is because
[01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:22.240]   it is,
[01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:28.800]   there's a lot coming I think around location based data
[01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:31.040]   of what you're doing and how you're doing it
[01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:33.800]   and letting you create new games inside of that space
[01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:35.280]   and I think that this is one of those things
[01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:37.200]   where it's keeping track of exactly
[01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:40.200]   how you went down the slope and your vertical drops
[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:42.560]   and your average speed and all those bits
[01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:44.880]   that works with your watch, it works with your phone.
[01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:47.160]   It just, you can share it with your friends
[01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:49.520]   and compete with each other or cover things
[01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:50.920]   and pay attention to it.
[01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:55.360]   And I just think it adds data in a really fun way.
[01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:57.000]   I haven't made it up to Tahoe yet
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.720]   so I can't say that I've used it but I have,
[01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:05.920]   it is a, again, my friend Fred has used it quite a bit
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:09.080]   and just loves it and I downloaded it
[01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:11.440]   and as soon as I saw it and I saw what he was doing with it,
[01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:13.040]   I was like, oh my gosh, this is amazing.
[01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:14.840]   I wanna go skiing just to play with it.
[01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:18.680]   So anyway, it's a, it's a cool little app.
[01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:21.040]   Makes you wanna take up skiing just to use it.
[01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:22.600]   (laughing)
[01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:24.760]   No, I have a skiing in a long time.
[01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:25.920]   Who needs cycles?
[01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:29.160]   But I think we're gonna see, I think what's more interesting
[01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:31.240]   about this is you can download or just take a look at it
[01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:32.920]   but think about how that's applied
[01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:35.400]   to lots of different recreational areas.
[01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:38.640]   I think when I look at this app, it's not so much that I'm,
[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:41.320]   you know, the reason I recommended it was not so much
[01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:45.800]   that everyone's skiing but that you should really look at it
[01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:50.480]   as location-based, you know, interactive experiences
[01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:53.760]   is going to be massive, especially as we see 5G come out
[01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:56.320]   and there's a lot of opportunities there
[01:39:56.320 --> 01:39:57.920]   and I think that this is just one of,
[01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:00.200]   one of a glimpse at what the future is gonna look like.
[01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:03.560]   Just remember if you're part of the US Army ski team,
[01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:04.960]   you're not allowed to use this.
[01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:05.960]   Don't use this home.
[01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:07.480]   (laughing)
[01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:09.600]   It works with Strava too so you can post your,
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:10.920]   share your slopes.
[01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:14.240]   Yes, data with your Strava friends.
[01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:16.520]   I had a couple of recommendations but I'll save one
[01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:19.760]   because this one's timely.
[01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:21.840]   For those of us with the new iPads,
[01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:24.840]   we've been looking desperately hoping
[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:27.840]   for a replacement for Apple's kind of okay
[01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:31.360]   but overpriced folio keyboard,
[01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:35.640]   the bridge BRY-DGE is now available for pre-order
[01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:37.840]   as of an hour and a half ago.
[01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:42.120]   And in fact, if you order, it says if you're in the first
[01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:43.480]   thousand customers to pre-order,
[01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:46.880]   you'll get it first delivered by April 15th.
[01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:49.000]   I'm thinking by now they got a thousand orders
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:50.400]   but maybe not so,
[01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:53.440]   high V over to BRY-DGE.com.
[01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:56.840]   Apple's folio keyboard for the 12.9 inch iPad
[01:40:56.840 --> 01:40:58.520]   is almost $200.
[01:40:58.520 --> 01:41:00.960]   The bridge is a little bit less.
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:03.200]   It's $150 for the 11 inch,
[01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:06.160]   $169.99 for the 12.9 inch.
[01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:09.040]   Comes in matching colors, either space gray or silver.
[01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:13.720]   I am, I have not tried it but I read Renee Richie's
[01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:16.640]   preview of it and he really liked it.
[01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:19.760]   It's very stable as Andy pointed out
[01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:21.200]   or was it you Alex?
[01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:23.280]   Nowadays you might want to case the keeps your iPad
[01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:24.800]   from bending.
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:27.080]   I'm thinking Andy pointed that out.
[01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:28.240]   You've seen it Andy.
[01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:32.520]   I've seen some kind of yes.
[01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:34.720]   How about you Micah?
[01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:35.560]   Have you seen it?
[01:41:35.560 --> 01:41:39.560]   I'm willing to state that this is my favorite kind
[01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:41.840]   of keyboard for the iPad.
[01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:43.920]   It is so good that you're going to be sort of
[01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:46.000]   hot angry with other comp.
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.920]   Oh, you're angry with Apple for not having made an iPad
[01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:53.440]   or even a MacBook with that that folds like this.
[01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:56.640]   Yeah, it does turn it more into like a laptop.
[01:41:56.640 --> 01:41:59.720]   It does not use the smart connector as the Apple keyboard.
[01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:00.560]   Definitely bummer.
[01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:02.560]   It's a blue tooth.
[01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:03.960]   But yeah, I have to say,
[01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:09.960]   I've already pre-ordered it and I'll have a review for you.
[01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:11.960]   I think I got in in the first thousand.
[01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:14.960]   So I'll have a review for you right about tax time.
[01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:17.960]   This is a good company.
[01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:19.960]   Bridge has done good stuff for a long time.
[01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:24.960]   And so I trust them enough to pre-order site unseen.
[01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:28.960]   And you might want to to be our YDGE.com
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:32.960]   or wait till April when all the reviews come out.
[01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:37.960]   Or actually read Renee's review because he gave a very positive review on iMore.com.
[01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:38.960]   That's what I remember.
[01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:47.960]   But if you wait until April, your iPad, the bridge keyboard might not fit the curve of your iPad at that point.
[01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:51.960]   So just be warned.
[01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:52.960]   Mm.
[01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:56.960]   Mike is sorry, but it's perfectly normal.
[01:42:56.960 --> 01:42:57.960]   That's perfectly normal.
[01:42:57.960 --> 01:42:58.960]   That's perfectly normal.
[01:42:58.960 --> 01:42:59.960]   It's perfectly normal.
[01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:00.960]   Well with an engineering call.
[01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:02.960]   The Apple says it's okay.
[01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:03.960]   Don't freak out.
[01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:09.960]   I don't think I have a bet in mind, but I don't really want to put it on the table to find.
[01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:10.960]   I haven't looked at mine yet.
[01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:11.960]   I have to get around to it.
[01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:12.960]   Don't look.
[01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:13.960]   That's a funny thing.
[01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:14.960]   I'm happy right now.
[01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:15.960]   So why bother?
[01:43:15.960 --> 01:43:16.960]   No.
[01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:17.960]   I don't like it.
[01:43:17.960 --> 01:43:19.960]   Mike Isargent also writes for iMore.
[01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:24.960]   And he's also found at chihuahua.coffee on the Twitter at mica.
[01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:26.960]   M-I-K-A-H.
[01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:28.960]   Sargent S-A-R-G-E-N-T.
[01:43:28.960 --> 01:43:29.960]   Thank you for being here, Micah.
[01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:31.960]   Hey, it was such a pleasure to be here.
[01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:32.960]   Thanks a lot.
[01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:33.960]   It's a lot of fun.
[01:43:33.960 --> 01:43:40.960]   I was going to, if Renee had been here, I would have shown him my Pokeball.
[01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:41.960]   Pokemongo ball.
[01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:42.960]   Oh yeah.
[01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:44.960]   He is Poke-wiled.
[01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:45.960]   He's Poke-wiled.
[01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:48.960]   You know, we're best friends on Pokemon Go.
[01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:50.960]   So I know all about that.
[01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:53.960]   Let's talk to him next week about this.
[01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:58.960]   Alex Lindsey, thank you so much for being in studio with us as always.
[01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:04.960]   If you want to know what Alex is up to, best thing to do is follow him on Twitter, A-L-E-X-L-I-N-D-S-A-Y.
[01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:06.960]   Are you going to think coming up?
[01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:07.960]   Nope.
[01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:08.960]   Nope.
[01:44:08.960 --> 01:44:09.960]   Nope.
[01:44:09.960 --> 01:44:10.960]   No, no, no.
[01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:11.960]   Nothing I can talk about.
[01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:12.960]   Nope.
[01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:14.960]   But otherwise, I do post more regularly on Twitter.
[01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:15.960]   I kind of settled into Twitter.
[01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:18.960]   I don't think it's going to adjust that much.
[01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:19.960]   Okay.
[01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:22.960]   I guess whatever that means is good to know.
[01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:24.960]   He's like, "I like to post a Twitter."
[01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:25.960]   He says.
[01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:32.160]   I post in a lot of places, but mostly what I post is just Twitter because I've taken -- I
[01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:34.960]   don't really do a lot of the other ones.
[01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:35.960]   I don't know why.
[01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:38.960]   I just like my ADD brain.
[01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:39.960]   That's why.
[01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:42.960]   Just like 200 -- and I've gotten really good at the 250 characters.
[01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:43.960]   Really?
[01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:44.960]   I get to about -- I get to feel it right up.
[01:44:44.960 --> 01:44:46.960]   You look closer minus five all the time.
[01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:47.960]   Good.
[01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:49.960]   Sorry about that if you're reading them.
[01:44:49.960 --> 01:44:54.960]   Andy Inaco, we can hear him every week on WGBH Boston, Boston Public Radio, and read
[01:44:54.960 --> 01:44:57.960]   his stuff at IHNATKO.com.
[01:44:57.960 --> 01:45:00.960]   Anything you want to plug?
[01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:08.960]   I posted a piece on Fast Company yesterday about the new Samsung app on the new Apple
[01:45:08.960 --> 01:45:10.960]   app on Samsung TV.
[01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:13.960]   He's all about it then.
[01:45:13.960 --> 01:45:14.960]   Oh.
[01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:15.960]   Oh.
[01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:16.960]   Well, perfect timing.
[01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:18.960]   He's completely frozen.
[01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:19.960]   I blame his Samsung TV.
[01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:21.960]   As the show grabs it.
[01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:22.960]   There he is.
[01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:23.960]   He's back.
[01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:24.960]   Fast company.
[01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:25.960]   Fast company.
[01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:26.960]   Fair day cage.
[01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:31.960]   The NSA was worried about the explosive stuff that I was talking about.
[01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:36.960]   As usual, how much did you get before I decided to take a break there?
[01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:38.960]   I did forgot to.
[01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:40.960]   We got the Fast Company thing.
[01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:42.960]   I think that's the most important.
[01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:44.960]   He's reviewing the new Samsung TV.
[01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:46.960]   I think I heard him say that.
[01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:47.960]   Oh, no.
[01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:49.960]   I wrote a piece about it and what it means in the bigger picture.
[01:45:49.960 --> 01:45:50.000]   And then just go to an
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:53.960]   and an outgoing Twitter further links.
[01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:54.960]   So there you go.
[01:45:54.960 --> 01:45:56.960]   I forgot to mention Mike has podcasts.
[01:45:56.960 --> 01:45:58.960]   Lucid all about lucid dreaming.
[01:45:58.960 --> 01:45:59.960]   He does with Tory folk.
[01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:02.960]   How is the lucid dreaming going?
[01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:06.960]   Well, we actually had to go on a creative hiatus on that one.
[01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:07.960]   So I would love to plug.
[01:46:07.960 --> 01:46:08.960]   Too much time sleeping.
[01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:09.960]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:11.960]   How about somehow I manage?
[01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:12.960]   How about that?
[01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:13.960]   Are you still doing that?
[01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:14.960]   That's the one.
[01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:15.960]   Okay, good.
[01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:16.960]   We do that weekly.
[01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:17.960]   If you're a fan of the office.
[01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:18.960]   Oh, you do it with tips.
[01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:19.960]   Yeah, Tiffany Arman tonight.
[01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:21.960]   Talk about the office every week.
[01:46:21.960 --> 01:46:23.960]   We watch an episode and talk about it.
[01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:24.960]   It comes out every Thursday.
[01:46:24.960 --> 01:46:25.960]   Wait a minute.
[01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:26.960]   The office, that old show?
[01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:28.960]   That old show.
[01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:31.960]   It is going through a renaissance right now.
[01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:34.960]   They're already up to episode 40.
[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:36.960]   How many episodes are there?
[01:46:36.960 --> 01:46:38.960]   Oh, a billion.
[01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:42.960]   There are nine seasons and a bunch of episodes.
[01:46:42.960 --> 01:46:46.960]   And like it's on Netflix and new people are getting into the show.
[01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:47.960]   Oh, that's awesome.
[01:46:47.960 --> 01:46:48.960]   I'm an old school super fan of it.
[01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:53.960]   So is TIFF and yeah, we very much love that show and talk about it every week.
[01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:57.960]   Just looking at the titles brings back memories like prison Mike.
[01:46:57.960 --> 01:46:59.960]   That was a good episode.
[01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:06.960]   I'm going to have to go back and listen to all of these.
[01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:07.960]   That's awesome.
[01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:08.960]   Yeah.
[01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:09.960]   Bedside bacon.
[01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:11.960]   We could flip some of the show and everything.
[01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:12.960]   Oh, you do.
[01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:14.960]   They let you do that or you just do it.
[01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:17.960]   We would try to say there's a.
[01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:18.960]   It's editorial.
[01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:20.960]   Do some some fair use stuff, right?
[01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:21.960]   Yeah, that's fair use.
[01:47:21.960 --> 01:47:24.960]   So you don't do the British version, just the American version.
[01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:25.960]   Just the American version.
[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:26.960]   Yeah.
[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:27.960]   The British version.
[01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:35.960]   I'm not going to go into too much here, but the British version was very much meant to be written as sort of dark comedy and it's sort of sad.
[01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:42.960]   And the first season of the American version was that way and then producers realized, hey, if we want to keep the show around, we kind of got to make it more positive.
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:46.960]   So you'll notice in season two that sort of changes and it gets a lot better, I think.
[01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:51.960]   Should I start the show and your podcast simultaneously?
[01:47:51.960 --> 01:47:58.960]   Yeah, I mean, if you'd like to, if you want to go back and run them, like, should I listen to your podcast wall?
[01:47:58.960 --> 01:47:59.960]   I'm watching.
[01:47:59.960 --> 01:48:00.960]   Oh, commentary.
[01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:02.960]   No, no, it's not commentary.
[01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:05.960]   It's yeah, it's sort of post show breakdown of stuff.
[01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:14.960]   We also talked about trivia and things that aren't mentioned in the show and sort of how the producers, like, it's a bunch of insight into what sort of goes into this episode.
[01:48:14.960 --> 01:48:16.960]   That was one of the greatest shows of all time.
[01:48:16.960 --> 01:48:17.960]   Maybe the greatest comedy.
[01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:18.960]   It's a common all time.
[01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:19.960]   I agree.
[01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:20.960]   I'm glad that you feel that way.
[01:48:20.960 --> 01:48:21.960]   Thank you, Micah.
[01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:22.960]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:48:22.960 --> 01:48:23.960]   Thank you, Alex.
[01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:26.960]   We appreciate your being here too.
[01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:32.960]   We do Mac break weekly every Tuesday round about 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern.
[01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:35.960]   That'd be, I think, 1800 UTC.
[01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:37.960]   I'll tell you what, here's the deal.
[01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:42.960]   If you want to watch live, you can go to twitter.tv/live or listen because we have a audio stream as well.
[01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:46.960]   And if you do that, you should be in the chatroom at irc.twit.tv.
[01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:51.960]   That's kind of like the commentary track for the show going on in the chatroom.
[01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:55.960]   But you don't have to because we know you're busy and we do the show in the middle of the workday.
[01:48:55.960 --> 01:48:57.960]   So here's the easiest thing to do.
[01:48:57.960 --> 01:49:00.960]   Just go to twitter.tv/mbw.
[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:02.960]   Download any episode you want listed as you want.
[01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:06.960]   And the most convenient thing to do is be subscribe in your favorite podcast app.
[01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:07.960]   That way it's there.
[01:49:07.960 --> 01:49:15.960]   You know, the minute we're done and the editors put it out, you can get a copy and automatically on your phone and you can listen whenever you feel like it.
[01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:20.960]   Either way, we hope you will come back each and every Tuesday to Mac break weekly.
[01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:26.960]   But now I'm sad to say it's time to go back to work because break time is over.
