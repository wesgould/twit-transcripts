[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Hello, Andy Inotko from the Chicago Sun-Times.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Oh, don't you remember those great do-op groups of the 60s?
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   The fabulous servers with four unbroken top ten hits.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Where'd they go?
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Where are they now?
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   I can't remember.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   What do they call those things?
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   They call them the...
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Well, I saw them at the Mahagan Sun Casino, but you could tell
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   there was only one of the original fabulous servers in the
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   group.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   The rest three were like people they hired on later.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Right.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   I hate when they do that.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   I almost like got my money back for the two drinks I had to
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   buy to go in and see them.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Also here with us from Oxford, Hertford, I don't know, from
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Great Britain, we got two, not one but two Brits, starting on my

[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Hello, Will.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Hello, lovely to be here.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Welcome back, could have you.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   You were just on Twitch.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   And now...
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   I know, it's all well all the time.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Did you just stay in the studio and wait for Mac break with you?
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   The study in the Harris residence.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Also, Don McAllister from Screencast Online.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Hi, Don.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Hello, Leo.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Hi.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Great to be back.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Great to have you.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Thank you.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Don and I have a little experience with the old...
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   I was going to say the oldie in the house.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   No, the oldie.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   What am I thinking?
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   I've just watched my turn and thought, no, the cruise, the
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   cruise thing.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   The cruise thing.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Don and Don and Danny and I were on Mac, Mania 10.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Nine.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   And then 10 is next year.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   And today...
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   The clock is three.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   These are going to be a very weird show.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   It is.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   No, I'm not going there anymore.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   That was it.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   That was the one time me, Drew Bies.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   All the access to throwing you off.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Me, Drew Bies.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   So, uh...
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Item one on the agenda.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   If you're using a Hackintosh,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Apple's got some bad news for you.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   We heard this rumor last week, and apparently it's true with
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   10.62, the security update that came out a couple of days ago.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   In fact, remove support for the Atom,
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   the Intel processors that's in a lot of, uh,
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   netbooks.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Yeah, we just tant them out to saying that we're saying no to
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Hackintoshing forever, because that's one of the reasons why
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   it's so effective is that it's every single netbook, the cost
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   400 bucks out there and runs Windows XP runs the same.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Item N270 or N280 processor.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   But, I don't know, there's room on the horizon because I'm
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   just testing out a $600, $599, Acer, not a netbook,
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   but like a mini miniature PC that runs a Intel Core Duo.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   So, maybe you need to still room for improvement here.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   So, yeah, because, I mean, Hackintosh doesn't necessarily require
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   a netbook.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   I mean, SciStar does it on desktops.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Yeah, all you need is a bootloader that's designed to work
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   with whatever hardware is built.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   There is a bootloader that works great with the N270.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   That's why it's been so easy to port to so many different
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   netbooks out there.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   So, back to square one.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   But remember that the world Hackintosh community was a
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   square one before and they managed to make pretty much
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   almost a consumer level installation for Dell and other
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   models on that book.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   So, I'm sure they'll bounce back after too long.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Yeah, you have to wonder why they actually stopped it now,
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   though, because it must have been hurting them at some point,
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   wasn't it?
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   It must have been, you know, initially it was just really the
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   die-hard geeks who were making the Hackintosh's.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   But it must really have started to impact them for them to actually
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   bring in this fix to stop it.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Or maybe it's just...
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Go ahead, Will.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   I'm not sure it's hurting them so much as about making a
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   statement.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Yes, that's kind of the feeling I get.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   It's an easy thing to do.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   That's what I was going to say.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Screw you, Hackintosh!
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Right.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   It's a processor that they don't put into any product and
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   probably have no intention of ever putting it into any product.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   All that to do is add just two lines of code maybe to the boot
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   process and that's it.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Someone probably did it on his lunch hour.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   It was a college intern sort of thing.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   So, if you have a Hackintosh and you update to 10.62,
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   I always thought, kind of, if you had a Hackintosh, you shouldn't
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   be running updates anyway.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   But if you do run 10.62, your machine will stop working.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Is that right?
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Yeah, that's likely.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   I have a Hackintosh Dell Mini 9, but I have not upgraded it past
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   10.5.6 yet.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   I haven't even put it on Snow Leopard yet.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Waiting to hear from reports from Otterline districts.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Plus, once you have it running on a Hackintosh, you're not really
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   in that business for the cutting edge, latest edition of every
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   operating system.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   So, it's okay to be four or five months behind.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   So long as people can still get the regular Leopard DVD out there
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   and so long as the 10.6.2 is not what you would get on a standard
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   upgrade disk.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Negligible impact.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   How about the security impact?
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Do you need to upgrade to 10.62 for security?
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   I don't know about that.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   I haven't, I haven't, haven't installed it yet.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Obviously, it's going to have the same incremental little O we heard
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   from here and everywhere that there's a buffer underflow problem
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   that we could seal up.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Right.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   But Stu Helm saying in the chat room that the Dell Mini 9 has
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Snow Leopard problems anyway.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   So, you're not going to go to Snow Leopard anyway on the Dell
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Mini 9.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   I think people are so community focused with these Hackintosh
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   projects that we have our own Genius Bar in the form of the
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   my Dell Mini, my Dell Mini forums where you can, there are always
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   the people who have, yeah, the people who are excited about
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   being the first person to buy the update and the first person
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   to release a patch that makes it work.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   So, it's not quite a consumer product, but it's close.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   It's as good as any installation of any Linux you will find out
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   there where it's easy enough to put in, if there's enough
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   support out there that it's stone go.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   I have a question actually for you because you're a Boston person.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   The giant iPod touch billboard.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Has that been a subject of a lot of controversy in Boston?
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Well, in the People's Republic of Cambridge, yes.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   It's been a, it's not quite as bad as Berkeley, but the controversy
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   is that the main highway going into Boston right before it turns
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   into that $18 billion tunnel system.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   You pass by the side of a big storage building that some
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   years ago, more than a decade and a half ago, one of the pain
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   who's famous for taking sides of buildings that aren't being
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   used and saying, you know what, we will, we will pay, I will paint
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   you a huge, wonderful sea mural of, of, of, of, of, of orcas and
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   whales playing it.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   That's pretty, I'm looking at that.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   That looks good.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Exactly.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   And realize that one of the reasons why people love that
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   mural so much is that it's part of your daily commute.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   It's the last thing you see before the car plunges into darkness.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   And it becomes, it becomes part of the part of the landscape of, of
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Boston.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   And so they were doing some reconstruction and some
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   renovation to the building and they erected one of those, one
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   of those layers of fabric that they put over the building
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   when they're renovating it and they decided, well, we know, well,
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   you know, we'll rent this out as a billboard.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Apple snapped it up.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Oh.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   And now.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   So it's desecrating a landmark.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   Number one is desecating, creating a landmark.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Number two, though, is that, that people are pointing out that
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   that building did not have the right to sell that space as
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   billboard space.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   So it's designed, they got a waiver because the whale mural is
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   not really advertising anything.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   It's just something pretty.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   So now they're trying to use this as a way to say you have to
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   pull that down.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   We were kind of okay with it when it was just going to be up for as
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   long as that building was being renovated.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   At some point you're going to be pulling it down and we'll get
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   the mural back.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   But now they're saying, well, gee, having, having, having an
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   ad build board about the size of half of a football field,
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   that's actually quite profitable.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   We would very much like to keep that.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   And so the developer, the guy who owns the building is now
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   really digging his heels and saying that you're going to have
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   to prove to me that I do not have the legal right to have this
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   ad up there before I'll take it down.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   Well, I, so is it up now?
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Is it currently up or the last I, last I drove past, which was
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   about a week and a half, two weeks ago, it was still up.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   But it's an ongoing thing.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   I wouldn't be surprised if he was forced to take it down.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   I have not been necessarily hip deep in this controversy, but
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   every article that I've read about it in the local papers, they've
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   unfortunately we have access to people from northeastern school
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   of law and Harvard University's law school who, and who like to
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   be on TV and contribute to these things.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   And so he's saying, nope, they are absolutely wrong.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   There's, it'll, it'll come to a point where the amount of money
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   that he's making off of this billboard will exceed the legal
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   battle to keep it up and he'll have to take it down.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   But there's every single impetus for this guy to keep it up as long
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   as he possibly can to keep those revenues coming in.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   Oh, change of plans.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   Apparently, Apple's 1062 no longer disables the atom.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   There you go.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   You heard it here first.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   The latest from download squad is that the developer build that
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   just came out of 1062 does not block atom support.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   And according to life hacker, which has installed it, our
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Hackintosh works like a charm with 1062.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   That's interesting because I know that they did, they did
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   disable it at one of the developer builds and then they brought
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   it back in at final developer build, but I thought that
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   the last one that official release broke it again.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   But is that never been disproven?
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   Well, let's see.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   Let me look at the date file date November 9th.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   So it was yesterday Adam Pash, the editor in chief of life hacker
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   writes.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   If you're following our most recent guides to installing
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Snow Leopard on a PC from start to finish, you'll be happy to
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   know I've tested my bill with today's 10.6.2 update to
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   Snow Leopard and it's working like a charm.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   That means you shouldn't have to do anything special to upgrade
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   the latest and greatest if you fire it followed our guide.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Now, apparently this is the particular life hacker
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   Hackintosh build.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   He says it looks like Adam CPUs.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   I'm very confused.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   Oh, is there build not an atom?
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   I guess there builds not on an atom.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   So it does now.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   He says, OK, it looks like this is very, very confusing.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   It looks like Adam CPUs are not supported in 10.6.2 as
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   previous speculation indicated.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   So all right.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   That explained it.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   I take it back.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   [laughter]
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   It doesn't work.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   It doesn't work.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   We're just like those with those news websites.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   All of ours that we posted first the news.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   If we can retract it later on, that's perfectly within the rules.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   Yes.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   And we told you we retracted it and we apologize for the error.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   So we're getting double the click throughs.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   This is awesome.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   If only we got click throughs.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   I've been given to believe that I've just received in the
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   mail the new Apple tablet.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   I haven't opened it up yet.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   [laughter]
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   90 minutes.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   Stay tuned.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   Unfortunately, doesn't work on a podcast.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   They just immediately drop the show and go right to the end to
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   see what happened.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   So no, nothing will happen at the end, kids.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   I don't think.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   Stop listening right now.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   I mean, there's probably a new edition of the bugle.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   It's a repeat from last week.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   But you know, it's huge.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   But I'll do go by the way, that's a great show.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   You got me hooked.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   I wish I--
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   I think that the highest compliment that you can give any
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   podcast or any regular show is that your love for the people who
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   do this show turns instantly to hatred when the announce is going
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   to be repeats next week.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   Like, oh, come on.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   You can't just record two shows this.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   Oh, you idiot.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   I hate you.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Don't you work.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   You killed the two.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   Did you work?
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   Did you see the photo of the tablet, didn't you?
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   I am looking at the Nvidia story here.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   Yeah, the CEO with the gadget on the table.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   Well, OK, let's take a look at this.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   Nvidia CEO loves Apple possesses mysterious alien device.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.600]   Shuffle's-- Shuffle magazine did a piece on Nvidia CEO Jen Son
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:03.000]   Hwang during a visit to Dubai recently.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   Oh, I know Shuffle magazine.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   That's Magnus Neistat's magazine.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   In fact, I've been in that magazine.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   He's a nice guy in which he talks about how much he and his
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   family love their Macs and how Apple's machines add value.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   And in his house, it's just Mac, Mac, Mac.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   And oh, my God.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   What is that sitting on the table in front of him?
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   Well, I don't think it's an Apple tablet.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   It's, first of all, it's a lot bigger than an Apple tablet.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   Right?
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   Oh, you take a lot of the boxes, though.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   It's single button down at the bottom and video camera at the top
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   with the stereo speakers and double-edged black.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   Very elegant.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   Yeah, it's unlikely that the CEO would actually
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   don't want on the table from the interview on the
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   Mac.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   I think way back.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   And also, it's right there, two inches away from the camera,
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   dominating the whole bottom third of the image.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   And what kind of an idiot would be taking that picture without
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   saying screw the interview with the CEO?
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   I've just got, again, guaranteed 500,000 clicks of the minute I put
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   this up.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   You know, it's even more embarrassing.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   That interview happened when I was in Dubai.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   [laughter]
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   They were sponsored.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   The TEDx thing.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   And I have a pretty good feeling that that was exactly when I was
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   there.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   So not only did Magnus miss it, I missed it too.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   Did Lee something behind?
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   Is that a lot of bad?
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   That's my pad.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   Is it a crunch pad?
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   Could be.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   And gadget, boy, I tell you, our chat room is great.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   And gadget has solved it.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   It is an ODM Tegra prototype.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   So the Tegra is that system on a chip that is used in the
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   Zoom HD and I guess ODM.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   Because making it make it a Tegra prototype.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   Yeah, if Tegra is, I think it's relatively relative.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   Are you downloading?
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   Are you bit turning large files there, Will, because you're
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   breaking up?
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   Oh, you know what it is.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   It's Transformers 2, isn't it?
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   It's not worth it.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   It's linking mobile me.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   Don't sync mobile me.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   Don't sync mobile me.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   Well, it does it automatically.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   I know.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   I hate that.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   But I'm pretty sure the new 3GS uses an Nvidia graphics chip,
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   the iPhone 3GS.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   And it seems like Apple's got a bit of a thing for Nvidia
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   mobile graphics at the moment.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   So it wouldn't surprise me if any Apple has had a tablet, if
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   and when it did ever emerge.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   You can include Tegra.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   Like a Tegra component.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   This one, according to Engadget, is running Windows CE.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   So don't get your hopes up.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   These guys are great.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   I thank you, chat room, because chat room basically is
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   feeding us the stories and then the reverse of the story in
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   sequence.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   Maybe you could feed us the reverse of the story first and then
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   we wouldn't make, you know, have it upside down.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   I think they're doing this to me on purpose.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   We've got lots more to talk about, including CEO of the
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   decade, you know his name, I think, and lots more.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   But first, I do want to mention our friends at Go to meeting.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   The folks at Citrix do a wonderful job with their remote access.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   You know about, of course, Go to my PC.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   Go to assist.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   Go to meeting is a remote access product that lets you hold
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   your meetings online.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   Eliminate those boring conference calls, meet, you know, where
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   you are, even on the phone, but make it a visual experience.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   Nothing worse than a conference call where you can't show
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   something.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   You've got that spreadsheet in front of you.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   You're describing it.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   Maybe a picture, a chart, a graph, a PowerPoint, or a keynote
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   presentation.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   How frustrating is that?
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   Well, that's what Go to meeting is all about.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   If you go to Go to meeting, you could be like Don.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   You could do your screencast right there online in real time.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   Go to go to meeting.com/macbreak right now.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   And you can get Go to meeting for 30 days free.

[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   Let them see what Go to meeting can do.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   I have a feeling they're going to say, this is great.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   Mac and Tasha, as well as Windows support now, I think
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   that's one of the reasons they want to be on Mac break weekly to
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   remind you that yes, you can use this with a Mac and Tasha on
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   either end.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   Work so well, you're going to love it.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   128-bit encryption, easy to use, invite somebody to a meeting
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   just by giving them the meeting ID or sending them a link.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   And it's so easy to go to go to meeting.com if they've never
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   used it before.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   They'll get up and running in minutes.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   Try it free for 30 days.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   We thank them so much for their support of Mac break weekly.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   Steve Jobs is the CEO of the decade.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   It's pretty obvious.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   It's Fortune Magazine's slideshow that they, I hate it when
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   they do this.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   They do the 80 pictures.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   It's in its 80 page loads.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   But some of these pictures, if you looked at these of Steve from
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   Times Gone By are pretty fun.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   Yeah, you wonder how much help they must have gotten from Steve's
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   from very inside people to get access to those pictures.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   I haven't seen most of these pictures.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   Yeah, okay, I was going to ask you Andy.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   Yeah, they were not familiar to me.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   A decade of hits and a few misses.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   And then a great, I thought the Apple timeline that they did was
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   quite nice too.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   Yeah, I love that some of quotes they got from other people like
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   my favorite quote and the whole thing was probably from Larry
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   Ellison who's also mega super billionaire and also as in
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   Bluntchill in his own way as Steve Jobs is saying that, you
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   know, I have the, I'm satisfied with owning the best things in the
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   world.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   Steve Jobs isn't.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   He'd rather have nothing than nothing than have something that
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   he doesn't feel is the best thing that there should be.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   He was telling the story about how he used to visit Steve Jobs
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   and his mansion like years ago that had absolutely no furniture
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   in it.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   And Larry was convinced it was because he could not find any
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   furniture that he thought was good enough.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   He might rather live in an empty house than have furniture
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   that is in any way substandard.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   I love it.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   One of the photos is called Bear Essentials.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   I think I've seen that one before and it's just Steve Jobs sitting
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   in his living room in the single standard lamp and a mat on
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   the floor in a few books and that's it basically, you know,
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   talk about minimalistic.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   It's amazing.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   I'm looking, I'm looking to find the slide show so I could show
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   you some of it.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   They also have some sidebar stuff that's kind of fun,
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   famous people's favorite iPhone apps and, you know, Rachel Ray and
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   so forth.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   Pixar's.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   Well, hey, we should, we should have her on the show sometimes.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   I bet she's really into it.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   Don't you think she's like, she's like so into it.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   Well, okay.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   How about Neil Patrick Harris?
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   Actually, I should tell you, Rachel Ray's favorite iPhone app.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   Quarty.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   It's like having boggle in your iPhone.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   You just shake it and the letters scramble on your screen.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   Okay.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   She says it helps her past time in the backseat of a car.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   Neil Patrick Harris, Hitchcock.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   You create storyboards using photos from your camera.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   Now, I think we've talked about that on the show.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   That's pretty good.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   I'm pretty sure Alex Lendy recommend that all again.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   Yeah, I think so too.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   Bonnie Hammer, president of NBC Universal Cable.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   She says, "Bionic Eye."
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   Dana Delaney.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   Boy, they really scraped the bottom of the barrel on this one.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   Crossword puzzles.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   Oh, what, let's see.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   Wonder what T. Payne's favorite would be.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   Amateur Surgeon.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   You think it would be the T. Payne app?
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   Amateur Surgeon.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   All right.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   Let me see if I can find that.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   Where is that picture of Steve all along?
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   I've really seen Steve Jobs' on that first page underneath the timeline under the comments.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   Rarely seen Steve Jobs.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   There he is in front of the garage.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   Look at that.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   Wow.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   Is he 21 in that picture?
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   Or is that, it must have been, he went back later.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   Oh yeah, Jobs returned to the empty garage in '96.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   That's cool.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   There he is with Steve.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   Oh boy.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   I've never seen Steve wear a suit since then.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   Wasn't Jobs on an Apple one.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   That's a classic picture.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   Even those days looked a little bit like a porn star though.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   He looked like somebody.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   Don't you think, I mean maybe everybody looked that way.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   Did we all look that way in the 70s, I guess?
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   Leo, I'm going to look forward to working with whoever the new host of your network is next week.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   Leo's left?
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   No, Leo's left.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   Leo's gone.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   That was the same.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   He's not on his own accord.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   They carried him out on his ball.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   Here's a, looks like a lunch at Apple.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   An Apple board meeting.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   The first Mac Jobs and his team, they're working on the Apple Macintosh.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   That's very cool.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   Two years before it came out.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   That's a fun picture.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   Some of those people are still around.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   There he is.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   That's the one you were talking about.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Steve Jobs cross-legged.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   Looks like a lot, Aflodus.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   In his apartment, he's got a big Tiffany lamp.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   No furniture.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   A stereo with speakers that are actually huge.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   Look at the speakers.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   Oh, the experience in the background.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   I thought it was a door or a fridge.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   He replaced that with the...
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   Exactly with the iPod High-Fi.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   iPod High-Fi, yeah.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   That's the ones you threw out.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   That's 1982.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   Wow.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   That's Steve Jobs, all right.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   That must be where he couldn't find any decent furniture, so he just didn't have any.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   There he is with the same room it looks like with the Macintosh.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   He does have a laundry basket.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   We now know.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   Full of laundry.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   Well, that Jobs with story is about the freshness of his wardrobe.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   Oh, is that true?
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   Oh, he's going down together, Leo.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   (Laughter)
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   Anyway, would anybody contest that he is the CEO of the decade?
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   I think that's fair.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   Well, see, I don't know.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   We're talking about CEOs that are well-known enough to get that sort of a title.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   There are so many times when I meet somebody and I think I'm talking to this guy and having
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   a really entertaining conversation about whatever, the hors d'oeuvres or comic books or whatever.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   And then later on someone tells me, "Oh, wow, I can't believe that you're actually talking
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   to Bart Hammerstaz.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   Bart Hammerstaz?
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   He's worth $40 billion.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   He invented the letter L.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   Wow.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   Never heard of him.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   These are probably the CEOs of the decade.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   The people who have not just two or three companies to their credit.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   That's true.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   And also, you have to have a kind of proffsto who already did with the tech space.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   Say, first, go ahead, Will.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   Also, it seems to me that most of those companies that they're talking about in terms of the
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   top CEOs are in the tech space.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   So, Andy's right.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   There are lots of other companies that don't have the same kind of high-profile CEO of the year.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   But who would you pick?
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   Come on.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   I mean, all right.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   You're saying we just wouldn't know.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   There could be somebody better.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   Well, possibly.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.600]   But also, if you look at the amount of raw wealth created in the past decade, you have
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:24.600]   to say Google.
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:29.720]   Never has so much wealth been created so quickly.
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:32.440]   So you'd have to say, you know, Eric Schmidt would be right on that.
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:33.440]   Maybe.
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.600]   Maybe your math's a good point.
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:36.600]   That's a good point.
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:37.600]   But Jobs has done so much.
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:41.000]   Hey, do you guys ever read the mail online?
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   Is that considered a good paper in Britain?
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   No.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   Not in a nutshell.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   Okay.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   I think it's going to let you guys talk.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.720]   I sense a great discussion coming.
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:55.720]   I think this picture of the baby boy flashing the peace sign from the womb.
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:56.720]   That's pretty cool.
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:57.720]   She's sign?
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:58.720]   Okay.
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.720]   I'm not a peace sign, sir.
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:04.000]   Yeah, we could pull up peace sign out of here.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   All right.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   Just all right.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   It's really not an apple story.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   I'll put it this way.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.840]   Jeremy Kropklarsson flashed the peace sign at the United States police officer when the
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:12.840]   show was in town.
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:17.080]   But, well, he's just he's just gotten a free colonoscopy courtesy of the local because
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.080]   that was a good happen.
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:20.080]   There you go.
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:21.480]   Now, Andy, you're so cautious.
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:22.480]   You're so worried.
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:23.480]   Nothing's going to happen.
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:27.880]   I know that there's been this and the other thing.
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:28.880]   So.
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:30.440]   Also, no trousers and pants.
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:32.280]   I'm a world traveler, sir.
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:33.680]   Now we have been following.
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:40.280]   I'm sure the Verizon adroid campaign against AT&T and the coverage map campaign.
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.880]   AT&T has sued.
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:45.720]   We talked about this on Twitwill on Sunday.
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:46.720]   Indeed.
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:52.400]   There's a map for that, the ads and then the elves and all of these showing the bad coverage
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:53.400]   maps.
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:56.160]   AT&T says, well, first of all, it's not even an accurate coverage map.
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:00.040]   There are definitely blue dots somewhere there.
[00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:05.320]   Also, that Verizon isn't actually comparing the company's data networks.
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:10.000]   It restricts its comparison to 3G data because outside of 3G, Verizon doesn't have a network,
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:22.160]   but AT&T, in fact, does have Evdo, Evideo, Rev A as it's 3G in some areas and then migrated
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.600]   over to a faster 3G technology.
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:32.320]   So it has Rev A in some areas and Edge in other areas or B, I should say B in other areas.
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:39.200]   To me, the big danger that Verizon went through was just when they up the ante with that new
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:43.480]   holiday theme one where they get the puppets from the island of Misfit Toys and there's
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:47.880]   a hand held, there's a smartphone that's clearly supposed to be an iPhone that I originally
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:52.200]   marked as, oh, it's one of those really cheap stupid Verizon knockoff iPhones that they have
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.120]   that runs Windows Mobile.
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:59.160]   But now they're making the idea that the iPhone belongs on the island of Misfit Toys along
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:02.440]   with the Choo Choo train with the square wheels.
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:05.440]   And that's, wow, that's a bit of a reach.
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:11.600]   They definitely have a big asset in PR and saying that they have a much broader 3G network.
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:15.440]   So I've been using the Droid for a couple of weeks and I can definitely say that I get
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:19.760]   3G signals off the Droid far more often than I do on the iPhone here in New England.
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:20.760]   But there are nobody-
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:23.160]   I think nobody can test that really, right?
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:28.880]   Their big danger is making that a claim for specifically the phone as opposed to the network,
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:34.120]   because once you start saying anything on the Verizon network is going to be better than
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:40.200]   the iPhone on the AT&T network, okay, we now have to go to the flip chart and that's not
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.080]   going to look very good for Verizon.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:43.080]   Right.
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.080]   You guys are here.
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:48.320]   I find the whole thing really strange because in the UK, you're not allowed to do that kind
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:50.280]   of comparative marketing.
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:55.080]   You can't say on TV, this is better than this, even if you claim to have statistics.
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:58.920]   So it's unbelievable that, you know, sort of people go out there and really bash each
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:00.200]   other to this degree.
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:04.840]   See, that sounds so stereotypically British though.
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:07.440]   It's like, hello, we have a coffee mug.
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:09.720]   It's a new sort of coffee mug.
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:13.000]   We acknowledge there's other coffee mugs, but give us a try.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   It's not bad.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   It's quite a nice mug.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   In America, we can go after the other guy, you know.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.280]   Yeah, it's fine that with the BBC.
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:24.280]   We have a third call at the time, which is-
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:29.480]   Say again, we have a TV list, because in Colorado, you know, it's actually published
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:34.560]   by the BBC and they always, whenever it appears on TV, listing magazines are-
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:36.600]   You could take two other times.
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:38.320]   There is a choice.
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:39.800]   It's from BBC.
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:41.080]   You're breaking up on us, Don.
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:43.120]   I don't know if you're sinking your-
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:44.120]   You're-
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.480]   Oh, probably the most me as well.
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:50.160]   Damn that mobile made, damn you.
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:54.240]   Photoshop gains fixes from the Mac 10.6.2 update.
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:58.080]   So, you know, what the 10.62 takes away.
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:00.680]   It may give back if you're a Photoshop user.
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:07.200]   I guess some people were having application crashes when opening or saving files.
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.000]   Doc problems.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.480]   Images now open properly when dragged to the doc icon, including multiple selections of
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:15.120]   files taken from Safari.
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:22.720]   Some fixes particular to Photoshop CS4 include proper cursor display, more reliable editing.
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:23.720]   That's odd.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:28.480]   It would seem like those fixes belong on an Adobe update, not an Apple update.
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:36.400]   Are you- Are you- Are we blaming Apple for the problems on Photoshop CS4?
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.640]   Have you seen- Don, have you seen any of those problems?
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:41.880]   No, I'm not a big Photoshop user, to be honest.
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:46.520]   I tend to use Pixelmator and some of the other tools for whenever I do photos editing, because
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:49.560]   that's not really the thing that I do a lot.
[00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:50.560]   Right.
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:51.960]   I haven't really noticed any real problems.
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:52.960]   Yeah.
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.600]   I'm a bit of Pixelmator.
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:31:00.840]   It seems that it's just reading some of the new stories, that it's kind of stuff that
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:05.600]   was broken with Photoshop, which Apple has helped Adobe fix.
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:14.160]   So it's things like when you drag things from Photoshop to the doc, or when you're sort
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:19.840]   of trying to use Photoshop to expose a cursor display and that kind of thing, where basically
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:24.080]   sort of Adobe stuffed it up and Apple sort of came in and gone, "Okay, we can help you
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:30.440]   fix that since technically it kind of interacts with something that we do, so move away, real
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:31.640]   engineers coming through."
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:32.640]   Right.
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:35.000]   Give to Daddy.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.800]   Let's see.
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:44.120]   Well, there's one more story I want to talk about having to do with viruses before we get
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:46.320]   to that though.
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:52.160]   I would also like to talk about a little something from our friends at Carbonite.
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:54.800]   It's called Off-Sight Backup.
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:58.760]   I've talked about that before and how important that is in Carbonite.
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:00.080]   Makes it so easy to do.
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:06.120]   And again, this is a product like some others that we talk about that is now available on
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:07.120]   the Macintosh.
[00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:08.120]   It works great on Snow Leopard.
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:12.760]   It is a must-have and I highly recommend you give it a shot.
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:16.680]   If you've been using Time Machine all well and good, but if you're backing up to a local
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:18.800]   hard drive, what if the worst happens?
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:23.640]   What if there's a fire or a flood or somebody steals your gear and your backups are gone
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:24.800]   along with the originals?
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:26.640]   This is why Off-Sight is so important.
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:31.520]   Now, you could take a hard drive, plug it in, back up to it, swap it out, bring it to work
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:34.600]   with another one, go back and forth.
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:36.640]   But that's going to, you know, how often you're going to do that.
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:37.640]   There's going to be gaps.
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:40.640]   The beauty of Carbonite is you go there right now.
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:41.640]   You don't even need a credit card.
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:45.640]   You can install it for free at carbonite.com/offercode-twit.
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:47.680]   Use it for a couple of weeks.
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:52.560]   It'll start backing up immediately all of your irreplaceable files, your financial documents,
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:55.280]   your photos, your emails.
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:59.000]   Just going boom, boom, boom, boom, right up to the net.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.280]   And once those are all backed up, it automatically updates that.
[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:03.280]   And it's pretty quick.
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:05.920]   You know, the first backup, of course, because it's using your internet connection, they're
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:08.680]   very careful to not use up all your bandwidth.
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:11.040]   So the first backup takes a little while.
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:15.280]   But then once you're backed up, it's really quick to keep it up to date.
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:17.000]   And now you're just not at risk.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.480]   You can even get those files not only on the original computer, but anywhere you can log
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:23.000]   in to carbonite.com.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   Really useful for a laptop, because of course they get stolen.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.640]   About 13% of hard drives crash in their first year.
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:34.040]   43% of people, according to Harris Interactive, have lost files.
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:37.440]   They consider irreplaceable in any given year.
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:42.360]   600,000 laptops lost or stolen in the US airports every single year.
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.560]   These people need carbonite.
[00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:44.840]   And you do too.
[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:45.840]   Try it free for the next two weeks.
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.760]   You don't even need a credit card.
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:49.480]   Mac or PC works great with Snow Leopard.
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:52.200]   Go to carbonite.com.
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:54.240]   Use the offer code TWIT.
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:57.320]   And if you, now I have to explain this because it's a little complicated.
[00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:59.880]   Do the free trial first.
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:05.040]   Just set up the free trial, because if you do that, then when you sign up, even if it's
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:09.160]   a day or two later, you'll get two months free.
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:12.160]   So sign up for the free trial first with the offer code TWIT.
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:14.640]   And then, that's on the homepage.
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:18.160]   And then if you decide to stick around, and I know you will, you'll get two months free.
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:22.480]   By the way, very affordable, unlimited backup for less than $5 a month.
[00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:24.440]   It's $54.95 a year.

[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:34.440]   It's backup done right.
[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:37.160]   Thank you for their support.
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:43.880]   First this, this worm, it is apparently only affects jailbroken phones.
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:49.120]   F-Secure and others are reporting on the arrival of the first iPhone worm spreading in the
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:50.120]   wild.
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:51.280]   The worm is named I-Key.
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:54.840]   Apparently, that's, that's its author's name.
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:35:00.040]   And it only affects jailbroken iPhones, which have been modified to remove restrictions on
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:05.040]   what software can run on the device.
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:10.120]   The worm changes your iPhone's wallpaper to a picture of Rick Astley.
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:19.280]   Never gonna give you a message that goes across as I-Key is never gonna give you up.
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:22.320]   Never gonna give you a, so the key, Rick rolls your phone.
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.480]   I think it's actually pretty clever.
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:32.560]   The key is that the, the default password in SSH is Alpine.
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.200]   And everybody knows this.
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:37.760]   If you change your default password, if you've jailbroken your phone, just change the root
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:41.120]   password and you'll be fine.
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:42.520]   It's kind of a, kind of a big hole.
[00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:49.640]   Well, I'm kind of interested to know like, who is jailbreaking iPhones right now?
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:51.640]   Like what is the major application?
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:53.400]   I think a lot of people do.
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:56.320]   By the way, you have to install SSH.
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:00.280]   It does not come apparently by default, doesn't it?
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:01.280]   On the jail broke?
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:04.480]   You have to install, that's like step two or three in the process.
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:05.480]   Oh, okay.
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:06.480]   But it's part of the install, right?
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.480]   Yeah.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:11.120]   A lot of people are jailbreaking chiefly because it's the transition, it's the way that you
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:13.480]   crack the phone so you can make it sim independent.
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:15.480]   Oh, my God.
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.840]   It's been a long, as far as I know.
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:21.240]   Yeah, I think you're, I mean, you certainly, you have to be part, you have to make it
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:22.240]   silly.
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:23.240]   I'm sorry, Rick.
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:26.920]   People who see applications, they want to run, they want to run quick, for instance.
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:29.760]   And the only one you can run quick because Apple hasn't approved it for the store is
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.280]   by jailbreaking.
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:33.440]   My son, you know, and I jail broke our phones.
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:39.760]   It was kind of a father son bonding thing together, you know, come on, son, let's jailbreak
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:40.760]   our iPhones.
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:42.440]   Oh, isn't that cute?
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:46.200]   And I'm, and I have to say, I immediately regretted it because, you know, it just, it
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:47.200]   is, it's bonding with your child.
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.200]   Oh, let me.
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:49.200]   Yeah.
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:50.200]   And he wants money.
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:53.200]   No, I immediately regretted jailbreaking.
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:56.240]   The iPhone, because then it's just less stable, it seems to me.
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:59.960]   And, you know, I think your point is well taken will is that there's so many applications
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:02.000]   now available for the iPhone.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.880]   Do you really feel the need to jailbreak it?
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:05.880]   Yeah.
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:09.320]   I mean, when, if, when the iPhone first came out, I certainly jail broke mine because I
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:13.520]   wanted, you know, to be able to get all the cool applications that were coming out for
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:14.520]   it.
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:17.160]   I know I kind of feel like I can get those already now.
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:22.160]   Um, well, I guess, I guess if you jailbreak your phone, is it possible to pirate the official
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:24.520]   applications, then you don't have to pay for the night.
[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:29.600]   No, no, you still have to, well, I don't know, Andy, you're the pirate here.
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:33.600]   No, I don't look that I will let that pass.
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:35.480]   I don't think so.
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:40.240]   I don't know if anyone who successfully cracked apps from the iTunes store, for God's sake,
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:43.360]   these things with 99 cents, 299 free.
[00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:49.840]   I don't say, and there's the firm from what little I know of how these apps are protected.
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:56.920]   It would be a sufficiently non-trivial exercise that your, your, your efforts are better applied
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:59.200]   towards feats of super villainry.
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:02.600]   You could either control the weather or you get a free copy of that fart application.
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:06.160]   And you'd much rather put that same amount of research and creating it satellite that
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:07.160]   controls the weather.
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.160]   Yeah.
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:13.400]   Now, a number of people are saying in the chatroom that in fact there are a lot of places you
[00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:19.040]   can find cracked iPhone apps, the legit apps that would then work on a jailbroken phone.
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:23.560]   In fact, somebody's saying that Beehive, which is the IM program, claims that 80% of
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:27.160]   its users are using illegally cracked copies.
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:32.240]   So I guess if it's a popular application, somebody has taken it, cracked it in some way
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:37.440]   and put it on a repository that you can then get if you have a jailbroken iPhone.
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:40.640]   We are honest members of the community did not know about this.
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:46.560]   And the last time I took a look at it was nine or 10 months ago.
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:50.680]   And I, I, I, I spoke to some people who had tried it and they are sort of in the, so
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:55.240]   if I, if I say they're in the business of finding out how to circumvent certain things
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:59.160]   and two different people told me that they had looked at it and they recognize certain
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:02.560]   technologies that immediately tells them this is not going to be worth my effort.
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:03.560]   Yeah.
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:06.720]   Sort of like if you're trying to break into a safe and you, you, you, you, you crack through
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:09.880]   the cinder blocks around the vault and then you hit two inches of steel and you realize
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:14.360]   that, okay, this is going to be a lot more work than I want to go through to get $15,000
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:15.360]   in payroll.
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:20.200]   So we're, we're going to get a modem instead and start siphoning off ATM numbers.
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:24.880]   And of course tethering somebody pointed out there's a, if you wanted to do tethering.
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:27.400]   I'm not sure the tethering, does tethering still work?
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:29.080]   If you crack it, if you had jailbreak it.
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:30.080]   Yeah.
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:31.080]   Okay.
[00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:34.440]   I thought, because I thought they, I thought they fixed that weird little, yeah, the simple
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:37.320]   one that didn't require a jailbreak and broken iPhone just had a separate profile.
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:38.840]   I think they fixed that one.
[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:42.920]   But I think if you, if you, if you jailbreak the iPhone, you can, you could still tether
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:44.680]   and somebody's telling you.
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:45.680]   Go ahead.
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:46.680]   Sorry.
[00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:49.480]   The other thing I, I jailbreak my fast, got one phone that I keep jailbroken and that's
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:55.440]   really just to use the demo pod, which is the application that allows you to screen capture
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:59.360]   on the iPhone and capture it to the back desktop to do, you know, screencast.
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:02.880]   And they use that, that uses that quite a few times now when I've been doing screencasts
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:03.880]   for iPhone applications.
[00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:04.880]   Okay.
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:08.960]   And it's the only way, really until that will, you know, open up the API that we can actually
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:10.520]   get real video off the phone.
[00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:11.520]   Yeah.
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:12.520]   That was a pick of mine.
[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:13.680]   Some months ago demo guard.
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:14.680]   Right.
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:18.880]   And, and that's the reason is, is the only way you can do screencast as you point out,
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:19.880]   done.
[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:20.880]   Yeah.
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:21.880]   So that's a good reason.
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:23.720]   There we've come up with some good reasons to jailbreak.
[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:25.600]   By the way, quick apparently is not one of them.
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:26.600]   It is now available.
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:30.280]   I didn't realize I guess once Apple put out the three GS with video capability, it made
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:32.400]   sense to have quick.
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:34.400]   So they allowed it.
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:40.400]   Now, let's not, now that we have like multiple people who have lots of experience with the
[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:43.720]   Android, you bought, you buy yourself an Android phone.
[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:44.720]   It has not arrived.
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:45.720]   It arrives today.
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:46.720]   Not yet.
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:47.720]   Okay.
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:48.720]   The Droid phone arrives today.
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:53.680]   And I did it because of you, you, it's your fault Andy because Andy wrote a very good,
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:56.600]   I thought review in the Chicago Sun times.
[00:40:56.600 --> 00:41:01.360]   And while you didn't say it's better than the iPhone, I think your conclusion is it's
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:03.840]   the best, you know, it's the next best thing.
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:06.400]   And certainly if you're on Verizon, it's the phone to get, right?
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:07.400]   Yeah.
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:13.760]   The key line that I sort of kept looking at in my window and reconsidering and reconsidering
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:18.760]   and then deciding that no, I'm going to back this statement is that the Droid is as good
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:19.760]   as an iPhone.
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:24.680]   It's not as good for every user and it's not as good at everything, but this reverse is
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:27.040]   true when you compare the iPhone to the Droid.
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:29.920]   I think it's absolutely in the exact same class.
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:32.080]   It depends on what your priorities are.
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:38.360]   And yes, if you don't like the AT&T network or if the AT&T network is not very good where
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:43.880]   you happen to work and live, I think that you could get a Verizon Droid if that network
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:47.720]   works better for you in that area and be very, very happy with it.
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:54.520]   The difficulty is that this is why that I try to spend as much time and deep immersion
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:58.160]   on these products as I can because I didn't like it on the first day.
[00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:00.960]   On the second day, I knew my way around a little bit better.
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:04.960]   By the third and fourth day, I was completely used to the way the Droid and the Android
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:06.680]   2.0 operating system work.
[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:11.040]   I still don't think it's as polished or as slick or as simple as the iPhone.
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:14.560]   But the fact of the matter is that I stopped cursing it after two or three days and started
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:17.480]   to simply accept that this is the way that it works.
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:20.160]   That sounds like a defeatist attitude.
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:23.800]   So, well, I guess life is not going to get any better than this.
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:27.160]   So I may as well just pray for death, sweet release of death.
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:28.920]   It was a fine experience.
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:32.240]   The very first day it impressed me enough that I decided that, you know what, I'm going to
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:34.360]   leave the iPhone in my pocket.
[00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:37.440]   I'm going to just use the iPhone for incoming phone calls and incoming texts.
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:42.440]   I'm going to use the Droid for everything else and I'm a super heavy iPhone user.
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:46.640]   And I found that again, after two or three days after downloading all the extra stuff
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:51.040]   you need to download and need in order to give it parity with what you get from the iPhone
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:54.040]   out of the box, I was very, very comfortable with it.
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:56.560]   That's the thing I'm going to have to find an article that says, "What do you need to
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:57.560]   download?"
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:04.560]   There's a series of articles on Apple Insider comparing iPhone and Droid, the core platforms,
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:07.560]   business models and things like that, which I think is certainly something to read.
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:10.760]   But I need to find an article that says, "If you want to duplicate functionality that
[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:14.280]   you have on the iPhone, here's what you need to download on the Droid."
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:16.760]   I have to say the screen though is better than the iPhone screen.
[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:17.960]   I mean, that's pretty obvious, right?
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:19.640]   Well, it depends on how you go about it.
[00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:21.120]   It's super high resolution.
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:23.480]   Yeah, it is almost scary.
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:28.120]   If you're visiting a website and you see that little sort of blurb of copyright text at
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:31.400]   the bottom that you're not really meant to read, on the iPhone you can sort of make
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:32.400]   it out.
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.600]   On the Droid, you can make out every single letter.
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:37.520]   It's about almost twice the resolution of the screen.
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:41.680]   The difficulty though is that the Android operating system doesn't have anywhere near
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:47.120]   the amount of sophistication that the iPhone OS has in simply rendering fonts.
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:53.040]   I'm convinced that the iPhone OS, when you get fonts that are of certain whites and certain
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:57.940]   sizes, it says, "Here are tricks that we know how to render a font this size on this
[00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:00.720]   screen and still make it readable."
[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:04.940]   One problem that I was having consistently with the Android was, "I love how crisp and
[00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:09.920]   detailed these letters are, but I wish there was a way to turn it from whatever line weight
[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:15.040]   it was to a semi-bolt because the dots were so small and the uprights and the lines of
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:19.560]   the strokes of the characters were so thin that oftentimes they would just simply almost
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:21.560]   disappear into the whiteness of the background."
[00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:26.280]   I can't wait to see though, the first generation of Droid specific and ultra high resolution
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:30.120]   specific apps that are designed to take advantage of that kind of resolution.
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:33.920]   I don't think they're quite there yet, but it's a magnificent display.
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:39.080]   You're talking more than four times the number of pixels.
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:42.000]   It's 800 and something by 400 and something I believe.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.960]   854 by 480.
[00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:44.960]   Yeah.
[00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:49.160]   That's 273% larger than the iPhones 320 by 480.
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:50.160]   Right.
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:53.360]   So you can actually run an iPhone emulator in a window on that screen and still have
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:54.840]   three quarters of the screen left.
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:45:00.960]   Yeah, 410 megapixels compared to 150 megapixels on the iPhone.
[00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:01.960]   It is a significant difference.
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:07.480]   Actually, PC Magazine's got a great article and we'll put this in the show notes.
[00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:11.280]   Comparing side by side the phones.
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:14.520]   And you really can see the difference.
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:18.800]   Although I have to say that while it's higher resolution looks a little more yellow, maybe
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:20.640]   that's just the way they took the…
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:21.640]   I don't know.
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:22.640]   I wouldn't say that.
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:26.880]   When you put the screens at maximum brightness, the only difference I could really tell is
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:31.560]   that you can get the iPhone brighter than the Android screen, but you almost never just
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:34.280]   simply blow it up to maximum.
[00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:37.760]   You're always using automatic brightness on the screen.
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:44.600]   I didn't notice…I think that the color fidelity is better on the iPhone, not so much
[00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:46.600]   that you would be looking at photos and cursing.
[00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:47.600]   Oh geez.
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:48.600]   Well, it's the droid.
[00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:51.000]   So obviously there's going to be a greenish cast and everything.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.240]   No, if you put them side by side, you'll definitely notice an improvement, but you wouldn't necessarily
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:58.920]   be cursing the screen if all you had was a droid in front of you.
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:45:59.920]   Right.
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:04.000]   A little surprise though that video and photos didn't…the extra detail doesn't make it
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   quite so apparent.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:10.280]   I don't know if the standard image viewer that comes with the droid is a leftover from
[00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:17.360]   the old OS and it's simply down samples the photo to whatever the standard size of the
[00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:20.160]   original Google G1 phone was or something like that.
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:27.160]   I was expecting to see, instead of necessarily scaling the photo to fit the screen, I would
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:29.480]   see a lot more resolution and a lot more detail.
[00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:33.120]   Maybe it's just because the color fidelity is so much better on the iPhone screen than
[00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:36.840]   on the droid screen, but I really didn't notice those extra pixels when I'm looking
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:38.480]   at photos and watching video.
[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:39.480]   Yeah.
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:40.480]   It's interesting.
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:48.040]   In fact, the PC Magazine head-to-head and video, the iPhone looks better, considerably
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:51.760]   better than the droid, which is for YouTube video.
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:52.760]   That's odd.
[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:55.640]   Yeah, I'd say so too.
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:47:00.800]   But the important takeaway from that is this is the first Android phone that can truly
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:02.960]   keep up with video.
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:09.080]   One of my biggest problems with the G1 phone is that you truly had to burn yourself a
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:13.560]   version of this MP4 that would plague within the bandwidth limitations of the phone.
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:19.080]   I was taking the same full resolution DVD rips that I'd dump onto my iPhone, dumping
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:22.320]   them onto the Android and they were playing just fine.
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:26.680]   With the added advantage that I didn't have to import them into an iTunes library before
[00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:31.240]   I did, I just mounted as a mass storage USB device, drag it onto the device and there
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:32.240]   we go.
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:33.240]   I like that.
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:34.240]   I like that.
[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:35.240]   I don't like that.
[00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:36.240]   Yeah.
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:42.800]   Somebody in the chat room is asking a legitimate, I think a legitimate question, which is, so
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:45.360]   the Palm pre everybody said was going to be the iPhone killer.
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:47.360]   It didn't take off.
[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:52.160]   Do you think that this can compete against the iPhone better than the pre did?
[00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:53.320]   Well, the pre wasn't.
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:57.960]   Well, in the sense that it is actually competing against the iPhone, the pre is competing against
[00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:00.760]   whatever phone you bought your grandma three years ago.
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:07.000]   I just think the pre had a couple of really nice ideas about how it manages multiple
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   applications.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.880]   I do like the card interface for managing multiple applications made it very quickly
[00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:16.520]   easy to just jump from your web browser down to the application that you're using to track
[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:19.600]   your flight status when you're waiting at the airport and then Mac again.
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:21.000]   But it didn't come to play.
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.600]   It was not a serious phone anyway.
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:24.840]   I thought it absolutely sucked.
[00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:28.360]   Well, I think your judgment was proven accurate.
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:31.520]   I liked it a little bit better than you, but nobody else seems to want it.
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:33.360]   Did you ever get used to the keyboard on the pre?
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:34.360]   I didn't have it.
[00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:38.080]   I only had a week and my concern is that getting used to the keyboard and the droid, it does
[00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:41.320]   not look like a very usable keyboard.
[00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:46.920]   I'm very much on record as saying that virtual keyboards are way better on mobile phones.
[00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:48.320]   You're starting to think that.
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:52.560]   I can type so much faster on an iPhone keyboard than on any virtual keyboard.
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:56.800]   I can also certainly type much faster on the droids virtual keyboard, especially with
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:49:00.480]   the faster processor they have on the droid now than on its real keyboard.
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:08.000]   I also handed it off to two or three existing phone users who hate the virtual keyboards
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.800]   as much as I hate the real ones, including one or two who are long time Google G1 phone
[00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:15.800]   users and none of them like that the keyboard.
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:19.300]   The reason why people like those keyboards instead of the virtual ones is that you have
[00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:24.800]   raised bumps you can actually orientate underneath your thumbs and you feel like a very good
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:27.760]   solid tactile feedback when you click down on them.
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:33.520]   Unfortunately, the droid keyboard is almost completely flat.
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:39.280]   It's very undifferentiated and also you don't get much feedback when you push down on them.
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:44.420]   I didn't get anybody who thought that this was a very good keyboard at all.
[00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:49.040]   One last story before we get to your picks of the week, the mini display port standard
[00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:51.720]   has been approved by Visa.
[00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:53.280]   This is very good news.
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:57.800]   I really like the mini display port I have to say.
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:50:02.440]   And Visa today announced it is officially issued specifications as part of the Display
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:07.000]   port 1.1A standard for the mini Display port connector developed by Apple and implemented
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:13.280]   on its Macs since October 2008 with the introduction of the 24 inch LED cinema display and the
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:16.740]   new MacBooks and MacBook Pros.
[00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:22.060]   Actually Apple had been offering this as a no fee license in order to encourage adoption.
[00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:24.100]   But good news that Visa has adopted it.
[00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:27.140]   I just got a new Dell laptop that has a full display port on it.
[00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:30.500]   We're starting to see Display port everywhere.
[00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:31.500]   And I think that's a good move.
[00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:35.740]   I think that's a really great standard.
[00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:36.740]   Now on to light peak.
[00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:39.580]   You can just get that on the nice.
[00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:46.080]   Do you think we're ever going to see an HDMI port on a notebook or on any sort of a Mac?
[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:47.920]   No, no, no.
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:48.920]   Why not?
[00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:58.040]   Well, because for the same reason that you see very few HDMI ports on PCs in fact, which
[00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:04.360]   is the HDMI is a standard which is only which has to be licensed for an approximate sum of
[00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:06.280]   about $2 per unit.
[00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:07.780]   Too expensive.
[00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:08.780]   Which is too expensive.
[00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:14.000]   And the mass market, Intel created was part of the consortium that created display port
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:19.880]   with the idea that it would be entirely pin to pin compatible, but requiring no license
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:20.880]   fee.
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:22.320]   So it's very cheap to get a display port.
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:26.160]   So HDMI for computers is dead on arrival.
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:27.160]   Yeah.
[00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:29.360]   It wasn't even, you know.
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:31.360]   So we won't see it on any Apple kit.
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:35.160]   Apple will be display port and probably mini display port all the way.
[00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:36.160]   Right.
[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:42.100]   So it's the prospect of, you know, could we get a mini display port in the next iPhone?
[00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:45.020]   Oh, how cool would that be?
[00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:47.420]   Certainly in the tablet, you can do that.
[00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:48.420]   Yeah.
[00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:52.420]   I'm not sure if Apple would allow, I think it wouldn't be how cool would it be or what
[00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:53.420]   they could do with it.
[00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:58.060]   It would be, yeah, but do we really want to put another opening in that really beautiful
[00:51:58.060 --> 00:51:59.860]   curved case we've designed?
[00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:00.860]   No buttons.
[00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:02.860]   We're trying to take them out, not add more.
[00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:04.460]   No, I'm always surprised to hear.
[00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:10.760]   He would say that though, because I understand the point about how you can buy a cheap just
[00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:15.720]   wire crossover cable and get HDMI on what you've already got.
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:21.160]   But as it happens over the past week or so, I've been, I'm preparing a piece on good,
[00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:23.440]   cheap Windows notebooks.
[00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:27.480]   And I've been getting in nothing but notebooks that cost less than 600 bucks, some of the
[00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:29.080]   cost less than 500 bucks.
[00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:31.280]   And all of them have HDMI built into it.
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:32.280]   Really?
[00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:33.280]   Yeah.
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:36.020]   It's a cool feature because you can plug it right into your HDTV.
[00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:39.600]   A lot of people, I think are going to be using that as their, hey, look, I've got a free
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:44.840]   external monitor for showing off videos for showing off Hulu and Netflix stuff.
[00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:48.040]   But again, for just 25 bucks, you can buy a simple crossover.
[00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:49.640]   I don't see it as a big issue.
[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:50.640]   Right.
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:54.960]   All right, we're going to get to our picks of the week here in just a second.
[00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:57.560]   I didn't warn you, Don and Will, but you've been on enough.
[00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:02.720]   I think you probably know that in just a moment, you will be put upon to pick something
[00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:08.240]   wonderful that everyone will love and rave about and say, man, you got to get those guys
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:09.240]   on more.
[00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:11.440]   But there's no pressure.
[00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:12.440]   No pressure.
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:13.440]   No pressure.
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:16.840]   Right now though, I do want to mention our friends at audible.com, the great place to
[00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:22.520]   get online books at great prices and man with a selection, 65,000 and growing all the
[00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:28.680]   time books in every category, fiction and nonfiction, history.
[00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:30.720]   I love listening to history on audible.com.
[00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:31.720]   It just comes a life.
[00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:37.480]   But of course, novels are great too because it's like watching a movie in your head, in
[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:38.480]   your brain.
[00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:46.120]   Now that I got that nice Ford sink in my new car, I get in the car with my iPod and it's
[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:49.520]   Bluetooth is attached to the car and it just starts playing the book.
[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:51.440]   And when I get out of the car, the book stops.
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:52.800]   And it's just, it's wonderful.
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:57.160]   It's just like having somebody, I mean, it's just, it is wonderful.
[00:53:57.160 --> 00:54:00.280]   A lot of good picks on audible.com as always.
[00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:03.400]   I'm just looking and there's always new stuff.
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:10.280]   But Andy, I'm running out of, I only have a few minutes left in easy riders raging bulls.
[00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:14.680]   The great story of the movie industry in the 70s that you recommended a few took me about
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:15.600]   a month to read.
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:19.360]   So please, Andy, give me, give me another book, please.
[00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:25.080]   Well, this is a book that I actually downloaded just about just about three hours ago because
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:29.880]   I finished my last audio book and I needed new new worlds left to conquer.
[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:36.040]   I've got one problem in front of me because fire, I've been clicking on the wonderful wishlist
[00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:37.400]   button here in audible.com.
[00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:38.400]   Hang on.
[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:40.480]   Everybody goes to audible when we start talking about it.
[00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:43.440]   We tried to bring it back up.
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:46.600]   It's a huge biography of Sammy Davis Jr.
[00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:52.720]   Oh, that got me, that got me truly interested because there are so many of these musicians
[00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:56.440]   particularly where you learn about.
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:57.440]   Oh, I know.
[00:54:57.440 --> 00:54:59.160]   In black and white, the life of Sammy Davis Jr.
[00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:00.160]   Yes.
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:05.480]   You learn about them pretty much not as they actually are, but as the characters that they
[00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:07.840]   portray in real life.
[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:13.280]   So many people don't really know what Elvis sounds like because they're used to serving
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:15.200]   Elvis impersonators.
[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:23.080]   Sammy Davis Jr. had one hell of an interesting life of personal problems, desire to desire
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:26.280]   for affection, desire for acceptance more than anything else.
[00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:34.560]   Meanwhile navigating the scope of a 60, 70, 80 year career in show business that spanned
[00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:40.800]   times when people of color would have incredible, how do we basically be on a parallel career
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:41.800]   track?
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:45.000]   Sinatra would say the most racist things about Sammy Davis.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:50.360]   It just blew me away and he would always accept it and smile and then blow him away with his
[00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:51.960]   dancing and singing.
[00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:54.920]   Well, that's another interesting thing about both guys.
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:59.240]   Sinatra was that that was part of the game that was part of the rapport and part of the
[00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:00.840]   joking that they had around.
[00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:04.560]   Sinatra actually stuck up for non-white performers quite a bit.
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:08.320]   He was notorious for saying, "Oh, well, you're saying the part of my band can't stay in the
[00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:09.320]   same hotel?"
[00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:10.320]   Okay, great.
[00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:11.320]   We just won't stay in your hotel for your show.
[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:12.320]   Good.
[00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:13.320]   Very good.
[00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:14.880]   But isn't it interesting to think about.
[00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:20.440]   If you see some of these uncut performances of the full Radpack in Vegas, there are so
[00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:23.560]   many bits that they do with Sammy that sound so racist.
[00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:24.560]   Did you know?
[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:27.200]   It sounded like they absolutely would not play.
[00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:30.840]   What I'm really curious to know is not only where that talent came from because he was
[00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:32.720]   one phenomenal performer.
[00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:33.720]   Amazing.
[00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:36.920]   But also, what was going through his head when that was going on?
[00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:37.920]   Was it this is part of the...
[00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:42.600]   Hey, I can't believe I get to actually be part of a performance with Sinatra and Dean
[00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:46.720]   Martin, part of the hippest most popular crowd out there.
[00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:47.720]   This is just the price.
[00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:53.320]   Or was it just, "Hey, we make fun of Dean Martin's nose job and we make fun of Sinatra's mob
[00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:54.320]   connections?
[00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:56.560]   This is part of being part of a group."
[00:56:56.560 --> 00:57:00.000]   So it's a very detailed biography.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:03.760]   The biographies are just fun, trashy reads, and those are fine too.
[00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:08.000]   But then they're the ones where they try to truly document a life from every perspective
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.640]   and every era that this person went through.
[00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:14.400]   And the reviews of this book make me think that this is that second kind of a book that
[00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:17.640]   I'll learn something about this guy that I didn't know before.
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:21.160]   And he's tops on my playlist category after category.
[00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:25.040]   And I really want to know the story of where he got all that stuff from.
[00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:26.040]   Yeah.
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:27.040]   Oh, this is going to be great.
[00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:29.360]   And it's long, 23 hours, 47 minutes.
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:33.320]   Now normally that'd be almost $48 to buy this book.
[00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:37.120]   But you can get it absolutely free by going to audible.com/macbreak.
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.120]   It is...

[00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:23.880]   We thank them so much for their support of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:25.760]   Let's start with Don, Don McAllister.
[00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:32.400]   It's great to have you for ScreenCasts online and all the way from Liverpool.
[00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:33.400]   Indeed.
[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:36.360]   Let's hear your pick of the week.
[00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:37.360]   Right.
[00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:39.440]   Okay, I'm going to support UK developer here.
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:43.200]   I'm going to pick a problem that only came out of the day to watch.
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:47.320]   It's one of those products that I so downloaded, tried and bought within 10 minutes.
[00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:49.800]   It's a really, really useful product.
[00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:53.600]   I don't know if you had the same problem to me when you're doing a presentation or putting
[00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:58.360]   together a keynote or if you're even familiar with just looking for images for my screen
[00:58:58.360 --> 00:58:59.360]   casts.
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:02.560]   I tend to spend quite a lot of money on stock photos.
[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:07.760]   And that's because I know there are tons of photos in Flickr that have greater common
[00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:10.240]   licenses, but it's such a pain to set things in Flickr.
[00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:11.920]   It's really fine.
[00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:17.120]   So Francis Beers, who did the Flickr Equator, so he's a guy who really knows Flickr API,
[00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:22.400]   has developed an application called Viewfinder, which is a very simple, very elegant application
[00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:27.960]   that really just do your interface in Flickr to allow you to search for all sorts of images
[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:32.720]   and sorts of different licenses and then you just download them with a single click.
[00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:37.000]   It's a beautiful, really simple application, but well together and it does the job like
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:38.000]   it's supposed to.
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:43.240]   So if you're looking for images for presentations, you find it with just Find Point Straight Away.
[00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:44.400]   Alright, Viewfinder.
[00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:49.800]   Now, it's, say I only came out a couple of days ago, and I think he's pricing it to,
[00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:54.960]   it has 15 pounds for the first version and it's going up to 18 pounds when it's going
[00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:55.960]   on ships.
[00:59:55.960 --> 01:00:01.480]   But if you do any sorts of presentation, if you're involved with searching for any images,
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:04.080]   it's a great applicant to go and flip and pull things out.
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:09.160]   The nice thing is as well, it also brings out the attribution, so you know a lot of these
[01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:13.560]   common licenses, as well as downloading it, it will actually pull it across and also pull
[01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:17.120]   across the contributions as well so you can paste them into a caption so you can keep
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:23.320]   being onboard with what the original photographer or image creator wanted to do with the particular
[01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:24.320]   image.
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:28.400]   I know I knew the name ConnectedFlow.com and the developer and of course he's the guy who
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:31.440]   did the Flickr exporter for iPhoto.
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:35.040]   Yeah, iPhoto and for iPhoto as well.
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:39.240]   I've been using that for years, it's a really great application.
[01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:44.680]   So this is a very simple search term and then you can click on some tabs to say whether
[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:48.640]   you want a correct of commons license or commercial, you're so creative.
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:53.160]   And then once you have your results, you can sort them by relevance or interest or date.
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:56.440]   And then also size as well, so you can just filter down and see the large images and
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:01.840]   that's a good screen just on there, it's a very simple, very easy to interface.
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:06.000]   But if you've had any problems finding images in the past, this will solve the problems
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000]   very, very quickly.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   Good, Don.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:16.000]   It's again, viewfinderfromconnectedflow.com really looks neat.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.720]   Yeah, Don's a great resource.
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:23.280]   When I was, we were on the Macmamian 9, I had desperately needed a screen capture utility.
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:27.160]   You walked by, we were in Nagasaki or maybe it was in there.
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:29.680]   Yeah, and I was in Japan somewhere.
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:35.280]   Anyway, you walked by and I said, Don, quick, I need a screen capture application.
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:36.840]   I'm sitting on the curb borrowing Wi-Fi.
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:40.640]   He says, oh, yeah, I forgot what it was, but it was great.
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:41.640]   Download this.
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:44.080]   Oh, that was from the rocket with the guys, wasn't it?
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:46.960]   That was the capture utility of the rocket.
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:47.960]   It'll come to me.
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:48.960]   It's on my heart.
[01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:49.960]   I'll search for it.
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:50.960]   Little snapper.
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:51.960]   That's it, little snapper.
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:52.960]   I love this.
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:53.960]   I'm not trying.
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:56.080]   I apologize for Don's connection.
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:00.800]   Sometimes with a call to Great Britain, it's worse in the day, I think.
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:03.200]   Maybe it's because I have two of you.
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:08.360]   I'm using up all of the connection to Great Britain between Great Britain and the US.
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:13.520]   Let's see if we can get something better connection-wise out of our friend, Mr. Will
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:14.520]   Harris.
[01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:16.280]   Will, what's your pick of the week?
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:22.080]   Well, I have a pick, and I also have, perhaps slightly cheekily, a request of the week.
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:23.760]   Oh, no, it's not cheeky.
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:24.760]   Go ahead.
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:25.760]   We expect cheeky.
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:26.760]   Yeah.
[01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:31.200]   So my pick of the week, and I don't think I've heard anybody recommend this on the show
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:33.400]   before, is an iPhone game.
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:40.240]   Because I spend a lot of my time commuting, and so I get quite into my iPhone games,
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:41.240]   it's called Cannibalt.
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:43.960]   I don't know that one.
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:44.960]   Okay.
[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:45.960]   Well, that's great.
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:51.240]   It's called Cannibalt, C-A-N-A-B-A-L-T.
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:55.160]   And it's absolutely amazingly simple and fun.
[01:02:55.160 --> 01:03:01.360]   The premise is you are in a city, and the city is collapsing around you, and you have
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:02.840]   to escape.
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:05.200]   It's a linear platformer.
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:07.800]   In fact, it's- Oh, I love platformers.
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:13.280]   It's an iPhone version of the online game, so Leo's got it on the stream here, and it's
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:14.280]   fantastic.
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:15.720]   It's really simple.
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:17.960]   You just press the screen to jump.
[01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:18.960]   That's it.
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:19.960]   That's all you do.
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:26.360]   You press the screen and you jump, but you will spend hours and hours and hours on it.
[01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:27.360]   I love platformers.
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:29.600]   I haven't seen one of these in a long time.
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:31.600]   Oh, you're moving fast, too.
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:32.600]   Holy cow.
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:36.240]   And the longer you- The longer that you're running and that you're jumping without hidden
[01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:43.160]   obstruction, the faster you go, so the quicker you can make the jumps, the really awkward
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:45.480]   jumps through glass plate windows.
[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:47.560]   The music is fantastic.
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:52.960]   It's such an- You can just play it for hours, hours, hours, and nonstop, and I have done.
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:56.200]   I've so far managed to get just over 10 kilometers.
[01:03:56.200 --> 01:04:00.360]   So if anybody wants to see if they can beat that.
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:04.000]   So the iPhone game is just an iPhone version of this game.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000]   Yes.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000]   Oh, it's so much fun.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000]   I'm sorry, guys.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.920]   It's just a tap screen to jump.
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:10.320]   Break time is over, Mac break is over.
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:12.840]   Okay, I'm going to play this game now.
[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:13.840]   Yeah.
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:14.840]   So that's it.
[01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:17.560]   And the shaking is like an earthquake or what's going on here?
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:18.560]   Yeah.
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:20.920]   So as you get through the level, you'll see ships go overhead.
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:21.920]   You can see us.
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:22.920]   You can see us.
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:23.920]   You can see us.
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:24.920]   You can see us.
[01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:25.920]   Mine's drop on you.
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:26.920]   It's really fantastic.
[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:28.920]   It looks like a video game.
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:29.920]   It looks like a video game.
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:31.120]   It's a secret parkour.
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:32.600]   It's like parkour, isn't it?
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:33.600]   Yeah.
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:34.600]   I like the parkour guy.
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:35.600]   But it gets hard.
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:38.600]   I don't understand how I get through the window over here.
[01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:39.600]   I'm going to skit you.
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:40.600]   There you go.
[01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:41.600]   How do I get through that?
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:42.600]   A little bit too early.
[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:43.600]   Oh, you got to break it.
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:44.600]   Yeah.
[01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:46.840]   And also, if you hit the boxes, you slow down.
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:47.840]   So that's good.
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:48.840]   I don't mind slowing down.
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:51.080]   Sometimes you can tactically slow down.
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:53.720]   So you can jump over those boxes.
[01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:58.160]   And on the iPhone, you can hold down your jump for a certain amount of time to get different
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:00.520]   sizes and lengths of jump.
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:05.360]   It gets quite tricky.
[01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:07.480]   Wow, this is fun.
[01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:09.280]   And how much is it on the iPhone?
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:11.400]   It's like 50p or something.
[01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:13.240]   50p, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:14.240]   Like no money.
[01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:15.240]   Great, Vic.
[01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:19.240]   Annie and I go, by the way, that's catapult C-A-T-A-P.
[01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:20.240]   And a catapult.
[01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:21.240]   Okay.
[01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:22.240]   C-A-N-A-B-A-L-T.
[01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:24.240]   That's exactly right.
[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:25.240]   Kind of bolt.
[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:28.240]   Can I put my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my,
[01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:29.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:30.240]   What's your cheeky request?
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:31.240]   Yeah.
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:32.240]   Yeah.
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:33.240]   Yeah.
[01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:36.600]   Which is that I am desperate on the Mac for a personal finance app.
[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:38.880]   I understand in the US, you guys have mint.
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:39.880]   Oh, you don't have mint?
[01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:40.880]   I was going to say, yeah.
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:41.880]   It doesn't.
[01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:42.880]   It doesn't.
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:46.960]   So I've so through, so far, been through squirrel, which is buggy and doesn't work.
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:50.280]   I bank, which is ugly and doesn't really work.
[01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:54.760]   Cha-ching, which didn't work to the extent that the beta expired and took all my financial
[01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:55.760]   data with it.
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:57.240]   Oh, that's not good.
[01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:58.240]   Which is not cool.
[01:05:58.240 --> 01:05:59.240]   Yeah.
[01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:02.080]   So I'm on the lookout for a good personal finance app.
[01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:07.960]   So if anybody has got one or knows one or seen one in beta, if they can drop me a line
[01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:13.920]   on Twitter at Will Harris, I would be, or rather, you know, my accountant would be very pleased.
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:18.160]   WILL, Will Harris, I think we'd all be pleased.
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:23.520]   That's one, that's one thing where quick and really was dominant on the PC in the PC world.
[01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:28.520]   And then, and then Microsoft money and money's now gone out of business because quick and
[01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:31.400]   is so dominant, but mint in the States.
[01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:34.360]   And of course, into it has bought mint now.
[01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:35.360]   Just fantastic.
[01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:38.760]   It really, it obviates the need for any of that.
[01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:41.880]   And it has a great iPhone interface.
[01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:46.360]   I, you know, I pull it up all the time just to see what my net worth is.
[01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:51.840]   That sucks to be precious.
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:54.360]   DCJ in our chat room is saying money well.
[01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:55.960]   Did you try money well?
[01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:58.200]   Mm, I didn't try money well.
[01:06:58.200 --> 01:06:59.760]   Twit all mean for the win.
[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:00.760]   Twit army for the win.
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:03.080]   It does look pretty good.
[01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:05.080]   Time is different is simply better direct connect banking.
[01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:06.160]   So that's what it's got to have for me.
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:07.720]   I don't want to enter in any data.
[01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:10.000]   I want to download all the data.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.160]   Envelope budgeting transaction and cash flow.
[01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:14.200]   And this looks good.
[01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:16.840]   Free trial.
[01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:17.840]   That looks pretty good.
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:19.480]   Money well.
[01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:21.280]   We'll come back and tell us what you think.
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:23.960]   Yeah, it might be my pick of the week next time.
[01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:25.360]   Wouldn't that be funny?
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:28.920]   Andy Naco, it's time for your pick of the week, sir.
[01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:34.680]   Line is a freebie from Correlia Software, the guys who make Sandbox.
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:40.280]   They make a really cool media browser called the Correlia iMedia browser.
[01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:44.280]   If you're familiar with the media browser panel that you find in so many of the different
[01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:49.560]   iApps where you have this cool little just to paint thing that has a list of your photos,
[01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:55.280]   audio movies and web links with a little paint underneath it that lets you give thumbnails
[01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:57.960]   and a little browser up at the top there.
[01:07:57.960 --> 01:07:59.880]   That's exactly what this application is.
[01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:00.880]   Nothing more.
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:02.400]   You can have it floating above all other apps.
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:04.480]   You can have it behave like a regular other app.
[01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:08.880]   The big win of this though is that so many times when I'm doing a project, like when
[01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:14.240]   I was finishing my book project a couple of weeks ago, I just need to drag this one photo
[01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:16.120]   from here into there.
[01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:19.160]   I want to email something to somebody or I want to drag something into a document or
[01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:23.000]   I want to drag something into a file uploader so it has to go there.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.480]   As always the same thing.
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:30.440]   That's okay, tab tab over to the finder, navigate to where that image is and guess as to which
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:31.440]   one it is.
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:32.440]   Great, that's it.
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:36.200]   Tab tab back to the original application and sort of tab tab back to get both windows
[01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:40.120]   visible at the same time so I could drag it from the source of the destination with
[01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:41.120]   iMedia browser.
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:45.800]   It will be this floating window that always gives you direct teleportation access to
[01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:49.960]   all the content in your pictures folder, your iPhoto library, your appter library or any
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:52.920]   other folder that has media inside it.
[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:58.840]   So when I want to drag this image of this weird guy at the MIT flea market trying to sell
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:04.080]   what, when our black velvet paintings of unicorns sleeping over rainbows, I don't, it's
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:05.280]   going to be floating over everything else.
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:09.920]   I can simply take it, drag it from the source and drag it into the email app or drag it
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:13.120]   into my new web post or whatever.
[01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:19.120]   It's the epitome of one of a really good unitasker app where it does one thing but it adds a
[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:21.080]   basic feature to every single app.
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:25.880]   So it's as though your mail client and your word processor and every single other application
[01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:31.480]   you have on the Mac suddenly has that same really slick media browser and media importer
[01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:34.080]   that you'll find in iPhoto or any other iLife app.
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:36.720]   I've been using it non-stop since I found it a few weeks ago.
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:38.200]   Yeah, it's great and it downloads fast.
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:40.640]   I already downloaded it and installed it while you were talking.
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:43.080]   And it's free, free, free, free, free, free, free.
[01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:50.600]   Well I was torn between two items, one fairly expensive which I'll talk about another time.
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:55.000]   And one absolutely free and I was going to wait and see if any of you did the free one.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.560]   And since you didn't, I will mention, well I'll do the free one.
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:03.520]   I don't know, I'm just saying that sometimes when you do your picks, I feel a little bit
[01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:08.080]   like it's one of those game shows and you're the host, we're the celebrity panelist, and
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:11.040]   because nobody mentioned those.
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.040]   Exactly.
[01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:14.760]   Another $50 goes into the jumbo jackpot.
[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:16.920]   The word was "perfity."
[01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:24.480]   Oh, I was going to say "perfity, I don't know why I said, 'Oh, Brent, you got us again.'"
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:27.280]   Well this is one that I think really deserves mention.
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:31.280]   We've talked about Mac Heist before, but this is a free Mac Heist.
[01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:33.800]   They call it their nano bundle.
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:39.040]   And six Mac apps that would normally cost a total of $154 free, including one you've
[01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:45.560]   picked before, shove box Andy, free, right room, both, by the way, shove box is $25, right
[01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:53.240]   at room $25 free, Twitterific, $15 free, tiny grab, $14 free, hordes of orcs, which I don't
[01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:56.920]   know, but sounds good to me, $25 free.
[01:10:56.920 --> 01:11:00.880]   And one of the reasons, I have a little selfish reason for mentioning this.
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:03.400]   Right now, 265,000 people have downloaded it.
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:07.640]   There are two days left, I think it was only a three day deal.
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:12.840]   If they get to 500,000 down loaders, they'll unlock Mariner right, which is an excellent
[01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:15.520]   word processor with $50.
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:17.400]   Not doing that for a nano mo.
[01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:19.720]   Do I say that right, nano mo?
[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:23.080]   No, the right month where you're right on.
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:24.840]   Five apps named mo?
[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:25.840]   No, no.
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:27.960]   You know, it's writer's month.
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:29.400]   National novel writing mode.
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:31.400]   National nano mo.
[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:33.280]   So it's nano, nano, nano, I believe.
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:34.280]   Nano Ymo.
[01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:35.280]   There you go.
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:38.640]   So this is their nano Ymo bundle, their nano bundle.
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:41.400]   So you know, I don't know why they're doing this for free.
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:46.040]   I don't know why the developers are doing it for free, but what a nice deal for anybody
[01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:48.960]   who wants to get some great Mac apps for free.
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:51.760]   There's five apps now and it could be as many as six apps.
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:12:00.600]   If more of you would just run to Mac heist.com and get those six Mac apps.
[01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:04.520]   And I'll save my expensive pick for another day.
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:05.880]   Don McAllister, thank you for being here.
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:10.880]   I'm sorry we had difficulty with the connection, but next time.
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:13.640]   It's of course the host of screencasts online.
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:16.320]   You must go and take a look.
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:20.800]   Many free screencasts and then there's a premium account that gets you even more.
[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:22.720]   Can I just mention as well?
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:25.800]   Just for anyone who's been sitting on the fence, there's going to be some big changes
[01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:26.800]   in January.
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:27.800]   I'm sort of changing models.
[01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:30.200]   So I'm going to be doing more members shows next year.
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:33.600]   I also want the price up, but for November, they're a special offer.
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:36.080]   Anyone who's sitting on the fence and they want to come across and become members.
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:38.200]   There's a 50% discount off the usual.
[01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:46.320]   I said, if you go to screencast.com/extra, on the web page, there's a members info.
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:49.560]   You just go across to there, you get the code, etc.
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:54.320]   So just for November, though, that's 50% off the usual price.
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:56.520]   That is really great.
[01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:57.520]   Wow.
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:12:58.520]   Well, thank you.
[01:12:58.520 --> 01:12:59.520]   Very popular.
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:03.280]   Yeah, 50% off right now and that's for a year member or that's a six month member.
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:05.280]   That's for six months.
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:09.840]   So that brings it down to just over 28, but that's not just the six months.
[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:15.760]   That's the next six months worth of shows, but also 220 other tests that are in the archive
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:16.760]   as well.
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:20.120]   So you get all my content, a special one-off price for this.
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:24.520]   I really want to support Don in doing this because Don is really a pioneer in the idea
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:29.120]   of being able to do this full time, making a living, doing it without advertising.
[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:30.560]   And I think it's such a great model.
[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:32.640]   And I just, I really want to support you in doing this.
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:33.640]   So that's great, Don.
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:34.640]   Yeah.
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:39.640]   So 30% off, go to screencastsonline.com/extra.
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:42.000]   And you can find out all about that.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.320]   Thank you Don so much for being here.
[01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:44.320]   I really appreciate it.
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:45.320]   Also the invitation.
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:46.320]   Thanks.
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:47.320]   Yes.
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:52.120]   Also, thanks to our other Brit, Mr. Will Harris there in Oxford.
[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:53.120]   Yes.
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:54.960]   Great to have you on again.
[01:13:54.960 --> 01:14:00.640]   Don't forget channelflip.com is Will's IPTV channel online.
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:03.160]   Great content, broad variety, wonderful stuff.
[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:05.160]   All of the pleasure.
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:06.160]   Channelflip.com.
[01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:07.160]   Thank you, Will.
[01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:13.000]   Andy Inaco is the man at the Celestial Waste of Bandwidth, C-W-O-B.com.
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.880]   And of course, a reviewer for the Tech Writer for the Chicago Sun Times.
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:20.400]   Read his Droid review from this week.
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:21.400]   Very.
[01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:22.400]   That was a big deal.
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:26.600]   I went to 5,000 words and then I decided I could either edit this down.
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:28.840]   That would steal for my readers.
[01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:31.200]   And also, I'm too tired to edit right now.
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:33.120]   I did want to say one thing.
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:38.000]   Your mention of the Mac Heist discount reminded me of something that was in my mailbox that
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.800]   I wanted to point out.
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:45.080]   Not in response, but basically as to make it sort of a love fest for discounted software.
[01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:50.560]   Daniel Jaikod, the guy who, CEO of Red Sweater Software, they're the guys who make Mars
[01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:51.560]   out of it.
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:52.560]   I love Daniel.
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:53.560]   Yeah.
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:59.120]   So they decided to get together and do, get a site together called onefingerdiscount.com
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:03.960]   where 100 different developers are now having a coupon code on all of their sites.
[01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:08.560]   So if you type in one finger discount, you get 20% off the registration fees for all
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:09.560]   this commercial software.
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:13.880]   If you go to onefingerdiscount.com, you will see, I mean, just keep scrolling and scrolling
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:16.840]   and scrolling and scrolling.
[01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:19.120]   All kinds of really cool software that you can get at a discount.
[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:20.120]   It's not free.
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:21.120]   It's not part of it.
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:22.880]   It's not in any way part of the Mac Heist thing.
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:27.880]   But it looks like a good opportunity if there are these shareware apps that you were considering,
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:29.640]   like one password.
[01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:30.640]   God.
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:31.640]   Today.
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:33.680]   I mean, it's all of this stuff is stuff that much of this stuff is stuff.
[01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:34.680]   Full of stuff.
[01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:35.680]   Full of stuff.
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:36.680]   Right.
[01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:37.680]   We've recommended it.
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:38.680]   I mean, this is great stuff.
[01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:40.600]   And so I don't know how long these codes are going to be good, but definitely to go to
[01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:42.440]   onefingerdiscount.com.
[01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:43.440]   Take a look at that list.
[01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:47.240]   There's at least 100 different, not 100 different pieces of software, 100 different companies
[01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:48.240]   taking part in this.
[01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:49.240]   Text expander.
[01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:50.240]   Wow.
[01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:53.720]   So it looks like a good, a good opportunity to get a discount on some Google itself.
[01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:55.400]   Oh, I'm going to have to go through this list.
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:56.760]   This is a long list.
[01:15:56.760 --> 01:16:01.320]   All the flying meat stuff, including acorn and voodoo pad, which we've mentioned.
[01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:04.600]   Mac gourmet cash calculator.
[01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:06.160]   Maybe that be something for you.
[01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:12.120]   Will Harris Huda is doing their Huda Geo, which is really the best, one of the best
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:13.280]   geo tagging solutions.
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:14.280]   This is great.
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:15.280]   Carilla Sandvox.
[01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:17.200]   You mentioned the iMedia browser.
[01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:18.440]   All right.
[01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:19.840]   That's at onefingerdiscount.com.
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:20.840]   Good.
[01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:22.720]   I'm glad we can give them another plug.
[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:23.720]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:25.640]   We really appreciate you joining us.
[01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:26.880]   And we'll catch you next week.
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:28.120]   Now get back to work.
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:29.880]   Right time is over.
[01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:45.720]   [MUSIC]
